Environmental groups condemn new laws threatening soybean restrictions in Brazil's Amazon	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Dozens of environmental nonprofits issued a manifesto Thursday condemning new laws in Brazilian states that threaten to dismantle the Amazon soy moratorium — a landmark voluntary agreement banning trade in soybeans from recently deforested areas. The 18-year-old moratorium stipulates that traders and oil producers refrain from buying soybeans grown on land cleared after 2008. The deal gathered strange bedfellows, ranging from environmental groups Greenpeace and WWF to U.S. commodity giants Cargill, Bunge and ADM. However, new laws recently enacted in the Amazon states of Mato Grosso, Brazil’s largest soybean producer, and neighboring Rondonia have cut tax incentives for processing and trade companies that adhere to the agreement. Two other states and Brazil´s Congress are weighing similar legislation. 'This means penalizing companies committed to ending deforestation, promoting the continued expansion of agribusiness in Amazon forest areas, creating subsidies for deforestation and discriminating against the granting of tax incentives based on companies’ environmental commitment,' Thursday's declaration stated. 'Therefore, those who are more ambitious in environmental protection lose the incentive,' said the manifesto whose 67 signers include Greenpeace, WWF and Climate Observatory, a network of 119 organizations watching federal climate policy in Brazil. The document argues soybean production grew exponentially in the Amazon under the moratorium as it expanded into pasture land. Its area jumped from 1.6 million hectares (4 million acres) in 2007 to 7.28 million hectares (18 million acres) in 2022, according to a moratorium report. The manifesto also calls for the companies that operate in Mato Grosso and Rondonia to maintain their commitment to the agreement even though it means losing millions of dollars in tax incentives — a tough decision for small and middle-sized companies. Researchers have found the moratorium is helping to preserve the Amazon forest. A 2020 study in the journal Nature Food found that the agreement, in combination with public policies, contributed to the steepest reduction of deforestation recorded in Brazil, between 2003 and 2016 In a written response, the government of Mato Grosso said it enacted the law because the moratorium is harsher than Brazil´s legislation, which already has 'the world’s strictest environmental regulations.' It also stated that most of the state is covered by original rainforest trees and plants. 'We challenge these nonprofits to name any state, in any country, that is a major food producer and preserves 60% of its territory,' the statement said. —- The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Syria faces crisis and Gaza heads toward famine, World Food Program official says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The deputy executive director of the U.N. World Food Program has been on whirlwind visits to hotspots in the Middle East and Sudan to assess dire humanitarian situations and escalating demands for food from millions of people trapped or fleeing conflicts. But Carl Skau said in an interview with The Associated Press this week that the Rome-based agency has been forced to make major cuts to the numbers of people it can help because of a lack of funding. WFP is working to diversify its funding, including targeting the private sector, but Skau said, 'it’s going to be a tough time ahead, no doubt, with increasing gaps.' 'Needs continue to rise, and the funding does not even remain stable at the levels we have currently,' he said. ‘A triple crisis’ in Syria Syria is facing the fallout from a 13-year civil war, the surge in arrivals from the recent Israel-Hezbollah war in neighboring Lebanon, and rebels unexpectedly ousting longtime leader Bashar Assad, Skau said. Even before Lebanon and the end of the Assad family’s more than 50-year rule, he said 3 million people were acutely food insecure and very hungry. But the agency was only providing food aid to 2 million because of funding cuts. Now, Skau said, 'it’s a triple crisis, and the needs are going to be massive.' While the situation in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, is 'quite calm and orderly,' he said there is still uncertainty in the capital, Damascus, where markets are disrupted, currency values have dropped, food prices are going up and transport isn’t working. This means a bigger humanitarian response in the short term. In the next phase, the U.N. will be focusing on Syria’s recovery and ultimately its reconstruction, Skau said. Gaza is heading toward famine Skau says the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza is dire but he’s equally worried about southern Gaza, 'if not even more,' because of the million or so people on the beach north of Khan Younis as winter approaches. In northern areas, where the U.N. estimates there are still 65,000 Palestinians and no aid has arrived for more than two months, Skau said Israeli military operations, lawlessness and taking of food aid have prevented access to the needy. He said some humanitarian convoys have gotten through to the broader northern area including Gaza City, where the U.N. estimates some 300,000 people are located. In the south, Skau said, WFP assisted around 1.2 million people in June, July, August and into September. In October and November, only one-third of that number — 400,000 Palestinians — got aid. At the same time, the entry of essential commercial goods was very little compared with the summer months, Skau said. He blamed the limited number of entry points and the inability to move food to WFP warehouses as well as the 'total breakdown of civil and public order.' Skau said international famine experts reported three weeks ago that if nothing changed there would be famine in Gaza, 'and I think that’s where we’re heading.' Sudan is the world’s largest humanitarian crisis The needs are overwhelming: 25 million people in war-torn Sudan are acutely food insecure, with famine declared in the huge Zam Zam camp for the displaced in western Darfur. Skau cited progress over the past month in getting clearances to deliver aid across conflict lines and the border from Chad. And with roads drying up at the end of the rainy season, WFP is able to deliver 'much more food.' One convoy reached Zam Zam camp and two others were on the way but have been held up because of fighting in the past 10 days in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, Skau said. It is the only capital in Darfur still held by Sudanese forces. The others are held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including western Darfur. WFP reached some 2.6 million people this month, Skau said, stressing that the international community should have done more to address the Sudan crisis 'and needs to do more going forward.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-gaza-world-food-program-06f429a71dee5f11779d8cce94e810fb	2024-12-12T13:14:37-08:00	
China's Xi is likely to decline Trump's inauguration invitation, seeing it as too risky to attend	WASHINGTON (AP) — Chinese leader Xi Jinping would likely see President-elect Donald Trump’s invitation to attend his inauguration as too risky to accept, and the gesture from Trump may have little bearing on the increasingly competitive ties between the two nations as the White House changes hands, experts say. Trump’s incoming press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed on Thursday that Trump extended an invitation to the Jan. 20 ceremony. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said it had no information to provide. But experts don't see Xi coming to Washington next month. Why wouldn't Xi attend? 'Can you imagine Xi Jinping sitting outdoors in Washington, D.C., in January at the feet of the podium, surrounded by hawkish members of Congress, gazing up at Donald Trump as he delivers his inaugural address?' said Danny Russel, who previously served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Russel, now vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Xi would not allow himself to 'be reduced to the status of a mere guest celebrating the triumph of a foreign leader — the U.S. president, no less.' Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank, said Beijing will play it safe when there's no protocol or precedent for a Chinese leader to attend the inauguration of a U.S. president. 'I don't think the Chinese will take the risk,' Sun said. There could be risks in the guest list, for example, Sun said, noting that Taiwan's top diplomat in the U.S. attended the swearing-in of President Joe Biden in 2021. Beijing considers Taiwan to be Chinese territory and has repeatedly warned the U.S. that it is a red line not to be crossed. Should Trump slap tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods upon taking office as he's threatened, Xi would look like a fool if he had chosen to attend, and that's unacceptable to Beijing, Sun said. Rather, Chinese officials are known for their obsession with the dignity and security of their leader when traveling abroad, said Russel, who has negotiated high-level summits with the Chinese. 'They have always demanded that any leader trip to Washington be treated as a full ‘state visit’ with all the bells and whistles,' Russel said. What's ahead for U.S.-China relations? But it should be expected that planning is underway for Trump and Xi to meet in person soon, Russel said. Trump prefers in-person meetings with foreign leaders, especially key adversaries, and Beijing might believe it can get a better deal by dealing directly with Trump, Russel said. Trump's return to the White House is expected to further intensify the U.S.-China rivalry. He has picked several China hawks for his Cabinet, including Sen. Marco Rubio as the secretary of state and Rep. Mike Waltz as the national security adviser. Beijing has adopted a 'wait-and-see' approach but says it is prepared to hit back should Washington raise tariffs on Chinese goods or make other unfriendly moves. Sun of the Stimson Center cautions that Trump's invitation does not exclude hostile policies toward China. Trump visited China in 2017 and 'played nice,' but the following year he launched the trade war, she said. 'We've seen this before,' Sun said. 'For Trump, there's no contradiction between carrot and stick. For China, that's a contradiction. It will add to China's desire to play safe, not to be played by Trump, whether it is a friendly or a hostile message.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-xi-china-inauguration-invitation-a0fbde24ca2ccafa9a953813955d532f	2024-12-12T12:27:12-08:00	
Protesters hold a noisy demonstration against Serbia's populist leadership	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Hundreds of protesters led by university students on Thursday held a noisy rally outside Serbia's state television headquarters despite the country's president pledging to fulfil all their demands as he faced one of the most challenging threats to his populist rule. The demonstration is part of wider protests that erupted after the fall of a concrete canopy in the northern city of Novi Sad last month, killing 15 people. Blowing whistles, booing and jeering, the protesters said they are angry the state RTS television is carrying President Aleksandar Vucic's accusations that the students were paid from the West and elsewhere to hold protests to overthrow his government. The protesters brought sacks allegedly holding bundles of money in front of the downtown RTS station in the country's capital, Belgrade. The station has been accused of spreading the nationalist pro-government narrative for years. Classes at more than 40 university faculties throughout Serbia have been suspended for days. Many in Serbia blame the deadly collapse on rampant corruption in the country that led to sloppy renovation work on the station building in Novi Sad — part of a wider deal with Chinese state companies involved in a number of infrastructure projects in the Balkan country. The canopy collapse has became a flashpoint for broader dissatisfaction with the president's growingly autocratic rule, reflecting public demands for democratic changes. Almost daily protests have been held since Nov. 1 in Novi Sad, Belgrade and other cities, which sometimes turned violent. Vucic announced at a news conference on Wednesday evening that documentation regarding the renovation of the Novi Sad railway building would be made public, as students have requested. Prosecutors have launched an investigation and detained 13 people. But a government minister has been released, fueling widespread speculation over the probe as ruling populists also control both police and the judiciary. As Vucic spoke on Wednesday, hundreds of students also blew whistles and horns outside the presidency building, which could be heard in the live coverage of the address. The students on Thursday said they also want the thugs who attacked peaceful protesters arrested. 'We came to give back the money,' one of the students told the crowd as they symbolically left improvised money bags outside the television building. 'You can hand them (bags) to the president and tell him that we want a public apology.'	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-protest-roof-collapse-students-d5fefbb6efdefc5ecc76ce4fdb34dfbb	2024-12-12T11:38:07-08:00	
Israeli strike in Gaza kills 25 people as US makes new push for a ceasefire	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli airstrike hit the central Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing at least 25 Palestinians and wounding dozens more, Palestinian medics said, as U.S. President Joe Biden’s two top national security officials were in the region making a renewed push for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire. The strike on a multistory residential building in the Nuseirat refugee camp was just the latest in a series of Israeli attacks throughout Gaza that killed at least 54 Palestinians since late Wednesday night. Palestinian officials at two of Gaza's remaining medical centers, Al-Awda Hospital in the north and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the center, reported together receiving 25 bodies from the Nuseirat strike — which also wounded 40 people, most of them children. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the deadly strike. Israel is trying to eliminate Hamas, which led the attack on southern Israel in October 2023 that sparked the war in Gaza. The Israeli military says Hamas militants hide among Gaza’s civilian population. The U.N. General Assembly's member nations approved a new resolution this week demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, although they do reflect world opinion — the vote Wednesday was 158-9, with 13 abstentions. Israel strikes all across Gaza Photos from the scene in Nuseirat sent to journalists showed a completely collapsed building with people walking through its mangled and charred remains, smoke rising from piles of belongings strewn over the rubble. Palestinian rescuers were searching for more bodies trapped beneath the rubble. The strikes Thursday evening came as Palestinian medics were still surveying the morning’s deadly toll of fierce Israeli attacks, including on Nuseirat camp. Palestinian medical officials had reported at least 28 people killed earlier in the day, including seven children and a woman. One of the strikes flatted a house in Nuseirat, according to Al-Aqsa Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the bodies were taken. Two other strikes killed 15 men who were part of local aid coordination committees set up by displaced Palestinians and the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, according to health officials at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. Eight of the men were killed in an attack near the southern border town of Rafah and the remaining seven were killed by a strike in Khan Younis. The committees aim to establish secure aid convoys, which often face challenges such as looting, hoarding and profiteering in their efforts to deliver humanitarian supplies to Palestinians facing the risk of famine. Israel says it allows enough aid to enter and blames U.N. agencies for not distributing it. The U.N. says Israeli restrictions, and the breakdown of law and order after Israel repeatedly targeted the Hamas-run police force, make it extremely difficult to operate in the territory. In Gaza's isolated and devastated north, Awda Hospital said an orthopedic doctor, Saeed Jouda, was shot in the head and killed Thursday morning. The Health Ministry said the doctor was killed by an armed quadcopter drone as he was traveling from Kamal Adwan Hospital to treat patients at Awda Hospital. The two medical facilities are in northern towns where Israel has waged a blistering offensive against Hamas militants since early October, allowing in almost no humanitarian aid and ordering tens of thousands to flee to nearby Gaza City. Experts have warned that the north may be experiencing famine. Biden administration makes final push for a Gaza ceasefire The latest bombardment came as Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, was holding official meetings in Israel as signs emerge that long-stalled negotiations between Israel and Hamas could regain momentum. On Thursday, Sullivan revived hopes for a deal, telling reporters in Jerusalem that Israel’s ceasefire in Lebanon has helped clear the way for another deal to end the war in Gaza. Sullivan plans to travel next to Qatar and Egypt, key mediators in the ceasefire talks, as the Biden administration makes a final push on negotiations before Donald Trump is inaugurated. Sullivan said 'Hamas’ posture at the negotiating table did adapt' after Israel decimated the leadership of its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon and reached a ceasefire there. 'We believe it puts us in a position to close this negotiation,' he said. Last month, the U.S. vetoes a Security Council resolution demanding an immediate Gaza ceasefire, objecting that the resolution did not link the truce to an immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas. The council’s 14 other members supported the resolution. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,800 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in the war in Gaza. The International Criminal Court found there were reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu and his former defense minister bear responsibility for the war crime of starvation and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. ___ Associated Press writers Samy Magdy in Cairo and Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report. ____ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-12-12-2024-a39e98286d8d270b6e81608a3d17fa4a	2024-12-12T11:18:17-08:00	
North Korean nationals indicted in scheme using IT workers to funnel money for weapons programs	ST. LOUIS (AP) — Fourteen North Korean nationals have been indicted in a scheme using information technology workers with false identities to contract with U.S. companies — workers who then funneled their wages to North Korea for development of ballistic missiles and other weapons, the head of the FBI office in St. Louis said Thursday. The scheme involving thousands of IT workers generated more than $88 million for the North Korean government, Ashley T. Johnson, special agent in charge of the St. Louis FBI office, said at a news conference. In addition to their wages, the workers stole sensitive information from companies or threatened to leak information in exchange for extortion payments, Johnson said. Victims included defrauded companies and people whose identities were stolen from across the U.S., including Missouri, Johnson said. The indictments were filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in St. Louis. All 14 people face wire fraud, money laundering, identity theft and other charges. Most of those accused are believed to be in North Korea. Johnson acknowledged that bringing them to justice will be difficult. To help, the U.S. Department of State is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to any of the suspects. Federal authorities said the scheme worked like this: North Korea dispatched thousands of IT workers to get hired and work remotely or as freelancers for U.S. companies. The IT workers involved in the scheme sometimes used stolen identities. In other instances, they paid Americans to use their home Wi-Fi connections, or to pose in on-camera job interviews as the IT workers. Johnson said the FBI is going after those 'domestic enablers,' too. 'This is just the tip of the iceberg,' Johnson said. 'If your company has hired fully remote IT workers, more likely than not, you have hired or at least interviewed a North Korean national working on behalf of the North Korean government,' Johnson said. The Justice Department in recent years has sought to expose and disrupt a broad variety of criminal schemes aimed at bolstering the North Korean regime, including its nuclear weapons program. In 2021, the Justice Department charged three North Korean computer programmers and members of the government’s military intelligence agency in a broad range of global hacks that officials say were carried out at the behest of the regime. Law enforcement officials said at the time that the prosecution highlighted the profit-driven motive behind North Korea’s criminal hacking, a contrast from other adversarial nations like Russia, China and Iran that are generally more interested in espionage, intellectual property theft or even disrupting democracy. In May 2022, the State Department, Department of the Treasury, and the FBI issued an advisory warning of attempts by North Koreans 'to obtain employment while posing as non-North Korean nationals.' The advisory noted that in recent years, the regime of Kim Jong Un 'has placed increased focus on education and training' in IT-related subjects. In October 2023, the FBI in St. Louis announced the seizure of $1.5 million and 17 domain names as part of the investigation. The indictments announced Tuesday were the first stemming from the investigation. Johnson urged companies to thoroughly vet IT workers hired to work remotely. 'One of the ways to help minimize your risk is to insist current and future IT workers appear on camera as often as possible if they are fully remote,' she said. Officials didn’t name the companies that unknowingly hired North Korean workers.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-it-workers-indictments-7beb2f611489da09fe36ee14736b28b9	2024-12-12T11:09:58-08:00	
Chanel appoints designer Matthieu Blazy as new artistic director	PARIS (AP) — One of the most prestigious roles in global fashion has just been filled, as Chanel appointed Franco-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy as its new artistic director, the fashion house announced Thursday. The 40-year-old will oversee all collections for the world's second biggest luxury brand starting in 2025, replacing Virginie Viard, who parted ways with the house earlier this year. Blazy arrives with a reputation for innovation and craftsmanship, honed through stints at Raf Simons, Maison Margiela and Céline under Phoebe Philo. Most recently, he was creative director at Bottega Veneta. Chanel President Bruno Pavlovsky praised his 'audacious' and 'powerful' approach, adding that Blazy would 'play with the codes and heritage of the House' to take it in 'exciting new directions.' 'I am thrilled and honored,' said Blazy. Critics have noted that Blazy’s relatively young age suggests Chanel may be positioning him for a long tenure, akin to the 36 years Karl Lagerfeld spent at the helm. His appointment marks only the fourth designer in Chanel’s over 100-year history to lead the house, following Lagerfeld, Viard, and founder Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel. Viard, who succeeded Lagerfeld after his death in 2019, left earlier this year after more than three decades with the brand — an abrupt departure, announced in the middle of the night just weeks before the couture show. For a house known for meticulous image execution, the announcement felt unusually unpolished. Later, it was revealed that Viard would not oversee her final couture presentation, with her team stepping in to handle the collection. During her tenure, Viard achieved record sales for Chanel, reaching $19.7 billion last year. But her time was not without controversy. Critics often cited her collections as lacking the theatrical flair of Lagerfeld’s era, and backlash to a poorly received mid-season show in Marseille added pressure. Her appointment was initially viewed as temporary. Critics say that Blazy’s arrival signals a new chapter for Chanel, blending heritage with modernity as the house looks to the future. Chanel’s Global Executive Chairman Alain Wertheimer and CEO Leena Nair described Blazy as 'one of the most gifted designers of his generation.'	https://apnews.com/article/chanel-designer-blazy-lagerfeld-382cdb8761153f7c74981535e36c0f50	2024-12-12T10:54:45-08:00	
Greece launches emergency inquiry into the alleged assault of an Egyptian minor at a migrant camp	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — A prosecutor from Greece’s Supreme Court on Thursday launched an emergency inquiry into the alleged beating and sexual assault of a 16-year-old Egyptian boy at a migrant camp outside Athens. Four other Egyptians housed at the facility aged 16, 17, 18 and 21 have been arrested in connection with the alleged assault at the state-run refugee facility in Malakasa, west of the Greek capital, police said. The four male suspects were detained on charges of sexual assault and causing grievous bodily harm, according to authorities. Greek Migration Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos, described the incident as 'deeply abhorrent,' while his deputy, Sofia Voultepsi, announced an investigation into security procedures at the camp’s area for unaccompanied minors. Voultepsi said the number of unaccompanied minors from Egypt in Greece was rising due to the activity of criminal gangs active in neighboring Libya. Under Greek regulations, unaccompanied minors who arrive in the country illegally are not subject to deportation. 'Out of the total of 2,588 unaccompanied minors currently (registered) in the country, 1,341 — so more than half — are Egyptian,' Voultepsi told private Skai television. 'These children are taken from impoverished villages in Egypt,' she said. 'Criminals take them to Tobruk in Libya. According to testimonies we have, they are often beaten and mistreated in camps there and with the intention of involving them in criminal activity.'	https://apnews.com/article/greece-migrants-migration-assault-egypt-libya-43619869409ed8dd911550398721d566	2024-12-12T08:33:46-08:00	
Wander Franco's sex abuse trial has been postponed 5 months	PUERTO PLATA, Dominican Republic (AP) — The trial against Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco, who has been charged with sexually abusing a minor, sexual and commercial exploitation against a minor, and human trafficking, was postponed on Thursday and scheduled to resume June 2, 2025. Dominican judge Yacaira Veras postponed the hearing at the request of prosecutors because of the absence of several key witnesses in the case. Franco’s lawyers asked the court to reconsider the postponement, arguing Franco must report to spring training in mid-February. The judge replied that Franco is obligated to continue with the trial schedule, continue his conditional release from detainment and not leave the country. Documents that prosecutors presented to the judge in July and were viewed by The Associated Press alleged that Franco, through his mother Yudelka Aybar, transferred 1 million pesos (about $17,000) to the mother of the minor on Jan. 5, 2023, to consent to the abuse. The mother of the minor has been charged with money laundering and is under house arrest. Prosecutors say the minor’s mother went from being a bank employee to leading an ostentatious life and acquiring assets using the funds she received from Franco. During raids on the house of the minor’s mother, prosecutors say they found $68,500 and $35,000 that they allege was delivered by Franco. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/wander-franco-trial-mlb-rays-2cba7436c3dee91ecebea60773942abf	2024-12-12T07:50:55-08:00	
Paraguay reopens its embassy in Jerusalem, handing Israel a rare diplomatic victory	JERUSALEM (AP) — The small South American nation of Paraguay reopened its embassy in Jerusalem on Thursday, becoming the latest of just a small handful of countries to recognize the bitterly contested city as Israel’s capital. The move marks a welcome diplomatic victory for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has watched Israel’s international isolation deepen as the devastating war in Gaza drags on. Paraguay first relocated its embassy to Jerusalem in 2018 under the pro-Israel government of then-President Horacio Cartes but reversed its decision months later when a new administration came to power. The decision of President Santiago Peña, a protégé of Cartes who has followed in his mentor's footsteps, to reopen the Jerusalem embassy makes Paraguay the first country to make the move since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack last year triggered the war. The fate of Jerusalem is one of the most intractable disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It’s also a controversial move. Israel views the entire city as its unified capital, while the Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Israel annexed east Jerusalem, home to the Old City, with holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in 1967 in a move that was not recognized by the international community. Most countries run their embassies out of Tel Aviv. Paraguay now joins the United States, Honduras, Guatemala, Kosovo and Papua New Guinea as countries that have stationed their embassy in Jerusalem. Spirits were high at the ceremony marking the embassy’s inauguration Thursday, with Netanyahu and Israel’s new Foreign Minister, Gideon Saar, lavishing praise on President Peña. 'My good friend Santiago,' said Netanyahu, addressing Peña. 'We’re a small nation. You’re a small nation. We suffered horrible things but we overcame the odds of history…we can win and we are winning.' 'Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. It will always be the capital of Israel,' Netanyahu said. 'That will never change.' The ceremony came as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has brought a wave of condemnation on Israel, undermining its international standing. The world’s top war-crimes court issued arrest warrants last month for Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza. The Israeli offensive has so far killed over 44,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry which does not say how many are combatants. The warrants turn Netanyahu and Gallant into internationally wanted suspects, putting them at risk of arrest when they travel abroad. Nevertheless, Peña invited Netanyahu to visit Paraguay. Netanyahu hung a Jewish mezuzah, a small scroll containing verses from the Torah, on the doorway of the new Paraguayan embassy. Israel's top diplomat, Saar, said Israel and Paraguay shared a 'friendship based not only on interests but also values and principles.' He said he would soon visit Asunción, Paraguay's capital, with a delegation from the Israeli private sector. He and Paraguayan Foreign Minister Rubén Ramírez Lezcano signed a series of bilateral agreements at the ceremony. Peña thanked Netanyahu and said he looked forward to future collaboration with Israel. 'This is very important for you. We recognize that this is a very strong statement,' Peña said. 'Israel is going to win, and the countries (that) are standing next to Israel, we are going to win.' Despite a tiny Jewish community, far smaller than neighbors Argentina and Brazil, landlocked Paraguay has become one of Israel’s closest allies in Latin America. The other countries in the region to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Guatemala and Honduras, have similarly strong evangelical churches. Evangelicals, many of whom see Israel’s existence connected to biblical prophecy, are among the Israeli government's most hawkish supporters. In the U.S., conservative evangelicals have long inspired the Republican Party’s pro-Israel advocacy. Paraguay's conservative leadership has sought to curry favor with former and future U.S. President Donald Trump by strengthening its alliance with Israel as well as Taiwan — two causes célèbres of Republicans. Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ramírez Lezcano was among the first foreign dignitaries to meet with Trump following his November election victory. Earlier this year, Peña hosted Sen. Marco Rubio — Trump’s pick to become Secretary of State — in what marked the first visit by a U.S. senator to the landlocked country in four decades. The ascension of Peña to the presidency in 2023 helped revive Paraguay's strong ties with Israel years after his predecessor, Mario Abdo Benitez, shuttered Paraguay's Jerusalem embassy and prompted Israel to retaliate by temporarily closing its own in Asunción. Under former President Cartes, a powerful cigarette tycoon sanctioned by the Biden administration for corruption, Paraguay immediately followed Trump's move to relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and break with decades of policy that the city's status should be decided in peace talks. ___ Associated Press writers Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Josh Goodman in Miami contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-paraguay-embassy-jerusalem-capital-pena-netanyahu-ec4249a657d841a1e4ccd3e3b6edd574	2024-12-12T07:39:39-08:00	
Ontario to restrict electricity exports to US and bar American-made alcohol if Trump tariffs applied	TORONTO (AP) — Canada’s most populous province may bar American-made alcohol in addition to restricting electricity exports to Michigan, New York State and Minnesota if President-elect Donald Trump imposes sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products, a senior official said Thursday. The official in Ontario Premier Doug Ford's government said it is contemplating restricting Ontario's liquor control board — the largest alcohol purchaser in the world and the main retailer in the province — from buying American-made alcohol. Ontario is also considering restricting exports of critical minerals required for electric vehicle batteries and preventing U.S.-based companies from the government's procurement process, the official said, speaking on condition on anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the potential measures. Ford confirmed on Wednesday evening that Ontario is contemplating restricting electricity exports to Michigan, New York State and Minnesota. He reiterated that on Thursday and said it would make electricity unaffordable for Americans. 'It’s a last resort,' Ford said. 'I don’t think President-elect Trump wants that to happen. We're sending a message to the U.S. If you come and attack Ontario, you attack livelihoods of people in Ontario and Canadians, we are going to use every tool in our tool box to defend Ontarians and Canadians. Let's hope it never comes to that.' Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the United States from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. Ontario powered 1.5 million homes in the U.S. in 2023 and is a major exporter of electricity to Michigan, Minnesota and New York. 'That's okay if he that does that. That's fine,' Trump told CNBC when asked about Ford's remarks on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 'The United States is subsidizing Canada and we shouldn't have to do that,' Trump added. 'And we have a great relationship. I have so many friends in Canada but we shouldn't have to subsidize a country. We're subsidizing more than a $100 billion dollars a year. We shouldn't have to be doing that.' The CNBC reporter said off camera Trump told him they hope they can work something out with Canada. Canada supplies more oil to the U.S. than any other country. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. 'If you put a 25% tariff on oil from Alberta that increases every gallon of gasoline by one dollar,' said Ford, who is chairman of a council of premiers for Canada’s 10 provinces and three territories. Canada sold $170 billion worth of energy products last year to the U.S. It also has 34 critical minerals and metals the Pentagon is eager for. Ontario's Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said after Wednesday's meeting with the premiers that a number of provincial premiers voiced support for a robust response to the tariffs, including critical minerals being exported to the U.S. Freeland did not mention oil but said 'obviously other ideas were discussed as well' when asked if Canada is considering cutting off oil exports to America. About a third of Canada’s trade to the U.S. is energy. Nearly 3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Canada has promised more border security spending to address Trump’s border concerns. Ford said that will include more border and police officers, as well as drones and sniffer dogs. Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, who along with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago recently, said they plan to share details of those border plans with the incoming Trump administration in the coming days. At the dinner, Kristen Hillman, Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., said America’s trade deficit with Canada was also raised. Hillman said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. is energy exports and prices have been high. Trudeau said this week that U.S.-imposed tariffs would be 'absolutely devastating' for the Canadian economy, but it would also mean real hardship for Americans. Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for goods such as food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and others. The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington-based trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate. Canada imposed duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canadian officials have said it is unfair to lump Canada in with Mexico. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. The U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with irregular migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024, compared to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-us-trump-tariffs-c5d740bed83d71a230194ca28be02100	2024-12-12T07:37:58-08:00	
Funeral for activist turns into call for justice for other missing Syrians	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Hundreds of Syrians marched through central Damascus in a funeral procession Thursday to honor one of the country's most prominent anti-government activists, whose body was found after the ouster of President Bashar Assad. The procession for Mazen al-Hamada — unimaginable only a week earlier — turned the moment of mourning into a call for justice, with marchers carrying posters of other missing detainees and chanting for Assad to be put on trial. The capture of Damascus by insurgents last weekend brought thousands of people into the streets in celebrations, and Thursday’s march recalled the funerals-turned-protests of the early days of the uprising against Assad 13 years ago. 'We will not forget your blood, Mazen,' the marchers, most of them young people, chanted outside a mosque while family and friends held funeral prayers inside. Others chanted: 'We will get our revenge, Bashar. We will bring you before the law.' Al-Hamada joined the anti-government protest movement in its early days and was arrested several times. Released after a long detention in 2013, he left Syria for the Netherlands. There, he became a well-known figure and symbol of the anti-Assad movement, speaking publicly about the torture he endured in prison. Still, he returned to Syria in 2020 — apparently lured by promises of safety — and immediately disappeared. His family found him Tuesday in a hospital morgue. By the condition of his body, al-Hamada, who was in his late 40s, appeared to have been killed only in the past week, his family said. Tens of thousands of Syrians are still seeking information about the fate of loved ones who disappeared under Assad's police state. Many have swarmed prisons and detention facilities in their searches. Dozens of bodies have been found in morgues, some emaciated, and others with wounds that suggest they were tortured. The rebels and the transitional government have called for any information that would help identify secret prisons. In Thursday’s procession, supporters, protesters and family members carried al-Hamada’s body from al-Mujtahid mosque toward a mosque in central Damascus’s al-Hijaz Square. At Abu Awf Mosque, several family members of those still missing joined. Many participants said they last protested in Damascus 13 years ago, before Assad’s brutal crackdown on protesters turned the conflict into full-blown civil war. Mohammad Kulthum, 32, marched in the procession with his mother. 'I could not have imagined going out in a rally in any way, shape or form in Damascus.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-activist-funeral-a275b1cb50b7638d1dc0ff5a56e673e6	2024-12-12T07:32:50-08:00	
2 men deny charges of helping Hong Kong gather intelligence in UK	LONDON (AP) — Two men accused of helping Hong Kong authorities gather intelligence in the U.K. pleaded not guilty Thursday to violating Britain's National Security Act. Chung Biu Yuen, 64, and Chi Leung Peter Wai, 39, are accused of agreeing to undertake information gathering, surveillance and acts of deception likely to assist a foreign intelligence service. Yuen was the office manager of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London and Wai had worked as a U.K. Border Force officer. They had previously pleaded not guilty to a charge of foreign interference for allegedly breaking into a home in the U.K. Wai had also denied a count of misconduct in a public office for allegedly searching Home Office databases without justification when working as a border officer. The two, who are free on bail, face a March 10 trial in London’s Central Criminal Court. Officials in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese control in 1997, have voiced concerns over the charges. Beijing officials strongly criticized the case. A case against a third suspect, Matthew Trickett, an immigration enforcement officer, was discontinued after he was found dead in a park in May. A prosecutor said Trickett attempted suicide after he was charged. Authorities said his death was not considered suspicious.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-hong-kong-spying-charges-5d13785e808bae5d6dc2b8b804a3e264	2024-12-12T07:03:08-08:00	
Concern over Syria's chemical weapons stockpile triggers emergency meeting of global monitor	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The global chemical weapons watchdog opened an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the situation in Syria over concerns about the country’s stockpile of toxic chemicals in the wake of the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on Monday told Syria that it is under obligations to comply with rules to safeguard and destroy dangerous substances, such as chlorine gas, after rebels entered the capital, Damascus, over the weekend. 'Chemical weapons have been used in Syria on multiple occasions and victims deserve that perpetrators that we identified be brought to justice and held accountable for what they did and that investigations continue,' Fernando Arias González, the OPCW secretary general, said in his opening remarks. 'Our reports over the past few years have reached very clear conclusions and we hope that the new circumstances in Syria will allow this chapter to be closed soon,' he added, referring to the lack of stockpile declarations and the use of the weapons themselves. Assad’s government has denied using chemical weapons but the OPCW found evidence indicating their repeated use by Syria in the grinding civil war. Earlier this year, the organization found the Islamic State group had used mustard gas against the town of Marea. In a rare move, the OPCW's executive council called the meeting, hoping that under a new government, some of its 80 inspectors may be allowed to pursue investigations into Syria's chemical weapons program. Members of the ousted Syrian government plan to gradually transfer power to a new transitional Cabinet headed by Mohammed al-Bashir, who reportedly headed the rebel alliance’s 'salvation government' in its southwest Syrian stronghold. Arias González also expressed concern about ongoing Israeli airstrikes in Syria. 'We do not know yet whether these strikes have affected chemical weapons related sites. Such airstrikes could create a risk of contamination. Another real risk would be the destruction of valuable evidence for investigations by different independent international bodies related to past use of chemical weapons,' the Spanish diplomat said. The last time the OPCW called an extraordinary meeting was in 2018, in response to the chemical attack on Douma, a town close to Damascus, when some 40 people were killed by poison gas. Last year the watchdog found that the Syrian Armed Forces dropped canisters of chlorine gas during a major military operation. Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 to ward off the threat of airstrikes in response to a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus. The OPCW’s 193 member states are required to disclose their chemical weapons programs and dismantle them. The organization, created in 1997 by the Chemical Weapons Convention, seeks to eliminate all chemical weapons. In 2013, it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its work.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-chemical-weapons-opcw-stockpiles-chlorine-assad-e195ca88035fc2ae1feb9e9106191329	2024-12-12T06:01:14-08:00	
Trump invites China's Xi to his inauguration even as he threatens massive tariffs on Beijing	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration next month — extending a diplomatic olive branch even as Trump threatens to levy massive tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump's incoming press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed on Thursday that Trump invited Xi, but said it was 'to be determined' if the leader of the United States' most significant economic and military competitor would attend. 'This is an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of countries that are not just our allies, but our adversaries and our competitors too,' Leavitt said in an appearance on Fox News' program 'Fox &amp; Friends.' 'We saw this in his first term. He got a lot of criticism for it, but it led to peace around this world. He is willing to talk to anyone and he will always put America’s interest first.' CBS News first reported the invitation to Xi. Asked at a Chinese Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday about Trump's invitation, spokesperson Mao Ning responded: 'I have nothing to share at present.' Leavitt said that other foreign leaders have also been invited, but did not provide any details. The move by Trump to invite a leader of an adversarial nation to the American moment that is Inauguration Day is unorthodox. But it also squares with his belief that foreign policy—much like a business negotiation—should be carried out with carrots and sticks to get the United States' opponents to operate closer to his administration's preferred terms. Jim Bendat, a historian and author of 'Democracy’s Big Day: The Inauguration of Our President,' said he was not aware of a previous U.S. inauguration attended by foreign head of state. 'It's not necessarily a bad thing to invite foreign leaders to attend,' Bendat said. 'But it sure would make more sense to invite an ally before an adversary.' Trump on Thursday during an appearance at the New York Stock Exchange, where he was ringing the opening bell to open the market, said he’s been 'thinking about inviting certain people to the inauguration' without referring to any specific individuals. 'And some people said, ‘Wow, that’s a little risky, isn’t it?’' Trump said. 'And I said, ‘Maybe it is. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens.’ But we like to take little chances.' Meanwhile, a top aide to Hungarian President Viktor Orban, one of Trump's most vocal supporters on the world stage, said Thursday that Orban isn't slated to attend the inauguration. 'There is no such plan, at least for the time being,' said Gergely Gulyás, Orban's chief of staff. The nationalist Hungarian leader is embraced by Trump but has faced isolation in Europe as he's sought to undermine the European Union's support for Ukraine, and routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc’s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion. Orban recently met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Every country's chief of mission to the United States will also be invited, according to a Trump Inaugural Committee official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The invitation comes as Trump has vowed to enact massive tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China to get those countries to do more to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States. He has said that, on his first day in office in January, he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada and that China could be hit with even higher tariffs. China produces precursor chemicals used in the production of fentanyl, but Beijing has stepped up efforts over the last year to crack down on the export of the chemicals. 'We’ve been talking and discussing with President Xi, some things, and others, other world leaders, and I think we’re going to do very well all around,' Trump said in a CNBC interview Thursday. Xi during a meeting with President Joe Biden last month in Beijing urged the United States not to start a trade war. 'Make the wise choice,' Xi cautioned. 'Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other.' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also pushed back on Trump's threats, warning such a tariffs move would be perilous for the U.S. economy as well. Trudeau earlier this week said that Americans 'are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive' and said he will retaliate if Trump goes ahead with them. Trump responded by calling Canada a state and Trudeau the governor. In addition to the tariff dispute, U.S.-China relations are strained over other issues, including what U.S. officials see as Beijing indirectly supporting Russia's war on Ukraine. The Biden administration says China has supported Russia with a surge in sales of dual use components that help keep its military industrial base afloat. U.S. officials also have expressed frustration with Beijing for not doing more to rein in North Korea's support for the Russian war. China accounts for the vast majority of North Korea’s trade. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has dispatched thousands of troops to Russia to help repel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk border region. The North Koreans also have provided Russia with artillery and other munitions, according to U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials. Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration takes place a day after the U.S. deadline for ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of social media giant TikTok, to sell the social media app or face a ban in the United States. — Associated Press writer Balint Domotor in Budapest, Hungary, contributed reporting.	https://apnews.com/article/china-xi-trump-inauguration-d654da01f90bf3bec071bb9890ffbd29	2024-12-12T05:25:10-08:00	
Rescue group saves 11-year-old girl floating alone in the Mediterranean for days after shipwreck	MILAN (AP) — An 11-year-old girl from Sierra Leone was found floating in the Mediterranean Sea off Italy’s southernmost island of Lampedusa, believed to be the only survivor of a shipwrecked migrant boat that had departed from the port of Sfax in Tunisia, a humanitarian group said Thursday. The girl was saved by a German-flagged sailboat named Trotamar III, which brought her to Lampedusa on Wednesday morning, according to the German charity Compass Collective that has been operating in the Mediterranean Sea since August 2023. She had neither food nor water with her, and was suffering from hypothermia. 'It was an incredible coincidence that we heard the voice of a girl even though the motors were running,’’ the sailboat’s captain, Matthias Weidenluebbert, said in a press statement. The crew immediately cut the engines and searched for the source of the voice, Compass Collective's Katja Tempel, told The Associated Press 'She was exhausted and tired and cold, but in general, she was fine when we fetched her out of the water.' According to the girl’s account, she had floated in the sea for three days using innertubes inflated with air and a lifejacket. She told rescuers that she had set out in a metal boat with about 45 others, and that she had been in contact with two other people until two days before the rescue, when the contact was broken. 'We don’t know what happened to the people,'' Tempel said. 'We assume that they all drowned, but we don’t know what.' The girl was found following a storm that had lasted for days, with winds reaching more than 23 knots and waves above 2.5 meters (8 feet.) The Totamar III, a 13-meter vessel with a rotating crew of six, joined humanitarian rescue efforts in August 2023, rescuing more than 230 people to date. After picking up the girl, the boat distributed life jackets to 53 people aboard a wooden boat without a motor, and reported their location to Italian authorities. In all, the Totamar III crew has assisted 1,700 people, handing out life jackets, alerting authorities and staying with them until rescue arrives. In cases when the situation worsens, the stranded people are transferred on board the sailing ship. According to U.N. statistics, which are based largely on survivor accounts, 1,536 people have died or gone missing and are presumed dead in the central Mediterranean so far this year. A total of 64,234 have reached Italy through Thursday, according to the Italian Interior Ministry. That's down by 58% from last year, when 153,211 had arrived in the period. 'I want to emphasize, this girl is just a sign for the (deaths) in the Mediterranean,'' Tempel said. 'She's one person, and its very sad that she probably lost her relatives. But it is just a symbol for the tragedy that is happening.' ___ This story has been corrected to show that the first name of the rescue group's member is Katja, not Katya. ___ Murru reported from Rome.

Syria's new authorities say they've secured the release of an American pilgrim imprisoned by Assad	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — An American citizen who disappeared seven months ago into former Syrian President Bashar Assad’s notorious prison system was suddenly discovered Thursday outside Damascus after being released and handed over to rebel forces, Syria’s new authorities said. The political affairs office of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that led the lightning offensive to topple Assad’s government, said the group had secured the release of U.S. citizen Travis Timmerman. In interviews with media in Syria, Timmerman said he was imprisoned after crossing from Lebanon into Syria on a Christian pilgrimage. He appeared to be among the thousands of people released from Syria's sprawling military prisons this week after rebels reached Damascus, overthrowing Assad and ending his family’s 54-year rule. 'We affirm our readiness to cooperate directly with the U.S. administration to complete the search for American citizens disappeared by the former Assad regime,' the group said, adding that a search was underway for Austin Tice, an American journalist who went missing in Syria 12 years ago. As footage emerged online Thursday of Timmerman, looking disheveled and disoriented as rebels led him out of a family's home near Damascus, some initially mistook him for Tice. In the video, Timmerman could be seen lying on a mattress under a blanket. A group of men in the video said that he was being treated well and would be safely returned home. A Syrian family told The Associated Press they found Timmerman barefoot on a main road in the countryside of Damascus early on Thursday. He appeared cold and hungry so they brought him back to their home. 'I fed him and called a doctor,' said Mosaed al-Rifai, the 68-year-old waste collector who first found Timmerman. Al-Rifai said it was hard to communicate because of the language barrier but it seemed Timmerman had been held by an internal security agency. A few hours after al-Rifai discovered him, rebels arrived at the family’s house to pick him up, he said. Mouaz Mostafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based nonprofit group, said he met Timmerman at the house and arranged for a car to take him to Damascus, where the new authorities gave the ex-detainee food and water and brought him clothes and shoes. Timmerman had lice in his long, unkempt hair, Mostafa said, and reported walking for 13 miles barefoot before being discovered. Timmerman — now recovering until the rebels can figure out how to hand him to U.S. authorities — was planning to get to Jordan after his release to obtain a new passport, Mostafa said. Earlier this year, a Missouri State Highway Patrol bulletin identified him as 'Pete Travis Timmerman,' 29, and said he had gone missing in Hungary in early June. In late August, Hungarian police put out a missing persons announcement for 'Travis Pete Timmerman,' saying he was last seen at a church in Hungary’s capital, Budapest. Authorities in Missouri and Hungary had shared photos of a young man who strongly resembles the ex-prisoner who identified himself as 'Travis Timmerman' in interviews with international news outlets on Thursday. Missouri court records indicate Timmerman is from Urbana, Missouri, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Springfield in the southwestern part of the state. A graduation list from Missouri State University shows he earned his bachelor’s degree in finance in the spring of 2017. Timmerman’s mother, Stacey Collins Gardiner, told National Public Radio that he returned home to Urbana after working in Chicago for a couple of years. He then left for Budapest with the goal of writing about his Christian faith and helping people, she said. Timmerman had warned her, she added, that his travels might make communication difficult. After losing contact with him during his stay in Hungary, Gardiner later learned that her son had gone to Lebanon. On Thursday, she heard that he was found through the media. 'I will hug him. ... And then I probably won’t let him go,' she said, laughing. 'I’ll say, well, thank God you’re still alive. And I’m so happy. Our prayers came true.' U.S. officials said they were working to confirm Timmerman's identity and provide the support. From Aqaba, Jordan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that the White House was 'working to bring him home, to bring him out of Syria' but declined further comment for privacy reasons. Timmerman, with a scraggly beard and grey sweatshirt, later spoke with the Al-Arabiya TV network, saying he had illegally crossed into Syria on foot from the eastern Lebanese town of Zahle seven months ago before being detained and held in a cell alone. He said that he was treated well in detention, but could hear other young men being tortured. 'It was OK. I was fed. I was watered. The one difficulty was that I couldn’t go to the bathroom when I wanted to,' he said. He said he was only allowed to go three times a day. 'I was not beaten and the guards treated me decently,' he added. Washington's top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens, traveled to Lebanon earlier this week in hopes of collecting information on the whereabouts of Tice. President Joe Biden has said his administration believed Tice was alive and was committed to bringing him home, though he also acknowledged on Sunday that 'we have no direct evidence' of his status. The case has frustrated U.S. intelligence officials for years. On Thursday, Blinken emphasized the administration’s work on Tice's case. 'Every single day we are working to find him and to bring him home' Blinken said. 'This is a priority for the United States.' Tice, who has had his work published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and others, disappeared at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus in August 2012 as the Syrian civil war intensified. A video released weeks after Tice went missing showed him blindfolded and held by armed men. He hasn't been heard from since. Assad's government had denied that it was holding him. ___ Follow the AP's Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-war-assad-news-12-12-2024-832bd669d118305bd773a26c29893207	2024-12-12T02:25:22-08:00	
A pro-democracy ex-lawmaker in Hong Kong has been convicted of rioting during 2019 protests	HONG KONG (AP) — A Hong Kong judge on Thursday convicted a pro-democracy former lawmaker of rioting during mob violence at a subway station at the height of the city’s anti-government protests in July 2019. Prosecutors accused Lam Cheuk-ting of provoking a group of about 100 men armed with wooden poles and metal rods who attacked protesters and bystanders at a train station. The men, all clad in white shirts, in contrast with the black worn by protesters, claimed to be protecting their homeland in Yuen Long, a residential district in Hong Kong's New Territories. Dozens of people, including Lam, were injured in the violence, a key chapter that escalated the protest movement as the public criticized police for their delayed response. The landmark ruling could shape the city's historical narrative of the incident. Judge Stanley Chan ruled that Lam was not acting as a mediator as he had claimed, but rather was trying to exploit the situation for political gain. He said Lam's words directed at the white-shirted men had 'fanned the flames.' Lam, who is already in prison on a national security charge, is expected to be sentenced at a later date. Chan was still reading out the verdicts for six other lesser-known co-defendants in the same case. The prosecution alleged the seven defendants had either berated the white-shirted men, used obscene hand gestures, hurled objects or shot jets of water by pointing a hosepipe at them. The defendants had pleaded not guilty to the rioting charge. During the trial, Lam said he chose to go to Yuen Long because he hoped his then position as a lawmaker could pressure the police to act quickly. He said he could not leave the scene while fellow residents were in danger. Some defendants who targeted the white-shirted men with a hosepipe argued that they were just trying to stop the attackers from advancing. The 2019 protests were sparked by a proposed extradition law that would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to the mainland for trial. The government withdrew the bill, but the protesters widened their demands to include direct elections for the city’s leaders and police accountability. The social movement was the biggest challenge to the Hong Kong government since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In response, Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020, leading to the arrest of many activists. Others were silenced or went into exile. In November, Lam was sentenced to six years and nine months in jail in the city's biggest national security case. More than 10,000 people were arrested in connection to the protests for various crimes, such as rioting and participating in an unauthorized assembly. About 10 white-shirted men were convicted in other cases related to the mob violence in July 2019, local media reported.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-riot-verdicts-lam-cheukting-0fc782d0aa375faf8f8c3f91995a9f8f	2024-12-12T00:40:37-08:00

AP photos from Ukraine in 2024 convey wartime horror and hope	A man falls to his death from the window of a burning apartment after a Russian air strike. Two girls in pink tutus join a ballet class in a bomb shelter. The grisly evidence of war is everywhere in Ukraine, where, for a third year, soldiers and civilians are enduring the Russian army’s onslaught. AP photographers have traveled across the country, capturing the agony and the life-affirming joy witnessed in the conflict. Bombs and missiles have turned residential neighborhoods into fiery infernos, while relentless attacks have destroyed homes, hospitals and schools. Evacuations in front-line areas tear apart Ukrainian communities. The elderly are wrenched away from their longtime homes and neighbors. AP photos have evoked the grief and the poignancy of funerals for fallen soldiers and for families killed by the Russian shelling. Open coffins, including those of children, provide a glimpse of the tragedy. The United Nations accuses Russia of numerous human rights violations in Ukraine. They include aiming at civilian targets, devastating attacks on Ukraine’s power grid, and the forced transfer and deportation of children. By the end of October, the UN estimated that the war had killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians and injured almost 27,000. Despite the suffering and hardship, civilians carry on with some everyday activities that wouldn’t be out of place in peacetime. In northeastern Ukraine, about 20 young girls assemble for ballet lessons at the Princess Ballet Studio, where the windowless room doubles as a bomb shelter amid almost hourly air raids. Children leap into the water at Kyiv’s Liko Diving School. Another boy looks thoughtful as he learns chess strategy from an elderly man in one of the Ukrainian capital’s public parks. Clowns perform at a children’s hospital. Young people wave their arms and dance at a festival concert featuring an active serviceman in Ukraine’s Hroza battalion.

Hardest-hit Nigeria is latest African country to provide malaria vaccine to young children	BAYELSA, Nigeria (AP) — Ominike Marvis has lost count of the number of times her 6-year-old son has had malaria. So when Nigeria started offering a malaria vaccine, she was eager to protect her youngest child. She took the 6-month-old baby to get his first shot at a health center in hard-hit Bayelsa state, where the country's vaccination campaign kicked off last week. The vaccine aims to prevent severe illnesses and deaths from the mosquito-borne disease. 'At least I know he’s safe from it now,' Marvis, 31, said. Africa accounts for the vast majority of malaria in the world. Nigeria, the continent's most populous country, has the biggest burden with about a quarter of the cases. According to a World Health Organization report released Wednesday, there were an estimated 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths worldwide last year, mostly in children under 5. That is 11 million more malaria cases compared to 2022 with nearly the same number of deaths. 'No one should die of malaria, yet the disease continues to disproportionately harm people living in the African region, especially young children and pregnant women,' said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, calling for more support. There are now 17 countries giving new malaria vaccines to young children, the WHO report said. Nigeria began its campaign last week, offering a vaccine developed by Oxford University. Research suggests it is more than 75% effective at preventing severe disease and death in the first year and that protection is extended for at least another year with a booster. Nigeria’s health minister, Muhammad Ali Pate, called the vaccination campaign a 'monumental step' in the country’s efforts to eliminate malaria. The disease is caused by a parasite that is spread through mosquito bites. Experts say other measures like bed nets and insecticide spraying remain essential to curb the disease. Experts say Nigeria's population of more than 210 million people, as well as its climate, contribute to its high malaria burden, but so do other factors like poor sanitation and limited tools like treated bed nets. Besides the lack of funding, WHO report said countries with malaria still grapple with fragile health systems, weak surveillance and drug and insecticide resistance. But progress has also been made on several fronts, the report said, including in the African region where countries have achieved a 16% reduction in malaria deaths since 2015. And in 83 countries where malaria is present, 25 of them now report fewer than 10 cases a year, the report said. In the oil-rich but poor Bayelsa state, among the worst-hit in Nigeria, malaria is so common in riverside communities that mothers spoke of how no one in their family has been spared. 'Here, malaria is something we are used to,' said Claris Okah, a community health worker. Among the challenges health workers like Okah face is hesitancy among parents, so they are educating families about the new vaccine and other steps to prevent malaria. 'The vaccine is a good thing,' Okah siad. ___ Asadu reported from Abuja, Nigeria. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

One Tech Tip: How to protect your communications through encryption	LONDON (AP) — After a sprawling hacking campaign exposed the communications of an unknown number of Americans, U.S. cybersecurity officials are advising people to use encryption in their communications. To safeguard against the risks highlighted by the campaign, which originated in China, federal cybersecurity authorities released an extensive list of security recommendations for U.S. telecom companies — such as Verizon and AT&amp;T — that were targeted. The advice includes one tip we can all put into practice with our phones: 'Ensure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible.' End-to-end encryption, also known as E2EE, means that messages are scrambled so that only the sender and recipient can see them. If anyone else intercepts the message, all they will see is a garble that can't be unscrambled without the key. Law enforcement officials had until now resisted this type of encryption because it means the technology companies themselves won't be able to look at the messages, nor respond to law enforcement requests to turn the data over. Here's a look at various ways ordinary consumers can use end-to-end encryption: Texting Officials said the hackers targeted the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts. They also managed to see the content from texts from a much smaller number of victims. If you're an iPhone user, information in text messages that you send to someone else who also has an iPhone will be encrypted end-to-end. Just look for the blue text bubbles, which indicate that they are encrypted iMessages. The same goes for Android users sending texts through Google Messages. There will be a lock next to the timestamp on each message to indicate the encryption is on. But there's a weakness. When iPhone and Android users text each other, the messages are encrypted only using Rich Communication Services, an industry standard for instant messaging that replaces the older SMS and MMS standards. Apple has noted that RCS messages 'aren’t end-to-end encrypted, which means they’re not protected from a third party reading them while they’re sent between devices.' Samsung, which sells Android smartphones, has also hinted at the issue in a footnote at the bottom of a press release last month on RCS, saying, 'Encryption only available for Android to Android communication.' Chat apps To avoid getting caught out when trading texts, experts recommend using encrypted messaging apps. Privacy advocates are big fans of Signal, which applies end-to-end encryption on all messages and voice calls. The independent nonprofit group behind the app promises never to sell, rent, or lease customer data and has made its source code publicly available so that it can be audited by anyone to examine it 'for security and correctness.' Signal's encryption protocol is so reputable that it has been integrated into rival WhatsApp, so users will enjoy the same level of security protection as Signal, which has a much smaller user base. End-to-end encryption is also the default mode for Facebook Messenger, which like WhatsApp is owned by Meta Platforms. What about Telegram? Telegram is an app that can be used for one-on-one conversations, group chats and broadcast 'channels' but contrary to popular perception, it doesn't turn on end-to-end encryption by default. Users have to switch on the option. And it doesn’t work with group chats. Cybersecurity experts have warned people against using Telegram for private communications and pointed out that only its opt-in ‘secret chat’ feature is encrypted from end-to-end. The app also has a reputation for being a haven for scammers and criminal activity, highlighted by founder and CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France. Making calls Instead of using your phone to make calls through a wireless cellular network, you can make voice calls with Signal and WhatsApp. Both apps encrypt calls with the same technology that they use to encrypt messages. There are other options. If you have an iPhone you can use Facetime for calls, while Android owners can use the Google Fi service, which are both end-to-end encrypted. The only catch with all these options is that, as with using the chat services to send messages, the person on the other end will also have to have the app installed. WhatsApp and Signal users can customize their privacy preferences in the settings, including hiding IP address during calls to prevent your general location from being guessed. ___ Is there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

Middle East latest: Israeli airstrikes kill 28 in Gaza, including 7 children, health officials say	Palestinian medical officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 28 people in the Gaza Strip, including seven children and a woman, hours after the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. One of the strikes overnight and into Thursday flattened a house in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the casualties were taken. Two other strikes killed 15 men who were part of local committees established to secure aid convoys. The committees were set up by displaced Palestinians in coordination with the Hamas-run Interior Ministry. On Wednesday, the U.N. General Assembly approved resolutions demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and expressing support for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, although they reflect world opinion. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,800 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the latest: Israeli airstrikes kill at least 28 people, including 7 children, Palestinian medical officials say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 28 people in the Gaza Strip, including seven children and a woman. One of the strikes overnight and into Thursday flattened a house in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the casualties were taken. An Associated Press reporter saw the bodies at the hospital’s morgue. Two other strikes killed 15 men who were part of local committees established to secure aid convoys. The committees were set up by displaced Palestinians in coordination with the Hamas-run Interior Ministry. The Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis received the bodies and an Associated Press reporter counted them. The hospital said eight were killed in a strike near the southern border town of Rafah and seven others in a strike 30 minutes later near Khan Younis.

The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis, with experts warning of famine. Israel says it allows enough aid to enter and blames U.N. agencies for not distributing it. The U.N. says Israeli restrictions, and the breakdown of law and order after Israel repeatedly targeted the Hamas-run police force, make it extremely difficult to operate in the territory. Shooting attack on Israeli bus kills child, wounds 2 people JERUSALEM — Israeli hospital officials say a young boy died after being wounded in a shooting attack in the occupied West Bank that also wounded two adults. An Israeli bus came under fire from a suspected Palestinian attacker late Wednesday, the military said, and Israeli forces are searching for the shooter. The shooting took place just outside Jerusalem in an area near major Israeli settlements. Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem said the boy was 12 years old, after initial reports said he was 10. A spokesperson for the hospital did not immediately respond to a request for clarification. The hospital said two other people, ages 24 and 55, were also wounded. UN General Assembly demands ceasefire in Gaza and backs UN agency helping Palestinian refugees UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban. The votes in the 193-nation world body were 158-9 with 13 abstentions to demand a ceasefire now and 159-9 with 11 abstentions to support the agency known as UNRWA. The votes culminated two days of speeches overwhelmingly calling for an end to the 14-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly. Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-12-december-2024-b17c7ab064079d80fd006ab9d058966b	2024-12-11T22:37:57-08:00	
Thousands attend the funeral of a Taliban minister killed by an Islamic State suicide bomber	GARDA SERAI, Afghanistan (AP) — Thousands of people attended the funeral on Thursday of a Taliban minister killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, the day before that was claimed by the Islamic State group. The funeral for Khalil Haqqani, the minister for refugees and repatriation, was held in the eastern Paktia province. The Cabinet member was the most high-profile casualty of an assault in the country since the Taliban seized power three years ago. The minister, who died in a blast Wednesday at his ministry in Kabul along with five others, was the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the acting interior minister and the leader of a powerful faction within the Taliban. The United States has placed a bounty on both their heads. Tight security was in place for the high-ranking officials attending the funeral, including Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Deputy Prime Minister Maulvi Abdul Kabir. Armed men guarded the coffin, which was draped in the Taliban flag, and loudspeakers broadcast sermons and eulogies. Local and international media were invited to cover the funeral in Garda Serai district in Paktia. Sirajuddin Haqqani led the mourners in prayer. They gathered on a vast plain against a backdrop of rugged mountains. Haqqani told the crowd he wished the person who perpetrated this 'weak action' had thought of his uncle as an enemy of non-Muslims. 'The Americans offered a $5 million reward (for information) on him,' said the acting interior minister. 'He was not an enemy of Muslims. How can you call this a great victory, that you martyred a Muslim and are proud of it?' In a statement carried by the Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State Khorasan Province — a regional affiliate of the Islamic State group — said that one of its fighters carried out the suicide bombing. The fighter waited for Haqqani to leave his office and then detonated his device, according to the statement. An official from Paktia, the Haqqanis' heartland, gave a different account of what happened. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. The assailant was able to gain access to the ministry despite setting off an alarm on the body scanner because he told the guard he had metal plates in his hands, the official said. He also claimed he was a refugee. The official added that Haqqani made time for refugees and people with disabilities who come to see him at work because he was sympathetic to their plight. He was approaching the ministry after praying in the compound's mosque when the assailant detonated the bomb, the official added. The U.N. mission in Afghanistan was among those to condemn the ministry attack. 'There can be no place for terrorism in the quest for stability,' the mission said on X. Neighboring Pakistan has also expressed shock over teh attack. Mohammad Sadiq, the special representative for Afghanistan, wrote on X on Wednesday that the government stood in solidarity with Afghanistan and reiterated its commitment to work with Afghanistan in fighting the 'menace of terrorism.' The IS affiliate, a major rival of the ruling Taliban, has previously carried out bombings across Afghanistan. But suicide attacks have become rare since the Taliban seized power in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces were withdrawing after 20 years of war. Such assaults have mostly targeted minority Shiite Muslims, especially in the capital. ___ Associated Press writer Munir Ahmed in Islamabad contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-haqqani-funeral-suicide-bombing-kabul-cf2ec2a67b230ce0a4b919561c85042e	2024-12-11T22:24:56-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mostly higher, tracking a rally on Wall Street	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares were mostly higher Thursday in Asia after Wall Street resumed its upward climb, as an update on inflation appeared to clear the way for more help for the economy from the Federal Reserve. Chinese shares rose as leaders met in Beijing to set economic plans and targets for the coming year. The government announced plans to expand trial private pension programs to the entire country, beginning Dec. 15. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong jumped 1.4% to 20,441.57 and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.9% to 3,461.50. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index advanced 1.2% to 39,849.14, led by buying of technology shares. Advantest Corp., which makes equipment for testing computer chips, gained 5.1%, while chip maker Tokyo Electron was up 0.6%. South Korea's Kospi gained 1.6% to 2,482.12, while the S&amp;P/ASX 200 in Australia slipped 0.3% to 8,330.30. Taiwan's Taiex climbed 0.6% and the Sensex in India shed 0.2%. The SET in Bangkok picked up 0.2%. U.S. stock indexes resumed climbing on Wednesday after an update on inflation appeared to clear the way for more help for the economy from the Federal Reserve. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.8% to break its first two-day losing streak in nearly a month and finished at 6,084.19. Big Tech stocks helped drive the Nasdaq composite up 1.8% to 20,034.89. It was its first close above 20,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, dipped 0.2% to 44,148.56. Inflation in the U.S. ticked up to 2.7% in November from a year earlier from 2.6% in October, fueled by pricier used cars, hotel rooms and groceries. That shows some price pressures remain elevated, but not enough to prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates at its meeting next week. The Fed began trimming rates in September from a two-decade high to support a slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower rates would give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, but they could also provide more fuel for inflation. Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&amp;P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times this year, with the latest coming last week. Tesla jumped 5.9% to finish above $420 at $424.77. It’s a level that Elon Musk made famous in a 2018 tweet when he said he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share. Stitch Fix soared 44.3% after the company that sends clothes to your door reported a smaller loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave financial forecasts for the current quarter that were better than expected, including for revenue. GE Vernova rallied 5% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500. The energy company that spun out of General Electric said it would pay a 25 cent dividend every three months, and it approved a plan to send up to another $6 billion to its shareholders by buying back its own stock. Albertsons fell 1.5% after filing a lawsuit against Kroger, saying it didn’t do enough for their proposed $24.6 billion merger agreement to win regulatory clearance. A day earlier, judges in separate cases in Oregon and Washington had nixed the supermarket giants’ merger. The grocers contended a combination could have helped them compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, but critics said it would hurt competition. Macy’s slipped 0.8% after cutting some of its financial forecasts for the full year of 2024, including for how much profit it expects to make off each $1 of revenue. In other dealings early Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 13 cents to $70.42 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gained 23 cents to $73.75 per barrel. The U.S. dollar slipped to 152.35 Japanese yen from 152.46 yen. The euro rose to $1.0527 from $1.0496.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-41b48ce746dc18a1b5141d4c49cff403	2024-12-11T20:37:16-08:00	
Migrant workers in Lebanon are trying to return home after alleged abuses and then war	BEIRUT (AP) — Isatta Bah wakes up from a nap in a crowded shelter on the outskirts of Beirut, clutching her baby, Blessing. The 24-year-old from Sierra Leone spends her days waiting for an exit visa that could put her and her 1-year-old on a plane back to the West African nation. She wants to reunite with her family after what she called exploitative work conditions and sexual violence, along with the recent horrors of war in Lebanon. 'My experience in Lebanon is not good for me. I am really tired,' Bah said. 'I want to go home.' Hundreds of migrant workers in Lebanon are waiting to be repatriated after the ceasefire ending the 14-month war between the Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Israel went into effect last month. Lebanon has long drawn migrant workers dreaming of building better lives for their families. Enticed by promises of stable jobs and decent pay, they enter Lebanon via recruitment agencies under a sponsorship-based labor system known as Kafala — only to find themselves often trapped with confiscated passports, long hours, withheld wages and, for many, abuse. The Kafala system has long been criticized by human rights groups, but the government rarely if ever addresses the criticism. But Bah knew little of that when she came to Lebanon in 2022. She was promised a job at a supermarket with a $200 monthly salary, she said. Instead, she was sent to care for an older woman once she arrived. Within a month of her arrival, her 3-year-old son back home fell ill and died. She said she was not given the time to grieve and fled her employer’s house. Since her employer held her passport and other documents, Bah said she had to leave them behind. Her experience in Lebanon then took a darker turn. One day she and five housemates were picked up by a taxi driver who said he would take them home. Instead, she said, the driver dropped them at the wrong spot. As they tried and failed to find another cab, a group of men chased them and raped them. 'Men were coming and they were cheering for us,' said Bah, who gave her consent to be named. 'They beat us and they had sex with us.' She said it took her about two weeks to recover and resume work at two hotels. Without documents, migrants can hesitate to go to police. Two months later, she and another friend found out they were pregnant. Bah recounted the experience as she watched her baby’s wobbly footsteps. With war, their lives became more precarious. When Israel intensified its bombardment of Beirut’s southern suburbs in September, Bah fled the area with her baby and friends on foot. Not every migrant worker escaped the attacks. An estimated 37 have been killed and 150 wounded since October 2023, said Joelle Mhanna with the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. There were few places to turn. Most government-run shelters refused to take in displaced people who were not Lebanese, said activist Dea Hajj Shaheen. After supporting migrant women during previous crises in Lebanon, she stepped in again along with other volunteers. To house over 200 women from Sierra Leone including Bah, they repurposed an abandoned space owned by her family — a former car dealership that was later a venue for pop-up events and named The Shelter. The kitchen was alive with activity as women cooked, some dancing to Nigerian music. In another area, rows of thin mattresses lay in the dim light from broken windows. Despite the modest conditions, the women set up a Christmas tree crafted from sticks. While some migrants have been accepted at government-run shelters, there were regular reports of others being evicted or denied access, the IOM said. Some migrants hesitate to approach the government shelters for fear of detention or deportation, Mhanna said. 'As a result, most are being hosted by embassies, NGOs and community-based organizations including churches, monasteries and other religious groups.' The Lebanese government has not directly addressed the issue of migrant workers being rejected from government-run shelters, despite repeated calls for action from rights organizations and the United Nations. Moving on from the shelters they found posed another challenge for migrants like Bah, as many had passports and other documents confiscated by former employers. 'We had to secure exit permits, immigration clearances and even child travel documents for the five children in this group,' said Shaheen, who coordinated the repatriation last month of 120 women and their children with the support of IOM, who chartered the flight. IOM said it has received requests from around 10,000 migrants seeking to be repatriated, a small fraction of the over 175,000 in Lebanon. As of Nov. 26, the IOM had supported over 400 migrants to return home. That included two charter flights for people from Bangladesh and Sierra Leone. It wasn't clear how many more flights are planned. or to where. Laughter and cheer filled Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport on Nov. 19. The women from Sierra Leone arrived in groups, dragging suitcases and sharing hugs. Some danced in celebration for their long-awaited flight. 'It wasn’t easy in Lebanon,' said Amanata Thullah after four years. 'I am happy to be going back to my country.' Mariam Sesay, who described herself as the head of Sierra Leone's community in Lebanon, said there had been 'a lot of distress and trauma' in recent months. Bah was not among those leaving, but she said she and others at the shelter were happy to see friends return home. She now awaits her turn, along with over 50 others. At first she was told she needed official documents for her baby and the father’s consent to travel. But a lawyer waived the requirement due to her circumstances, Shaheen said. 'I wish to go back home to continue my education,' Bah said. 'Since I was little, I always wanted to be a computer science student, because I’m good at that.' She looked down at Blessing. 'Now I have something to take care of,' she said. 'When I watch her walk or laugh, that gives me joy.' ___ Follow AP coverage of migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-migrants-sierra-leone-war-9c696b80aa3bd5099ffc26394474d1fd	2024-12-11T20:23:38-08:00	
Rights group accuses Russian mercenaries of abuses against civilians in Mali	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Mali’s armed forces, supported by Russian mercenaries, committed abuses against civilians since the withdrawal of a U.N. peacekeeping mission late last year, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday. Malian armed forces and the Russia-backed Wagner Group deliberately killed at least 32 civilians, including seven in a drone strike, kidnapped four others, and burned at least 100 homes in towns and villages in central and northern Mali since May, the rights group said. Human Rights Watch also accused jihadi groups in the region of having summarily executed at least 47 civilians and displaced thousands of people since June. It said the groups burned thousands of houses and looted livestock, which is vital to the survival of the nomadic communities in the region. 'The Malian army with the Wagner Group and Islamist armed groups have been targeting civilians and their property in violation of the laws of war,' Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in the report. Mali, along with its neighbors Burkina Faso and Niger, has for over a decade battled an insurgency fought by jihadi groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Following military coups in all three nations in recent years, the ruling juntas have expelled French forces and turned to Russia’s mercenary units for security assistance. Wagner has been present in Mali since late 2021 following a military coup, replacing French troops and international peacekeepers to help fight the militants. At the same time, the mercenary group has been accused of helping to carry out raids and drone strikes that have killed civilians. In December last year, the United Nations ended its decade long peacekeeping mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA following the government’s request that alleged the force was inadequate to respond to the insurgency. 'Since MINUSMA left Mali a year ago, it has been extremely difficult to get comprehensive information on abuses, and we are deeply concerned that the situation is even worse than reported,' Allegrozzi said. ____ Follow AP’s Africa coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mali-human-rights-watch-russia-wagner-abuses-ee01ab840c6323c176ded02d1d7be5bb	2024-12-11T20:08:38-08:00	
As tourists discover Finland's Santa Claus Village, some locals call for rules to control the masses	ROVANIEMI, Finland (AP) — Shuffling across icy ground on a cold December afternoon, lots of tourist groups poured into Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park perched on the edge of the Arctic Circle. They frolic in the snow, take a reindeer sleigh ride, sip a cocktail in an ice bar or even meet Saint Nick himself in the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, which happily calls itself the 'official hometown of Santa Claus.' The Santa Claus Village theme park, which attracts more than 600,000 people annually, is especially popular during the holiday season. 'This is like my dream came true,' beamed Polish visitor Elzbieta Nazaruk. 'I’m really excited to be here.' Tourism is booming in Rovaniemi — which has hotel and restaurant owners, as well as city officials, excited as it brings lots of money to the town. However, not everyone is happy about the onslaught of visitors, 10 times the town's population, each year at Christmas time. 'We are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it’s not anymore in control,' said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city’s streets. It’s a feeling that has been echoed in other popular European travel destinations, including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Malaga and Florence. Across the continent, locals have protested against 'over-tourism' — which generally describes the tipping point at which visitors and their cash stop benefiting residents and instead cause harm by degrading historic sites, overwhelming infrastructure and making life markedly more difficult for those who live there. Now, it seems to have spread north, all the way to the edges of the Arctic Circle. Rovaniemi counted a record 1.2 million overnight visitors in 2023, almost 30 percent growth on 2022, after rebounding from pandemic travel disruptions. 'Nordic is a trend,' Visit Rovaniemi CEO Sanna Karkkainen, said as she stood in an ice restaurant, where snow carvers were working nearby. 'People want to travel to cool countries to see the snow, to see the Northern Lights, and, of course, to see Santa Claus,' she added. Thirteen new flight routes to Rovaniemi Airport opened this year, bringing passengers from Geneva, Berlin, Bordeaux and more. Most tourists come from European countries like France, Germany and the UK, but Rovaniemi’s appeal has also spread further. Hotel availability is scarce this winter, and Tiina Määttä, general manager of the 159-room Original Sokos Hotel, expects 2024 to break more records. Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi’s city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a 'transient space for tourists.' Finnish law prohibits professional accommodation services in buildings intended for residential use, so campaigners are calling on authorities to act. 'The rules must be enforced better,' said Pakkanen. Not everyone agrees. Mayor Ulla-Kirsikka Vainio notes some make 'good money' on short-term rentals. Either way, stricter regulations likely won’t be in place to impact this winter season, and despite the unease expressed by locals, mass tourism to Rovaniemi is probably only going to grow in 2025 — as visitors want to experience the unique atmosphere up north, especially during the holiday season.

US hikes tariffs on imports of Chinese solar wafers, polysilicon and tungsten products	BANGKOK (AP) — The Biden administration plans to raise tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect U.S. clean energy businesses. The notice from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50% from 25% and duties on certain tungsten products will increase from zero to 25%, effective on Jan. 1, following a review of Chinese trade practices under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. The decision followed a public comment period after the USTR said in September that it was considering such actions. 'The tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People’s Republic of China,' USTR Katharine Tai said in a statement. 'These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains.' Reports Thursday said U.S. and Chinese officials were meeting this week and next for trade talks ahead of the year's end. Last week, Washington tightened restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology. Beijing responded by banning exports to the U.S. of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the U.S. China provides a very large share of most of those materials and the United States has been working to secure alternative sources in Africa and other parts of the world. Tungsten is another strategically vital metal whose production is dominated by China. The U.S. does not produce it, but South Korea is a potential big supplier. It's used to make armaments and is also used in x-ray tubes and light bulb filaments, among other industrial applications. U.S. imports of the metal from China fell to $10.9 million in 2023 from $19.5 million the year before. After Beijing announced its ban on exporting gallium and the other materials to the United States, analysts said tungsten was another likely area where China might strike back. Trade frictions have been escalating ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods, among other threats. President Joe Biden has said Trump’s promise of broad tariffs on foreign imports would be a mistake. His administration has kept in place tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term in office, but says it has a more targeted approach. China has sharply ramped up production of cheap electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries at a time when the Biden administration has championed moves to support those industries in the U.S. The U.S. and other trading partners say China improperly subsidizes exports, giving exporters of solar panels and other products an unfair advantage in overseas markets, where its manufacturers charge lower prices thanks to government support. Washington also says China improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology. China accounts for more than 80% of the market for solar panels at all stages of production, according to the International Energy Agency, more than double domestic demand for those products. Its huge economies of scale have made solar power more affordable, but also concentrated the supply chain inside China. The IEA has urged other countries to assess their solar panel supply chains and develop strategies to address any risks. In early 2018, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. Beijing filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization charging that the U.S. was unfairly supporting electric vehicle purchases. The investigation that led the USTR to raise the tariffs on solar panels concluded with a report in May that has prompted increases in tariffs on a range of products including electric vehicles, syringes and needles, medical gloves and facemasks, semiconductors and steel and aluminum products, among others. It has pushed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles up to 100% from 25%, raised tariffs on Chinese-made lithium batteries to 25% from 7.5%.	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tariffs-tungsten-solar-a9653d4b14051d78314c2bd8111510e7	2024-12-11T19:39:53-08:00	
In Nigeria's lithium boom, many mines are illegal and children do much of the work	NASARAWA, Nigeria (AP) — Dressed in a faded pink dress, 6-year-old Juliet Samaniya squats under scorching skies to chip at a jagged white rock with a stone tool. Dust coats her tiny hands and her hair as she works hour after hour for less than a dollar a day. The landscape around her is dotted with active and abandoned mineshafts, farmland that may soon be cleared in search of more rich ore, and other mine workers — many of them children. Juliet should be in school, her mother, Abigail Samaniya, admits. Instead, she spends her day mining lithium, a mineral critical for batteries needed in the global transition to clean energy, to earn money that helps sustain her family. 'That is the only option,' Abigail Samaniya said. The International Labour Organization estimates more than 1 million children work in mines and quarries worldwide, a problem particularly acute in Africa, where poverty, limited access to education and weak regulations add to the problem. Children, working mostly in small-scale mines, work long hours at unsafe sites, crushing or sorting rocks, carrying heavy loads of ore, and exposing themselves to toxic dust that can cause respiratory problems and asthma. The growing demand for lithium has created a new frontier for mining in mineral-rich Nigeria. But it has come with a steep cost, exploiting its poorest and most vulnerable: its children. Their work often provides material for Chinese businesses that dominate Nigeria’s laxly regulated extractive industry and are often blamed for illegal mining and labor exploitation. The Associated Press recently traveled to the deep bush of Pasali, near the federal capital of Abuja in Nasarawa state, to follow and interview miners operating illegal mines, including the one where Juliet works. AP also witnessed negotiations and an agreement to purchase lithium by a Chinese company with no questions about the source of the lithium or how it was obtained. That company, RSIN Nigeria Limited, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But in a statement to AP, the Chinese embassy in Abuja said Chinese mining companies in Nigeria 'operate in line with local laws and regulations.' Nigeria has laws requiring basic education and prohibiting child labor, but enforcement is a challenge with many illegal mines in hard-to-reach areas. Corruption among regulatory and law enforcement officials is also a problem. The government said it's pursuing reforms that would toughen laws. Earlier this year it also launched a 'corps of mining marshals' to combat illegal mining, but activists say it's too soon to tell if that program is helping. How Nigeria's illegal mines work Lithium mining began in Pasali a decade ago, transforming a remote and slumbering community into a bustling site for small-scale illegal mining, said Shedrack Bala, a 25-year-old who began working in the mines at age 15 and now owns his own pit. Dozens of mines now dot the area, all unlicensed. The mining methods are primitive and dangerous. Miners use chisels and heavy hammers to break through rocks, descending several feet into dark pits. In some old but still viable mines, they crawl through narrow passages snaking between unstable mud walls before starting to dig. For new mines, the ground is blasted open with dynamite. Bashir Rabiu, now 19, started in these pits as an underage worker. AP journalists watched as he wriggled around at the bottom of a pit, where miners can be at risk if dynamite explodes prematurely. They also face danger of suffocating in narrow tunnels that connect pits, or burial from wall collapse — all fates Rabiu has seen befall other miners. 'But it is God that protects,' he said. Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to Juliet and five other children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over heaps of rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments. Once sorted, the minerals were bagged to begin their journey from Pasali to the global supply chain. A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. When the AP visited, they did 22 kilograms (about 48.5 pounds) in one hour. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them. They said it is enough money to cover meals at the children’s homes. In Juliet's group, only she and a 5-year-old boy named Zakaria Danladi had ever attended the local elementary school. Zakaria stopped when he was orphaned. Juliet was pulled out because her family couldn't afford to send both her and her 11-year-old brother, and his education took precedence, her mother said. Basic education is supposed to be free in Nigeria, at least in government schools like the one in Pasali. But hidden fees often put it out of reach of the poorest families. For example, in Pasali, a Parent-Teacher Association levy of 5,000 Naira (about $3) is charged per term, parents said. For Juliet’s family and others, even this amount is too much. About 63% of Nigeria's population lives in poverty. Sule Dantini, the schoolmaster, said his classes have become virtually empty with only three pupils turning up when he spoke with AP in early December. 'I used to have up to 300 pupils, but attendance has been very poor because of mining.' He denied the school charges fees. Miners say they have no trouble finding buyers Nigeria is Africa’s top oil producer, but it also has deep mineral resources including granite, limestone, and gold, and it's seeking to tap those to reduce its reliance on petroleum exports. Yet much of this wealth — including lithium — is siphoned off through unlicensed mines that cost the nation billions of dollars and drive insecurity, according to a parliamentary probe this year. The illegal mining thrives on informal networks of buyers and sellers who operate without much fear of the government. Aliyu Ibrahim, a lithium merchant in Nasarawa, owns unlicensed mines and also buys lithium ore from other illegal sites. At his warehouse, he told AP that his business flourishes by paying officials to look the other way. Ibrahim said he then sells his lithium in bulk to Chinese companies. Ibrahim said he knows that children are working at his mines and others he buys from, but he said many of the children are orphans or poor. 'It is dangerous, but the work helps them survive, while the government has abandoned poor people,' he said. Some of the bush miners avoid middlemen like Ibrahim and sell directly to Chinese companies or Chinese nationals. AP accompanied miners from Pasali illegal mines to Chinese-owned RSIN Nigeria Limited, where a sales agreement was reached without questions about the source of the minerals or the conditions under which they were extracted. Sellers were asked to leave samples to test for lithium content. A price list from the buyers offered 200,000 naira (about $119) for a metric ton of minerals containing up to 3% lithium. China's citizens and companies are frequently in the spotlight for environmentally damaging practices, exploitative labor and illicit mining in several countries. Nigeria has seen multiple cases of illegal mining arrests and prosecutions involving Chinese nationals in recent months. Experts say the materials are exported in a variety of ways, including shipping with false documentation or concealment within legitimate shipments. The Chinese embassy's statement to AP said its government has a zero-tolerance policy toward any illegal mining activity or illegal labor by Chinese companies operating abroad. Philip Jakpor, a Nigerian activist, said his nonprofit Renevlyn Development Initiative has documented widespread child labor practices across Nasarawa state. 'Revenue generation seems to have trumped the need to protect human rights,' Jakpor said. 'We expect those operating in the upper spheres of the supply chain to adopt responsible models that prevent abusive conditions in mineral extraction.' Juliane Kippenberg, associate director of children’s rights at Human Rights Watch, said global demand for lithium is expected to grow rapidly in coming years and it's imperative for governments to protect human rights and press corporations to do the same. Segun Tomori, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mining and Solid Minerals Development, said ongoing reforms such as amending the Minerals and Mining Act are aimed at minimizing the use of child labor. Tomori also said social safety programs such as school feeding initiatives are being revamped to keep children in school and combat child labor. He also cited the program to add mining marshals announced this year to clamp down on illegal mining. Abigail Samaniya, 6-year-old Juliet's mother, said she hopes her daughter will someday escape the mine. 'I still want her to go to school, have a better life, work in an office, not a mine forever,' she said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Papua New Guinea gains a team in Australian rugby league in diplomatic push aimed at curbing China	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Papua New Guinea will gain its own team in Australia’s rugby league in a soft diplomacy deal announced Thursday linked to limiting Chinese influence in the South Pacific. The Australian government will spend 600 million Australian dollars ($380 million) over a decade to add a team from its nearest neighbor to the National Rugby League from 2028. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his Papua New Guinea counterpart James Marape announced the deal at a Sydney news conference. They also announced that a bilateral security deal struck a year ago had officially come into force. China has pursued its own bilateral security pact on policing with Papua New Guinea and with other South Pacific island nations which U.S. allies including Australia fear could undermine regional security. Rugby league is the most popular sport in Papua New Guinea, a poor population of 12 million mostly subsistence farmers that is racked by tribal violence, worsening violent crime and civil unrest. Marape said the security deal with Australia 'fits in neatly' with ensuring the safety of players and officials who would be based in the capital Port Moresby. 'The player is safe when we have good rapport between our two police' forces, Marape told reporters. The prime ministers said in a joint statement the security agreement 'ensures consultation on security-related developments.' Albanese did not directly answer when asked by a reporter if the agreement would prevent Papua New Guinea from striking a security deal with China. 'Security in Pacific is primarily the responsibility of the Pacific family is a principle that we share,' Albanese said. Marape said the security pact with Australia was in his country’s interests. 'Australia is a security partner of choice in the first instance,' Marape said. 'That doesn’t stop us from relating with any nation, especially our Asian neighbors. We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner, a great bilateral partner, but on security, closer to home we have this synergy and our shared territory needs to be protected, defended, policed,' Marape added. Marape described the deal to create a Port Moresby-based football team as 'pivotal in ... anchoring' the Papua New Guinea-Australia relationship. 'At the heart of every foreign relationship lies people-to-people relations. Foreign relations minus people-to-people relations is completely in vain,' Marape said. The security pact signed by Albanese and Marape a year ago strengthened Australia’s place as the preferred security partner. It was signed six months later than initially planned. The original June 2023, date was abandoned after a security deal struck between the United States and Marape’s government sparked protests in the South Pacific nation a month earlier over concerns that it undermined Papua New Guinea’s sovereignty. Australia agreed to support Papua New Guinea’s internal security in areas of policing, courts and prisons. Australia has also helped Papua New Guinea build a new police training center in the Port Moresby that will be open to recruits from other Pacific nations.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-papua-new-guinea-china-rugby-league-37f7e5f4203bc05cbe5485e20d66f4a6	2024-12-11T17:34:58-08:00	
South Korea's Yoon defends martial law as an act of governance and vows to 'fight to the end'	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol defended his martial law decree as an act of governance and denied rebellion charges, vowing Thursday to 'fight to the end' in the face of attempts to impeach him and intensifying investigations into last week’s dramatic move. He spoke hours before the main opposition Democratic Party submits a new impeachment motion against him for a floor vote this weekend. Parliament on Thursday afternoon passed motions to impeach national police chief Cho Ji Ho and Justice Minister Park Sung Jae, suspending them from official duties, over their enforcement of martial law. Yoon’s Dec. 3 martial law declaration has generated political chaos and large protests calling for his ouster. The decree brought hundreds of armed troops attempting to encircle parliament and raid the election commission, though no major violence or injuries occurred. Martial law lasted only six hours as Yoon was forced to lift it after the National Assembly unanimously voted it down. Yoon, a conservative, said he enacted martial law as a warning to the liberal Democratic Party, which controls parliament. He called the party 'a monster' and 'anti-state forces' that he said tried to use its legislative muscle to impeach top officials, undermined the government’s budget bill for next year and sympathized with North Korea. 'I will fight to the end to prevent the forces and criminal groups that have been responsible for paralyzing the country’s government and disrupting the nation’s constitutional order from threatening the future of the Republic of Korea,' Yoon said. 'The opposition is now doing a sword dance of chaos, claiming that the declaration of martial law constitutes to an act of rebellion. But was it really?' he said. Yoon said martial law was an act of governance that cannot be the subject of investigations and doesn’t amount to rebellion. He said the deployment of nearly 300 soldiers to the National Assembly was designed to maintain order, not dissolve or paralyze it. The Democratic Party quickly dismissed Yoon’s statement as 'an expression of extreme delusion' and 'a declaration of war against the people.' Kim Min-seok, head of a party task force, accused the president of attempting to incite pro-Yoon riots by far-right forces. He said the Democratic Party will focus on getting the motion impeaching Yoon passed on Saturday. It's unclear how Yoon's comments will affect his fate. Opposition parties hold 192 seats combined, eight votes short of a two-thirds majority of the 300 members of the National Assembly. The earlier attempt to impeach Yoon failed with most lawmakers from Yoon’s governing People Power Party boycotting the vote. Yoon's speech was expected to deepen a divide inside the PPP. When party chair Han Dong-hun, a critic of Yoon, called Yoon's statement 'a confession of rebellion' during a party meeting, Yoon loyalists angrily jeered and called on Han to stop speaking. Han has urged party members to vote in favor of Yoon's impeachment. Opposition parties and even some PPP members say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. South Korean law allows the president to declare martial law during wartime or similar emergencies, and they said such a situation did not exist. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the constitution doesn’t give a president such rights in any situation. The country's law enforcement authorities are investigating whether Yoon and others involved in imposing martial law committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes. A conviction for rebellion carries a maximum penalty of death. The National Assembly on Thursday passed a bill that could introduce an independent counsel to investigate Yoon on rebellion charges without his approval. A bill it endorsed earlier this week on appointing an independent counsel requires Yoon's approval. The Justice Ministry on Monday placed an oversea travel ban on Yoon. South Korean law gives a president immunity from prosecution while in office, except for allegations of rebellion or treason. This means that Yoon can be questioned and detained by investigative agencies over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. On Wednesday, Yoon’s presidential security service didn't allow police to search the presidential office. Yoon's statement was seen as an about-face. Last Saturday, he apologized over declaring martial law and said he wouldn't avoid responsibility for it. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the political turmoil, 'including matters related to my term in office.' On Wednesday, Yoon's former defense minister, Kim Yong Hyun, was arrested on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. The national police chief, Cho, and the head of Seoul's metropolitan police have been detained while their actions of sending police forces to the National Assembly are investigated as a criminal matter. Park, the impeached justice minister, has faced suspicions raised by the opposition that he was involved in the planning and execution of Yoon’s martial law decree. Park has denied the accusations. Kim, who resigned after martial law was lifted, is one of Yoon’s close associates. He has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. He tried to kill himself in detention, but correctional officers stopped him and he was in stable condition, according to the Justice Ministry. In his speech Thursday, Yoon said he had discussed imposing martial law only with Kim before he informed other top officials about it at a Cabinet meeting just before its declaration. On the night of Dec. 3, besides the National Assembly, Yoon and Kim sent troops to the National Election Commission. That raised speculation that he might have tried to seize computer servers at the commission as he believed unfounded rumors that the results of April's parliamentary elections, in which his party suffered steep losses, were rigged. Yoon said he asked Kim to examine the supposed vulnerabilities of the commission's computer systems, which Yoon said was hampering the credibility of election results. He accused the commission of resisting a thorough inspection by Seoul’s spy agency following a cyberattack attributed to North Korea-backed hackers last year. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to remove him from office or restore his powers. If he is dismissed, a new presidential election would be required within 60 days.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-76af91dfc6a252a536ee1d80c0bdfccd	2024-12-11T16:01:49-08:00	
Slovakia's parliament passes legislation that could ban doctors from protesting low pay	BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) — Slovakia’s parliament on Wednesday approved legislation drafted by the government of populist Prime Minister Robert Fico that could effectively ban doctors from protesting against low pay and force them to continue working. Lawmakers in the 150-seat National Council voted 74-70 in favor of the law, which came in response to a mass resignation threat by more than 3,000 doctors from the nation's hospitals, who said they would quit their jobs at the beginning of next year. The law gives the government the power to declare an emergency in the case health care might not be available. Doctors would be then obliged to work because their notices to leave the job would not be accepted. Refusal to do so could result in imprisonment. The measure is intended to prevent a collapse of the health care system. The emergency measures can last for up to 120 days. Health Minister Kamil Šaško said during the parliamentary debate that he hoped that 'he’ll never be forced to use the tool,' which is strongly opposed by the labor unions representing the doctors. The doctors protested that the government had not discussed with them the cuts to a 2022 plan aimed at increasing their salaries in the next two years. The cuts are part of austerity measures approved by the government to keep the ballooning budget deficit under control.	https://apnews.com/article/slovakia-health-care-hospital-doctors-protest-6c9b0add3a1a9699c1aa7f8b69f4df6c	2024-12-11T12:52:15-08:00	
UN General Assembly demands ceasefire in Gaza and backs UN agency helping Palestinian refugees	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban. The votes in the 193-nation world body were 158-9, with 13 abstentions to demand a ceasefire now and 159-9 with 11 abstentions in support of the agency known as UNRWA. The votes culminated two days of speeches overwhelmingly calling for an end to the 14-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group. Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions. While Security Council resolutions are legally binding, General Assembly resolutions are not, though they do reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly. The Palestinians and their supporters went to the General Assembly after the U.S. vetoed a Security Council resolution on Nov. 20 demanding an immediate Gaza ceasefire. It was supported by the council’s 14 other members but the U.S. objected that it was not linked to an immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas militants during their attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war. The language of the resolution adopted by the assembly is the same as the text of the vetoed resolution, demanding 'an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire to be respected by all parties,' while also reiterating a 'demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' The second resolution backs the mandate of UNRWA, which was established by the General Assembly in 1949. It deplores laws adopted by Israel’s parliament on Oct. 28 banning UNRWA’s activities in the Palestinian territories, a measure to take effect in 90 days. And it reiterates U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ statements that UNRWA is 'the backbone' of all humanitarian operations in Gaza and no organization can replace it. Israel alleges that around a dozen of UNRWA’s 13,000 workers in Gaza participated in Hamas’ attacks on Israel that precipitated the war. It recently provided the U.N. with over 100 names of UNRWA staff it accuses of having militant ties. The resolution adopted Wednesday calls on the Israeli government 'to abide by its international obligations, respect the privileges and immunities of UNRWA and uphold its responsibility to allow and facilitate full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance in all its forms into and throughout the entire Gaza Strip.' U.S. deputy U.N. ambassador Robert Wood reiterated America’s opposition to the ceasefire resolution ahead of Wednesday’s vote and criticized the Palestinians for again failing to mention Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. 'At a time when Hamas is feeling isolated due to the ceasefire in Lebanon, the draft resolution on a ceasefire in Gaza risks sending a dangerous message to Hamas that there’s no need to negotiate or release the hostages,' he said. The Hamas attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw another 250 abducted as hostages. Gaza militants have not returned around 100 hostages, a third of them believed to be dead, and ceasefire efforts have ground to a halt. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the local Health Ministry. It says women and children make up more than half the dead but does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Wood said the U.S. will continue to seek a diplomatic solution to the war and called UNRWA 'a critical lifeline to the Palestinian people.' But he said the UNRWA resolution has 'serious flaws' because it fails to create a path to restore trust between the U.N. agency and Israel — despite U.S. efforts and a U.S. proposal. Just before the vote, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon accused the resolutions’ supporters of complicity with Hamas, which he said has 'hopelessly infiltrated' UNRWA, and denounced their failure to link a ceasefire to the release of the hostages. 'By demanding a ceasefire today without addressing the hostages, this assembly will once again side with those who weaponize human suffering,' Danon said. 'It will send a message that the lives of innocent Israelis, including children, are not worth your consideration.' 'This is not diplomacy,' he stressed. 'It is appeasement. It is enabling terror and abandoning the innocent.' At the opening of the assembly debate last Wednesday, the Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour accused Israel of mass killings, displacements, destruction and starvation — 'a cruel war of atrocities against an entire civilian population.' Mansour said the only way to stop the atrocities, free the hostages, 'and to preserve the hope of a different future' is an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and support humanitarian efforts and prevent Israel’s attempt to eliminate UNRWA. Slovenia’s U.N. Ambassador Samuel Žbogar, reflecting the views of many speakers, pointed to the tens of thousands killed in Gaza. 'Gaza doesn’t exist anymore,' he told the assembly Wednesday. 'It is destroyed. Civilians are facing hunger, despair and death.'	https://apnews.com/article/un-gaza-unrwa-palestinians-israel-resolutions-vote-2df5701e79b9678104e60a99b17d2f7a	2024-12-11T11:32:15-08:00	
The Trump and Biden teams insist they're working hand in glove on foreign crises	WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump doesn't think much of Joe Biden's foreign policy record. The Republican president-elect frequently casts the outgoing Democratic president as a feckless leader who shredded American credibility around the world during his four-year term. But a funny thing happened on Trump's way back to the White House: The Biden and Trump national security teams have come to an understanding that they have no choice but to work together as conflicts in Gaza, Syria and Ukraine have left a significant swath of the world on a knife's edge. It's not clear how much common ground those teams have found as they navigate crises that threaten to cause more global upheaval as Trump prepares to settle back into the White House on Jan. 20, 2025. 'There is a deep conviction on the part of the incoming national security team that we are dealing with ... and on our part, directed from President Biden, that it is our job, on behalf of the American people, to make sure this is a smooth transition,' Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during a weekend appearance at a forum in California. 'And we are committed to discharging that duty as relentlessly and faithfully as we possibly can.' To be certain, Trump and his allies haven't let up on their criticism of Biden, putting the blame squarely on the shoulders of Biden and Democrats for the series of crises around the globe. The president-elect says Biden is responsible for the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, arguing that policies under his watch led to Hamas and Russia becoming emboldened. And shortly before Syria's Bashar al-Assad's government collapsed last week, Trump blamed Biden's old boss, former President Barack Obama, for failing to enforce his own 'red line' in 2013 after Assad deployed chemical weapons that killed hundreds of civilians, and laying the groundwork for Islamic militants to establish a beachhead in the country. But amid the hectoring of Biden, Trump team officials acknowledge that the Biden White House has worked diligently to keep Trump's circle apprised and help ensure there is a smooth handoff on national security matters. 'For our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity that they can play one administration off the other, they’re wrong, and we are — we are hand in glove,' Mike Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said in a Fox News interview last month. 'We are one team with the United States in this transition.' While Trump rarely has a good word for the Democratic administration, there's an appreciation in Trump world of how the Biden White House has gone about sharing critical national security information, according to a Trump transition official who was not authorized to comment publicly. The coordination is precisely how lawmakers intended for incoming and outgoing administrations to conduct themselves during a handover when they bolstered federal support for transitions. It's already the most substantive handoff process since 2009, aides to Biden and Trump acknowledged, surpassing Trump's chaotic first takeover in 2017 and his wide refusal to cooperate with the incoming Biden team in 2021. Trump's pick to serve as special envoy to the Middle East, Florida real estate developer Steve Witkoff, consulted with Biden administration officials as he recently traveled to Mideast to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive talks and spoke on condition of anonymity. Sullivan, who was to travel to Israel on Wednesday for talks with Netanyahu, has in turn kept Waltz in the loop about the Biden administration's efforts at getting a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza before Trump's inauguration. Biden administration officials say that the two national security teams have also closely coordinated on Ukraine and Syria, though they have provided scant detail on what that coordination has looked like. 'Let me put it this way: Nothing that we’re doing and nothing that we’re saying are coming as a surprise to the incoming team,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. 'They will decide for themselves what policies they might want to keep in place, what approaches they might want to continue and which ones they won’t.' Trump made clear during his campaign that he would move to end the war in Ukraine quickly once he came to office. He called on Russian leader Vladimir Putin earlier this week to act to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine. But the Biden White House has begun gently — and publicly — making the case for how continued support for Ukraine lines up with Trump's priorities. On Saturday, Sullivan pointed to comments made by Trump on social media to buttress the case that Biden’s push for continued support of Ukraine falls in line with the incoming president’s thinking. Trump earlier that day had noted that Assad’s rule was collapsing because Russia 'lost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine, where close to 600,000 Russian soldiers lay wounded or dead, in a war that should never have started, and could go on forever.' 'Russia and Iran are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success,' Trump said in the posting on Truth Social. Sullivan underscored that Biden and Trump are in agreement that there should be no American boots on the ground in Syria and that the war in Ukraine was a major factor in Assad’s fall. 'I was a little bit struck by it — earlier in the post, he said part of the reason this is happening is because of Russia’s war against Ukraine,' Sullivan said of Trump. 'And I think he even referenced the sheer scale of the casualties that Russia has suffered in Ukraine, and for that reason, they’re not in a position to defend their client, Assad. And on that point, we’re in vigorous agreement.' Two days later in Washington, Sullivan made the case that Trump should bolster the little-known U.S. International Development Finance Corporation that was created during the Republican’s first term. The push for reauthorizing the foreign aid agency comes as Trump has promised to make massive cuts to the federal bureaucracy. Trump signed into law the agency's authority -- tucked into a five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration — to provide $60 billion in loans, loan guarantees and insurance to companies in developing nations. Sullivan called the agency an effective tool for private-public partnerships, before allowing that 'maybe I shouldn’t be the one' making the case 'since I’m leaving, but I will give my advice anyway.' 'It was created as we’ve all noted, under the Trump administration,' Sullivan said in remarks at the agency’s annual conference. 'It has been strengthened under the Biden administration. And as we look to DFC reauthorization next year, it has to remain a bipartisan priority.' After Assad's government fell, the Biden administration issued a warning to Iran not to speed up its nuclear program after one of its closest allies was toppled, declaring 'that’ll never happen on our watch.' The U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, hinted at coordination on the matter with the Trump team. The official said there had been 'good discussions' with the incoming administration on the matter and there was an expectation the same policy would carry over. Biden has also approved a new national security memorandum that is meant to serve as a road map for the incoming Trump administration as it looks to counter growing cooperation between China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House announced Wednesday. Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it will go about dealing with the tightening relationships between the United States’ most prominent adversaries and competitors, according to two other senior administration officials. One of those officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, sought to assure the incoming Trump team that the Biden White House effort 'isn't trying to box them in or tilt them toward one policy option or another.' Instead, the official said, it's about helping the next administration build 'capacity' as it shapes its policies on some the most difficult foreign policies it will face.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-foreign-policy-ukraine-syria-mideast-d9bdefb745fc3a54b9f32e8e690bf04c	2024-12-11T09:22:44-08:00	
Vatican's keffiyeh Nativity scene raises eyebrows and then disappears — at least until Christmas Eve	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis presided over his weekly general audience Wednesday alongside a Palestinian-crafted Nativity scene that was missing its eyebrow-raising signature element: a keffiyeh-draped manger holding the infant Jesus. The wooden Nativity scene in the Vatican’s main audience hall had generated headlines when it was unveiled Dec. 7 because of the presence of the keffiyeh, the black-and-white checkered headscarf that has become a potent symbol of the Palestinian cause. Pope Francis had prayed before the creche briefly that day when he greeted the artists and donors responsible for all the Vatican’s Christmas decorations this year, which include various depictions of the manger in a Bethlehem stable where Jesus is said to have been born. This year, the Nativity scenes were made by Bethlehem-based artisans. Representatives of the Palestinian Embassy to the Holy See, as well as special representatives of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, had been on hand at the Vatican that day for the unveiling. By Wednesday, when Francis was seen again in the audience hall, the keffiyeh, manger and infant Jesus had been removed from the Nativity scene, while the figures of parents Mary and Joseph remained. While it is tradition in the Vatican for the infant Jesus to only be placed in the manger on Dec. 24, when Catholics celebrate the birth of Jesus, often the mangers remain in the scenes empty until that date. The Christ figure had apparently been placed in the manger on Dec. 7 to show off the finished product while the donors, artisans and pope were there to see it. A Palestinian official said the Vatican had removed the keffiyeh without explanation, and it was unclear whether it would be restored on Dec. 24. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA, in its report on the unveiling, noted the significance of the Jesus figure being wrapped in a keffiyeh. During the encounter with the Christmas donors, Francis again referred to the 'martyred Palestine' and, noting the broader conflict, repeated his call for an end to war. The Holy Land, including Bethlehem, is home to a small Christian community. 'Let us remember the brothers and sisters who, instead, right there and in other parts of the world, are suffering from the tragedy of war,' he said. 'With tears in our eyes, let us raise our prayer for peace. Brothers and sisters, enough war, enough violence!' Francis has called for Hamas to release hostages taken from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but he has long been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. He recently caused an uproar when he called for an investigation to determine if Israel's attacks in Gaza constituted genocide. Two Palestinian children presented the pope with a 'Bethlehem Star' award, which WAFA said was a 'powerful reminder of the suffering and sorrow endured by Palestinian children amid the ongoing Israeli war and blockade in Gaza.' The Israeli Embassy to the Holy See declined to comment on whether it had complained about the keffiyeh creche or asked for it to be removed. Vatican officials merely recalled Vatican tradition that calls for the infant Jesus to only appear in the manger on Christmas Eve. PLO executive committee member Ramzi Khoury who attended the unveiling, expressed deep gratitude for what he said was the pope’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and his tireless efforts to end the war on Gaza and promote justice, WAFA said. Coincidentally, Francis on Thursday is due to meet Abbas, the Palestinian president, at the Vatican. ___ Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Ontario premier says US energy exports will be cut off if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs on Canada	TORONTO (AP) — The premier of Canada's most populous province said Wednesday he will cut off energy to the United States if President-elect Donald Trump imposes sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products. Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. 'We're going to put our list together, and I'm sure the other provinces will as well. But we will go to the full extent, depending on how far this goes. We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy,' Ontario Premier Doug Ford said after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other provincial premiers. Ford said he didn't want this to happen but wasn't optimistic Canada could avoid tariffs. 'This fight is 100% coming on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21,' he said, referencing to the date of Trump’s inauguration. 'We will use every tool in our tool box to fight back. We can’t sit back and roll over. We just won’t as a country. And isn’t this a shame, our closest friends and allies.' About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. It wasn't immediately clear if Ford was talking about all Canadian provinces cutting off energy exports to the U.S. or just his province. But a spokeswoman for Ford, Grace Lee, said it was raised in the call between Trudeau and the provincial premiers. 'Premier Ford can only speak on behalf of Ontario, but its an area of provincial jurisdiction that we would certainly look at,' Lee said in an email. Lee noted Ontario powered 1.5 million homes in the U.S. in 2023 and is a major exporter of electricity to Michigan, Minnesota and New York. Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the threat. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing for national security. 'Canada, of course, will respond to unjustified tariffs,' Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said after the meeting. Freeland said a number of provincial premiers voiced support for a robust response to the tariffs and said that included critical minerals that are exported to the U.S. She didn't specifically mention oil but said 'obviously other ideas were discussed as well' when asked if Canada is considering cutting off oil exports to America. About a third of Canada's trade to the U.S. is energy. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US $2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Canada has promised more border security spending to address Trump's concerns. Ford said that will include more border and police officers as well as drones and sniffer dogs. 'A priority will be to share details of this plan with the incoming Trump administration and with Canadians in the coming days,' Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said. Trudeau said this week tariffs would be 'absolutely devastating' for the Canadian economy, but it would also mean real hardship for Americans. Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods. The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington-based trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate. Canada imposed duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canada’s central bank, meanwhile, lowered its key interest rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday and called Trump’s threat to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada 'a major source of new uncertainty.' 'We did underline that the threat of new tariffs on Canadian exports, particularly at the level suggested, that is a major source of new uncertainty,' Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem said at a press conference. 'But the reality is we don't know if those tariffs are going to be implemented. 'We don't know if exemptions are going to be agreed on some parts, we don't know at what level, we don't know if Canada will take retaliatory measures.' Trudeau, meanwhile, got the attention of billionaire Elon Musk, a big supporter of Trump, with comments he made Tuesday lamenting that U.S. voters selected Trump over Kamala Harris as president. 'We were supposed to be on a steady if difficult sometimes march toward progress. And yet, just a few weeks ago, the United States voted for a second time to not elect its first woman president,' Trudeau said at a event sponsored by Equal Voice, an organization dedicated to improving gender representation in Canadian politics. 'Everywhere, women’s rights and women’s progress is under attack — overtly and subtly.' Musk called Trudeau 'insufferable' in a post on X. 'Won't be in power for much longer,' he wrote. Ford also criticized Trudeau for the remarks. 'They are not helpful at all. It was brought up a couple of times in our meeting,' Ford said. 'Donald Trump was elected democratically. If you like him or you don’t like him that’s not our issue. We elect Canadians and it was not helpful whatsoever. I’m sure the prime minister got the message loud and clear.'	https://apnews.com/article/canada-interest-rate-cut-trump-tariffs-c0ef920ffb02ea0531c93516abad64e0	2024-12-11T09:15:38-08:00	
Syrians flock to morgues looking for loved ones who perished in Assad's prisons	DAMASCUS (AP) — Mohammad Chaeeb spoke softly into his phone, telling a relative the grim news: He found his brother at the morgue. 'I saw him and said my goodbyes,' he said. His gaze lingered on the blackened body of Sami Chaeeb, whose teeth were bared and whose eye sockets were empty. It looked as if he had died screaming. 'He doesn’t look normal. He doesn’t even have eyes.' The dead man was jailed five months ago, disappearing into a dark prison system under the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. His body is just one of many found in Syrian detention centers and prisons since Assad's government fell last weekend. Some of the prisoners died just weeks ago. Others perished months earlier. Syrians across the world are now circulating images of the bodies in hope of seeing slain loved ones whose fate had been a mystery. At the morgue visited by The Associated Press on Wednesday in Damascus, families flocked to a wall where some of the pictures were pinned in a haunting gallery of the dead. Relatives desperately scanned the images for a recognizable face. Mohammad Chaeeb never knew why his brother had been imprisoned. 'We heard stories — cannabis, organ trafficking, drugs, weapon trading. But he had nothing to do with any of that,' he said. He rushed to the morgue after another brother living in Turkey sent him a photo of a body that looked familiar. He was able to identify his brother by a mole under his ear and a half-amputated finger, an injury from when he was 12. Standing over the body, he lifted the drape and gently pulled out his brother’s left hand, examining it closely. 'Here,' he said, pointing to the stump. Nearby, forensic workers worked rapidly to identify the bodies and hand them over to relatives. Yasser Qasser, a forensic assistant at the morgue, said they received 40 bodies that morning from the hospital that were being fingerprinted and having DNA samples taken. The staff had already identified about eight, he said. 'But dozens of families are arriving, and the numbers don’t match.' Some bodies came from the notorious Saydnaya Prison, still dressed in prisoner uniforms, Qasser said. His colleague, Dr. Abdallah Youssef, said identifying all of them would take time. 'We understand the suffering of the families, but we are working under immense pressure. The bodies were found in salt rooms, exposed to extreme cold,' he said. Morgue officials who examined the corpses have seen bullet wounds and marks that appeared to be the result of torture, he added. An estimated 150,000 people have been detained or reported missing in Syria since 2011. Under Assad’s rule, any whiff of dissent could send someone to prison immediately. For years, it was a sentence akin to death, as few ever emerged from the system. Citing testimony from freed prisoners and prison officials, Amnesty International has reported that thousands of Syrians were killed in frequent mass executions. Prisoners were subjected to constant torture, intense beatings and rape. Inmates frequently died from injuries, disease or starvation. Some fell into psychosis and starved themselves, the human rights group said. Among the bodies at the morgue Wednesday was Mazen al-Hamada, a Syrian activist who fled to Europe but returned to Syria in 2020 and was imprisoned upon arrival. His mangled corpse was found wrapped in a bloody sheet in Saydnaya. As they searched the morgue, some families moved among the bodies, weeping quietly and pausing to look for familiar features. The bodies lay covered in white shrouds, each marked with a number and some bearing the label 'unknown.' Hilala Meryeh, a 64-year-old Palestinian mother of four, stood in the dingy identification room, bags of bodies all around her. She had just found one of her sons. She paused, screwed her eyes closed and turned her face toward the ceiling, murmuring a prayer. Her four boys were arrested by the former Syrian regime in 2013 during a crackdown on the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk. She still needed to find three. 'I don’t know where they are,' she said. 'Give me my children, search for my children!' 'Why did he do this to his people?' Meryeh cried out. 'Imprison them, we wouldn’t have objected. Try them, but to slaughter them?' Other Syrians, like Imad Habbal, stood motionless in the morgue, coming to grips with the reality and injustice of their loss. Habbal gazed at the body of his brother, Diaa Habbal. 'We came yesterday, and we found him dead,' he said. 'They killed him. Why? What was his crime? What did he ever do to them? Just because he came back to his country?' Diaa Habbal, a Syrian who had been living in Saudi Arabia since 2003, returned to Damascus in mid-2024 to visit his family, his brother said. He was arrested by the Syrian military police six months ago on charges of evading military service. With trembling hands, Imad Habbal lifted the covering, his voice breaking as he wept and spoke to his brother. 'I told you not to come,' he said. 'I wish you didn’t come.' ___ Associated Press writers Julia Frankel in Jerusalem and Sally Abou AlJoud in Beirut contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-rebels-assad-morgues-death-c64f6f4f3e03e7d063dc90f03ccd4c4b	2024-12-11T09:01:52-08:00	
America's closest ally in Syria is losing ground as a new order takes shape	The jihadi rebels who toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad say they want to build a unified, inclusive country. But after nearly 14 years of civil war, putting that ideal into practice will not be easy. For Syria’s Kurdish minority, America’s closest ally in the country, the struggle for a new order is entering a potentially even more challenging phase. Over the course of Syria’s civil war, Kurdish fighters have fended off an array of armed factions, partnered with the U.S. to rout the Islamic State group and carved out a largely autonomous region in the country’s oil-rich east. But the gains of the non-Arab Kurds are now at risk. The ascendance of the Sunni Arab rebels who overthrew Assad — with vital help from Turkey, a longtime foe of the Kurds — will make it hard for the Kurds to find a place in the new Syria and could prolong the conflict. The jihadi rebels who rode into Damascus over the weekend have made peaceful overtures to the Kurds. But the rebels violently drove Kurdish fighters out of the eastern city of Deir al-Zour days after government forces abandoned it. To the north, a separate opposition faction backed by Turkey that has been battling the Kurds for years seized the town of Manbij. And Turkey carried out airstrikes on a Kurdish convoy it said was carrying heavy weapons looted from government arsenals. The Kurds have long counted on U.S. aid in the face of such challenges. Around 900 American troops are in eastern Syria, where they partner with Kurdish forces to prevent an Islamic State resurgence. But the future of that mission will be thrown into doubt under president-elect Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical about U.S. involvement in Syria. Here's a closer look at the predicament the Kurds find themselves in. Who are the U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters in Syria? The Kurds are among the largest stateless ethnic groups in the world, with some 30 million concentrated in a territory straddling Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. They are a minority in each country and have often suffered persecution, which has fueled armed Kurdish uprisings. In Syria, they carved out an autonomous enclave early in the civil war, never fully siding with the Assad government or the rebels seeking to topple him. When the Islamic State group seized a third of the country in 2014, Kurdish fighters — who are secular and include women in their ranks — proved their mettle in early battles against the extremists, earning support from the U.S.-led coalition. They formed a group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, which also includes Arab fighters, and drove the Islamic State group out of large areas of Syria with help from U.S.-led airstrikes and American special forces. In 2017, these Kurdish-led forces captured Raqqa, the capital of the extremists' self-styled caliphate. Why is Turkey fighting the Kurds? Turkey has long viewed the SDF as an extension of the decades-old Kurdish insurgency within its own borders. It considers the main Kurdish faction a terrorist group on par with the Islamic State and has said it should have no presence in the new Syria. In recent years, Turkey has trained and funded fighters known as the Syrian National Army, helping them wrest control of territory from the Kurds in northern Syria along the border with Turkey. These Turkish-backed fighters have portrayed themselves as part of the opposition against Assad, but analysts say they are largely driven by opportunism and hatred of the Kurds. The Kurds have focused on battling the SNA in recent years. But the new leadership in Damascus, which also has longstanding ties to Turkey, could open another, much longer front. How do the Syrian rebels view the Kurds? The main rebel faction is led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, a former al-Qaida militant who cut ties with the group eight years ago and says he wants to build a new Syria free of dictatorship that will serve all its religious and ethnic communities. Nawaf Khalil, head of the Germany-based Center for Kurdish Studies, said the early signs were positive. He said the rebels steered clear of two SDF-controlled enclaves of Aleppo when they stormed the city two weeks ago at the start of their rapid advance across the country. 'It is also positive that they did not speak negatively about the Syrian Democratic Forces,' he said. It remains to be seen if those sentiments will endure. After sweeping into Deir al-Zour this week, a fighter from al-Sharaa's group posted a video saying they would soon advance toward Raqqa and other areas of eastern Syria, raising the possibility of further clashes with the Kurds. The rebels could still seek some kind of agreement with the Kurds to incorporate them into the post-Assad political order, but that would likely require accepting a degree of Kurdish autonomy in the east. It would also risk angering Turkey, which now appears to be the chief power broker in Syria. Will the Trump administration support the Kurds? The top U.S. military commander for the Middle East, Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, met with SDF forces in Syria on Tuesday, in a sign of the Biden administration's commitment to the alliance post-Assad. But things could change on Jan. 20. Trump has provided few details about his Middle East policy, aside from saying he wants to end the region's wars and keep the United States out of them. In a social media post shortly before Assad was overthrown, Trump wrote that 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, &amp; THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT.' During his previous term, in 2019, Trump abandoned the Kurds ahead of a Turkish incursion, casting it as the fulfillment of a campaign promise to end U.S. involvement in the region's 'endless wars.' The move prompted heavy criticism, including from prominent Republicans who accused him of betraying an ally. Trump backtracked weeks later, approving a wider mission to secure oil fields in the east. The troops remained where they were and the alliance endured. ___ Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed. ___ Follow the AP's Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-war-assad-kurds-rebels-turkey-us-2b4af609c4dcf853ac6d7a22d3dccf5d	2024-12-11T07:50:01-08:00	
Brazil’s President Lula to undergo a new surgery after initial procedure for brain bleed	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will undergo another surgery, doctors at the Sirio-Libanes hospital where the leftist leader is being treated said Wednesday. The minimally invasive procedure that doctors will perform on Lula is called middle meningeal artery embolization and aims to stop persistent bleeding on the surface of the brain, according to the University of California San Francisco’s definition. On Tuesday, the 79-year-old leader underwent surgery for a brain bleed after suffering complications resulting from a fall at home in October. Doctors told journalists after the operation that Lula would remain in intensive care for 48 hours. But doctors on Wednesday said he would undergo another surgery on Thursday. Lula 'spent the day well,' doctors said in their updated statement. 'He underwent physiotherapy, walked and received visits from family members,' they added. Lula remains in intensive care. In an earlier statement on Wednesday, doctors said the Brazilian president was lucid and had his bearings, and that he remained hooked up to a surgical drain as he awaits further routine tests. After the first surgery, doctors had said that there would be no aftereffects and that Lula was expected to return to the capital, Brasilia, at the beginning of next week. Until then, they said, he would be unable to work. Doctors will hold a press conference at 10 a.m. local time on Thursday to provide further updates, they said. Lula canceled a trip to Russia for a BRICS summit after the accident, his office said at the time. It left him with a visible cut on the back of his head, slightly above his neck. Fagnislainny Fernandes, a 40-year-old visual artist, said she went to the hospital 'out of compassion' for Lula. 'This country, unfortunately, has a lot of misinformation and so I came personally to find out if this situation is really happening,' she said. ___ AP videojournalists Thiago Mostazo and Maycron Abade contributed to this report. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-health-surgery-5331cb91a03e0880c10dae81ed643cc6	2024-12-11T07:24:52-08:00	
Macron seeks political deal to name a new prime minister and restore France's stability	PARIS (AP) — French president Emmanuel Macron is seeking a political deal that would allow him to both name a new prime minister and 'guarantee the stability of the country,' following the resignation of ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier, a spokesperson for the outgoing government said Wednesday. Maud Bregeon, the spokesperson, said Macron insisted there was at the moment no 'broader' political alliance than the current one between his centrist allies and conservatives from The Republicans party, which does not have a majority at parliament. She was relaying comments made by Macron during a weekly Cabinet meeting. Last week, the French president vowed to stay in office until the end of his term, due in 2027. The move followed a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes in the National Assembly left France without a functioning government. Barnier’s government has been tasked with handling current affairs pending the appointment of a new prime minister. Two options are still being considered by Macron, Bregeon reported. The first one would be to find a way to 'broaden the alliance,' she said, implicitly suggesting some leftists could join the government in addition to centrists and conservatives. That could give the future government a majority in the assembly. The other option would be to make a deal with opposition parties on the left so that they commit not to vote any no-confidence motion -- even though they would not be governing parties, Bregeon said. Macron did not provided any firm deadline for naming a new prime minister, she said. Since last week, Macron has held talks with politicians from the left and the right, including Socialist leaders who now appear as key in efforts to form a more stable government. Discussions have not involved the far-right National Rally party led by Marine Le Pen nor the hard-left France Unbowed party of Jean-Luc Mélenchon since Macron said he would only speak with more moderate political forces. Le Pen, who helped ousting Barnier by supporting the no-confidence motion, demanded on Wednesday her party's proposals on preserving the purchasing power of the French to be taken into account by the future government. The next prime minister knows 'what needs to be done to work in decent conditions,' that is 'talk to all political forces and build a budget that doesn't cross the red lines of each party,' Le Pen said. She concluded: 'It's perfectly doable.' On Wednesday, the outgoing government unveiled a special bill meant to enable the state to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year’s rules, and avoid a shutdown. The bill, expected to be approved by parliament by the end of the year, is 'temporary,' outgoing budget minister Laurent Saint-Martin said. 'It aims to ensure ... the continuity of the nation’s life, the regular functioning of public services and the fulfillment of our financial commitments.' A proper budget law for year 2025 will then need to be presented by the new government and approved at parliament in the coming months, Saint-Martin said.	https://apnews.com/article/france-new-prime-minister-macron-barnier-lepen-26d09486d37c741a7c048f09e65f0ca3	2024-12-11T05:35:40-08:00	
North Macedonia court delays language law ruling amid ethnic tensions	SKOPJE. North Macedonia (AP) — North Macedonia’s Constitutional Court on Wednesday postponed a ruling on a controversial law concerning the use of minority languages, triggering a new round of ethnic tensions in the tiny Balkan country. The 2019 law made Albanian a second official language in areas with a significant population of ethnic Albanians. It faces multiple legal challenges regarding its constitutionality, some focused on specific articles and others concerning the entire law. Court officials said the delay will allow further deliberations and input from foreign experts and could take up to three months. Ethnic Albanians make up roughly a quarter of North Macedonia’s 2 million population, in a country slightly larger than the U.S. state of Vermont. Several hundred demonstrators joined a protest outside the court Wednesday organized by the DUI, an ethnic Albanian opposition party. The party warned that any rollback would destabilize the country’s fragile ethnic balance. North Macedonia’s multi-ethnic composition was formalized in the 2001 Ohrid Agreement, which ended a brief ethnic conflict and granted broader rights to ethnic Albanians. The DUI accuses the current conservative government of attempting to undermine those gains. 'Any attempt to repeal parts of the Law on the Use of Languages would be absolutely unacceptable for us,' a DUI statement said. 'Such actions would upend the balance between communities and damage the basic pillars of the Ohrid Agreement.' The law has drawn criticism from both domestic and international observers, including the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe’s advisory body on constitutional matters. In 2019, it noted ambiguities in the law, particularly in its application to judicial proceedings. Critics also argue that it fails to clarify whether certain provisions apply solely to Albanian or to other minority languages, such as Turkish, Roma, and Serbian. Bujar Osmani, the DUI party's deputy leader, said he was concerned by the absence of ethnic minority judges during Wednesday’s session. 'Such mono-ethnic meetings or sessions have always been a harbinger of bad times in multi-ethnic states,' Osmani said. 'This is not just a cause for the Albanian language, but for the protection of a multi-ethnic European Macedonia.' Both the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party and the opposition Social Democrats have condemned the politicization of the issue. Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski accused the DUI of exploiting ethnic tensions for political gain. 'They are again abusing Albanians, Macedonians, and others, harassing everyone with attempts to divide and attract attention,' Mickoski said.	https://apnews.com/article/north-macedonia-minorities-language-albanian-0280605e825d4805749446cb91364b40	2024-12-11T05:34:23-08:00	
Scholz sets Germany on course for an early election as he requests a confidence vote next week	BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Olaf Scholz formally set Germany on course for an early election Wednesday by requesting a confidence vote in parliament next week. Five weeks after his three-party governing coalition collapsed in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany's stagnant economy, Scholz's office said he had requested the confidence vote in parliament's lower house, or Bundestag, for Monday. The aim is to hold a parliamentary election on Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally scheduled. Scholz is expected to lose Monday's vote. His center-left Social Democrats hold 207 seats in the Bundestag and their remaining coalition partners, the environmentalist Greens, have 117. That leaves his government well short of a majority in the 733-seat chamber. The confidence vote is needed because Germany's post-World War II constitution doesn't allow parliament to dissolve itself. If Scholz loses the vote, it's up to President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve the Bundestag. He has 21 days to make that decision, and once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. Polls show Scholz's party trailing behind the main opposition center-right Union bloc of challenger Friedrich Merz. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, whose Greens are further behind, is also bidding for the top job. The far-right Alternative for Germany, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it. Germany hasn't had a confidence vote since 2005, when then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder called and lost one as he engineered an early election that was narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-confidence-vote-parliament-election-0320454ead6b883ce70fff78d09df38a	2024-12-11T04:43:11-08:00	
UK spy agency releases annual Christmas card puzzle to uncover future codebreakers	LONDON (AP) — What does a spy agency give for Christmas? How about a riddle wrapped in an enigma inside a mystery. GCHQ, Britain’s electronic and cyber-intelligence agency, on Wednesday published its annual Christmas Challenge – a seasonal greeting card that doubles as a set of fiendishly difficult puzzles designed to excite young minds about solving cyphers and unearthing clues. The challenge is aimed at young people aged 11 to 18, who are encouraged to work in teams and use 'lateral thinking, ingenuity and perseverance' to crack the seven brainteasers set by GCHQ’s 'in-house puzzlers.' The card is sent by the head of GCHQ — short for Government Communications Headquarters — to other national security chiefs around the world. Puzzles were first included in 2015 and have become an annual tradition. The card can be downloaded from the GCHQ website, and has become popular with teachers – the agency says a third of British secondary schools have downloaded it. The agency admits the festive fun has an ulterior motive. GCHQ Director Anne Keast-Butler said she hoped the card would inspire young people to explore STEM subjects – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – 'and to consider what a career in cybersecurity and intelligence might have to offer.' 'The Challenge has been designed for a mix of minds to solve, so is best tackled in groups of classmates, families or friends,' she said. 'Whether you have an analytical mind, a creative brain or prefer engineering, there’s something for everyone.' The card features a map of the U.K., linked to the locations where GCHQ has bases, including its high-tech headquarters in Cheltenham, western England, nicknamed the doughnut because of its shape. Many British people are keen puzzle-solvers, and the link between puzzlers and spycraft is often celebrated – notably in the many books, films and TV shows about Bletchley Park, a complex of buildings and wooden huts northwest of London where, during World War II, hundreds of mathematicians, cryptologists, crossword puzzle experts and computer pioneers worked to crack Nazi Germany’s secret codes. Historians say their work shortened World War II by as much as two years.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-gchq-spy-agency-christmas-card-puzzle-33ab57e85479141ae18fd8abdef2d00f	2024-12-11T04:35:16-08:00	
Father and stepmother of 10-year-old girl found dead in England are convicted of her murder	LONDON (AP) — The father and stepmother of a 10-year-old girl found dead in her home in England were found guilty Wednesday of her murder. Urfan Sharif, 42, was accused of Sara Sharif’s murder alongside his partner, 30-year-old Beinash Batool. His brother, 29-year-old Faisal Malik, was found guilty of causing or allowing the girl's death. Police found Sara’s body under a blanket in a bunk bed at her home in Woking, southwest of London, on Aug. 10, 2023, with dozens of injuries including extensive bruising, burns and fractures. A post-mortem examination concluded she died of unnatural causes. Prosecutors have said that all three defendants played a part in a 'campaign of abuse' against Sara in the weeks leading to her death. The three fled the U.K. for Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, on Aug. 9, the day after Sara was believed to have died. The discovery was made after Urfan Sharif called U.K. police from Pakistan to say he had 'legally punished her, and she died,' prosecutors said. He told the phone operator it wasn’t his intention to kill her but he had 'beat her up too much,' they said. Police in Pakistan found the three suspects after an extensive search and put them on a flight to the U.K. They were arrested upon arrival at London’s Gatwick Airport. Batool and Malik had declined to give evidence. They denied involvement in the abuse. Prosecutor William Emlyn Jones has said all three defendants lived in the same house as Sara and that it was 'inconceivable' that just one of them had acted alone. He alleged that each of the suspects sought to point the finger at the others. He said Sharif’s case was that Batool, Sara’s stepmother, was responsible for the girl’s death, and he made a false confession to protect her. He said that violence against Sara became so normalized that no one batted an eye when she appeared with bruises at a family barbeque. Yet Sara was feisty and dreamed of being a fairytale princess. Her spirit came across on a video taken just two days before her death showing her dancing at home, despite multiple broken bones and iron burns on her bottom. 'Seeing the footage of Sara laughing and joking even when she had signs of injuries to her body and knowing what a happy child she was at school, she loved singing and dancing, and knowing what happened to her, those are the most affecting parts of the case,' Libby Clark, a specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service said.	https://apnews.com/article/sara-sharif-uk-pakistan-murder-c01b9b8285966b26ffc4e6dbcfe1b146	2024-12-11T04:17:12-08:00	
Haiti's main international airport reopens one month after gang violence forced it to close	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Haiti’s main international airport reopened on Wednesday, one month after it closed for the second time this year because of gang violence. Haitian soldiers and police, bolstered by Kenyan police leading a U.N.-backed mission to quell gang violence, boosted security in the area, and a test flight was successful, Haiti’s government said in a statement. The Toussaint Louverture airport in Port-au-Prince closed in mid-November after gangs opened fire on a Spirit Airlines flight that was preparing to land, striking a flight attendant who suffered minor injuries. Other commercial planes were also hit that day, prompting Spirit, JetBlue and American Airlines to cancel their flights to Haiti. A day later, the Federal Aviation Administration banned U.S. airlines from flying to the Caribbean country for 30 days. It wasn’t immediately clear which flights would resume on Wednesday to Port-au-Prince. The FAA’s ban is in place until Thursday. Spokespeople for Spirit, JetBlue and American Airlines did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The Guy Malary terminal, which serves domestic flights, also reopened on Wednesday. For the past month, the only international airport operating in Haiti was the one in the northern coastal town of Cap-Haitien, but traveling there by land is dangerous since gangs control the main roads leading out of Port-au-Prince and are known for opening fire on public transport. The few who could afford to escape the surge of gang violence in the capital this past month paid thousands of dollars for private air transport to Cap-Haitien. The airport in Port-au-Prince closed for nearly three months earlier this year after gangs launched coordinated attacks on key government infrastructure starting in late February. Some 5,000 people have been reported killed in Haiti this year, including more than 100 in a recent massacre in a gang-controlled community in Port-au-Prince. ___ Associated Press writer Dánica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-international-airport-reopen-gang-violence-c3890d9c79df18745e748d8715efad00	2024-12-11T03:54:23-08:00	
TikTok files challenge against Canadian government order to dissolve its business in the country	TikTok has challenged a Canadian government order to shut down the Chinese video-sharing app's business operations in the country that was imposed over national security concerns. The company said Tuesday that it filed an application for a judicial review with the Federal Court in Vancouver on Dec. 5, which seeks to set aside the order for TikTok to wind-up and cease its business in Canada. The Canadian federal government last month announced it was ordering the dissolution of TikTok Technology Canada Inc. after a national security review of its Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. The government is not blocking access to the TikTok app, which will continue to be available to Canadians. TikTok said it has 14 million users in Canada, which is about a third of the population. It has offices in Toronto and Vancouver. The wildly popular platform is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020, but is under increasing pressure in the West. It's facing a possible ban in the U.S. and intensifying scrutiny in Europe over issues including election influence campaigns allegedly coordinated by Moscow. TikTok argues in its court application, which was posted online, that Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne's decision was 'unreasonable' and 'driven by improper purposes.' It says the order is 'grossly disproportionate' and the the national security review was 'procedurally unfair.' The review was carried out through the Investment Canada Act, which allows the government to investigate foreign investment with potential to harm national security. Champagne said in a statement at the time that the government was taking action to address 'specific national security risks,' but did not elaborate. His office said in response to the filling that the government’s decision was informed by a 'thorough national security review and advice from Canada’s security and intelligence community.' TikTok said Champagne 'failed to engage with TikTok Canada on the purported substance of the concerns' that led to the order. It argues the government ordered 'measures that bear no rational connection to the national security risks it identifies' and that the reasons for the order 'are unintelligible, fail to reveal a rational chain of analysis and are rife with logical fallacies.' The platform says there were 'less onerous' options than shutting down its Canadian business, which it said would eliminate hundreds of jobs, threaten business contracts and 'cause the destruction of significant economic opportunities.'	https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-canada-social-media-52e820e4e912ad031691c322fbb9b546	2024-12-11T03:30:02-08:00	
An explosion in the Afghan capital kills the Taliban refugee minister, officials say	ISLAMABAD (AP) — A suicide bombing in the Afghan capital on Wednesday killed the Taliban refugee minister and two others, Interior Ministry officials said. The explosion struck inside the ministry, killing Khalil Haqqani, the refugee minister, officials said. The officials provided no further details. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Khalil Haqqani is the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the acting interior minister who leads a powerful network within the Taliban. Haqqani was the most high-profile casualty of a bombing in Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power three years ago. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. In March 2023, a bomb killed a Taliban-appointed provincial governor, Daud Muzmal, and two others in Afghanistan’s Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of Balkh province. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the killing of Haqqani. Dar, who is also deputy prime minister, wrote on the X platform that he was 'deeply shocked' at the killing of Haqqani and 'loss of precious lives as a result of a terrorist attack' in Kabul. 'We offer our heartfelt condolences,' he said, adding, 'Pakistan unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.' Dar said Pakistan was in touch with Kabul to get further details. The Islamic State group’s affiliate, a major rival of the ruling Taliban, has carried out previous attacks across Afghanistan. In early September, a suicide bomber in the southwestern Qala Bakhtiar neighborhood in Kabul killed at least six people, wounding 13 others. IS had claimed responsibility for the attack.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-explosion-refugee-minister-taliban-6b7044402f0741916584fc40dfc6da6e	2024-12-11T02:40:08-08:00	
Romania's pro-Western parties agree to form a majority government after political turmoil	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania’s pro-European parties agreed Wednesday to form a majority government made up of groupings that were traditionally on opposite sides and shutting out far-right nationalists who made significant gains in the election on Dec. 1. Pro-Western parties won the most votes, with the leftist Social Democratic Party, or PSD, topping the polls. The PSD reached agreement late Tuesday to form a grand coalition with the center-right National Liberal Party, or PNL, the reformist Save Romania Union party, USR, and the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party. The parliamentary election came hard on the heels of a presidential vote in which the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu won the first round. His surprise success plunged the European Union and NATO member country into turmoil as allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference emerged. Days before the Dec. 8 presidential runoff, the Constitutional Court made the unprecedented move to annul the presidential race. A statement from the new coalition said the parties would potentially support a 'common pro-European candidate' in the new presidential elections. It isn’t yet clear whether Georgescu will be allowed to run in the new vote. President Klaus Iohannis, whose second term is set to expire later this month, said a new date for the rerun presidential election would be set once the new government has taken office. He signed a decree on Wednesday to convene parliament on Dec. 20. 'In the coming days, the four parties and the representatives of the national minorities will work on a joint governing program, focusing on development and reforms, while addressing the priorities of Romanian citizens,' the coalition statement said. Elena Lasconi, the leader of USR who was set to face Georgescu in the annulled presidential runoff, said after the agreement was reached that 'Romania is going through a very difficult' period and that cutting state spending and reducing bureaucracy would be part of the governing program. In 2021, despite historically being Romania’s two main opposition parties that have dominated post-communist politics, the PSD and the PNL formed an unlikely but increasingly strained coalition together with UDMR, which exited the Cabinet last year after a power-sharing dispute.	https://apnews.com/article/romania-government-parliament-georgescu-elections-europe-psd-d897d4c03825004637e340fb5205f96a	2024-12-11T02:04:00-08:00	
FIFA prepares to give Saudi Arabia its biggest sports win yet as host of the 2034 World Cup	ZURICH (AP) — Saudi Arabia will be confirmed by FIFA as host of the men's soccer 2034 World Cup on Wednesday, giving the oil-rich kingdom its biggest prize yet for massive spending on global sports driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The decision completes a mostly opaque 15-month bid process which FIFA president Gianni Infantino helped steer toward Saudi Arabia without a rival candidate, without taking questions, and which human rights groups warn will put the lives of migrant workers at risk. FIFA and Saudi officials say hosting the 2034 tournament can accelerate change, including more freedoms and rights for women. A fast-track path to victory was cleared last year by FIFA accepting a three-continent hosting plan for the 2030 World Cup led by Spain, Portugal and Morocco. That bid also will win Wednesday in a combined approval for the 2030 and 2034 tournament hosts by applause from more than 200 FIFA member federations in an online meeting hosted from Zurich by Infantino. It will kick off a decade of scrutiny on Saudi labor laws and treatment of workers mostly from South Asia needed to help build and upgrade 15 stadiums, plus hotels and transport networks ahead of the 104-game tournament. One of the stadiums is planned to be 350 meters (yards) above the ground in Neom — a futuristic city that does not yet exist — and another named for the crown prince is designed to be atop a 200-meter cliff near Riyadh. During the bid campaign, FIFA has accepted limited scrutiny of Saudi Arabia’s human rights record that was widely criticized this year at the United Nations. Saudi and international rights groups and activists warned FIFA it has not learned the lessons of Qatar’s much-criticized preparations to host the 2022 World Cup. The kingdom plans to spend tens of billion of dollars on projects related to the World Cup as part of the crown prince’s sweeping Vision 2030 project that aims to modernize Saudi society and economy. At its core is spending on sports by the $900 billion sovereign wealth operation, the Public Investment Fund, which he oversees. Critics have called it 'sportswashing' of the kingdom's reputation. The prince, known as MBS, has built close working ties to Infantino since 2017 — aligning with the organizer of sport’s most-watched event rather than directly confronting the established system as it did with the disruptive LIV Golf project. The result for Saudi Arabia and FIFA has been smooth progress toward the win Wednesday with limited pushback from soccer officials, though some from women international players. The steady flow of Saudi cash into international soccer is set to increase. FIFA created a new and higher World Cup sponsor category for state oil firm Aramco, and Saudi funding is set to underwrite the 2025 Club World Cup in the United States that is a pet project for Infantino. North American soccer body CONCACAF signed a multi-year deal with PIF, Saudi stadiums host Super Cup games for Italy and Spain, and nearly 50 FIFA member federations have signed working agreements with Saudi counterparts. Lavish spending by PIF-owned Saudi clubs in the past two years buying and paying players – including Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Karim Benzema and Sadio Mané – put hundreds of millions of dollars into European soccer. That influence could be key in talks to agree which months to play the 2034 World Cup. The November-December slot taken by Qatar in 2022 to avoid extreme midsummer heat is complicated in 2034 by the holy month of Ramadan through mid-December and Riyadh hosting the multi-sport Asian Games. Still, January 2034 could be an option — and likely better for European clubs and leagues —after the International Olympic Committee said it saw few issues in clashing with the Salt Lake Winter Games opening Feb. 10, 2034. The IOC also has a major commercial deal with Saudi Arabia, to host the new Esports Olympics. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/fifa-world-cup-2030-2034-saudi-arabia-spain-portugal-945f8d7bf332553de0726901d096b956	2024-12-11T01:55:57-08:00	
Biden approves national security memo on China, Iran, North Korea and Russia ahead of Trump's return	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has approved a new national security memorandum ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House that could serve as a road map for the incoming administration as it looks to counter growing cooperation among China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House said Wednesday. Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it deals with the tightening relationships involving America's most prominent adversaries and competitors, according to two senior administration officials. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the classified memorandum would not be made public because of the sensitivity of some of its findings. The document includes four broad recommendations: improving U.S. government interagency cooperation, speeding up the sharing of information with allies about the four adversaries, calibrating the U.S. government's use of sanctions and other economic tools for maximum effectiveness, and bolstering preparation to manage simultaneous crises involving the adversaries. The U.S. for many years has been concerned about cooperation among the four countries. Coordination has accelerated between the countries in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The officials noted that as Russia has become more isolated by much of the world, Moscow has turned to Iran for drones and missiles. From North Korea, the Russians have received artillery, missiles and even thousands of troops that have traveled to help the Russians try to repel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region. China, meanwhile, has supported Russia with dual use components that help keep its military industrial base afloat. In return, Russia has sent fighter jets to Iran and assisted Tehran as it looks to bolster its missile defense and space technology. North Korea has received from Russia much-needed fuel and funding to help build out its manufacturing and military capabilities. The officials added that Russia has 'de facto accepted North Korea as a nuclear weapon state.' China, meanwhile, is benefiting from Russian know-how, with the two countries working together to deepen their military technical cooperation. The two nations are also conducting joint patrols in the Arctic region. Biden and Trump have sharply different worldviews, but officials in both the incoming and outgoing administrations said they have sought to coordinate on national security issues during the transition. One of the officials said that the Biden White House memo 'isn’t trying to box (the Trump administration) in or tilt them toward one policy option or another.' The official said the document is intended to help the next administration build 'capacity' as it shapes its policies on some the most difficult foreign policies it will face.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-national-security-memorandum-6d3462b37533a2665d1e844ee6f7f662	2024-12-11T01:02:21-08:00	
2 Ukrainian women are pulled alive from rubble hours after Russian missile strike	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Rescue crews working through the night pulled two women from rubble more than seven hours after a Russian missile struck a private medical clinic in a southern Ukraine city, killing eight people and wounding 22 others, authorities said Wednesday. The women called rescue services on their cellphones to say they were buried under the rubble after the attack late Tuesday in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine’s Emergency Services said. Deadly Russian strikes on civilian areas have been a feature of the almost three-year war. Ukraine’s Western allies are sending more aid to help it keep fighting Russia’s invasion, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Zaporizhzhia strike showed that his country still needs more air defense systems. He urged Western partners to send weaponry they are holding in their arsenals. 'We currently do not have enough systems to protect our country from Russian missiles. But partners have these systems,' Zelenskyy said late Tuesday in his daily address to the nation. Air defense systems that Ukraine’s allies possess 'should save lives, and not gather dust in storage bases,' he said. Meanwhile, Ukraine kept up its long-range attacks on areas behind Russian lines that are supporting its war effort. A Ukrainian drone attack caused a blaze at an industrial facility in Russia’s Bryansk region, Gov. Alexander Bogomaz said. Air defenses downed 14 Ukrainian drones over the Bryansk region early Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Also, a Ukrainian missile attack on the city of Taganrog in the Rostov region early Wednesday damaged an industrial plant, regional Gov. Yuri Slusar said. Zelenskyy thanked Ukrainian forces for hitting what he called 'military facilities on the territory of Russia, as well as facilities of the fuel and energy complex.' 'It is precisely such long range and accuracy that step-by-step bring Russia back to reality — to the reality that the war must be ended,' he said on Telegram. It wasn't possible to verify either side's claims. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-missile-strike-zaporizhzhia-ba02d01051b57d10a6fdfa9b54e1be89	2024-12-11T00:45:08-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strike on home in northern Gaza kills 19 people, Palestinian medics say	An Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 19, Palestinian medical officials said Wednesday, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed back to the region reeling from the weekend ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Kamal Adwan Hospital said it received the bodies after the overnight strike in the town of Beit Lahiya. Hospital records show that a family of eight were among those killed, including four children, their parents and two grandparents. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has waged a renewed offensive against Hamas militants in northern Gaza since early October. Another strike in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least seven people, according to al-Awda Hospital. Records show the dead included two children, their parents and three relatives. Blinken is returning to the Middle East this week on his 12th visit since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last year but his first since Assad's ouster. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people, including children and older adults. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health officials. They say women and children make up more than half the dead but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians in their count. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the latest: Germany says it's looking for ways to work with Syria's new rulers BERLIN — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Wednesday addressed Berlin's reservations but also willingness to work the Syrian militant group in control of Damascus, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. 'Nobody overlooks the origins of HTS in the al-Qaeda ideology. It is therefore clear that we will measure HTS by its actions,' Baerbock told reporters in Berlin. 'Any cooperation presupposes that ethnic and religious minorities are protected, women’s rights are respected and acts of revenge are prevented.' She said that 'whether we like it or not, the HTS militia ... is one of the decisive actors for the future of Syria.' 'Together with our partners, we are therefore looking for an adequate way of dealing with HTS, with whom many have had no direct contact for good reasons,' she added. Ahmad al-Sharaa, the insurgent leader also known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has renounced longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicted himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon kills 1, state news agency says BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike near the southern Lebanese town of Bin Jbeil killed one person and wounded another, the state news agency reported. National News Agency said Wednesday’s airstrike hit a home. It gave no further details and there was no immediate comment from Israeli military. More than a dozen people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes since a ceasefire went into effect on Nov. 27, ending the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war. Blinken is returning to the Middle East WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is returning to the Middle East this week on his 12th visit since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last year but his first since the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Assad's departure has sparked new fears of instability in the region now wracked by three conflicts despite a ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. Blinken will travel to Jordan and Turkey on Thursday and Friday for talks expected to focus largely on Syria but also touch on long-elusive hopes for a deal to end the fighting in Gaza that has devastated the territory since October 2023. The State Department said Blinken would meet Jordanian officials, including King Abdullah II, in the port of Aqaba on Thursday before flying to Ankara for meetings with Turkish officials Friday. Other stops in the region are also possible, officials said. Blinken 'will reiterate the United States’ support for an inclusive, Syrian-led transition to an accountable and representative government,' department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. Insurgents set fire to Hafez Assad's tomb, a war monitor says BEIRUT — Insurgents have set on fire the tomb of Syria’s former President Hafez Assad in his hometown in the northwest, a war monitor and a local journalist said Wednesday. Hafez Assad had ruled Syria for 30 years until his death in 2000, when his son, Bashar, succeeded him. Both ruled Syria with an iron fist and were blamed for crackdowns that left tens of thousands dead, mainly in the central city of Hama in 1982, and in much of the country since the civil war in 2011. Bashar Assad was ousted over the weekend and fled to Russia where he was given political asylum. Rami Abdurrahman of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Syrian journalist Qusay Noor told The Associated Press that the tomb was set on fire Wednesday in the town of Qardaha in Latakia province. UN appeals for $4 billion for humanitarian operations in Palestinian territories JERUSALEM — The United Nations is asking donors for over $4 billion to fund humanitarian operations in the Palestinian territories, most of it earmarked for war-ravaged Gaza. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs also called for the 'lifting all impediments to the entry of aid' in its appeal issued Wednesday. U.N. agencies say aid operations in Gaza are hindered by Israeli restrictions and the breakdown of law and order. Israel says it allows enough aid to enter and blames the U.N. for not distributing it within the territory. The appeal for 2025 includes $3.6 billion for Gaza and about $450 million for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel’s offensive, launched after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, has destroyed vast areas of the besieged territory and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million. Many have been displaced multiple times and are now crammed into squalid tent camps with little in the way of food or other essentials. Most of the population relies on international aid. Paraguay's president addresses the Knesset ahead of embassy reopening in Jerusalem JERUSALEM — The president of Paraguay addressed the Israeli parliament Wednesday ahead of the reopening of the country’s embassy in Jerusalem. The decision to reopen the embassy in Jerusalem and recognize the city as the capital of Israel is a diplomatic win for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and puts Paraguay in a small group of countries that have taken the move. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in 1967 but it wasn't recognized by the international community, and most countries run their embassies out of Tel Aviv. 'Without Jerusalem, the land of Israel is a body without a soul,' President Santiago Peña said in a speech to the Knesset. 'So I say here today that without an embassy in Jerusalem, diplomatic relations with Israel do not have a real heart.' He said he hoped the move would inspire other countries to do the same. The embassy is set to open Thursday. Pena’s move was welcomed by Netanyahu, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, along with other Israeli leaders. 'Tomorrow we will inaugurate together the embassy of Paraguay in our eternal capital, and that will happen not for the first time, but for the second time,' Netanyahu said. Paraguay had an embassy in Jerusalem in 2018, under Former President Horacio Cartes. That embassy was moved back to Tel Aviv by Cartes’ successor, Mario Abdo Benitez, prompting Israel to close its embassy in Asuncion. Israel reopened its embassy in September. Russia says it's in touch with new authorities in Syria MOSCOW — Russia said Wednesday it has maintained contacts with the new authorities in Syria. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that 'we are monitoring most closely what is happening in Syria.' 'We, of course, maintain contacts with those who are currently controlling the situation in Syria,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. 'This is necessary because our bases are located there, our diplomatic mission is located there and, of course, the issue related to ensuring the security of these facilities is extremely important and of primary significance.' Peskov wouldn’t give details of those contacts, saying only that Russia has contacted 'those who are controlling the situation on the ground.' He wouldn’t give the number of Russian troops in Syria. Asked to comment about Israel’s seizure of a buffer zone on the border with Syria, Peskov called them destabilizing. 'The strikes and actions in the Golan Heights area, in the buffer zone area, are unlikely to help stabilize the situation in an already destabilized Syria,' he said. Russia has granted political asylum to ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad and his family after they fled rebels who seized Damascus over the weekend. Iran's supreme leader says fall of Syrian government was part of joint plan by US and Israel TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says the recent events in Syria, including the fall of its government, were part of a joint plan by the United States and Israel. 'There should be no doubt that what has happened in Syria is the result of a joint American and Zionist plan,' Khamenei said in a speech in Tehran on Wednesday that was broadcast on state TV. 'We have evidence, and this evidence leaves no room for doubt.' The Supreme leader added: 'A neighboring state of Syria has played a clear role in this matter, and it continues to do so. Everyone can see this.' Khamenei also rejected speculation by analysts who have said that Iran will be weakened by the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government. 'Those ignorant analysts are unaware of the meaning of resistance. They think that if resistance weakens, Islamic Iran will also weaken. But I say, with the help and power of God — by the will of Almighty Allah — Iran is powerful and it will become even more powerful,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-11-december-2024-90f14a411f4e58cdf773b85ee75e8b4d	2024-12-10T22:10:07-08:00	
Israeli strike on northern Gaza kills 19, Palestinian medics say	CAIRO (AP) — Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli strike on a home where displaced people were sheltering in the northern Gaza Strip has killed at least 19 people. That’s according to the Kamal Adwan Hospital, which received the casualties on Wednesday after the overnight strike in the town of Beit Lahiya. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has been waging a renewed offensive against Hamas militants in northern Gaza since early October.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-12-11-2024-52692a401ef2fb7e66c0d4d00633bd10	2024-12-10T21:36:53-08:00	
Taiwan demands that China end its military activity in nearby waters	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan demanded Wednesday that China end its ongoing military activity in nearby waters, which it said is unilaterally undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and disrupting international shipping and trade. The Foreign Ministry, in a statement posted on its website, said it was responding in part to the activities of a 'large number' of Chinese naval and coast guard ships in the first-island chain, the Pacific archipelago off the Asian continental mainland that includes Japan, Taiwan and part of the Philippines. 'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs solemnly demands that the Beijing authorities immediately stop military intimidation and all irrational activities that endanger regional peace and stability,' the statement said. Taiwan defense officials say they have detected Chinese ship s since Monday, both off Taiwan and farther out along the first-island chain. They described the formations as two walls designed to demonstrate that the waters belong to China. China restricted airspace off its southeast coast from Monday to Wednesday, an indication that it was planning to hold drills, but the country's People's Liberation Army has not confirmed whether it is doing so. Taiwan has been expecting drills following stops by its president, Lai Ching-te, in Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam during an overseas trip last week. China claims self-governing Taiwan as its territory and opposes any official contact with America and other foreign governments. A Chinese spokesperson didn't comment directly on any military exercises but said in a statement posted online Wednesday that the government would not let provocations by Taiwan in collusion with external forces go unchecked. 'We will take necessary measures to resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and safeguard the fundamental interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,' said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the government's Taiwan Affairs Office. The Taiwan Strait is a 160-kilometer- (100-mile-) wide body of water between China and the island of Taiwan. China's military held major exercises around Taiwan following both Lai's inauguration in May and his national day speech in October. It also held a major drill after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-military-drills-b48c59b819f2d32e3a6d9b9635c7aa53	2024-12-10T21:36:12-08:00	
A Lebanese man who spent 32 years in Syrian prisons is welcomed home	CHEKKA, Lebanon (AP) — Suheil Hamwi spent 32 years in a Syrian prison, and now, after an offensive by insurgents that toppled the government of Bashar Assad, he's finally returned to his home in Lebanon. In 1992, Hamwi worked as a merchant, selling various goods in the town of Chekka in northern Lebanon. On the night of Eid il-Burbara, or Saint Barbara’s Day — a holiday similar to Halloween — a man came to his door to buy some whiskey. Hamwi said he handed his 10-month-old son, George, to his wife and went to his car to fetch the whiskey and make the sale. As Hamwi approached his vehicle, a car filled with men pulled up, he said, forcing him inside and taking him away. It would be years before his family heard from him again. Hamwi was one of hundreds of Lebanese citizens detained during Syria’s occupation of Lebanon from 1976 to 2005 and believed to be held in Syrian prisons for decades. On Sunday, freedom came to him and others unexpectedly — prisoners who'd heard rumors about Syria’s opposition forces and their sweeping campaign found that guards had abandoned their posts. Hamwi and other prisoners left, he said, and he would soon be among the first from Lebanon to reenter the country. 'I’m still scared this might not be real,' he told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday from his home — the same one he left more than three decades ago. This new reality feels fragile, but, he said, 'I found my freedom.' Years of uncertainty and imprisonment For years after the night of his disappearance, Hamwi’s family didn’t know where he was. It wasn’t until 16 years later that his wife discovered he was imprisoned in Syria. Even then, the reason for his detention remained unclear, Hamwi said. It took another four years before authorities finally told him the charge, he said: He was detained because he was a member of the Lebanese Forces, a Christian political party that also functioned as a militia during the 15-year Lebanese civil war that ended in 1990. The party fought against Syrian forces and remained opposed to Syria's military presence in Lebanon afterward. Hamwi said prison interrogations were cryptic. 'They asked for my name, my parents’ names, my age, and where I was from. That’s all,' he said. Then he would be sent back to his cell. 'There was no lawyer, no nothing.' He said he spent his first years in Syria’s notorious Saydnaya prison before being transferred to other facilities, eventually ending up in prison in Latakia. Torture marked his early days behind bars, he added, 'but that stopped after a while.' For years, he said, he lived in nearly complete isolation. He was alone in a small cell, surrounded by other Lebanese detainees as well as Palestinians and Iraqis. In 2008, he said, his wife was able to visit him for the first time. Then she came about once a year. The door opens to freedom Last week, there was some buzz in the prison about what was happening outside. 'But we didn’t know the dream would reach us,' Hamwi said. Early Sunday morning, chaos erupted as prisoners discovered the guards were gone. 'The first door opened,' Hamwi said, describing how rebels stormed the prison and started opening cell gates. 'Then others followed. And for those who couldn’t open their gates, they started coming out through the walls.' The prisoners left 'walking toward the unknown,' he said. 'And I walked with them.' Strangers on the street helped guide him back to Lebanon, Hamwi said. He came into the country through the Arida border crossing in northern Lebanon, where his family waited on the other side. Back home, at last As Hamwi walked through his door, it was his two grandchildren who greeted him. 'This is the first time I met them,' Hamwi later told AP, his voice tinged with disbelief. In the living room, Hamwi lit a cigarette and took a slow drag. He took in photos of moments he'd missed: George’s graduation portrait; George with his wife; Hamwi's own smiling wife, Josephine, with granddaughter Tala. Grandson Chris clung to Hamwi's hand, giggling as he called out 'Jeddo!' — Arabic for grandpa. Josephine handed out sweets, her hands steady despite the emotions of the last several days. Outside, neighbors and friends gathered, their voices echoing in the narrow hallway outside his apartment. They sat on chairs in a circle, sharing laughter and memories, as plates of the Arabic sweets and small chocolates were passed around. 'Do you know me? Do you remember me?' one friend asked, shaking Hamwi’s hand. Hamwi paused, studying the man’s face. 'You’re Jean! Yes, you’re Jean,' he said. Hawmi has visited a hospital, for tests to assess the toll of 32 years in captivity. And he has to relearn life outside prison walls. He hoped one of the best moments was yet to come: his reunion with only son George, an engineer working in the Gulf. In their first phone call, Hamwi said, George told him the words he'd been longing to hear: 'I miss you. I love you. I’m waiting to see you.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-prisoners-prison-suheil-hamwi-deae45f72edd7d4544d5d411c1717123	2024-12-10T21:35:25-08:00	
Rural resurrection: A Greek village leans into faith in fight against demographic collapse	FOURNA, Greece (AP) — Fourna, home to 180 people and hidden in the fir-tree covered mountains of central Greece, is a vanishing village that is determined to keep its place on the map. A winding four-hour drive from Athens, it enjoys near total silence, periodically broken by church bells and howling dogs. Elderly residents measure the village’s chances of survival by the number of children enrolled at the local primary school. Last year, there were only two. But Fourna’s fortunes have been reversed by an unlikely and tireless partnership. The local schoolteacher, a Ph.D. student studying artificial intelligence, found common cause with the Rev. Constantine Dousikos, a burly Orthodox priest and former lumber machine operator who was ordained shortly before turning 50. They started a despair-fueled campaign to attract families to Fourna, offering settling-in money raised from private donations and municipal programs. It’s working: Two families have moved to the village, five more are on a 2025 wait list, and hundreds of others have made inquiries. Eight children now attend elementary classes. Dousikos, equally at ease behind the wheel of his pickup or in front of the church altar, says the initiative was partly inspired by calls from the Orthodox church hierarchy urging clergy to promote family life. 'I think we did the obvious thing: Help the people here keep our village alive,' he says, standing in the Church of Transfiguration of Christ on the main square. 'Of course, village life is not for everyone. You need to be good at manual work.' Greece has one of the world’s oldest populations with 23% aged 65 or older in 2023, according to World Bank data. The central Greek region of Evrytania, home to Fourna, faces low birth rates and rural depopulation, with an average age of 56.2 – one of the three highest in the European Union. Panagiota Diamanti, Fourna’s only elementary schoolteacher and co-founder of the family campaign 'New Life in the Village,' says the urgency of the situation is palpable. 'If the kids don’t come, the teacher gets transferred and the school will close. And a closed school will never reopen,' she says. 'We need bold action.' More than 200 publicly run schools and kindergartens were shut down across Greece in the current school year due to low enrollment, many in remote parts of the country with sparse populations due to its mountainous mainland terrain and numerous small islands. Several local authorities have reached out to the Fourna campaign, and asked Diamanti to help them start a similar program. After class, she joins her eight students in a game of dodgeball at the school yard which overlooks Evrytania’s jagged mountains. The kids enjoy a local-celebrity status; their birthdays are often celebrated in the main village square. Vassiliki Emmanouil relocated to Fourna with her six children – five sons and a daughter – and says she has been showered with kindness. Village residents leave food outside her door overnight and are encouraging her to restart an old bakery when her husband returns from a spell of work in Germany. 'I’ve been here for nearly three months, and I would be ungrateful to say I’ve struggled,' Emmanouil says. 'The local priest and his wife treat me as if I’m part of their family. The entire village has been by our side, from offering daily essentials to emotional support.' Deaths overtook annual births in Greece in 2010 as the country sank into a severe financial crisis and the numbers have steadily worsened since then, reaching almost double the birth level in 2022. The conservative government last year created a ministry of family and social cohesion. It has increased family benefits in the 2025 budget and reached out to the Orthodox Church for help. Last year, the church’s governing Holy Synod issued a circular that was read out at all of Greece’s Orthodox churches, arguing that financial incentives will not be enough to reverse the dire demographic trends. 'Experts propose various solutions to address the issue, emphasizing its significant social, economic, and geopolitical implications,' the message said. 'The Church underscores the spiritual dimension of family life, advocating for unity, love, and the creation of families as a testament to divine purpose,' it added. 'Children, considered gifts from God, bring meaning to life and symbolize hope and renewal.' For Fourna’s residents, even church attendance is tied to village survival. Two dozen churches in the area remain empty most of the year, but are well maintained and open for important dates on the religious calendar. The appearance of children in church and on the village’s long-quieted streets caught most residents off guard. 'At the start, I never thought families would come to live here. It’s a remote village, very small, without much here,' local business owner Giorgos Vassilikoudis said. 'But to my surprise, families did come and they’re happy,' said Vassilikoudis, who runs a restaurant and guesthouse. 'It’s very good for the village and for people who have shops and businesses. For other villages, it serves as an example. It’s a good start.' ___ AP journalist Lefteris Pitarakis contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Brazilian beef and leather companies fall short in tackling deforestation, a study finds	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — The next United Nations climate conference, COP30, will be held in Belem, the capital of an Amazon region where widespread deforestation mainly driven by cattle farming has turned the surrounding rainforest from a vital carbon sink into a significant carbon source. Now a new report concludes around 80% of Brazil’s leading beef and cow leather companies and their financiers have made no commitments to stop deforestation. The study, released Wednesday by the environmental nonprofit group Global Canopy, highlights the country´s 175 most influential beef and leather companies and financial institutions that have supported them with $100 billion. This amount is one-third of the annual funding that wealthy nations pledged to provide for climate finance in developing countries during COP29 last month in Baku, Azerbaijan. 'Although cattle is the single most influential commodity for deforestation and linked greenhouse gas emissions, the report ... reveals a picture of staggering inaction from corporates and financial institutions alike in Brazilian supply chains,' the study said. The record is poor even among companies that commit to halting deforestation, such as JBS, according to the report. The giant meatpacker is one of the few to make such commitments and one of only two to have a system for tracing cattle all the way to the production unit. Yet the report ranks the company as the most likely to be buying cattle and cow leather from recently deforested land. This assessment of deforestation risk is based on the number of cattle bought from ranchers in each Brazilian municipality and its deforestation rate. Meatpackers buying from high-deforestation areas are more likely to source from recently cleared land than those buying from low-deforestation areas. The methodology was created by Do Pasto ao Prato, an independent Brazilian consumer app that aims to increase transparency in the livestock sector. 'Commitments are critical as one of the first steps a company takes to address deforestation,' Emma Thomson, one of the coauthors, told The Associated Press. 'But it has to be followed by effective implementation and by monitoring suppliers and indirect suppliers for compliance with those standards. It has to have effective traceability mechanisms and transparent reporting on the progress that is — or isn´t — being made.' Besides JBS, the report lists three processing companies with units based in Para state as likely to be buying cattle and cow leather from recently deforested land: Mercurio, Mafrinorte and Frigol. In a written response, JBS said the study's methodology provides a simplistic and inaccurate assessment of deforestation risk, ignoring factors such as corporate policies, sustainable procurement systems and exclusion of noncompliant suppliers. The company said that since 2009 it has maintained a system to ensure suppliers meet socio-environmental criteria. 'The companies that have made significant progress in their controls end up being criticized, and their transparency is used not as an incentive but as a penalty,' it said. Mercurio, Mafrinorte and Frigol didn´t reply to requests for comment. Global Canopy´s report was funded by the Bezos Earth Fund. Do Pasto ao Prato is financed by Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative. The state of Para harbors Brazil´s second largest cattle herd, with 25 million animals — and 35% of its territory is cleared, an area slightly smaller than Syria. As a result, it ranks first in greenhouse gas emissions among Brazilian states. A landmark study published in the journal Nature in 2021 found that the eastern Amazon, where Para is located, has ceased to function as a carbon sink, or absorber, for the Earth, due to widespread deforestation and climate change. Niki Mardas, executive director of Global Canopy, said there will be an update to Wednesday's baseline report in the runup to COP30 next November, when all eyes will be on the Amazon.

US Biathlon officials ignored sexual harassment and abuse of female racers for decades, athletes say	Sexual abuse and harassment by coaches and others who held positions of power over women on the U.S. Biathlon team have been dismissed, ignored or excused over decades by officials more concerned with winning medals than holding offenders accountable, according to a half-dozen former Olympians and other biathletes. And while the men involved climbed the ranks of the sport, these women — who described a culture of abuse dating back to the 1990s — told The Associated Press they were forced to end their racing careers early. One coach resigned after the young biathlete he was accused of sexually abusing attempted suicide, but he was later hired to coach the U.S. Paralympic team. Max Cobb, who the women say was informed but failed to address the claims, went from U.S. domestic team manager to CEO of the U.S. Biathlon Association and is now secretary general of the International Biathlon Union, the worldwide governing body of the sport, which combines cross-country skiing on trails with target shooting. Two male coaches and a former racer on the men's biathlon team confirmed the culture of misogyny described by the women, who all said they faced retaliation for speaking up. 'My safety on the team was clearly secondary to a top-down power structure focused on image, medals and marketing,' said two-time Olympian Joan Wilder, 58, who said her coach got away with trying to sexually assault her in 1990 despite her complaints to Cobb. Grace Boutot, a 2009 Youth World Championship silver medalist, said her reports to Cobb and other officials about abuse committed by two coaches, beginning when she was 15, also went unheeded, eventually leading to a suicide attempt. 'U.S. Biathlon leadership always seems to choose to support the predators instead of the person who was abused,' the now 33-year-old Boutot said. The women came forward after the AP reported that Olympian Joanne Reid was sexually abused and harassed for years, according to findings by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, a watchdog group created to investigate sex-abuse allegations in Olympic sports in the aftermath of the Larry Nassar U.S. Gymnastics scandal. Reid told the AP her repeated complaints to top U.S. Biathlon officials, which were relayed to Cobb, were ignored for three years. Cobb denied the women's allegations that he failed to act. 'During my 33 years at U.S. Biathlon, athlete safety was always fundamental to me and I can't recall ever hearing from athletes or others that my efforts in this regard were not appropriate,' he said in an email to the AP. Cobb declined to be interviewed to respond to specific allegations raised by the women, saying it would be a violation of SafeSport's code. However, an independent investigation ordered by U.S. Biathlon into team culture and safety following the AP report found biathletes faced 'misogynistic' behavior while racing and feared retaliation if they came forward with their concerns. The assessment by outside auditor Vestry Laight, released last week, said the athletes surveyed described a sport 'dominated by men who have a very different outlook on how to treat women' and criticized the 'lack of attention paid to create a respectful environment.' Biathlon officials said they were adopting an 'action plan' in response to the auditor's report, including workshops with staff and athletes to define core values and create a way to measure progress. SafeSport interviews also confirmed the sexualized atmosphere. U.S. Biathlon team psychologist Sean McCann described 'a European boys club culture' in the watchdog group's 2022 report on the Reid case, with some men sharing sexual comments and other explicit content on a private WhatsApp group. Turning a blind eye in pursuit of elusive Olympic medals, athletes say Biathlon is the only winter sport for which the U.S. has never won an Olympic medal. Desperate to excel in the European-dominated sport, U.S. officials hired European coaches and staff, and turned a blind eye when women raised claims of sexual harassment or abuse on the team, all those interviewed said. In 1990, to prepare for the first-ever women’s biathlon race at the Olympics, U.S. officials hired German biathlete Walter Pichler, a 1984 Olympic bronze medalist, to coach the U.S. women’s team. During a training camp in Montana that year, the team went out one night but then 20-year-old Wilder said she went to bed early. She suddenly woke to someone on her back. Pichler was holding her down and trying to force her to have sex, she said in a complaint filed with SafeSport. Pichler denied trying to sexually assault Wilder. 'This is unbelievable,' he told AP. 'I’m speechless. If this comes out, it does damage to me.' 'I always had a super relationship with Joanie, or with all the athletes, all the female, the men athletes. All of them.' Wilder said she chased Pichler from her room and reported it to then-team manager Cobb. He showed concern, she said, 'but didn’t consider it discipline-worthy.' Cobb justified Pichler’s behavior by saying he didn’t know U.S. laws or culture, she said. 'I recall pressing Max Cobb about sending Walter back to Germany. The conversation didn’t last long,' said Wilder, who competed under her maiden name Guetschow. Pichler's visa had taken two years to secure, he told her, 'and we were so close to the Olympics. We needed their expertise to perform well.' 'The message I felt, and it hurt, was not to harm the team, organization, Olympics over a very inconvenient ‘incident,’' she said. 'Basically, shut up for the team’s sake.' Wilder said in her SafeSport complaint that she faced retaliation for pressing the issue of firing Pichler. 'I was targeted as a ‘problem’ athlete,' she said, in the complaint. She said her rifle disappeared, her skis went to another athlete, and she was temporarily bumped from the 1994 Olympic team, then dropped from the national team before the 1998 Olympics without being told. That put her health insurance at risk. She had undergone heart surgery, so losing coverage with a pre-existing condition was catastrophic, she said. She called Cobb in distress. 'Max ended the conversation with, ‘Well, if you write a letter to the U.S. Olympic Committee and say that you’re resigning from biathlon, I’ll extend your medical insurance,’' she told the AP. She hung up, she said, deciding she didn’t have any fight left. 'It was time for me to move on.' Two coaches prey on teenage Maine biathlete Boutot grew up homeschooled and mostly isolated from others her age in Fort Kent, Maine, a town of 4,000 on the Canadian border. The Maine Winter Sports Center ran a world-class Nordic ski facility there used by U.S. Biathlon. Boutot was 12 when she was recruited into the program in 2003. She started racing biathlon the next year and began training with newly hired coach Gary Colliander when she was 15. Colliander gave her a lot of coaching attention, but also a lot of hugs, she said. Her parents had divorced and she rarely saw her father, so she appreciated his support. 'I didn’t think he would do anything to hurt me,' she told the AP of Colliander, who was 15 years her senior. As she got older, she said, his attention increased. He invited her to his home, massaged her legs and rubbed her back and buttocks, she said. He was married, but his wife lived part time in Colorado. The conduct escalated after she turned 18 to 'kissing, sexual fondling and oral sex,' according to a treatment summary by therapist Jacqueline Pauli-Ritz, shared with the AP. Boutot said she begged him to stop but Colliander ignored her. She said he warned her against telling anyone, saying his life would be ruined and her biathlon career would end. She loved racing, and felt trapped; to compete internationally she needed her coach's recommendation: 'I didn’t know what to do,' she said. She became severely depressed and started cutting herself, according to the therapist's notes. In September 2010, Pauli-Ritz contacted Colliander and told him Boutot was suffering from major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and he should stop coaching her, the treatment summary said. 'He did not do this until after the suicide attempt,' Pauli-Ritz wrote, referring to Boutot's Oct. 7, 2010, overdose on antidepressants while at a training camp in Soldier Hollow, Utah. She was found by a teammate and hospitalized. The next day, Colliander resigned. He took a coaching job in Colorado and was hired in December 2016 by the U.S. Paralympic team, where he is associate director of high performance for U.S. Paralympics Nordic Skiing. Colliander did not respond to phone messages and emails seeking comment. In October 2010, Boutot informed the CEO and the vice president of the Maine Winter Sports Center about the abuse by Colliander, according to a letter she sent to the sports center’s board. But, she said, there was no investigation. Boutot said she also faced abuse by then-U.S. Biathlon junior team coach Vladimir Cervenka of the Czech Republic, starting in 2007. He caressed her buttocks and legs, she said, and also grabbed other girls and gave 'good luck pats.' When she won a silver medal at the 2009 Youth World Championships in Canada, Cervenka grabbed her, she said. 'He forcibly kissed me and groped my entire body, smothering me and crushing me until he was pulled off of me by our team masseuse,' she said of Cervenka, who was 26 years older than her. Cervenka denied Boutot's claims. 'I absolutely did not kiss her or grope her body,' he told the AP in an email. 'Regarding inappropriate touching Grace, I have no memory of any of that and I for sure did not have any intention of doing that. All these accusations are absurd and very upsetting.' Boutot reported the alleged abuse by Cervenka twice to U.S. Biathlon officials, including in a Jan. 6, 2011, email to Cobb and a U.S. Biathlon board member in which she also expressed concern about Cervenka's inappropriate contact with other young teammates and her worries about retaliation for speaking up. In the email exchange, she was told the issues were serious, but she had to make her complaint public so Cervenka could defend himself. Boutot said she expected them to investigate. 'I wish I would have spoken up more at the time but it was terrifying,' she told the AP. 'I told them of the abuse and they never took me seriously. It felt like an insurmountable battle, me against them. I went to USBA hoping for help, and it felt like they continuously shut me down and wanted me to leave the sport.' Boutot tried to keep racing but faced retaliation by the Maine Winter Sports Center, she said in a 2011 complaint filed with the Maine Human Rights Commission. She accused the center of failing to prevent Colliander’s sexual misconduct and retaliating against her when she reported it — denying her coaching and ending its financing of equipment, travel, athlete housing and other U.S. Biathlon competition-related expenses. The center settled for $75,000, and Boutot quit racing. What comes next? SafeSport has ordered a new investigation into whether Reid was retaliated against for exposing the abuse she endured to the watchdog group. SafeSport spokeswoman Hilary Nemchik said she could not comment on the ongoing case. Olympian Deedra Irwin, Reid's teammate who is competing at the World Cup in Europe this winter, said the misogynistic culture described by SafeSport grew under Cobb's leadership. 'Max Cobb just hired all his friends,' Irwin told the AP. 'The amount of people working in USBA right now who are all ex-athletes that are all really close with Max Cobb, it's like, OK, this is how this kept happening for so many years.' 'You just keep hiring people who are comfortable with what's already happening.' SafeSport, which was created in 2017, decades after the abuse reported by Wilder and Boutot, investigates claims even when the legal statute of limitations has expired. After receiving an anonymous tip, SafeSport contacted Boutot in 2021 about filing a complaint about the abuse allegations involving Colliander, she said. She declined. A coach found guilty might only face a six-month suspension, she said, but 'what I have endured has been a life sentence.' Wilder said she didn’t know she had the option and filed a SafeSport complaint, naming Cobb and Pichler, after she found out. She said it is 'an important next step.' 'I love the sport of biathlon,' Wilder said. 'I sincerely hope that my shared story with other women biathletes results in this being bookends to a darker period — that it never happens again.' ___ EDITOR'S NOTE — Martha Bellisle is an amateur biathlete who has won several U.S. national and world championship gold medals in the master’s division for competitors 60 and older.

Rights group demands probe of ex-governor, 2 army officers in Congo for possible humanitarian crimes	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Amnesty International called for an investigation Wednesday into a former governor and two top army officials in Congo for 'possible crimes against humanity' during a deadly crackdown on demonstrators last year protesting the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the country. The human rights group said in a report Congo's security forces killed at least 56 people and injured 80 more, during a protest in the eastern city of Goma in August 2023. The protest was organized by a sect called the Natural Judaic and Messianic Faith Towards the Nations and known colloquially as Wazalendo. Its supporters were demonstrating against the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, called MONUSCO. The MONUSCO force arrived in Congo in 2010 after taking over from an earlier U.N. peacekeeping mission to protect civilians and humanitarian personnel and to support the Congolese government in its stabilization and peace consolidation efforts. However, frustrated Congolese say that no one is protecting them from rebel attacks, leading to several protests against the U.N. mission. Eastern Congo has struggled with armed violence for decades as more than 120 groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources, while others try to defend their communities. Some armed groups have been accused of mass killings. More than 7 million people have been displaced. Goma’s Mayor Faustin Napenda Kapend banned the protest soon after it was announced over concerns the organizers were inciting hate and violence. Amnesty International said it found no evidence of incitement to violence in the statements and messages from the Wazalendo it reviewed. Congolese security and defense forces amassed at major intersections in anticipation of the protest when violence broke out early in the morning. Amnesty International said it saw operational plans in which the security forces were given orders to 'destroy isolated enemy elements.' 'This massacre was not the result of a blunder by a few soldiers who intervened unexpectedly after Wazalendo followers stoned a police officer, as authorities have claimed,' Tigere Chagutah, the rights group regional director for East and Southern Africa, said in the statement. 'It was the result of a series of deliberate, planned actions by the Congolese authorities, after MONUSCO explicitly requested they prohibit the protest.' Amnesty International said it traced the timeline and locations of the killings, identifying three top officials who should be investigated and, if evidence supports it, prosecuted for possible crimes against humanity. They include Lt. Gen. Constant Ndima, who was governor of the North Kivu province at the time, Col. Mike Kalamba Mikombe, who was head of the Republican Guard unit in Goma, and Maj. Peter Kabwe, who led the Republican Guard's Special Forces. The rights group said Ndima had directed the army and the police to 'take all measures' to protect MONUSCO facilities and the city, after he informed the army and police that the Wazalendo posed a serious threat. Mikombe was accused of ordering soldiers to open fire on the protesters, who were unarmed, according to Amnesty International and two Congolese military trials, killing dozens. Amnesty International accused Kabwe of leading a raid on a Wazalendo radio station ahead of the protest in which six people, including a journalist, were summarily executed. While Mikombe was convicted and sentenced to death, which the rights group said it opposed, Ndima and Kabwe have not faced justice. 'The Democratic Republic of Congo authorities must reopen the investigations into this massacre, in line with regional and international standards, to establish the truth and hold all of those involved accountable,' Chagutah said. He added that Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi should suspend Ndima and Kabew, further investigate Mikombe, and ban the Republican Guard and Special Forces from law enforcement operations.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-army-crimes-against-humanity-amnesty-international-eb7d662c7b0efe2ef138f60df8a34e81	2024-12-10T20:08:09-08:00	
These Palestinians disappeared after encounters with Israeli troops in Gaza	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Reem Ajour says she last saw her husband and then 4-year-old daughter in March, when Israeli soldiers raided a family home in northern Gaza. She is haunted by those chaotic last moments, when the soldiers ordered her to go – to leave behind Talal and Masaa, both wounded. Eight months later, the 23-year-old mother still has no answers about their fate. The military says it does not have them. Troops leveled the house where they were staying soon after the raid. 'I am living and dead at the same time,' she said, breaking down in sobs. Ajour is one of dozens of Palestinians that an Israeli legal group, Hamoked, is helping in their search for family members who went missing after being separated by Israeli soldiers during raids and arrests in the Gaza Strip. Their cases — a fraction of the estimated thousands who have gone missing during the 14-month-long war — highlight a lack of accountability in how the Israeli military deals with Palestinians during ground operations in Gaza, Hamoked says. Throughout the war, the military has conducted what amounts to a mass sifting of the Palestinian population as it raids homes and shelters and sends people through checkpoints. Troops round up and detain men, from dozens to several hundreds at a time, searching for any they suspect of Hamas ties, while forcing their families away, toward other parts of Gaza. The result is families split apart, often amid the chaos of fighting. But the military has not made clear how it keeps track of everyone it separates, arrests or detains. Even if troops transfer Palestinians to military detention inside Israel, they can hold them incommunicado for more than two months — their whereabouts unknown to families or lawyers, according to rights groups. When people vanish, it’s nearly impossible to know what happened, Hamoked says. 'We’ve never had a situation of mass forced disappearance from Gaza, with no information provided for weeks and weeks to families,' said Jessica Montell, the director of Hamoked. Israel's High Court of Justice has refused to intervene to get answers, despite Hamoked's petitions, she said. Asked by The Associated Press about the cases of Ajour and two other families it interviewed, the Israeli military declined comment. 4-year-old Masaa Ajour was shot, then separated from her mother The Ajours were sheltering at a home in Gaza City that belonged to Talal's family after being displaced from their own house earlier in the war. Israeli troops raided the home on March 24, opening fire as they burst in, Ajour said. Ajour, who was three months pregnant, was shot in the stomach. Talal was wounded in his leg, bleeding heavily. Masaa lay passed out, shot in the shoulder – though Ajour said she saw her still breathing. As one soldier bandaged the little girl's wound, another pointed his gun in Ajour’s face and told her to head out of Gaza City. She said she pleaded that she couldn’t leave Masaa and Talal, but the soldier screamed: 'Go south!' With no choice, Ajour collected her younger son and went down to the street. 'It was all in a blink of an eye. It was all so fast,' she said. Still bleeding, she walked for two and a half hours, clutching her son. When they reached a hospital in central Gaza, doctors treated her stomach wound and found her fetus’ pulse. Weeks later, doctors found the pulse had gone. She miscarried. Ajour said that several weeks later, a Palestinian released from a prison in southern Israel told her family he had heard her husband’s name called out over a loudspeaker among a list of detainees. The rumor has kept her hope alive, but the military told Hamoked it had no record of Masaa or Talal being detained. Another possibility is that they died on the scene, but no one has been able to search the rubble of the family's building to determine if any bodies are there. The storming of their building came as Israeli forces were battling Hamas fighters in surrounding streets while raiding nearby Shifa Hospital, where it claimed the militants were based. Troops cleared families out of nearby homes and often then destroyed or set the buildings ablaze, according to witnesses at the time. The military itself may not know what happened to Ajour’s husband and daughter, said Montell of Hamoked. 'That illustrates a broader problem,' she said. Ajour and her son now shelter in a tent camp outside the central Gaza town of Zuweida. Masaa, she said, 'was my first joy' — with blond hair and olive-colored eyes, a face 'white like the moon.' Masaa’s fifth birthday was in July, Ajour said, sobbing. 'She turned five while she is not with me.' Does the military document what troops do in Gaza? Under a wartime revision to Israeli law, Palestinians from Gaza taken to military detention in Israel can be held for over two months without access to the outside world. Israel says the law is necessary to handle the unprecedented number of detainees as it seeks to destroy Hamas following the Oct. 7 2023, attack on Israel that killed 1,200 and took around 250 people hostage inside Gaza. The military has transferred some 1,770 of its Gaza detainees to civilian prisons, according to rights groups, but it has not revealed the number still in its detention. Milena Ansari, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said Israel is obligated under international law to document what happens during every home raid and detention. But the military is not transparent about the information it collects on detainees or on how many it is holding, she said. Hamoked has asked the military for the whereabouts of 900 missing Palestinians. The military confirmed around 500 of them were detained in Israel. It said it had no record of detaining the other 400. The group petitioned Israel’s High Court of Justice seeking answers in 52 cases, including that of Masaa and two other children, where witnesses testified that the missing were handled by troops before their disappearances. 'The judges just dismiss the cases, without even inquiring what measures might be necessary to prevent such cases in the future,' said Montell. A court spokesperson said it often asks the military to provide additional information but isn’t authorized to investigate if the military says it is not detaining them. In the cases of three missing adult Palestinians presented by Hamoked, the military first claimed it was not holding them, then found records of them being detained after being pressed by Hamoked to double-check. In another case, military police discovered that two Palestinians they had initially denied holding -- a father and his adult son -- had died in Israeli custody. The U.N. Human Rights Office says at least 53 Palestinians are known to have died in Israeli detention during the war. Ailing with cancer, Mahmoud Alghrabli disappeared after raid The last time the Alghrabli family saw their 76-year-old patriarch, Mahmoud Alghrabli, was when Israeli troops stormed their district in Khan Younis on Feb. 4. The soldiers ordered residents out of the area. The Alghrablis had to carry Mahmoud, suffering from cancer, out of their building on a chair, his son Ahmed Algharbli told the AP. After detaining some men, the soldiers ordered the rest to leave. Mahmoud Alghrabli made it to a sand mound near the house. Ahmed Algharbli said his brother went to help the father, but soldiers shouted at him to leave. 'He left our father by force, or he would have been shot,' he said. The family returned a month later. There was no trace of Mahmoud. Ahmed Algharbli said he 'walked meter by meter' searching for traces, finding bones but not knowing whose they were. He keeps them wrapped in a piece of cloth at home. Hamoked was told by the military there was no indication of him in Israeli detention. 'By God, I don’t sleep at night,' said Mahmoud’s wife, Sabah Abdul-Salam. Whether he was arrested or killed, she said, 'let us know, we will rest.' Mahmoud Almoqayed vanished while searching for his family The only traces left of another missing man, 77-year-old Mahmoud Almoqayed, are his torn shirt and pants with his ID in the pocket. They were found in the dirt near the school where he and his family were sheltering when it was raided by Israeli troops on May 23 in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. The soldiers released Almoqayed and sent him and other men to another shelter, said his son, Rani Almoqayed, a doctor working in Saudi Arabia who pieced together the account from witnesses and family members. Once at the second shelter, the elderly Almoqayed immediately turned back, determined to find his wife and grandchildren left behind at the school, witnesses told his son. It was dark, well after 1 a.m., and troops were all around the area. Almoqayed was never seen by his family again. Weeks later, his family found his abandoned clothes. They also found skulls and body parts nearby, Rani Almoqayed said. The military police told Hamoked it had no indication Almoqayed was detained. Rani Almoqayed believes it's possible his father was killed and Israeli troops took the body. Since December 2023, the military has returned at least 318 bodies and a sack of body parts to Gaza after seizing them to search for hostages, a senior U.N. official in Gaza told the AP, speaking anonymously to discuss confidential matters. The bodies, with no identification and often decomposed, are buried in anonymous mass graves. The family had Mahmoud Almoqayed declared officially dead, his son said. 'But the doubt will not stop and one’s heart won’t ease unless they see the body.' ___ El Deeb reported from Beirut, and Frankel from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-war-missing-military-court-f5a8633d750e496e1fe91dd07fa71a4f	2024-12-10T20:02:53-08:00	
Stock market today: Trading muted on Wall Street ahead of key US inflation report	Trading on Wall Street was muted early Wednesday ahead of the latest update on inflation coming out before markets open. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 edged less than 0.1% higher before the bell, while futures for the Dow were off less than 0.1%. Wednesday’s update on consumer inflation and a report Thursday on inflation at the wholesale level will be the final big pieces of data the Federal Reserve will get before its meeting next week, where many investors expect this year’s third cut to interest rates. The Fed has been easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high since September to take pressure off the slowing jobs market, after bringing inflation nearly down to its 2% target. Lower rates would help give support to the economy, but they could also provide more fuel for inflation. Expectations for a series of cuts through next year have been a big reason the S&amp;P 500 has set so many records this year. In premarket trading Wednesday, Macy's tumbled close to 10% after the department store chain reported a decline in third-quarter profits and sales as consumers continue to divert spending toward essentials amid elevated prices. Macy's raised its annual sales forecast but lowered profit projections, citing an uncertain economic environment. Shares of Kroger stabilized early Wednesday following a more than 5% decline late Tuesday when the supermarket giant's proposed merger with Albertsons was nixed by judges in separate cases in Oregon and Washington. The grocery stores contend the merger would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, but critics of the deal, including the Federal Trade Commission, said the tie-up would hurt competition. Stitch Fix was a big gainer early Wednesday after the personalized fashion styling service posted a narrower loss than expected raised its full-year outlook. Its shares jumped 20% before the bell. Dave &amp; Buster's tumbled 15% after the restaurant and arcade chain posted more than double the loss that Wall Street expected as sales fell. In Europe at midday, Germany’s DAX was flat, while the CAC 40 in Paris and Britain’s FTSE 100 each gained 0.3%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.8% to 20,155.05 while the Shanghai Composite index advanced 0.3% to 3,432.49 as Chinese leaders convened an annual planning meeting in Beijing that is expected to set economic policies and growth targets for the coming year. Earlier this week, top leaders agreed on a 'moderately loose' monetary policy during a meeting of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo. That’s the first move in 10 years away from a more cautious, 'prudent' stance. Readouts from state media hinted at more robust stimulus to support the world’s second-largest economy, but analysts remained skeptical about any dramatic measures. South Korea's market rose for a second straight day, recovering from last week's political turmoil. The Kospi added 1% to 2,442.51. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was little changed at 39,372.23 after data showed that Japan’s wholesale inflation in November rose 3.7% year-on-year, marking three consecutive months of increases and adding to pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates. Japan's central bank will hold a two-day policy meeting next week. Markets widely expect the bank to raise short-term interest rates from the current level of 0.25%. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped 0.5% to 8,353.60. U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 91 cents to $69.50 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 7 cents to $71.05 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 152.65 Japanese yen from 151.93 yen. The euro was trading at $1.0504, down from $1.0531.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-inflation-rates-f52917dbab997a2c95fbeb9b83d175f1	2024-12-10T19:37:44-08:00	
What should I do?' Unpredictable school fees bar many children in Africa from an education	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — The day Shalom Mirembe was sent home from school last month over unpaid tuition, her father lay dying in a hospital. Even as her mother sat by his bedside, school officials were calling and demanding payment. For Mirembe's mother, a shoe vendor who looks after four children, it was a heartbreaking moment in the daily struggle to pay often unpredictable and unregulated school fees. Constant threats demanding payment can leave her feeling helpless. Some officials are more tolerant, but eventually they all grow tired of her pleas. 'You have to care for this one, you have to care for the other one,' Justine Nangero said, describing a delicate balancing act to keep Mirembe and the others enrolled. 'I try to fight to see that I pay to all these schools.' It is a crushing issue for many across sub-Saharan Africa, where the lack of a few hundred dollars can determine a child's future. The region has long had the world's highest dropout rates. Reasons vary, but financial pain is the biggest. Last year, the World Bank said 54% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa rank the issue of paying school fees higher than medical bills and other expenses. It said school fees were the biggest source of financial worry for 40% of people in Uganda, where top government-funded schools now charge nearly $700 in tuition per three-month term. That's a significant amount in this East African country where annual GDP per capita was $864 in 2023. More than anything, it’s the unpredictable tuition hikes — for sometimes questionable reasons — that haunt parents across the country of more than 45 million people. Some critics, including Uganda's parliament speaker, have called for regulation to protect parents from exploitation. The Equal Opportunities Commission, a government agency that tracks inequality and discrimination, released a report in September calling for punitive measures against government-supported schools that appear to set excessive fees. It warned that arbitrarily raising fees can force children to drop out. Attendance falls from 68% in grade school to 22% in secondary school, with financial difficulty the main reason for failure to continue studies, according to new figures from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. Uganda does have a program for universal secondary education, introduced in 2007 and similar to one for primary education, but such schools are often rundown and undesirable for many families. They are generally tuition-free, but parents must pay sometimes burdensome fees for uniforms, textbooks and other items. When it comes to more popular, and more expensive, private schools, the government is not interested in price intervention, said Dennis Mugimba, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education. Setting fees for private schools is 'purely administrative and it is adjusted according to the business environment,' he said. But certain charges such as those including 'capital development' should not be the responsibility of parents, he said. Such private schools have mushroomed across Uganda and now make up the majority of the country's schools, addressing growing demand but also emphasizing the profitability of education as a business. That worries some experts. 'We can’t let education be treated like a market stall,' said Fagil Mandy, a former inspector of schools. Education authorities should standardize regulations to make school fees universally predictable, he said. Routine school expenses, for both private and some top government-funded schools, can include everything from a contribution towards the purchase of a bus to the procurement of laboratory equipment. But when the list of fees includes a ream of photocopying paper or a bag of cement from each student, questions emerge about where they end up. The school that Mirembe attends outside the capital, Kampala, charges the equivalent of $300 per term. Its officials expect 70% of fees to be paid at the beginning of a term, but many parents fail to meet that threshold. Some, like Nangero, send their children to school having paid nothing, counting on the mercy of officials. But measures to track payments include gate passes that show how much is owed and when, and a student may be denied entry, said Joanita Seguya, a deputy head teacher at the school, Wampewo Ntakke Secondary. In the school of more than 2,100 students, roughly 400 are from working-class families that routinely struggle to pay fees, according to Seguya, who said the system can seem harsh. To accommodate some parents, the school accepts in-kind payments such as vegetables and fruit, she said. But Nangero, whose family shares a single room, has nothing of the sort to offer. Her shoe business, long drained of cash by school fees, has collapsed. The death of her husband, whose carpentry once supplemented the family income, has increased the pain. She said anxiety over school fees is more damaging for her children, who spend days at home whenever school officials lose patience. She's grateful that two of her sons in secondary school are now supported by an evangelical cleric — rare support made possible via contact through their religious fellowship. The 20-year-old Mirembe, who is taking her final exams this year, was able to start the school term in September because of a bursar's sympathy, she said, but other officials were not so lenient weeks later as her father was near death. 'At least maybe I will come and pay something tomorrow,' her mother recalled pleading with one official. 'And she told me, ‘No, we are not going to allow your daughter to be here.’' Mirembe arrived home hours before her father died. Vincent Odoi, a teacher at her school, recalled the incident as unfortunate, saying administrators didn’t know of the family’s challenges. Mirembe was allowed to return days after her father’s burial, which some of her teachers attended. Other families are not so fortunate. One is a nearby family of seven children who dropped out of school in recent years for lack of tuition. Their jobless father, Moses Serikomawa, described the scramble in vain for school fees as 'like a cancer. It cannot be treated.' Raising a total of over $200 in school fees each term is too much trouble when the family sometimes lacks food, he said. His oldest child, who would be in high school now, dropped out after completing secondary school last year. Now the boy is idle. 'The children still want to go back to school,' Serikomawa said. 'When I look at my children, there is no joy, no joy at all.' ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Humanitarian aid to North Gaza mostly blocked for the last 2 months, UN says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Humanitarian aid to North Gaza, where Israel launched a ground offensive on Oct. 6, has largely been blocked for the past 66 days, the United Nations said Tuesday. That has left between 65,000 and 75,000 Palestinians without access to food, water, electricity or health care, according to the world body. In the north, Israel has continued its siege on Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya with Palestinians living there largely denied aid, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, said. Recently, it said, about 5,500 people were forcibly displaced from three schools in Beit Lahiya to Gaza City. Adding to the food crisis, only four U.N.-supported bakeries are currently operating throughout the Gaza Strip, all of them in Gaza City, OCHA said. Sigrid Kaag, the senior U.N. humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told reporters after briefing the U.N. Security Council behind closed doors Tuesday afternoon that civilians trying to survive in Gaza face an 'utterly devastating situation.' She pointed to the breakdown in law and order and looting that has exacerbated a very dire situation and left the U.N. and many aid organizations unable to deliver food and other humanitarian essentials to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in need. Kaag said she and other U.N. officials keep repeatedly asking Israel for access for convoys to North Gaza and elsewhere, to allow in commercial goods, to reopen the Rafah crossing from Egypt in the south, and to approve dual-use items. Israel’s U.N. Mission said it had no comment on Kaag’s remarks. The U.N. has established the logistics for an operation across Gaza, she said, but there is no substitute for political will that humanitarians don’t possess. 'Member states possess it,' Kaag said. And this is what she urged Security Council members and keeps urging the broader international community to press for — the political will to address Gaza’s worsening humanitarian crisis.	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-aid-united-nations-f529bf77d09e609265179e259b799c6b	2024-12-10T15:45:24-08:00	
Ex-defense chief in South Korea tried to kill himself after being arrested over martial law case	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s previous defense minister was stopped from attempting suicide while in detention over last week's martial law, officials said, as police were reported to be raiding President Yoon Suk Yeol’s office Wednesday in their intensifying investigation. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party also plans to submit a new motion to impeach Yoon for his Dec. 3 declaration that imposed martial law. Yoon’s ill-conceived power grab has paralyzed South Korean politics, frozen its foreign policy, and rattled financial markets, greatly reducing his chances of completing his five-year term and casting a turbulent shadow over one of Asia’s most robust democracies. Shin Yong Hae, commissioner general of of the Korea Correctional Service, told lawmakers Wednesday that Kim tried to kill himself at a detention center in Seoul. He said that Kim's suicide attempt failed after center officials stopped him and that he is in a stable condition now. At the same parliament committee meeting, Justice Minister Park Sung Jae confirmed Kim's failed suicide attempt. Kim was arrested earlier Wednesday after a Seoul court approved a warrant for him on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. Kim became the first person formally arrested over the Dec. 3 martial law decree. Later in the day, National Police Agency Commissioner General Cho Ji Ho and Kim Bong-sik, head of the metropolitan police agency of the capital, Seoul, were detained over their actions during martial law. They are being investigated for their roles in deploying police forces to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting to lift Yoon’s martial law decree. South Korean police also searched Yoon's office Wednesday over his martial law decree, Yonhap news agency reported. Other South Korean media also carried similar reports. but Yoon's office and police have not immediately confirmed the search. The country’s main law enforcement institutions are focusing on finding whether Yoon and others involved in imposing martial law committed the crime of rebellion. Yoon survived an impeachment attempt last Saturday when the ruling party boycotted the vote, but the Democratic Party is aiming to put the new motion to a vote on Saturday. After last week’s impeachment motion fell through, the leader of Yoon’s conservative party pledged to arrange his stable exit from power, saying the party will coordinate with Cabinet members over state affairs and that Yoon will be sidelined from duties during a transition to an early election. However, the plans have been widely criticized as unrealistic and unconstitutional. The constitution explicitly states that impeachment is the sole method for suspending presidential powers and that the authority to command the military rests solely with the president. The Defense Ministry said this week that Yoon remains in charge of the country’s military forces. The Assembly was also encircled by heavily armed troops, which military commanders say were deployed on the orders of the former defense minister. But enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and unanimously rejected Yoon’s decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun to obstruct lawmakers from entering the Assembly’s main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim’s instructions was to prevent the 300-member parliament from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon’s martial law order. Kwak said Yoon later called him directly and asked for the troops to 'quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.' Kwak said he discussed Yoon’s order with the commander at the scene and that they concluded there was nothing that could be done, ruling out the possibility of threatening the lawmakers by shooting blanks or cutting off electricity. At the same hearing, senior officer Kim Dae-woo of the military’s counterintelligence agency said his commander, Yeo In-hyung, asked him if an army bunker in Seoul had space to detain politicians and other figures after martial law was imposed. Yeo is considered a close associate of Kim Yong Hyun. Last week, Hong Jang-won, a deputy director of the country’s spy agency, said Yoon ordered him to help Yeo’s command to detain some of his political rivals but he ignored the president’s order. Kwak and Yeo are among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended them last week. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If he is dismissed from office, a new presidential election would be required. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' and South Korea wasn’t in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean Constitution doesn’t allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces,' a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has had near-constant friction with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which introduced motions to impeach some of his top officials and launched a political offensive over scandals involving Yoon and his wife. On Wednesday, North Korea’s state news agency for the first time reported about the political turmoil and street protests triggered by Yoon’s martial law decree. The report mostly attempted to explain the South Korean events though it used its typical abusive language like calling Yoon 'a traitor' and his military 'gangsters.' Many experts say North Korea is sensitive to the domestic spread of news on massive anti-government protests in foreign countries because its own people have no official access to international news and could be affected by such events.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-3210438b8663fe609bfe4cb8b748a114	2024-12-10T15:35:52-08:00	
Vandals burn a car and spray graffiti in latest antisemitic attack in Australia	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Vandals torched a car and sprayed graffiti with anti-Israel slogans including an apparently misspelled 'Kill Israiel' on Wednesday in a Sydney suburb that is home to Australia's largest Jewish community. Officials condemned the attack as antisemitic. The incident in the eastern suburb of Woollahra came after federal police this week established a task force to investigate increasing antisemitic crimes across the country. Police were searching for two male suspects, aged between 15 and 20, who were seen running from the scene of the attack, wearing face masks, or balaclavas, and dark clothing, New South Wales state Police Commissioner Karen Webb said. She said there were 'antisemitic writings' on the walls of two buildings, two cars including the burnt car, and the sidewalks. She did not detail what words were spraypainted, but the media photographed 'Kill Israiel' painted on a garage door. Last week's arson at a Melbourne synagogue marked an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and the militant Hamas group started over a year ago in the Gaza Strip. Premier Chris Minns, the Sydney-based leader of the New South Wales state government, described the attack as an attempt to 'intimidate the Jewish community in Sydney.' 'This was a targeted attack in Sydney’s eastern suburbs ... directly after the burning down of a synagogue,' Minns told reporters. 'This was a deliberate attack ... designed to put fear into the hearts of the people who live in Sydney’s east,' he added. Police say the torched car had been stolen from elsewhere and used by the suspects to get to Woolahra. Stolen cars are often torched before they are abandoned. Two men are in custody facing multiple charges after buildings were similarly graffitied with antisemitic slogans and a car was set alight in another part of Woolahra on Nov. 21. They each face prison sentences of up to 10 years if convicted. Assistant Police Commissioner Peter McKenna said detectives did not believe the Woollahra crimes were linked. 'We will get to the bottom of this. We will bring people to justice,' McKenna said. David Ossip, president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, which represents the state's Jewish community, said the latest Woolahra attack was part of a 'sustained campaign of intimidation, harassment and terror against the Jewish community.' 'But the message to the perpetrators and all who wish ill on the Jewish community is that the Jewish community is strong, it is proud, it is united and it will not be cowed by these attempts to intimidate and harass us,' Ossip said. This week, authorities declared the attack on Melbourne's Adass Israel Synagogue a terrorist attack, which increases the resources and information available to investigators. Also this week, federal police announced Special Operation Avalite to target those behind antisemitic attacks around the country — including the arson at the Melbourne synagogue, the attack on Jewish lawmaker Josh Burns’ Melbourne office in June, and the Woollahra attacks last month. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the Woollahra attack on Wednesday as an 'outrage' and a 'hate crime.' 'It is another antisemitic attack and all Australians must condemn it,' Albanese said. 'I stand with the Jewish community and unequivocally condemn this attack. There’s no place for antisemitism in this country or anywhere else for that matter.' He said he had been briefed by Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw on the attack and would soon be briefed by Special Operation Avalite officials, and rejected allegations the attack could be a criticism of Israel rather than Jews. 'This isn’t an attack on a government, this is an attack on people because they happen to be Jewish,' Albanese said. 'The idea that we take a conflict overseas and bring it here is something that is quite contrary to what Australia was built on.' Government opponents argue that Albanese has been too slow to call out rising antisemitism for fear of alienating pro-Palestinian groups. Opposition Sen. Jane Hume said she knew a Jewish couple who were considering moving from Australia to Israel because they would feel safer there, despite the raging Mideast wars. 'Because the government has prevaricated, because it has used weasel words and wishy-washy language, it does seem that those that are committing these offenses have been emboldened if not enabled by a government that has failed to take leadership,' Hume said. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish global human rights organization, issued a travel warning on Tuesday, urging Jews to 'exercise extreme caution' in Australia as 'a result of the failure of Australian authorities to stand up against persistent demonization, harassment and violence against Jews and Jewish institutions in Australia.'	https://apnews.com/article/australia-sydney-graffiti-woollahra-antisemitism-89f8b08f58047ba1e3e7fb8c6447f52f	2024-12-10T14:07:37-08:00	
The swift fall of Syria's Assad brings moments inconceivable under his iron rule	It took barely 10 days for Syria’s insurgents to march from their stronghold in the northwest into Damascus and bring an end to the Assad family rule that had gripped the country for half a century. Every step of the way brought moments that would have been unbelievable only days earlier. Raising their hands and automatic rifles into the air, insurgents rode out of their enclave in Idlib province on Nov. 28. Some wore Islamic extremist emblems on their uniforms, a sign of the jihadi roots of the leading insurgent faction, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. First to fall was Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, with a swiftness that may have amazed even the fighters. They celebrated by taking photos of each other stomping on a poster of President Bashar Assad in his sunglasses and military uniform. At the airport, they tore down a poster glorifying the ruling family — Bashar; his father and predecessor Hafez Assad; and Bashar’s elder brother Basel, who was supposed to succeed their father but died in a 1994 car crash. More towns and cities fell like dominoes in the following days, including Hama and Homs. Along the way, Assad’s army melted away. Surrendered soldiers lined up for rebel-issued certificates of amnesty. Advancing rebel fighters passed army trucks and tanks abandoned on the side of the highway. There was little fighting. The main response from the government was sporadic airstrikes from Syrian and Russian warplanes. Among the dead was a Syrian photographer, Anas Alkharboutli, who worked for Germany’s DPA news agency. Friends mourned over his body, his press helmet and flak jacket laid on his chest. Overnight Saturday into early Sunday, the fighters marched unopposed into their greatest prize, the capital, Damascus. Assad and his family fled, ultimately taken in by his ally Russia. Assad's regime was deplored by many for its brutality and corruption. Insurgents and civilians celebrated his downfall by waltzing freely into his private residence and ransacking it. One man yanked a chandelier from the ceiling. A fighter posed for a photo behind a gigantic desk surrounded by luxurious furniture of wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl. A family posed in the palace’s grandiose atrium lined with colored marble beneath a giant chandelier. Others streamed into the biggest symbol of Assad’s police state, Saydnaya Prison, hoping to find relatives who had disappeared years or even decades earlier. One man held up nooses he found — a reminder of the mass executions that rights groups say killed thousands of inmates. Insurgents set fire to a military court building, where rights group say death sentences were churned out after perfunctory trials that often lasted just minutes. Some insurgents danced in the streets while others posed — cheering — on an army tank. Many waved the flag of the Syrian opposition, green, white and black with three red stars, instead of the Assad-era flag of red, white and black with two green stars. The insurgent takeover has pushed the country into the unknown. There is potential for more chaos with jihadi militants hoping to seize power and the possibility of conflicts between the many armed factions. But with the end of Assad’s rule, it is a time for celebration.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-fall-of-assad-photo-gallery-f4862a7f801eae711a69482f04b88c8a	2024-12-10T11:08:26-08:00	
Citizens against smog: Protesters in North Macedonia demand action against pollution	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — Thousands of protesters across North Macedonia took part in demonstrations Tuesday to demand better air quality in cities that are among the most polluted in Europe. In the capital, Skopje, demonstrators gathered outside the Environment Ministry, some wearing gas masks to highlight the problem blamed by authorities for some 3,500 premature deaths annually. Pollution levels often spike during the winter months due to the widespread use of log fires. Many urban households, unable to afford central heating, burn wood, old tires, plastic and other waste materials, releasing a toxic mix of harmful chemicals. Protest organizers called for rare national action after winter weather brought another spike in air pollution levels. They demand stricter government regulation of traffic and industry, citing decades of neglect. Gorjan Jovanovski, a prominent environmental campaigner who created a mobile app to monitor air quality, said pollution was forcing city-dwellers to flee as 'ecological migrants.' 'It’s enough! We have waited decades for governments to act, but they’ve done nothing,' Jovanovski said. According to European Union health authorities, pollution levels in Skopje and other Macedonian cities often exceed World Health Organization's limits by more than four times. Several thousands joined Tuesday's protests that were organized by Green Human City, one of several environmental campaign organizations largely focused on air pollution.	https://apnews.com/article/north-macedonia-pollution-protest-e865d9fcd676f6ba169dfc636aeb312d	2024-12-10T10:39:52-08:00	
Haitians demand protection after gang leader massacres dozens of people to avenge son's death	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A gang leader accused of killing more than 100 people in Haiti's capital to avenge his son's death was still persecuting residents on Tuesday, according to a rare witness account. Mackenson Cangé, whose father was among the victims, told Magik9 radio station that residents in the gang-controlled area said gunmen were still hunting down older people and killing younger ones as well. 'I believe in the justice of my country. But I’m tired of the government (only) condemning these massacres. We need to take action,' he said. Few details about the two-day killing spree in the community of Cité Soleil on Friday and Saturday have been made public. Residents have not been allowed to leave, and no images of the killings have been shared on social media like they often have been in previous incidents. A spokesman for Haiti’s National Police did not return messages for comment on Tuesday. Neither did the leader of a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police that deployed earlier this year to help quell gang violence in Haiti. For years, police have been unable to penetrate the gang-controlled area, and even human rights groups have not been able to access it this time, relying on witnesses who live there and often refuse to talk for fear of being killed. Two local human rights groups say more than 100 people were killed on Friday and Saturday, while Volker Türk, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said at least 184 people were killed. It isn't clear how they determined the number of victims. Numbers vary wildly following massacres in Haiti since they occur in areas with limited or no access. The killings blamed on gang leader Micanor Altès, also known as Monel Felix and Wa Mikanò, were triggered by his son’s illness and eventual death, according to the National Human Rights Defense Network and the Cooperative for Peace and Development. The two rights groups said Altès blamed Vodou religious leaders and older people in the community of practicing witchcraft and harming his son. On Tuesday, Haiti’s Office of Citizen Protection decried the killings, noting the victims were between 60 and 80 years old. The ombudsman agency said 'sorcery accusations never justify violence or summary executions. Older people, who have contributed so much to society, deserve respect and protection.' It called on police and judicial officials to react quickly and identify all those responsible. The Haitian Bridge Alliance, a U.S.-based nonprofit, also called for a thorough investigation on Tuesday as it demanded that the government improve security. 'This massacre is a profound tragedy that underscores the escalating crisis of gang violence and lawlessness in Haiti,' said Guerline Jozef, the alliance's executive director. Altès controls the coastal communities of Wharf Jérémie, La Saline and Fort Dimanche and is known for robbery, extortion and hijacking of goods and trucks, according to a U.N. report. Experts say he was not known for being as brutal as other Haitian gang leaders. Cangé said residents in Wharf Jérémie told him that gunmen are still hunting down older people and killing young ones as well. He said his father, Marcel Cangé, was killed after three men showed up at his home on Friday night and demanded he go with them. The older Cangé was already preparing for bed because he was going to church early Saturday and liked to be punctual. When he requested that the men allow him to put on a shirt and pants, they told him it wasn’t necessary, according to his son. 'I never believed something like that would happen to my father,' Mackenson Cangé said, noting he had lived in that community for 29 years. 'My father was assassinated. Stabbed and then burnt.' Cangé said he personally knows some 30 other people who were killed. His mother and sister, who lived with his father, survived. 'I lost a best friend, someone who supported me my whole life,' Cangé said. The gang-controlled area, like many others, remains inaccessible to police and other authorities. While the government has pledged to bring those responsible to justice, it wasn’t clear how it planned to do so. 'A red line has been crossed, and the state will mobilize all its forces to track down and destroy these criminals,' the government said in a statement Monday. More than 4,500 people have been reported killed so far this year in Haiti.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-massacre-killed-gangs-5fe82962c3111f433308ec1b28913857	2024-12-10T10:34:02-08:00	
Venezuela's opposition signals flexible timeline toward long-sought government transition	MADRID (AP) — Venezuela’s political opposition on Tuesday signaled a shift toward a flexible timeline for a government transition that it had long insisted would come next month when the new presidential term is set to begin. The change came as the faction’s candidate in the July presidential election, Edmundo González, remained in exile in Spain and its leader Maria Corina Machado continued to hide in Venezuela, both efforts meant to avoid arrest, with only 30 days left before Venezuela’s constitutionally mandated swearing-in ceremony. The move underscores the challenges the opposition coalition faces to deliver on its promise to remove President Nicolás Maduro from office, even as dozens of nations back the faction's claim to victory and denounce the government for electoral fraud. 'On January 10, the one who is against the wall is really Maduro, not us,' Machado said via livestream during an event in Madrid, that highlighted the repression ruling party opponents have faced since the July 28 election. 'When will that understanding really be reached and trigger the transition? It could be before, it could be on January 10, it could be after.' Machado did not give details of the 'terms of a negotiation' which she said the opposition has offered the government. But the faction has repeatedly said that a top priority is the release from prison of hundreds of people detained for being actual or perceived government opponents. Venezuela’s National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared him the election winner hours after polls closed. But unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. Meanwhile, the main opposition coalition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said the voting records showed González won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. The government ignored calls for transparency from inside and outside Venezuela, and instead, the ruling party-controlled National Assembly sent Maduro an invitation for his swearing-in ceremony. González left Venezuela in September for exile in Spain after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with an investigation into the publishing of the vote tally sheets, while Machado has been hiding for months at an undisclosed location, which she says is in Venezuela. González again told reporters Tuesday that he is willing to return to Venezuela to take office. 'I see myself assuming the position for which I was voted by the majority of Venezuelans on July 28,' he said without offering a timeframe. Dozens of governments, including the United States, have recognized González as the election winner, but it is unclear whether Maduro and allies would allow him to enter Venezuela. Anti-government protests erupted nationwide the day after the election, drawing repression from state security forces, which arrested more than 2,200 people, including political leaders, lawyers, poll workers, election volunteers and protesters, both minors and adults. Relatives of a few of the detained attended the event in Madrid and spoke of the conditions detainees face. The arrests had a chilling effect across the country, with people carefully choosing what they say in public or on social media. The move also hit the opposition's capacity to summon thousands to the streets. Not a single massive rally has taken place since August, but Machado sought to quelch doubts about the strength of her movement, arguing that it continues to gain 'more and more support' and characterizing the repression as the actions of a government 'in a terminal state.' 'We were told that it was impossible for us to defeat the regime on July 28, and we did,' she said. 'The voices that today want us to believe that it is not possible to enforce (the election’s result) will be wrong again. So, it is time to move forward firmly.'	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-election-president-maduro-opposition-machado-edmundo-f9edc6ec5276728eeea6446010b09c2a	2024-12-10T09:09:55-08:00	
Syrians in Germany worried by some politicians' eagerness for them to go home after Assad's fall	BERLIN (AP) — Nearly a decade after he arrived in Germany from Syria and took a selfie with then-Chancellor Angela Merkel, Anas Modamani has finished his university studies and has a German passport. He’s less positive about some German politicians’ reactions to the fall of Bashar Assad, which was followed within hours by the first talk of Syrians returning. 'Berlin has become my second home, I will definitely stay here,' Modamani said Tuesday. 'I managed it' — a reference to Merkel's famous slogan 'We will manage it,' coined as Germany faced the challenge of integrating hundreds of thousands of migrants. As Syrians took to the streets of Berlin Sunday, far-right leader Alice Weidel wrote on social platform X that anyone celebrating a 'free Syria' in Germany 'evidently no longer has a reason to flee. He should return to Syria immediately.' With a German election approaching and the government under longstanding pressure to reduce irregular migration, some mainstream opposition politicians also appeared eager to kickstart the return of Syrians. On Monday, prominent conservative lawmaker Jens Spahn suggested on n-tv television the government could say that 'for everyone who wants to go back to Syria, we will charter planes for them, they will get a starting fund of 1,000 euros ($1,055).' He stressed, though, that it will take time before it's clear whether things have stabilized. Such ideas strike Syrians as indecently hasty. Modamani, a 27-year-old from Damascus who came to Germany in 2015, said he was 'shocked' by reports of the 1,000-euro proposal. 'I think that’s a terrible idea,' he said as he sat over lunch with Syrian friends at a Berlin restaurant. 'The situation in Syria is still just as dangerous as before.' Modamani, who says he shares an apartment with his girlfriend from Ukraine and finished his studies in business communication, illustrates what German officials acknowledge is the successful integration of many Syrians. A deputy interior minister, Juliane Seifert, said Syrians are 'a group that has significantly above-average educational qualifications,' among them many doctors. The number of Syrians gaining German citizenship has risen from 6,700 in 2020 to 75,500 last year, when they were the biggest single group and accounted for 38% of all naturalizations. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, whose conservative party has talked tough on migration, said Tuesday that many Syrian refugees are now 'superbly integrated in our country, have a job and are urgently needed here' and no one is thinking of getting such people to leave Germany. 'Those who have already integrated well are still cordially welcome,' Herrmann told Deutschlandfunk radio Tuesday. 'But it is clear that there are also people who have been here for 10 years and don’t have a job and haven’t integrated well, and then it’s right to help them return to their homeland' if Syria stabilizes. It's not surprising that hopes of a more stable Syria raise hopes in Germany of reducing immigration. Official figures show that, at the end of October, there were nearly 975,000 Syrian nationals in Germany, a country of 83 million. The majority had some kind of refugee or other protected status. On Monday, Germany and a string of other European countries announced that they were suspending decisions on Syrians' asylum applications as they wait for the situation in Syria to become clearer. Over 47,000 cases are pending in Germany, one of the main destinations for Syrians outside the Middle East. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said that is the right thing to do, but it would be 'unserious to speculate in such a volatile situation' about the eventual return of Syrians. Among those who will may face a longer wait is Basil Khalil, a 26-year-old Kurdish Syrian who said he applied for asylum Monday after crossing from Turkey into Bulgaria and traveling to Germany on the back of a truck. Khalil said he spent the last nine years as a refugee in Turkey, but was worried that Turkish authorities may soon start deporting Syrians. 'I applied for asylum in Germany because I’m afraid that back in Syria I may get drafted as a soldier,' he told The Associated Press as his cousin translated for him. 'But if the German government will deport me, then I guess I will go back,' Khalil said. 'We Syrians have been through so much suffering, all we want to do is survive.' Tarek Alaows, a spokesperson for pro-refugee group Pro Asyl, said that 'many from the Syrian community naturally want to return ... Many want to participate in the reconstruction. But they must not be forced to leave the country' for a still-unstable Syria. Alaows, 35, who fled Damascus in 2015 and became a German citizen over three years ago, said many Syrians in Germany were concerned to hear public calls so soon for the quick return of Syrians. 'These debates that are going on right now — nobody needs them,' he said. Yamn Molhem, who arrived 10 years ago, sees it the same way. The 39-year-old father of four now manages the Aldimashqi restaurant on Berlin’s Sonnenallee boulevard, known for its many Arabic stores and businesses. 'All of my family has left Aleppo, and the situation in Syria is generally very unstable,' he said. Molhem said he is applying for a German passport, proudly adding that his youngest son already has one. ’They can’t deport our family,' said, 'My son is German.' In general, Molhem said, Germans should think twice before they even consider sending back Syrians who work, pay taxes and help keep the economy running. 'Syrians don’t just sleep here,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-syria-refugees-asylum-future-ab24be8f2ffef4e118ed12a4b0df110f	2024-12-10T08:04:27-08:00	
US says it will support new Syrian leaders who protect women and renounce terrorism	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Tuesday it will recognize and support a new Syrian government that renounces terrorism, destroys chemical weapons stocks and protects the rights of minorities and women. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the U.S. would work with groups in Syria and regional partners to ensure that the transition from President Bashar Assad’s deposed government runs smoothly. He was not specific about which groups the U.S. would work with, but the State Department has not ruled out talks with the main Syrian rebel group despite its designation as a terrorist organization. The qualified pledge of support for a post-Assad Syria comes as the Biden administration continues to look to target Islamic State fighters to prevent the group from reemerging as an international threat and maintains support for Israel as its forces conduct their own operations inside Syria. The sudden ouster of Assad has left President Joe Biden's outgoing administration having to delicately maneuver through yet another volatile moment in the Middle East and as President-elect Donald Trump demands that the United States tread carefully in the region and stay out of the fray. 'The transition process and new government must also uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbors, and ensure that any chemical or biological weapons stockpiles are secured and safely destroyed,' Blinken said. He added that Syrians should decide their future and that other countries should 'support an inclusive and transparent process' and not interfere. 'The United States will recognize and fully support a future Syria government that results from this process,' Blinken said. 'We stand prepared to lend all appropriate support to all of Syria’s diverse communities and constituencies.' The Assad government collapsed over the weekend during lightning strikes led by the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, known as HTS, which has been designated a 'foreign terrorist organization' by the U.S. since 2012. The State Department says it will review that designation if the group takes steps to reverse the reasons for it but says the listing itself does not prohibit discussions between its members and U.S. officials. Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, whom Trump has picked to serve as his national security adviser, said the 'jury is out' on HTS and its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani. 'On the one hand, though, he’s not, at least so far, beheading former Assad regime officials or hanging them from bridges. They do seem to be sitting and talking, which is a very, which is a good initial first sign,' Waltz said in a Fox News interview. 'But President Trump and our team are watching very closely., and we’re also watching very closely the tens of thousands of ISIS fighters and their, and their families that are still held in camps from when President Trump in his first term cleaned up and destroyed the ISIS caliphate.' The White House also signaled its approval of Israel’s strikes against Syrian military and alleged chemical weapons targets as well as the seizure of a buffer zone in the Golan Heights after the fall of the Assad government. 'These are exigent operations to eliminate what they believe are imminent threats to their national security,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday, saying the U.S. would leave it up to the Israelis to discuss their operations. 'They have, as always, the right to defend themselves,' Kirby said. He declined to say whether any U.S. intelligence cooperation with the Israelis may have gone into the strikes. Kirby said the White House was reasserting its support of the 1974 Golan Heights disengagement agreement, but he didn’t criticize the Israeli seizure of the demilitarized zone. The agreement on disengagement between Israel and Syria, which concluded the Yom Kippur War, established the buffer zone. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel's military is temporarily seizing control of the buffer zone, saying the disengagement agreement has collapsed with the rebel takeover of Syria. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar are condemning Israel’s deployment into Golan Heights, a plateau about 60 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Damascus. Israel seized the strategic highlands from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War and unilaterally annexed it in 1981. The U.S., during Trump's first White House term, became the only country to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan, which the rest of the international community regards as Israeli-occupied. Biden is dispatching his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Israel this week for talks with Netanyahu and Israelis officials about the situation in Syria and ongoing efforts to win a ceasefire and hostage deal that could bring an endgame to the war in Gaza. Sullivan is scheduled to meet on Tuesday at the White House with the families of American hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Kirby said while Israel and Hamas are 'not on the verge of completion of a deal,' U.S. officials think the evolving situation could bolster the chances of getting a deal done. 'Hamas has got to be looking out at the world today and realizing that the cavalry’s not coming to rescue them. and so one would hope that recent developments in Syria reinforce, for them, that they are just increasingly isolated and ought to take a deal,' Kirby said.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-united-states-assad-b02790878868ddb3d2f5bc887b66fd5e	2024-12-10T07:30:54-08:00	
US officials to investigate labor and human rights abuses in Nicaragua	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is opening an investigation into labor and human rights abuses in Nicaragua, impacting relations with a country the U.S. has a free trade deal with amid growing concerns over President Daniel Ortega’s increasingly authoritarian rule. The investigation being opened by the U.S. Trade Representative must be completed within a year. 'Numerous reports suggest the Government of Nicaragua is engaging in repressive acts that harm Nicaragua’s own workers and people, undermine fair competition, and destabilize our region,' U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a statement. The investigation, authorized under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, will look into not only allegations of abuse but also the extent to which they affect commerce with the U.S. Only after that determination is made will retaliatory actions, if any, be taken. The U.S. trade representative, in her statement, cited credible reports by several watchdog groups against Ortega's government, including politically-motivated arrests, forced labor, human trafficking and repression of freedom of association and collective bargaining. 'Such actions exacerbate worker exploitation and diminish economic growth and trade opportunities,' the agency said, adding that its decision to open the probe was part of a range of actions taken Tuesday to mark International Human Rights Day. Nicaragua Vice President and government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo did not immediately respond to an emailed request seeking comment. In May, the U.S. government imposed Section 301 tariffs on an array of Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel and aluminum. Those tariffs largely reflected the government’s conclusion that China was unfairly subsidizing those industries. 'For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies,' President Joe Biden said about those tariffs. 'It’s not competition, it’s cheating.' In Nicaragua’s case, any retaliatory action would be complicated by its membership in a regional free trade pact, the Central America Free Trade Agreement. Of the five members of the trade pact, Nicaragua is one of only two to run a trade surplus with the U.S., about $3 billion in 2022, or almost 20% of its gross domestic product. Ortega last month proposed a constitutional reform that would officially make him and his wife, Murillo, 'copresidents' of the Central American nation and extend the presidential term to six years from five. The proposals come amid an ongoing crackdown by the Ortega government that has resulted in the mass imprisonment and forced exile of adversaries including religious leaders and journalists. Since 2018, the government has shuttered more than 5,000 organizations, largely religious, and forced thousands to flee the country. — AP Writer Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/us-nicaragua-trade-investigation-labor-abuse-211917bda504c6b35a60c39709a71b2d	2024-12-10T07:09:32-08:00	
Japanese survivor of atomic bomb recalls its horrors in Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech	OSLO, Norway (AP) — A 92-year-old Japanese man who lived through the American atomic bombing of Nagasaki described on Tuesday the agony he witnessed in 1945, including the charred corpses of his loved ones and the ruins of his city, as he accepted this year's Nobel Peace Prize on his organization's behalf. The prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of Japanese atomic bombing survivors who have worked for nearly 70 years to maintain a taboo around the use of nuclear weapons. The weapons have grown exponentially in power and number since being used for the first and only time in warfare by the United States on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945. The bombings pushed Japan to surrender to the Allies. They killed some 210,000 people by the end of 1945, but the full death toll from radiation is certainly higher. As the survivors reach the twilight of their lives, they are grappling with the fear that the taboo against using the weapons appears to be weakening. It was a concern expressed by the 92-year-old-survivor, Terumi Tanaka, who delivered the acceptance lecture in Oslo's City Hall to an audience that included Norway's royal family. 'The nuclear superpower Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, and a cabinet member of Israel, in the midst of its unrelenting attacks on Gaza in Palestine, even spoke of the possible use of nuclear arms,' Tanaka said. 'I am infinitely saddened and angered that the nuclear taboo threatens to be broken.' That concern drove the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award this year's prize to the Japanese organization, though it had honored other nuclear non-proliferation work in the past. Jørgen Watne Frydnes, the chair of the committee, said in introducing the laureates that it was important to learn from their testimony as the nuclear dangers grow. 'None of the nine countries that possess nuclear weapons — the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea — appear interested in nuclear disarmament and arms control at present,' he said. 'On the contrary, they are modernizing and building up their nuclear arsenals.' He said the Norwegian Nobel Committee was calling upon the five nuclear weapon states that have signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons — the U.S., Russia, China, France and the U.K. — to take seriously their obligations under the treaty, and said others must ratify it. 'It is naive to believe our civilization can survive a world order in which global security depends on nuclear weapons,' Frydnes said. 'The world is not meant to be a prison in which we await collective annihilation.' In his speech, Tanaka described the attack on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. He recalled the buzzing sound of a bomber jet followed by a 'bright, white light,' and then an intense shock wave. Three days later, he and his mother sought out loved ones who lived near the hypocenter. 'Many people who were badly injured or burned, but still alive, were left unattended, with no help whatsoever. I became almost devoid of emotion, somehow closing off my sense of humanity, and simply headed intently for my destination,' he said. He found the charred body of an aunt, the body of her grandson, his grandfather on the brink of death with severe burns and another aunt who had been severely burned and died just before he arrived. In all, five family members were killed. He described the efforts of survivors to use their experiences to try to abolish nuclear weapons for the sake of humanity, and to try to receive compensation from the Japanese state, which started the war, for their suffering. 'I hope that the belief that nuclear weapons cannot — and must not — coexist with humanity will take firm hold among citizens of the nuclear weapon states and their allies, and that this will become a force for change in the nuclear policies of their governments,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/norway-nobel-japan-peace-prize-nuclear-9f39bcd5d6035fb1e75ac2030cf5c009	2024-12-10T07:00:55-08:00	
Negotiations over the war in Ukraine could start 'in the winter,' Poland's leader Tusk says	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s prime minister said Tuesday that negotiations over Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine could start 'in the winter,' as his country prepares to take over the rotating presidency of the European Union on Jan. 1. 'Our presidency will have, among others, joint responsibility for the shape of the political landscape, for what the situation will look like probably during the negotiations that, perhaps — there are still question marks here — will begin in the winter of this year,' Prime Minister Donald Tusk told his Cabinet. He said he hoped that the 'end effect' of Poland's and the EU's efforts will be peace in Ukraine. He offered no details of the efforts or any time frame. He didn't say who might be involved in the negotiations or where or when they might take place. Poland has been one of Ukraine's strongest backers against Russia's full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022. Poland will assume the EU presidency just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in the U.S. Trump has been pushing for an end to the war in Ukraine and during his campaign said that he could settle the matter in a day if he were elected. In a television interview that aired Sunday, Trump also said he would be open to reducing military aid to Ukraine and pulling the United States out of NATO. Those are two threats that have alarmed Ukraine, NATO allies and many in the U.S. national security community. Tusk said that he would be holding numerous meetings with political leaders concerning the situation relating to the war in Ukraine. Later Tuesday, he was meeting with Friedrich Merz, the head of Germany's CDU party, who was returning from talks in Kyiv with the Ukrainian government. Tusk will also speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. French President Emmanuel Macron is expected in Warsaw on Thursday, and Tusk said they will talk about meetings Macron recently held in Paris with Trump and Zelenskyy. Tusk said that Poland was taking the six-month EU presidency during a 'very dramatic' situation for the continent. Last week, he pointed to armed conflicts, also in Europe's vicinity, political crises some of Europe's biggest countries are going through and to the change in U.S. leadership. 'I would like it very much for Poland to be the country that will not only mark its presence all the time, but will also set the tone of the decisions that are to bring us security and safeguard Poland's interests,' Tusk told a government meeting.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-war-poland-tusk-negotiations-russia-eu-23802e5b26f5c0c1d45a32e9cc80f362	2024-12-10T05:36:21-08:00

Netanyahu is testifying in his corruption trial. He has been dogged by scandal for years	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the witness stand Tuesday for the first time in his long-running trial on corruption charges. But long before these accusations emerged, Netanyahu has been vexed by a flurry of embarrassing scandals and allegations. Netanyahu consistently and vehemently denies wrongdoing and has assailed investigations into his conduct or that of his family as witch hunts driven by a hostile media and a biased justice system. Here’s a look at some of the scandals that have beset Netanyahu, his family and his aides since he began to dominate Israel’s political scene. Submarine suspicions Close confidants of Netanyahu are suspected of receiving bribes to advance a deal to purchase submarines and other warships from Germany. Netanyahu is not a suspect in that case. But a state commission of inquiry looking into the affair earlier this year sent a letter to the prime minister warning him that he could be harmed by its conclusions. The committee did not detail the precise accusations against Netanyahu, but painted a picture of improper decision-making at multiple levels in government, the defense establishment and the military. He denies wrongdoing. Leaked and doctored documents A spokesperson for the Israeli leader has been charged with leaking classified information to German tabloid 'Bild' that indictments alleged harmed Israel's wartime security and interests. Netanyahu himself has not been accused of wrongdoing. Critics say the leak was meant to sway public opinion to be more in favor of Netanyahu's negotiating positions with Hamas, and diminish public pressure on him to reach a deal to release hostages held by the militants. Another Netanyahu aide is being investigated for doctoring documents, a move critics say was meant to protect Netanyahu from future investigations into his wartime conduct. Big spending In 2016, an official expense report revealed that Netanyahu spent more than $600,000 of public funds on a six-day trip to New York, including $1,600 on a personal hairdresser. Three years earlier, he was criticized for spending $127,000 in public funds for a special sleeping cabin on a five-hour flight to London. Netanyahu contended he was unaware of the cost and halted the practice. He also was forced to stop purchasing ice cream from an artisanal Jerusalem parlor after news erupted that his office ran up a $2,700 bill for his favorite flavors, vanilla and pistachio. His wife, Sara, has also been charged with misusing some $100,000 in public funds to order lavish meals from celebrity chefs at the prime minister’s official residence, even though she already had cooks on the government payroll. She agreed to pay $15,000 for misusing state funds as part of a plea deal. Allegations also mounted against the Netanyahus for using government money to purchase furniture for their private beach house and to cover the medical expenses of Sara Netanyahu’s late father. The attorney general ultimately dismissed the allegations. Flying high Netanyahu was suspected of double billing travel expenses and using state funds to cover personal travel in the 2000s, while he was finance minister and opposition leader. After a drawn-out investigation, the attorney general dismissed the case. Unhappy household Netanyahu's household staff has repeatedly accused Sara Netanyahu of explosive tirades and mistreatment. During Netanyahu’s first stint as prime minister, the family’s nanny said she was fired by Netanyahu’s wife for burning a pot of vegetable soup. The young woman said she was thrown out of the family’s home without her clothes or passport, and later was ordered to pick up her belongings dumped outside the front gate. Netanyahu’s office said the woman was fired because she was prone to violent outbursts. Two household aides have won damages in lawsuits accusing Sara Netanyahu of abusive conduct. In 2016, a Jerusalem court awarded one domestic worker over $42,000 in damages. Netanyahu and his wife have both rejected the accusations. In 2018, a recorded phone conversation surfaced of the prime minister's wife screaming at her publicist about how a gossip column omitted mention of her educational credentials. Joyride In 2018, a recording surfaced of Netanyahu’s eldest son, Yair, joyriding with his super-rich buddies to Tel Aviv strip clubs in a drunken night out in a taxpayer-funded government vehicle. He later apologized. The 33-year-old Netanyahu has also sparked controversy for lewd and offensive social media posts over the years, such as his publishing a caricature that drew on classic antisemitic tropes. Facebook briefly suspended his account after he wrote he would prefer an Israel without any Muslims. Mistress leak Back in the 1990s, rumors circulated that a videotape existed depicting Netanyahu and his image consultant, a married woman named Ruth Bar, in 'compromising romantic situations.' In response, Netanyahu went on television and confessed to adultery, even though the tape never turned up. Influence peddling During his first term in office in the 1990s, Netanyahu was suspected of appointing a crony as attorney general in exchange for political support from the ultra-religious Shas party. Prosecutors called Netanyahu’s conduct 'puzzling' but ultimately closed the case, citing lack of evidence. Lining pockets During that same spell in office, Netanyahu and his wife were suspected of pocketing gifts and foreign contributions received from world leaders — items considered state property. The Netanyahus also were suspected of accepting favors from a contractor. Both cases were closed without charges.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-netanyahu-corruption-trial-scandals-13d309b5513d8f18c67a7cb364b97533	2024-12-10T05:20:07-08:00	
France flies out 2 Mirage fighter jets from Chad to signal beginning of military withdrawal	PARIS (AP) — France flew out the two Mirage fighter jets it had stationed in Chad on Tuesday, signaling the beginning of the withdrawal of its military forces from the former French colony in Central Africa that last month broke off its defense cooperation agreement with Paris. The pair of Mirage 2000-D fighters took off after midday from a French base in the capital, N’Djamena, after Chadian military forces came to wish them farewell, and were returning to a French air force base in Nancy in eastern France, French military spokesman Col. Guillaume Vernet said. He added that negotiations with Chadian authorities were continuing on how and when France might withdraw other members of its 1,000-strong force in Chad, and whether all or just some of them will leave. In announcing the end of the defense cooperation agreement with France last month, the Chadian government described the decision as a historic turning point for the country that gained independence in 1960, and said that it would enable Chad to redefine its strategic partnerships in line with national priorities. Chad was one of the last countries in the region in which France maintained a large military presence, having been ousted in recent years from Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso after years of fighting Islamic extremists alongside regional troops. Those countries have inched closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel, the vast expanse below the Sahara desert. France has maintained about 1,000 troops in Chad. Chadian authorities didn’t specify when they have to leave and said the end of the defense agreement in no way calls into question the countries’ historical ties and that it wants to maintain relations in other areas of common interest. Last week, hundreds of people marched in N’Djamena to call for the withdrawal of French troops, chanting 'Chad for us, France out!' Some held banners that read, 'We do not want to see a single French person in Chad.'	https://apnews.com/article/france-chad-military-withdrawal-mirage-fighter-jets-6d98f486f122e0792b66397633aca3a8	2024-12-10T04:07:42-08:00	
Dutch police arrest 3 with possible links to huge apartment explosion that killed 6 in The Hague	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Dutch police said Tuesday that they have arrested three suspects who might have been involved in the explosion and fire that killed six people in an apartment building in The Hague over the weekend. Authorities had said they were investigating 'all possibilities' that could have caused the disaster, and the arrests indicate there might have been a criminal intent. 'More arrests are not excluded,' The Hague police said in a statement. It didn't elaborate on any reason for the arrests and said the three were seen as 'possibly implicated in the explosion.' Police also seized several vehicles, but they said that it was unclear whether they included the one which was seen driving away at high speed from the site shortly after the explosion. Early Saturday, residents of the northeastern neighborhood of Mariahoeve in The Hague heard the blast and screams before dawn, and authorities were still working at the scene of collapsed homes on Tuesday.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-gas-explosion-fire-apartments-hague-11f06d110ca7dc6ebc8a7eca73992a78	2024-12-10T03:45:14-08:00	
China's CATL forms joint venture with Stellantis to build electric vehicle battery factory in Spain	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Chinese electric battery company CATL and automaker Stellantis will build a major battery factory in northern Spain, the partners announced Tuesday. They said the plant will be located in Zaragoza and start producing lithium iron phosphate batteries by the end of 2026. The joint venture represents an investment of 4.1 billion euros ($4.3 billion), they said in a statement. The plant plans to be carbon neutral, apparently by making use of Spain's ample supplies of solar, wind and water power. The announcement comes after CATL and Stellantis agreed in November 2023 to collaborate on fabrication of batteries to help build electric cars in Europe. European carmakers are struggling to keep up with their Chinese counterparts in electric cars, a key pillar of the green transition that the European Union is pursuing. The bloc's 27 member states won’t be able to produce internal combustion cars after 2035. The EU, like the United States, is applying tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China to help protect domestic producers and encourage Chinese carmakers to move production to Europe and create local jobs. CATL and other Chinese battery makers are far ahead in the critical area of producing batteries for electric vehicles. Northvolt, Europe’s great hope for catching up, filed for bankruptcy last month. CATL is already producing batteries at two European factories in Germany and Hungary. The deal comes a day after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez met with CATL Chairman Robin Zeng in Madrid. Spain produces the second most cars in the EU after Germany. Sánchez posted on X that he was 'very satisfied' when the deal was made official. Spain’s Minister of Industry Jordi Hereu applauded the announcement, which he said received public funding from Europe’s post-pandemic recovery plan that includes Spain's ambitious plan to shift to electric vehicles. 'We all have a lot riding on the transition toward an electric transport model,' Hereu told reporters. 'Therefore we consider this investment to be a great sign that the car industry believes in Spain.' Stellantis includes the Chrysler, Citroen, Dodge, Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat, Opel and Alfa Romeo brands, among others. In Spain, Stellantis group has car factories in Zaragoza, Vigo and Madrid. The production of electric vehicles in Spain has risen from just 16,000 models in 2019 to 323,000 in 2023, but that is still 13% of the total output of 2.4 million vehicles produced, according to ANFAC, the Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers. Germany, which is now seeing layoffs in its car industry, led Europe with 4.1 vehicles of all types produced in 2023, ANFAC said. Volkswagen Group, through its Spanish affiliate SEAT, announced in 2022 its plans to build an electric battery plant in Spain's eastern Valencia region.	https://apnews.com/article/electric-car-batteries-china-spain-stellantis-catl-eaec84bbc375c8814c1030dab73f389b	2024-12-10T01:56:59-08:00	
Death toll in Italy fuel depot blast rises to 5	ROME (AP) — Rescuers found the body of the last missing person on Tuesday at the site of a fuel depot explosion in Italy's central Tuscany region, bringing the death toll to five, Italian media reported. The blast on Monday caused the collapse of a building with offices, injuring 14 people, Tuscany’s governor Eugenio Giani said, adding that two were in critical condition. The explosion struck an ENI fuel depot north of Florence, sending a dark plume of smoke into the air. Witnesses kilometers away reported a large bang and tremors. Residents were initially advised to keep their windows closed, but environmental officials later determined that the air quality was safe. The smoke temporarily interrupted regional train services. The cause of the blast at the depot in the town of Calenzano was under investigation. The flames were quickly contained, preventing the fire from spreading to storage tanks from a loading dock area where the explosion occurred. Prosecutors in the nearby city of Prato have started an investigation into the deadly blast.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-calenzano-eni-fuel-depot-explosion-deaths-116a9a499c9d041d6db943d3b8d53cb2	2024-12-10T00:38:36-08:00	
Hundreds protest in New Delhi against reported attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh	NEW DELHI (AP) — Hundreds of protesters rallied near the Bangladesh diplomatic mission in the Indian capital on Tuesday, pressing for an end to reported attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh after former premier Sheikh Hasina fled into exile in India in August. The protesters demanded an intervention by the United Nations, carrying banners and placards that criticized the world body for not doing more to address the problems in Bangladesh. They also rejected claims by interim government officials in Bangladesh that the targeting of minorities was an internal matter. 'It's a very serious attack, a very sustained attack on the lives of the (Hindu) minority,' said Veena Sikri, a former Indian ambassador to Bangladesh. Attacks on the livelihoods, homes and businesses of minorities in Bangladesh must stop, she said. Scores of social and cultural organizations joined the protest in New Delhi a day after top Foreign Ministry officials from the two countries, Vikram Misri and Mohammad Jashim Uddin, met in Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital, to discuss their strained relations. It was the first high-level visit to Bangladesh by an Indian official since massive protests ended Hasina’s 15-year rule. Following Hasina's ouster, minorities — and particularly Hindus — have reported widespread attacks in the Muslim-majority nation of Bangladesh, but Bangladesh says the reports are widely exaggerated. Most Bangladeshi Hindus are thought to support Hasina’s secular Awami League party. Tensions spiked over the recent arrest of a Hindu spiritual leader in Bangladesh, which is currently being run by an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. India also stopped issuing visas to Bangladeshis, except for emergency medical visas, after Hasina fled. Many Indian nationals working on infrastructure projects also left Bangladesh because of security threats. After Monday's meeting, Misri told reporters there was no reason for the mutually beneficial relationship between the two countries to deteriorate. 'To that end, therefore, I have underlined today India’s desire to work closely with the interim government of Bangladesh,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/indians-protest-bangladesh-diplomatic-mission-hindu-minority-attack-154c6cef14508507aab5a841846c4e21	2024-12-10T00:10:30-08:00	
Doctors say Brazil's Lula is recovering after surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is recovering in an intensive care unit after undergoing unplanned surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage, doctors said Tuesday. The procedure was performed after the 79-year-old leftist leader suffered complications resulting from a fall at home in October, doctors said. 'He is in a stable condition, talking normally and eating. He will remain under observation for the next few days,' Dr. Roberto Kalil with the Sirio-Libanes hospital in Sao Paulo told a press conference. There will be no aftereffects, doctors said, adding that Lula expected to return to the capital, Brasilia, at the beginning of next week. Until then, he will not be working, they said. Lula traveled from Brasilia in the early hours Tuesday to be treated in Sao Paulo, 1,000 kilometers south (620 miles). Doctors said the first lady was at his side and the president had no other visitors. Lula canceled a trip to Russia for a BRICS summit after the accident, his office said at the time. It left him with a cut visible on the back of his head, slightly above his neck. Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa sent his best wishes for a full and speedy recovery, according to a statement. Colombia's President Gustavo Petro posted his wishes on X, calling Lula a 'comrade.'	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-surgery-recovering-icu-bb058df92bf29fb67a5fb1d44700aa39	2024-12-09T23:45:07-08:00	
Israeli warplanes pound Syria as troops reportedly advance deeper into the country	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Israel carried out a wave of heavy airstrikes across Syria as its troops advanced deeper into the country, a Syrian opposition war monitor said Tuesday. Israel denied its forces were advancing toward Damascus after they pushed into a buffer zone inside Syria following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. Associated Press reporters in the capital heard heavy airstrikes overnight and into Tuesday on the city and its suburbs. Photographs circulating online showed destroyed missile launchers, helicopters and warplanes. There was no immediate comment from the insurgent groups — led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS – that have taken control of much of the country. Their lightning advance brought an end to the Assad family’s half-century rule after nearly 14 years of civil war. There are concerns over what comes next. ‘Damascus is more beautiful now’ Life in the capital is slowly returning to normal after the overthrow of Assad, who fled the country over the weekend and has been granted political asylum in Russia. Private banks reopened on instructions from the Central Bank, said Sadi Ahmad, who runs a branch in the upscale Abu Rummaneh neighborhood. He said all his employees returned to work. Shops also reopened in the city's ancient Hamidiyeh market, where armed men and civilians could be seen buying things like perfume and ice cream. A clothing shop owner, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said he hoped vendors would no longer have to pay bribes to security officials. At Bakdash, a famous ice cream shop, a poster outside read: 'Welcome to the rebels of free Syria. Long live free Syria.' 'Damascus is more beautiful now,' said Maysoun Qurabi, who was shopping in the market. 'It has a soul, and people feel at ease and secure.' Under Assad, she said, 'people were hungry and scared. The regime was strong.' Israeli incursion draws condemnation In the immediate aftermath of Assad's fall, Israeli forces moved into a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) buffer zone inside Syria that had been established after the 1973 Mideast war, a move it said was taken to prevent attacks on its citizens. Israel has also said it is striking suspected chemical weapons sites and heavy weapons to prevent them from falling into the hands of extremists. Israeli officials rarely acknowledge individual strikes. Israel has a long history of seizing territory during wars with its neighbors and occupying it indefinitely, citing security concerns. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally, except by the United States. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has closely tracked the conflict since the civil war erupted in 2011, said Israel has carried out more than 300 airstrikes across the country since the rebels overthrew Assad. The Observatory, and Beirut-based Mayadeen TV, which has reporters in Syria, said Israeli troops are advancing up the Syrian side of the border with Lebanon and had come within 25 kilometers (15 miles) of Damascus, which the Israeli military denied. Israel denies advancing toward Damascus Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said 'the reports circulating in the media about the alleged advancement of Israeli tanks towards Damascus are false.' He said Israeli troops are stationed within the buffer zone in order to protect Israel. Israel's military had previously said troops would enter the buffer zone 'and several other places necessary for its defense.' Israeli media meanwhile reported that the air force was methodically destroying Syria's military assets to ensure whoever rules the country next would have to rebuild them. The operations 'have been systematically destroying all that remains of the escaped tyrant’s military,' wrote Yossi Yehoshua, the military correspondent for Israel's largest daily, Yediot Ahronot. 'Dozens upon dozens of targets, including arms depots of various kinds, have been hit in waves of attacks so as to prevent them from falling into hostile hands and from posing a threat to Israel.' The air force 'currently enjoys complete freedom of action,' he added. Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have condemned Israel’s incursion, accusing it of exploiting the disarray in Syria and violating international law. Turkey, which has been a main backer of the Syrian opposition to Assad, also condemned Israel’s advance. The Turkish Foreign Ministry accused Israel of'displaying a mentality of an occupier' at a time when the possibility of peace and stability had emerged in Syria. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Monday said Israel's incursion constitutes a violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement and called on both Israel and Syria to uphold it. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut and Lidman from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Frieder Reimold, journalist who wrote AP’s iconic ‘East Germany opens borders’ bulletin, dies at 80	BERLIN (AP) — Frieder Reimold, a former Berlin bureau chief of The Associated Press German-language service who wrote the iconic 1989 bulletin that East Germany had opened its borders, has died. He was 80. Reimold died Thursday in Berlin of complications related to cancer, his daughter Nancy Stephan told the AP. He began working for AP as a political correspondent in Bonn in the late 1970s after entering journalism on a German newspaper. After months of overtime writing about upheaval and protests in East Germany, Reimold, who had by then become the Berlin bureau chief of AP’s German-language service, settled in on Nov. 9, 1989, to watch a televised evening briefing by Günter Schabowski, a member of the communist country’s Politburo. History didn’t give Reimold a break that night. About an hour into the rambling news conference, Schabowski mentioned that East Germany was lifting all restrictions on travel across its border into West Germany. Pressed on when the new regulations would take effect, he looked at his notes and stammered, 'As far as I know, this enters into force ... this is immediately, without delay.' The remark was so offhanded that it took Reimold a little time to recognize the implications of the statement — that East Germany was opening the Berlin Wall and the heavily fortified border with West Germany. Carefully, Reimold then typed out what has become his iconic alert: 'DDR öffnet Grenzen' — 'East Germany opens borders.' 'This was the alert that changed the course of the night,' Reimold said during an interview with the AP in 2019, when Germany celebrated the 30-year-anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. 'The alert sped up a development that sooner or later would have been inevitable in any case.' Reimold sent out his alert at 7:05 p.m. Other wire services alerted the news as well, but none went so far that moment as to say that Schabowski’s announcement in fact meant that East Germany had opened its border. His alert is widely seen as having helped nudge the process along, and in a nod to its significance his words are today immortalized in a plaque in the sidewalk on Bornholmer Strasse, the border crossing where people first walked over from East to West. Frieder Reimold was born on April 21, 1944, in the Bavarian village of Irschenhausen. His family moved to Hannover in northern Germany a couple of years later when his father took a job at a museum there. After graduating from high school, Reimold left Germany for Canada, where he first stayed with relatives and later worked in logging before attending university in Vancouver to study languages, his sister Sabine Reimold told the AP. During his three decades with the AP, Reimold worked as political correspondent in Bonn, led the Berlin bureau and later covered the foreign ministry. He also spent several years in Vienna reporting on the upheavals created by the war in Yugoslavia. 'He was a terrific journalist and dear friend who helped me a great deal during the Cold War when I was a correspondent for the Associated Press in Bonn,' in the 1980s, Susan Cornwell, a retired former AP reporter, said in an email from Washington D.C. 'Frieder was always ready to explain the political and historical background to the events I was covering. I used to call him the ‘spazierendes Brockhaus'' — a walking German encyclopedia, Cornwell remembered. He 'knew details about key German political figures and was especially good at helping me understand the historical backdrop for events going on at that time, from the rise of the Greens party to NATO’s deployment of Pershing II missiles in West Germany,' she said. Annette Ramelsberger, another colleague, who covered the fall of the Berlin Wall and its aftermath with Reimold at the AP German service, remembered him as very smart and accurate, and at the same time as a caring and supportive manager with a fine sense of humor. 'It was great to go together with him through this wild time,' Ramelsberger, who now works for German daily newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, said. After his retirement in 2009, Reimold took on archery and enjoyed working in his garden at his home in Stahnsdorf, on the outskirts of Berlin, friends said. He was also very interested in history, culture and traveling, his sister said. Reimold 'was always a journalist, always conscientious, always put his own feelings aside,' his niece Rebekka Reimold said. 'The facts were important to him — even in the last days of his life, when he spoke soberly about the facts concerning his illness and its consequences.' ___ Randy Herschaft contributed reporting from New York.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-frieder-reimold-associated-press-dies-6e92d49a09cd9e549f1afd6ed6e19a87	2024-12-09T23:33:04-08:00	
Greyhound racing is increasingly rare worldwide. New Zealand now plans to outlaw the practice	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand plans to outlaw greyhound racing because too many dogs are hurt or killed, the government said Tuesday, spelling an end to the practice in one of the few countries where it still operates. The racing of greyhounds as a betting sport was wildly popular at times last century. But the number of dogs euthanized due to race-day injuries, or because homes cannot be found for them after their short careers end, has provoked animal welfare campaigns and growing public distaste for the sport. Commercial greyhound racing continues in the United States, Australia, the U.K. and Ireland, with only two tracks remaining in the U.S. after many states ended the practice. New Zealand’s ban is not yet law but has universal political support. The government plans to stop the racing from Aug. 1, 2026, to allow the 2,900 racing dogs to be rehomed and more than 1,000 people employed in the industry to find other work, Racing Minister Winston Peters said Tuesday. Unease over animal welfare New Zealand’s greyhound racing industry has faced repeated reviews in recent years over its dog safety record, with multiple reports urging sweeping changes. Peters said the industry had made progress -– but not enough. Stricter policies governing when dogs can be euthanized, and rehoming programs that send retired New Zealand greyhounds abroad as pets when homes cannot be found domestically, have reduced the numbers killed each year. But the percentage of dogs injured 'remains persistently high,' Peters said. 'The time has come to make a call in the best interest of the animals,' he said. Greyhound Racing New Zealand, an industry group, accused the government of not recognizing improvements made, including its commitment to tracking the care of every retired dog for the rest of its life. Tuesday’s announcement was 'a devastating blow,' said chair Sean Hannan. The animal welfare organization SPCA praised the government for showing 'compassion for dogs made to work in a dangerous gambling industry.' The practice has long been out of favor in New Zealand, spokesperson Arnja Dale said. A racing industry in global decline Some lawmakers in parliament on Tuesday described the racing industry’s end as inevitable following the steady decline of greyhound racing worldwide. Commercial racing operates in four other countries. In the U.S., its popularity peaked in the 1980s and the number of states allowing the practice has dwindled since then amid reports of dog mistreatment and the explosion of other gambling options. Only two tracks remain -– both in West Virginia -– after Iowa, Arkansas and Florida shuttered their racing industries. Greyhounds have become popular as pets in the U.S., and New Zealand has sent dozens of dogs to new owners there when homes could not be found in the country of 5 million people. Greyhound racing is also legal in Australia, where critics have decried the practice, and the rules governing it vary by state. Commercial racing currently operates throughout the U.K. and Ireland, but the Scottish parliament is considering a ban there. The practice remains legal in Mexico and Vietnam, but there are no longer operational tracks in either country, according to information supplied by Peters’ office. A swift legal change to protect dogs Hours after it announced the end to greyhound racing, New Zealand's government rushed through a law to prevent dogs from being killed while the industry winds down, unless a veterinarian deems it unavoidable. This will prevent owners from euthanizing dogs for economic reasons, Peters said. Lawmakers unanimously agreed to the change. The law shutting down the industry will take longer, however, and is not expected to pass until next year after a period of public submissions. All political parties support the ban.	https://apnews.com/article/greyhound-racing-ban-zealand-dogs-welfare-11159c996fa5e5ee6602bbbb4e6a40e4	2024-12-09T22:31:27-08:00

Middle East latest: Netanyahu prepares to testify in court in a corruption trial	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to testify in court on Tuesday, facing charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three separate cases. Netanyahu has repeatedly requested to delay his testimony because of the conflicts roiling the Middle East but was mostly denied by the courts. The long-running trial comes as Netanyahu is already facing accusations by critics in Israel of dragging out the war in Gaza and putting off a cease-fire deal that could release some 100 hostages who remain in the territory after 14 months of war triggered by the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in the Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, according to local health authorities. They say most of the dead are women and children but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250, including older adults and children. Meanwhile, U.S. prosecutors have accused two senior Syrian officials of overseeing a notorious prison that tortured peaceful protesters and other political prisoners, including a 26-year-old American woman who was later believed to have been executed. The indictment was unsealed Monday, two days after a shock rebel offensive overthrew Syrian President Bashar Assad. The U.S., U.N. and others accuse him of widespread human rights abuses in a 13-year battle to crush opposition forces seeking his removal from power. Assad fled to Russia, where he received asylum from his longtime ally. ___ Here's the Latest: Israeli military official says troops plan to seize a buffer zone inside Syria TEL AVIV, Israel — An Israeli military official says troops plan to seize a buffer zone inside Syria as well as 'a few more points that have strategic meaning.' The official spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The official dismissed reports of a larger Israeli invasion as 'rumors.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israeli forces were moving to control a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized buffer zone in Syrian territory. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. Following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad, Israel sent troops into the buffer zone. It said the move was temporary and was aimed at preventing attacks. It said the 1974 agreement establishing the zone had collapsed and that Syrian troops had withdrawn from their positions. Israel has also carried out airstrikes across Syria in recent days targeting what it says are suspected chemical weapons and long-range rockets. Egypt and Saudi Arabia have condemned Israel’s incursion, accusing it of exploiting the disarray in Syria and violating international law. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move not recognized by the international community, except for the United States. The rest of the world views the strategic plateau as occupied Syrian territory. ___ From AP journalist Joseph Krauss. Israeli air force has launched hundreds of airstrikes in Syria, war monitor says DAMASCUS, Syria — Israel’s air force has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Syria as its ground forces move north of the Golan Heights along the border with Lebanon, according to an opposition war monitor. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Tuesday that since the fall of President Bashar Assad’s government, Israel’s air force has carried out more than 300 airstrikes against research centers, arms depots and military infrastructure across Syria, as well as a naval base along the Mediterranean coast. Associated Press journalists in Damascus witnessed intense airstrikes on the city and its suburbs overnight into Tuesday morning. Photographs posted online by activists showed destroyed missile launchers, helicopters and warplanes. Meanwhile, Israeli troops marched along the border with Lebanon and now control a long stretch on the Syrian side facing Lebanon’s Rashaya region, according to the war monitor's head, Rami Abdurrahman, and the Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV, which has reporters in Syria. Israeli troops are now about 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Damascus, according to the monitor. Saudi Arabia condemns Israeli incursion into a buffer zone in Syria DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Saudi Arabia has condemned Israel’s incursion into a buffer zone in Syria and a wave of Israeli airstrikes launched after the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that 'the assaults carried out by the Israeli occupation government, including the seizure of the buffer zone in the Golan Heights, and the targeting of Syrian territory confirm Israel’s continued violation of the principles of international law and its determination to sabotage Syria’s chances of restoring its security, stability and territorial integrity.' Israel sent troops into a buffer zone inside Syria that had been established after the 1973 Mideast war. It said the move was temporary and was taken to prevent any cross-border attacks after Syrian troops withdrew. Israel has also carried out heavy airstrikes that it says are aimed at preventing suspected chemical weapons and long-range rockets from falling into the hands of extremists. Saudi Arabia has been in talks with the United States in recent years over normalizing relations with Israel in exchange for a U.S. defense pact, American assistance in establishing a civilian nuclear program and a pathway to the establishment of a Palestinian state. But the kingdom has also repeatedly condemned Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip, where it is at war with the Hamas militant group. Last month, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and day-to-day ruler Mohammed bin Salman accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, allegations Israel adamantly rejects.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-10-december-2024-90bc663aea10628735f8c1acd75664d4	2024-12-09T21:57:57-08:00	
Is it a military drill? China deploys ships and planes around Taiwan but remains mum	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China's secretive military appears to be up to something around Taiwan, but it's unclear exactly what. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that it had detected a dozen Chinese naval ships and 47 military planes in the past 24 hours but no live-fire activity as in previous drills. Taiwan's military has been bracing for possible exercises by China in response to a recent overseas trip by Taiwan's president that included Hawaii and Guam, an American territory. Without any Chinese announcement, Taiwan officials are calling it training, said Taiwanese Lt. Gen. Hsieh Jih-sheng, while noting that training can become drills, and drills can become war. 'It’s in the status of regular training,' he said at a news conference. 'But under the status of normalized training, it’s able to mobilize military forces on such a large scale and carry out exercises in such a large area.' China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and opposes the self-governing island having official interactions with other countries, and in particular, the United States. Lai spoke with with U.S. congressional leaders by phone while in Guam last week. While the U.S., like most of the world, doesn't formally recognize Taiwan a a country, it is the largest supplier of arms to the island of 23 million people for its defense. China, which views Lai as a separatist, held major military exercises around Taiwan following his inauguration in May and his National Day speech in October. It also held a major drill after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022. Taiwan's military set up an emergency response center on Monday in response to increased Chinese naval activity and the announcement of flight restrictions in seven zones off China's east coast. The restrictions are in place until Wednesday. 'We have noticed that there are no live-fire drill activities in the seven exercise areas as planned in the past,' said Hsieh, who heads the office of the deputy chief of general staff for intelligence.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-military-drills-training-d1da8a88fab175fc816b919b384ac964	2024-12-09T21:28:01-08:00	
Israel's Netanyahu vows to challenge 'absurd' corruption charges as he takes the stand in his trial	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised defiantly on Tuesday to knock down corruption allegations against him as he began testifying in his long-running trial, becoming the first sitting Israeli leader to take the stand as a criminal defendant. The testimony is another low point for Israel’s longest-serving leader, who also faces an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war in Gaza. In his opening testimony in a packed Tel Aviv courtroom, Netanyahu argued that he was a dedicated leader and a defender of Israel’s interests, swatting away the charges against him as a 'drop in the sea' compared to the challenges he has faced protecting his country. But the charges have torn open divisions in Israel and complicated Netanyahu's legacy, which has also been tainted by the war in Gaza and the growing international isolation Israel faces because of it. Speaking freely and appearing at ease, Netanyahu said he could balance appearing at his trial with his duties as prime minister at a time when Israel is still fighting a war in Gaza and contending with the fall of Bashar Assad in neighboring Syria. 'I waited eight years for this moment, to say the truth,' Netanyahu said, standing at a podium, with his son Avner and several members of his Likud party seated on the courtroom benches. He said his testimony would 'poke holes in the absurd accusations.' Netanyahu will answer during his court appearances to charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. He is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assistance with personal and business interests. He is also accused of promoting advantageous regulations for media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage of himself and his family. Netanyahu, 75, denies wrongdoing, saying the charges are a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media and a biased legal system out to topple his lengthy rule. His testimony caps years of scandals that have swirled around him and his family, who have gained a reputation as enjoying a lavish lifestyle at taxpayers' expense. Netanyahu's testimony is taking place in an underground, fortified courtroom for security reasons. Outside the courthouse, dozens of protesters gathered, both supporters of Netanyahu and his opponents. A banner draped outside read 'Crime Minister' as each side chanted slogans. Some families of hostages held in Gaza also demonstrated. At the start of his testimony, a judge told Netanyahu he had the same privileges as other witnesses and could sit or stand as he chose. Netanyahu told his version of events and shared personal details about his life that he might hope would shape the judges’ perception of him. He said at the start of his career in public service he would lose sleep over media coverage but learned it had no meaningful bearing — in contrast to the prosecution’s attempts to paint him as image-obsessed. He said he smoked cigars but could hardly finish them because of his workload, and hated champagne. Ahead of the testimony's start, Netanyahu’s lawyer, Amit Hadad, accused the Israeli justice system of making up the charges in an attempt to ensnare Netanyahu. 'There was a huge effort … to find a few pieces of a puzzle that don’t connect to each other,' Haddad said, as Netanyahu sat on a bench behind him. 'In court, in the light of day, we see everything falls apart.' The testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu’s working hours, prompting critics to ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran. His lawyer asked that he be allowed to receive notes while testifying to help ensure he could continue running the country, and at some points during the trial, Netanyahu did. Under Israeli law, indicted prime ministers are not required to step down. But the charges against Netanyahu cleaved deep divisions in Israel, with protesters demanding he resign and former political allies refusing to serve in government with the Israeli leader, triggering a political crisis that led to five elections in less than four years beginning in 2019. Netanyahu’s supporters view the charges as the result of bias and overreach by the justice system. Despite the pressure, Netanyahu has rejected calls to step down and has used his position as prime minister to lash out at law enforcement, media and courts. An Israeli court rejected a request by Netanyahu’s lawyers to reduce the expected number of hours of testimony, as well as several other requests to delay its start, which they said were necessary because of the prime minister’s busy schedule and the country’s significant challenges. A verdict isn’t expected until 2026 at the earliest and Netanyahu will have the option to appeal to the Supreme Court. Since the trial began in 2020, the court has heard prosecution witnesses in the three cases, including some of Netanyahu’s once closest aides who turned state witnesses. The prosecution has tried to portray the prime minister as an image-obsessed leader who broke the law to improve his public perception. Netanyahu’s testimony could further tarnish his image at a complicated time. His popular support dropped after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, with the public blaming his leadership for failing to prevent the assault, and if elections were held today he would struggle to form a government. Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza with no end in sight, despite heavy international pressure to wind down the war, as well as pressure from the families of hostages held in Gaza and their supporters to bring their loved ones home. The Israeli leader along with his former defense minister also face an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes charges related to the war in Gaza. The warrant puts Netanyahu in the same company as Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-netanyahu-corruption-trial-gaza-478c957c7749986d5b8b2d039f670d54	2024-12-09T21:08:44-08:00	
US defense secretary in Japan to support alliance as Osprey aircraft safety causes concern	TOKYO (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with officials in Japan on Tuesday to reaffirm the importance of their alliance and Washington's commitment to regional security as threats rise from China and North Korea. Austin also stressed that U.S. trilateral cooperation with Tokyo and Seoul is crucial for regional stability even as South Korea is in political turmoil following President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived declaration of martial law last week. Austin’s visit also came amid growing concerns over the safety of Osprey military aircraft, which have been grounded in the United States following a near crash at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico last month. The incident, caused by weakened metal components, was similar to a fatal crash off southwestern Japan last year. The U.S. measure prompted Japan to also ground its Ospreys. After confirming details with the U.S. military, Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force has suspended operations of its 17 Ospreys, except for possible disaster relief and other missions, beginning Tuesday to prioritize safety, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters. During their meeting, Austin and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba noted the collapse of the Syrian government and praised the strength of the Japan-U.S. alliance at a time of rapid global political change. 'The world can change drastically in a week,' Ishiba told Austin, referring to political unrest in South Korea and Syria. The U.S. defense chief, whose term ends in January when President-elect Donald Trump takes office, told Ishiba that he appreciated the steady alliance with Japan during 'very dynamic times' and that he was proud of the modernization of alliance command and control, strengthening of force posture and deterrence capabilities over the past several years. Austin later met with Japanese counterpart Gen Nakatani and noted China's 'coercive behavior' in the East and South China Seas, North Korean support for Russia's war in Ukraine as growing challenges. Austin underlined U.S. commitment 'to advancing our historic trilateral cooperation' with South Korea. Washington's commitment of 'extended deterrence,' including its nuclear umbrella, to Japan and South Korea is 'iron clad,' he added. Nakatani earlier told reporters that cooperation between Japan and the U.S., as well as with South Korea and other partners, is important as tensions escalate in the region. The trilateral partnership between Japan, the U.S. and South Korea has significantly strengthened under President Joe Biden’s administration, but faces new uncertainty amid ongoing political unrest in South Korea, which already led to the cancellation of Austin's planned trip to that country. On Monday, Austin greeted crew members of the USS George Washington, a nuclear-powered flagship aircraft carrier docked at the U.S. Navy base in Yokosuka, near Tokyo. Austin stressed the importance of U.S. cooperation with allies and partners in the region as he singled out China as the only country in the world with the intent and capability to change the rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific, according to the U.S. Defense Department. 'We want to see this region remain open to freedom of navigation and the ability to fly the skies in international airways,' Austin was quoted as saying on the Defense Department's website. 'We will work with allies and partners to ensure we can do just that,' he added. The U.S. carrier, which is under maintenance in Yokosuka, will carry the advanced F-35C stealth combat aircraft squadron currently based in the Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in the southwestern Japanese prefecture of Yamaguchi. ___ Mayuko Ono contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-us-defense-austin-alliance-korea-osprey-d5d4319cb9b5ce687f951b8c50689664	2024-12-09T20:44:57-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares mostly higher as Chinese stocks are lifted by latest stimulus	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares in Asia were mostly higher on Tuesday as Chinese shares were buoyed by an apparent shift in Beijing toward easier credit and other forms of stimulus for the sluggish economy. Shares in market superstar Nvidia fell 0.6% in afterhours trading extending a 2.6% loss after China said it’s investigating the company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws. The Shanghai Composite index surged 1.6% to 3,456.12 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 1%, at 20,618.18. At a meeting announced late Monday, top Chinese leaders agreed on a 'moderately loose' monetary policy for the world’s second-largest economy. That’s the first move in 10 years away from a more cautious, 'prudent' stance. A major planning meeting expected Wednesday could also bring more stimulus for the Chinese economy. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 0.5% to 39,335.74 while the Kospi in South Korea jumped 2.3%, recovering some of its recent losses as the country's recent political turmoil simmered on. On Tuesday, South Korean prosecutors were seeking to formally arrest the former defense minister alleged to have colluded with President Yoon Suk Yeol in imposing martial law last week, as both men are being investigated on rebellion and other charges. Taiwan's Taiex shed 0.8% as the government said China’s military appeared to be preparing for widely anticipated drills in response to a recent visit by its president, Lai Ching-te's visits to Hawaii and Guam. Taiwan’s defense ministry said Monday that it has detected Chinese naval and coast guard ships entering the Taiwan Strait and the western Pacific and that China had restricted airspace along its southeast coast through Wednesday. The moves ratchet up tensions after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he would not commit to defending Taiwan if China were to invade during his presidency. Elsewhere in the region, Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.4% to 8,389.30. Markets in Thailand were closed for a holiday. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6% to 6,052.85, coming off its 57th all-time high of the year so far. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.5% to 44,401.93, and the Nasdaq composite pulled back 0.6% to 19,736.69. Nvidia’s decline was by far the heaviest weight on the S&amp;P 500. It has skyrocketed to become one of Wall Street’s most valuable companies because its chips are driving much of the world’s move into artificial-intelligence technology. That gives its stock’s movements more sway on the S&amp;P 500 than nearly every other. U.S.-listed stocks of several Chinese companies climbed, including a 12.4% jump for electric-vehicle company Nio and a 7.4% rise for Alibaba Group. Stocks in Shanghai. The week’s highlight for Wall Street will arrive midweek when the latest updates on inflation arrive. Economists expect Wednesday’s report to show consumer inflation was little changed last month. A separate report on Thursday, meanwhile, could show an acceleration in inflation at the wholesale level. They’re the last big pieces of data the Federal Reserve will get before its meeting next week on interest rates, where it is expected to cut its main interest rate for the third time this year. The Fed has been easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high since September help the slowing jobs market, after bringing inflation nearly down to its 2% target. In the oil market early Tuesday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude gave up 44 cents to $67.93 per barrel. It rallied 1.7% Monday to settle at $68.37 following the overthrow of Syrian leader Bashar Assad, who sought asylum in Moscow after rebels. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 39 cents to $71.75 per barrel. On Monday it added 1.4% to $72.14 per barrel. The price of gold rose 0.3% to $2,693.10 per ounce after gaining 1% a day earlier amid the uncertainty created by the end of the Assad family’s 50 years of iron rule.

Biden is rushing aid to Ukraine. Both sides are digging in. And everyone is bracing for Trump	WASHINGTON (AP) — The grinding war between Ukraine and its Russian invaders has escalated ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration, with President Joe Biden rushing out billions of dollars more in military aid before U.S. support for Kyiv’s defenses is thrown into question under the new administration. Russia, Ukraine and their global allies are scrambling to put their side in the best possible position for any changes that Trump may bring to American policy in the nearly 3-year-old war. The president-elect insisted in recent days that Russia and Ukraine immediately reach a ceasefire and said Ukraine should likely prepare to receive less U.S. military aid. On the war's front lines, Ukraine's forces are mindful of Trump's fast-approaching presidency and the risk of losing their biggest backer. If that happens, 'those people who are with me, my unit, we are not going to retreat,' a Ukrainian strike-drone company commander, fighting in Russia's Kursk region with the 47th Brigade, told The Associated Press by phone. 'As long as we have ammunition, as long as we have weapons, as long as we have some means to defeat the enemy, we will fight,' said the commander, who goes by his military call sign, Hummer. He spoke on condition he not be identified by name, citing Ukrainian military rules and security concerns. 'But, when all means run out, you must understand, we will be destroyed very quickly,' he said. The Biden administration is pushing every available dollar out the door to shore up Ukraine's defenses before leaving office in six weeks, announcing more than $2 billion in additional support since Trump won the presidential election last month. The U.S. has sent a total of $62 billion in military aid since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. And more help is on the way. The administration is on track to disperse the U.S. portion of a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, backed by frozen Russian assets, before Biden leaves the White House, U.S. officials said. They said the U.S. and Ukraine are in 'advanced stages' of discussing terms of the loan and close to executing the $20 billion of the larger loan that the U.S. is backing. Biden also has eased limits on Ukraine using American longer-range missiles against military targets deeper inside Russia, following months of refusing those appeals over fears of provoking Russia into nuclear war or attacks on the West. He's also newly allowed Ukraine to employ antipersonnel mines, which are banned by many countries. Biden and his senior advisers, however, are skeptical that allowing freer use of the longer-range missiles will change the broader trajectory of the war, according to two senior administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. But the administration has at least a measure of confidence that its scramble, combined with continued strong European support, means it will leave office having given Ukraine the tools it needs to sustain its fight against Russia for some time, the officials said. Enough to hold on, but not enough to defeat Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces, according to Ukraine and some of its allies. Even now, 'the Biden administration has been very careful not to run up against the possibility of a defeated Putin or a defeated Russia' for fear of the tumult that could bring, said retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, a former supreme allied commander of NATO. He is critical of Biden’s cautious pace of military support for Ukraine. Events far from the front lines this past weekend demonstrated the war's impact on Russia’s military. In Syria, rebels seized the country’s capital and toppled Russia-allied President Bashar Assad. Russian forces in Syria had propped up Assad for years, but they moved out of the way of the rebels’ assault, unwilling to take losses to defend their ally. Biden said it was further evidence that U.S. support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was wearing down Russia’s military. Trump, who has long spoken favorably of Putin and described Zelenskyy as a 'showman' wheedling money from the U.S., used that moment to call for an immediate ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. And asked in a TV interview — taped before he met with Zelenskyy over the weekend in Paris — if Ukraine should prepare for the possibility of reduced aid, Trump said, 'Yeah. Probably. Sure.' Trump's supporters call that pre-negotiation maneuvering by an avowed deal-maker. His critics say they fear it shows he is in Putin's sway. Zelenskyy said Monday that Russian forces’ retrenchment from outposts worldwide demonstrates that 'the entire army of this great pseudo-empire is fighting against the Ukrainian people today.' 'Forcing Putin to end the war requires Ukraine to be strong on the battlefield before it can be strong diplomatically,' Zelenskyy wrote on social media, repeating near-daily appeals for more longer-range missiles from the U.S. and Europe. In Kursk, Hummer, the Ukrainian commander, said he notices Russian artillery strikes and shelling easing up since the U.S. and its European allies loosened limits on use of longer-range missiles. But Moscow has been escalating its offensives in other ways in the past six months, burning through men and materiel in infantry assaults and other attacks far faster than it can replace them, according to the Institute for the Study of War. In Kursk, that includes Russia sending waves of soldiers on motorcycles and golf carts to storm Ukrainian positions, Hummer said. The Ukrainian drone commander and his comrades defend the ground they have seized from Russia with firearms, tanks and armored vehicles provided by the U.S. and other allies. Ukraine’s supporters fear that the kind of immediate ceasefire Trump is urging would be mostly on Putin’s terms and allow the Russian leader to resume the war when his military has recovered. 'Putin is sacrificing his own soldiers at a grotesque rate to take whatever territory he can on the assumption that the U.S. will tell Ukraine that U.S. aid is over unless Russia gets to keep what it has taken,' Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at Scotland’s University of St. Andrews, wrote on his Substack channel. Putin's need for troops led him to bring in North Korean forces. Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range missiles more broadly in Russia was partly in response, intended to discourage North Korea from deeper involvement in the war, one of the senior administration officials said. Since 2022, Russia already had been pulling forces and other military assets from Syria, Central Asia and elsewhere to throw into the Ukraine fight, said George Burros, an expert on the Russia-Ukraine conflict at the Institute for the Study of War. Any combat power that Russia has left in Syria that it could deploy to Ukraine is unlikely to change battlefield momentum, Burros said. 'The Kremlin has prioritized Ukraine as much as it can,' he said. ___ Novikov reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-military-aid-russia-biden-efbcff8ed068e621055e8fa70b5905e1	2024-12-09T20:07:59-08:00	
Here's how the US is countering the Islamic State group during Syria's upheaval	WASHINGTON (AP) — Massive U.S. airstrikes on Islamic State militants in Syria were meant in part as a message to the group and a move to ensure that it doesn't try to take advantage of the chaos following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad's government. The U.S. and its partners want to make sure the Islamic State group, which still has a presence in Syria, can't step into the leadership void and once again exert control over wide swaths of the country, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Monday. The U.S. on Sunday struck about 75 IS targets in the Syrian desert. The U.S. has had troops in Syria for the last decade to battle IS. The tumult following a rebel offensive that toppled Assad has raised fears of an Islamic State resurgence. 'ISIS will try to use this period to reestablish its capabilities, to create safe havens,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday, using another acronym for the group. 'As our precision strikes over the weekend demonstrate, we are determined not to let that happen.' So far, U.S. officials are saying that they do not plan an increase in American forces in Syria but are focused on making sure those already there are safe. Here's a look at the U.S. fight against the Islamic State group: What's the U.S. military presence in Syria? The U.S. has about 900 troops and an undisclosed number of contractors in Syria, largely at small bases in the north and east, with a small number farther south at the al-Tanf garrison closer to the Iraq and Jordan borders. U.S. special operations forces also routinely move in and out of the country but are usually in small teams and are not included in the official count. Islamic State militants seized large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014, declaring a caliphate. The U.S. gathered a coalition of allies and was able to defeat IS in Iraq in 2017. The U.S. partnered with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, and after fierce fighting, ultimately declared an end to the caliphate in Syria in 2019. Remnants of the militant group remain, including as many as 10,000 fighters held in SDF-run detention facilities in Syria and tens of thousands of their family members living in refugee camps. And IS fighters have been more active over the past year or so, including in attacks against U.S. and Kurdish forces in Syria. The country has been wracked by violence and competing interests. Russia has a naval port in the north, and while there have been fewer Russian forces in the area since the onset of the war in Ukraine, the U.S. maintains a deconfliction phoneline with Moscow to avoid any troop miscalculations on the ground or in the air. Iran also has had a significant presence, often using Syria as a transit route to move weapons into Lebanon for use by Hezbollah militants against Israel. The al-Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria is located on a vital road that can link Iranian-backed forces from Tehran all the way to southern Lebanon and Israel’s doorstep. So troops at the U.S. garrison can try and disrupt those shipments. Why is the U.S. striking Islamic State targets? The U.S. has, over the past decade, routinely targeted IS leaders, camps and weapons in Syria to keep the group at bay and prevent it from coalescing. In the past year, as Israel's war with Hamas widened into a broader conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, attacks by Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria as well as by the Islamic State group have escalated. As a result, the U.S. has kept up a steady drumbeat of counterattacks against all the groups, including against IS camps in the desert, where fighters found safe haven. Officials say that while the group is vastly weaker than in 2014, it still maintains thousands of militants in Syria. On Sunday, the U.S. launched one of its larger, more expansive assaults against IS camps and operatives in the desert, taking advantage of the Assad government's downfall. The U.S. bombed at least 75 targets in about five locations using B-52 bombers, A-10 attack aircraft and F-15 fighter jets. 'Does it send a message? I mean, I think it absolutely sends a message that we use B-52s, A-10s and F-15s,' Singh told reporters. She had no other details on the result of the strikes. What's next for the U.S. in Syria? The Biden administration insists the U.S. will not get involved in Syria's war or the overthrow of the Assad government. But the U.S. and its allies have deep interests in Syria, including the efforts to defeat IS, disrupt Iran-backed groups and contain the remnants of al-Qaida and other terror groups that have found sanctuary. 'I think it is a harbinger of more instability and the potential for more political violence,' Chris Costa, former senior director for counterterrorism in the first Trump administration, said last week before the fall of Damascus. Costa spent decades in the U.S. Army and ran special operations in combat zones. 'I think there’s the potential for ISIS again to make trouble not just for the Iraqis but also be emboldened in the region.' Alex Younger, who led Britain’s foreign intelligence agency, MI6, between 2014 and 2020, said a big concern is the 'very large number of ISIS detainees left over from the destruction of the caliphate.' Younger told the BBC that IS remnants are 'currently contained by the Kurdish groups in the east, but if they go off the job, you can expect a serious spike in the threat posed to Europe by ISIS.' Who will rule Syria? Another problem is figuring out who's in charge. The opposition forces that stormed into Damascus and sent Assad fleeing to Russia are led by a group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, that originally was part of al-Qaida, but split a number of years ago. HTS is considered a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. Its leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has sought to reassure Syrians that the group is more moderate. U.S. officials say that while he may be saying some of the right things, they are adopting a wait-and-see attitude for now. White House national security spokesman, John Kirby, told CNN News Central on Monday that while HTS 'was the vanguard' they aren't the only opposition group involved. 'We’re going to be working through all the processes we can, including at the U.N., to make sure that there is adequate communication with these opposition groups and that we are all working together,' he said. Singh said she is not aware of any formal U.S. channel of communications with the group. But, she said, 'We have other ways of getting messages through, you know, groups and other allies in the region.' ___ Associated Press reporters Eric Tucker and Sagar Meghani in Washington and Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-islamic-state-united-states-airstrikes-b4e72b3fd8fff4e9364597a1ca817803	2024-12-09T20:05:26-08:00	
Thousands scour Syria's most horrific prison but find no sign of their loved ones	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — They came from all over Syria, tens of thousands. The first place they rushed to after the fall of their longtime tormentor, former President Bashar Assad, was here: Saydnaya Prison, a place so notorious for its horrors it was long known as 'the slaughterhouse.' For the past two days, all have been looking for signs of loved ones who disappeared years or even decades ago into the secretive, sprawling prison just outside Damascus. But hope gave way to despair Monday. People opened the heavy iron doors lining the hallways to find cells inside empty. With sledgehammers, shovels and drills, men pounded holes in floors and walls, looking for what they believed were secret dungeons, or chasing sounds they thought they heard from underground. They found nothing. Insurgents freed dozens of people from the Saydnaya military prison on Sunday when Damascus fell. Since then, almost no one has been found. 'Where is everyone? Where are everyone’s children? Where are they?' said Ghada Assad, breaking down in tears. She had rushed from her Damascus home to the prison on the capital’s outskirts, hoping to find her brother. He was detained in 2011, the year that protests first erupted against the former president's rule – before they turned into a long, grueling civil war. She didn’t know why he was arrested. 'My heart has been burned over my brother. For 13 years, I kept looking for him,' she said. When insurgents last week seized Aleppo — her original hometown — at the start of their swiftly victorious offensive, 'I prayed that they would reach Damascus just so they can open up this prison,' she said. Civil defense officials helping in the search were as confused as the families over why no further inmates were being found. It appeared fewer were held here in recent weeks, they said. But few were giving up, a sign of how powerfully Saydnaya looms in the minds of Syrians as the heart of Assad’s brutal police state. The sense of loss over the missing — and the sudden hope they might be found -- brought a kind of dark unity among Syrians from across the country. During Assad’s rule and particularly after the 2011 protests began, any hint of dissent could land someone in Saydnaya. Few ever emerged. In 2017, Amnesty International estimated that 10,000-20,000 people were being held there at the time 'from every sector of society.' It said they were effectively slated for 'extermination.' Thousands were killed in frequent mass executions, Amnesty reported, citing testimony from freed prisoners and prison officials. Prisoners were subjected to constant torture, intense beatings and rape. Almost daily, guards did rounds of the cells to collect bodies of inmates who had died overnight from injuries, disease or starvation. Some inmates fell into psychosis and starved themselves, the human rights group said. 'There is not a home, there is not a woman in Syria who didn’t lose a brother, a child or a husband,' said Khairiya Ismail, 54. Two of her sons were detained in the early days of the protests against Assad – one of them when he came to visit her after she herself had been detained. Ismail, accused of helping her son evade military service, spent eight months in Adra prison, northeast of Damascus. 'They detained everyone.' An estimated 150,000 people were detained or went missing in Syria since 2011 — and tens of thousands of them are believed to have gone through Saydnaya. 'People expected many more to be here ... They are clinging to the slightest sliver of hope,' said Ghayath Abu al-Dahab, a spokesman for the White Helmets, the search and rescue group that operated in rebel-held areas throughout the war. Five White Helmet teams, with two canine teams, came to Saydnaya to help the search. They even brought in the prison electrician, who had the floor plan, and went through every shaft, vent and sewage opening. So far, there were no answers, Abu al-Dahab said. He said the civil defense had documents showing more than 3,500 people were in Saydnaya until three months before the fall of Damascus. But the number may have been less by the time the prison was stormed, he said. 'There are other prisons,' he said. 'The regime had turned all of Syria into a big prison.' Detainees were held in security agencies, military facilities, government offices and even universities, he added. Around the Y-shaped main building of the prison, everyone kept trying, convinced they could find some hidden chamber with detainees, dead or alive. Dozens of men tried to force a metal gate open until they realized it led only to more cells upstairs. Others asked the insurgents guarding the prison to use their rifle to lever open a closed door. A handful of men were gathered, excavating what looked like a sewage opening in a basement. Others dug up electrical wiring, thinking it might lead to hidden underground chambers. In a scene throughout the day, hundreds cheered as men with sledgehammers and shovels battered a huge column in the building’s atrium, thinking they had found a secret cell. Hundreds ran to see. But there was nothing, and tears and loud sighs replaced the celebrations. In the wards, lines of cells were empty. Some had blankets, a few plastic pots or a few names scribbled on walls. Documents, some with names of prisoners, were left strewn in the yard, the kitchen and elsewhere. Families scoured them for their loved ones’ names. A brief protest broke out in the prison yard, when a group of men began chanting: 'Bring us the prison warden.' Calls on social media urged anyone with information of the secret cells of the prison to come forth and help. Firas al-Halabi, one of the prisoners freed when insurgents first broke into Saydnaya, was back on Monday visiting. Those searching flocked around him, whispering names of relatives to see if he met them. Al-Halabi, who had been an army conscript when he was arrested, said he spent four years in a cell with 20 others. His only food was a quarter loaf of bread and some burghul. He suffered from tuberculosis because of the cell conditions. He was tortured by electrocution, he said, and the beatings were constant. 'During our time in the yard, there was beating. When going to the bathroom, there was beating. If we sat on the floor, we got beaten. If you look at the light, you are beaten,' he said. He was once thrown into solitary for simply praying in his cell. 'Everything is considered a violation,' he said. 'Your life is one big violation to them.' He said that in his first year in the prison guards would call out hundreds of names over the course of days. One officer told him it was for executions. When he was freed Sunday, he thought he was dreaming. 'We never thought we would see this moment. We thought we would be executed, one by one.' Noha Qweidar and her cousin sat in the yard on Monday, taking a rest from searching. Their husbands were detained in 2013 and 2015. Qweidar said she had received word from other inmates that her husband was killed in a summary execution in prison. But she couldn’t know for sure. Prisoners reported dead in the past have turned up alive. 'I heard that (he was executed) but I still have hope he is alive.' Just before sundown on Monday, rescue teams brought in an excavator to dig deeper. But late at night, the White Helmets announced the end of their search, saying in a statement they had found no hidden areas in the facility. 'We share the profound disappointment of the families of the thousands who remain missing and whose fates are unknown.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-saydnaya-prison-assad-families-search-9f533d54b4df72f97416f90921dd2a9c	2024-12-09T20:05:04-08:00	
Soros' Open Society Foundations say they remain focused on human rights	NEW YORK (AP) — Despite years of internal turmoil and changes, Open Society Foundations wants those in the human rights sector to know their movements will still receive support from the organization, its president Binaifer Nowrojee said Tuesday. The foundations, founded by billionaire investor George Soros and now led by one of his sons, Alex Soros, have historically been one of the largest funders of human rights groups. But since 2021, they closed some of their programs and reduced their staff as part of a major internal reorganization. In the process, many grantees and others in the human rights movement have waited anxiously to see where the chips would fall. 'A reimagination has taken place under the leadership of the new board chair at Open Society Foundations,' Nowrojee said, referring to Alex Soros. 'One of the reasons that we wanted to really reiterate in a large way, with balloons, et cetera, that we are still committed to human rights, is because of this fear that’s permeated with the changes that somehow Open Society Foundations is no longer going to be working on rights or equity or justice,' she said in advance of Human Rights Day, which the United Nations observes on Dec. 10. Nowrojee offered few new details about OSF's specific funding priorities, though earlier this year, the foundations committed $400 million toward green jobs and economic development. Another new program focuses on protecting environmental defenders that will work in a few countries, like Colombia and the Democratic Republic of Congo and end after five years, said Sharan Srinvias, a director of programs at OSF. 'We did a survey of what other donors are supporting and in general, we saw that this is where the gap is,' he said of people who come under attack for defending land, water or other resources. 'Especially bilateral donors find it much easier to support global organizations, who in turn are able to support prominent rights defenders in capital cities who are well known.' One benefit of the limited time horizon, Srinvias said, is his team will mostly make grants of three or five years — longer than OSF's typical grants — and offer grantees more flexibility. It will also have some funds to respond to emergencies for human rights defenders all over the world. In 2020, OSF was the largest global human rights funder, giving out the most money overall and making the largest number of grants. That's according to the Human Rights Funders Network, a membership organization of grantmakers that tracks philanthropic funding for human rights groups. 'When major funders adjust their priorities, it can have a ripple effect. Their decisions can dramatically impact the human rights movements they once supported, especially in regions where they’ve been a long-time champion,' HRFN wrote in its most recent Advancing Human Rights report from September. To add to the atmosphere of uncertainty, another major human rights funder, Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, announced earlier this year that it would end its work by 2028. OSF's board aims to employ 600 people in total around the world, Nowrojee said, which is down from a reported 800 in 2021. Some of the changes OSF made in the last three years include winding down its global public health program and significantly diminishing its programs in the European Union. It spun off its area of work focused on Roma communities into a new organization and issued final grants to many of its partners. 'You never want philanthropy to just be doing the same thing. You want philanthropy to be getting out of stuff,' Nowrojee said. 'And so there’s large areas of work where huge achievements were made, which we have retreated from, not because we don’t think that there’s value in them, but the movements themselves have strengthened.' People who worked for OSF's public health program and some of their grantees have spoken about its impacts over almost three decades through an oral history project led by University of Southern California Institute on Inequalities in Global Health and funded by OSF. Jonathan Cohen, who led the OSF public health program and now holds positions at USC, told an interviewer with the oral history project about a decision in 2020 by OSF's leadership to take funding from its programs and reallocate it to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 'That claw-back in April should have been a sign, I think, to all of us that we were not long for this world,' Cohen said, of the public health program. 'But of course, you don’t accept that. You fight. You resist. You try to keep your program, which is what we did until we couldn’t.' Among the movements that OSF had supported under its public health program was the the Network of Sex Work Projects, a global coalition of sex worker groups. It formed in 1992 in part in response to the killing of sex workers who had HIV, said Ruth Morgan Thomas, who was NSWP's global coordinator for many years, as part of the oral history project. She said she was saddened to see the closure of OSF's public health work. 'I hope as it reemerges and its global strategy reemerges, it will retain its stance and support for promoting the realization of sex workers’ rights and inclusion in our societies,' she said. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

China's exports slow, imports decline, in November falling below forecasts	HONG KONG (AP) — China’s exports slowed in November and its imports declined, falling below forecasts and underscoring potential weakness in trade at a time when its leaders are striving to boost the economy after the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Customs data Tuesday showed exports grew 6.7% from a year earlier, down from a 12.7% increase in October. Analysts had estimated that exports had risen more than 8%. Imports fell 3.9% from a year earlier, reflecting weak demand from industries and consumers. With exports outpacing imports, China’s trade surplus rose to $97.4 billion. The report came a day after Beijing pledged to loosen monetary policy and provide more support for the world’s No. 2 economy. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs of 60% or more on imports of Chinese goods, complicating Beijing's efforts by threatening an area of the economy that has performed relatively well while the property sector remains in the doldrums and consumer spending remains fragile. Some analysts say that the latest setbacks are likely to be temporary. 'We expect exports to accelerate again in the coming months, supported by gains in export competitiveness and exporters front-running tariffs,' Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a note. 'Import volumes declined last month, but they are likely to recover in the short run as accelerated fiscal spending boosts demand for industrial commodities,' she said. The effects of tariffs will likely only be felt in the middle of 2025, Huang wrote. In another sign of slack demand, consumer inflation in November was a lower-than-expected 0.2%, according to data released Monday, down from 0.3% the month before mainly due to lower food prices. But late last month, an official survey by the National Bureau of Statistics showed China's factory activity expanding for a second consecutive month in November, rising to 50.3, the highest figure reported in seven months. A reading above 50 suggests growth while below 50 represents a contraction. The revival in factory orders may also reflect efforts to beat higher tariffs, analysts said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-trade-exports-economy-47d2788059c9dabbb2905120d16f6ea9	2024-12-09T19:42:05-08:00	
South Korean prosecutors seek to arrest ex-defense minister over martial law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean prosecutors are seeking to formally arrest the former defense minister alleged to have colluded with President Yoon Suk Yeol in imposing martial law last week, as authorities are investigating whether their acts amount to rebellion. Martial law lasted only about six hours but was the first of its kind in more than 40 years and has caused a domestic firestorm and large street protests. Yoon and his associates face criminal investigations and impeachment attempts. The Justice Ministry has banned Yoon and eight others from leaving the country as authorities see them as key suspects in the martial law case. It’s the first time that a sitting president in South Korea has received such a travel ban. The Seoul Central District Court said Tuesday it’ll review prosecutors' request for a warrant to arrest former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber to unanimously reject Yoon’s decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Dec. 4. Kim released a statement through his law firm, saying that he 'deeply apologizes for causing significant anxiety and inconvenience.' He said that all responsibility over the martial law enforcement rests solely with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers deployed to enforce martial law, saying they were only following orders. If the arrest warrant is issued, Kim would be the first person arrested over the martial law case. Prosecutors would have up to 20 days to investigate Kim and determine whether to indict him. A conviction on the charge of rebellion would carry up to the death penalty. Prosecutors reportedly accuse Kim of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power by staging a riot to disrupt the constitution in collaboration with Yoon and other military and police officers. Prosecutors' offices in Seoul couldn't immediately confirm the reports. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun, to obstruct lawmakers from entering the National Assembly’s main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim’s instructions was to prevent the assembly from gathering the required 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon’s martial law order. Kwak is among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended him last week. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' but South Korea wasn’t in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean constitution doesn’t allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed the need to rebuild the country by eliminating 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces' in a reference to his liberal rival rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has been on a near-constant collision course with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which has introduced motions seeking to impeach some of his top officials and launched a fierce political offensive against Yoon over a spate of scandals involving him and his wife. The focus of attention is how authorities could investigate Yoon and whether they can detain him. South Korean law gives a president immunity from prosecution while in office, except for allegations of rebellion or treason. This means that Yoon can be questioned and detained by investigative agencies over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. They also say the security service won’t likely permit searches of Yoon’s office, citing a law that prohibits searches on sites with state secrets without approval from those in charge of those areas. In the case of former President Park Geun-hye, who was thrown out of office in 2017 after being impeached by parliament over a corruption scandal, prosecutors failed to search her office and ended up receiving documents outside the compound because presidential officials turned them away. After refusing to meet with prosecutors while in office, Park underwent questioning by them and was arrested after the Constitutional Court approved her impeachment and ruled to dismiss her as president in March 2017. Yoon avoided impeachment Saturday, after most ruling party lawmakers boycotted a floor vote. The Democratic Party said it would prepare for a new vote to impeach Yoon on Saturday. The party on Tuesday submitted motions to impeach Yoon’s police chief and justice minister as well. It pushed to impeach Kim Yong Hyun and the safety minister, but they resigned before parliament votes took place. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If it voted for removal, a new presidential election would be required.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-defense-minister-c07fea5a701d5d708bfc236b3b81ee6f	2024-12-09T19:40:33-08:00	
Argentina’s Milei marks one year in office. Here's how his shock measures are reshaping the economy	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — When libertarian President Javier Milei assumed office one year ago, Argentine supermarkets were marking price increases on an almost daily basis. Middle-class families tried to spend their rapidly depreciating pesos as quickly as they got them, and economists warned the country was teetering on the brink of hyperinflation. It was popular outrage over this upside-down economy that fueled the rise of Milei, a self-declared 'anarcho-capitalist' and former TV pundit who rode to power on vows to 'blow up' the central bank, take an axe to the bloated government and kill sky-high inflation. It was an almost impossible job, and Milei's lack of government experience, unkempt hairdo, sexual boasts and missionary-like zeal for his dead dog, the Rolling Stones and the free market didn't inspire much confidence in a country with a history of failed economic reforms. 'It wasn’t a given that he could govern Argentina when he took office,' said Marcelo J. García, Americas director at geopolitical risk firm Horizon Engage. 'He was Mr. Nobody.' On taking power, Milei implemented a series of austerity measures, including slashing energy and transportation subsidies, laying off tens of thousands of government workers, freezing public infrastructure projects and imposing wage and pension freezes below inflation. It has been brutal. Unemployment has climbed, economic activity has declined and poverty has surged. But now signs have emerged that Argentina’s bizarre and long mismanaged economy is starting to look a little more normal. Monthly inflation has plummeted, bonds have rallied and the closely watched gap between the black market dollar and the official rate has shrunk as much as 44%. Argentina's country-risk index, an influential measure of the risk of default, is at its lowest point in five years. 'He reaches the anniversary at the best moment of his administration,' García said. Inflation: a priority Inflation, Argentina's perpetual scourge and Milei's top priority upon coming to office, slowed from a monthly rate of 25.5% in December 2023 to just 2.7% in October — its lowest level in three years. 'Inflation has gone down faster than what everyone has expected,' said Ignacio Labaqui, a Buenos Aires-based senior analyst at risk consultancy Medley Global Advisors. 'That’s something that validates his narrative and sustains his popularity.' In a sign of Milei's long way to go — and the unmitigated shambles he inherited — Argentina's annual inflation rate remains at 193%. But Argentines are paying closer attention to month-to-month inflation, taking the sharp decline as a sign that Milei’s fiscal shock therapy is paying off. 'Last year it was a shock to the system, I couldn’t keep up with the prices,' said 34-year-old deli worker Jazmin Quintana. 'I’m not saying I like the guy, I find his personality very weird and aggressive, but I admit — if he continues on this route I’ll be very happy.' A stronger peso A stronger peso is also boosting confidence. The black market dollar price has dropped since July, narrowing its gap with the official rate of 980. Chileans, once accustomed to bargain-hunting in Argentina, are now surprised to see the traffic reversed. Shoppers unable to afford iPhones and kitchen appliances in Argentina arrive at Chilean border towns by the busload to get the most bang from their buck. The customs office shut down briefly last month because officials were overwhelmed. Underpinning the currency appreciation is a new tax amnesty to lure Argentines to declare their hidden U.S. dollar savings — longs squirreled away in offshore bank accounts and under mattresses. Ahead of the first-phase deadline on Oct. 31, the scheme drew some $19 billion into Argentina’s banks, the tax agency reported, boosting scarce foreign exchange reserves. But a strong peso also carries risks — squeezing domestic industry by making exports more costly, deterring investors and raising fears of a crash. Foreign visitors are warned of higher prices as peak tourism season begins. 'The prices are INSANE,' reads a popular Reddit post about travel in Argentina, filled with cautionary tales of $50 dinners and $100 T-shirts. Painful consequences Argentina's first budget surplus in 12 years has come at a steep cost. Milei halted inflation increases for university budgets, leaving some universities struggling to keep their lights on and elevators running. He downgraded the culture ministry, closed the national theater institute, shuttered a state-funded news agency and defunded scientific research. He suspended public works projects, leaving cities littered with white-elephant structures. An estimated 200,000 construction workers lost their jobs in the last year, says the Argentine Chamber of Construction. The brutal austerity has deepened Argentina's recession, with consumer spending falling 20% percent in the past year and poverty rates soaring to a two-decade high of 52.9% in the second half of last year. Argentina’s retirees are perhaps the most potent symbol of the strife inflicted by Milei’s fiscal shock. Some of the government’s biggest savings came from holding down the real value of pensions. The average minimum monthly pension is just $300. 'We have always been in bad shape, but now things are even harsher,' said Rubén Cocurullo, 76, among dozens of pensioners protesting at the social welfare office in Buenos Aires last week. 'Do they want to kill us?' An uncertain future In a country with a long history of raucous street protests, it's striking that the mass unrest pundits predicted last year has not materialized. That his approval ratings have held up at some 50% is also a sign of how desperately Argentines wanted change after years of crisis. 'Strangely enough, there comes a time in all societies, when the cost of a fiscal adjustment becomes less than the cost of continuing with inflation,' said Sebastián Mazzuca, an Argentine political scientist at Johns Hopkins University. 'It’s like a fire. There are badly injured people, but the fire was put out, wasn’t it?' It helps Milei that Argentina's left-leaning Peronist opposition is in disarray, with former President Alberto Fernández charged with beating his ex-wife while in office. Many also attribute the social peace to Milei’s expectation management. He warned that things would get worse before they got better. But now, as an ebullient Milei declares his government the most successful in history and assures Argentines they’ll soon collect on the economic revival he pledged would follow the pain, the bar is getting higher even as risks remain. To fulfill his promise of transforming the heavily regulated nation into one of the world’s freest economies, Milei needs to lift strict currency controls. That requires a fresh infusion of cash or a new deal with the International Monetary Fund, which would relieve pressure on the billions of dollars in debt repayments due next year. Foreign investors, as well as the IMF, to which Argentina owes an unprecedented $44 billion, have expressed excitement about Milei’s changes. But, still haunted by Argentina’s 2001 crisis — which culminated in the largest foreign-debt default in modern history — they’re cautious. 'Argentina still seems to be mired in a major ‘wait and see’ period,' said consulting firm Zuban Córdoba and Associates in a report on Milei’s first year. The radical populist hopes to profit from his budding bromances with President-elect Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk. As president of the biggest shareholder of the IMF in 2018, Trump was key to Argentina securing a record $56 billion loan package. The three men dined and danced together at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida last month. Milei claims his brutal cost-cutting inspired Trump and Musk to plan their so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Last week the Conservative Political Action Conference brought its traveling program to Buenos Aires, where Milei and right-wing political figures railed against socialism, praised Trump and pledged to battle what they saw as the global scourge of liberal 'woke-ism.' 'Everyone assumed that we were going to fail politically,' Milei told the cheering crowd. 'Today they admit, through gritted teeth, that they are surprised.' ___ Associated Press reporter Debora Rey contributed to this report. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-trump-musk-default-economy-inflation-libertarian-18efe55d81df459792a038ea9e321800	2024-12-09T19:20:26-08:00	
Mass evacuation of Philippine villages underway after a brief but major volcanic eruption	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — About 87,000 people were being evacuated in a central Philippine region Tuesday a day after a volcano briefly erupted with a towering ash plume and superhot streams of gas and debris hurtling down its western slopes. The latest eruption of Mount Kanlaon on central Negros island did not cause any immediate casualties, but the alert level was raised one level, indicating further and more explosive eruptions may occur. Volcanic ash fell on a wide area, including Antique province, more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) across seawaters west of the volcano, obscuring visibility and posing health risks, Philippine chief volcanologist Teresito Bacolcol and other officials said by telephone. At least six domestic flights and a flight bound for Singapore were canceled and two local flights were diverted in the region Monday and Tuesday due to Kanlaon’s eruption, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines. The mass evacuations were being carried out urgently in towns and villages nearest the western and southern slopes of Kanlaon which were blanketed by its ash, including in La Castellana town in Negros Occidental where nearly 47,000 people have to be evacuated out of a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) danger zone, the Office of Civil Defense said. More than 6,000 have moved to evacuation centers aside from those who have temporarily transferred to the homes of relatives in La Castellana by Tuesday morning, the town’s mayor, Rhumyla Mangilimutan, told The Associated Press by telephone. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said authorities were ready to provide support to large numbers of displaced villagers and that his social welfare secretary flew early Tuesday to the affected region. 'We are ready to support the families who have been evacuated outside the 6-kilometer danger zone,' Marcos told reporters. Government scientists were monitoring the air quality due to the risk of contamination from toxic volcanic gases that may require more people to be evacuated from areas affected by Monday’s eruption. Disaster-response contingents were rapidly establishing evacuation centers and seeking supplies of face masks, food and hygiene packs ahead of the Christmas season, traditionally a peak time for holiday travel and family celebrations in the largely Roman Catholic nation. Authorities also shut schools and imposed a nighttime curfew in the most vulnerable areas. The Philippines’ Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the nearly four-minute eruption of Kanlaon volcano on Monday afternoon had caused a pyroclastic density current — a superhot stream of gas, ash, debris and rocks that can incinerate anything in its path. 'It's a one-time but major eruption,' Bacolcol told the AP, adding that volcanologists were assessing if Monday's eruption spewed old volcanic debris and rocks clogged in and near the summit crater or was caused by rising magma from underneath. Few volcanic earthquakes were detected ahead of Monday's explosion, Bacolcol said. The alert level around Kanlaon was placed on Monday to the third-highest of a five-step warning system, indicating 'magmatic eruption' may have begun and may progress to further explosive eruptions. The 2,435-meter (7,988-foot) volcano, one of the country’s 24 most-active volcanoes, last erupted in June sending hundreds of villagers to emergency shelters. In 1996, three hikers were killed near the peak and several others were later rescued when Kanlaon erupted without warning, officials said.

Trudeau says Americans are realizing that Trump's tariffs on Canada make life a lot more expensive	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday said Americans 'are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive' and said he will retaliate if Donald Trump goes ahead with them. Speaking at an event put on by the Halifax Chamber of Commerce, Trudeau also said dealing with Trump will be 'a little more challenging' than the last time because Trump’s team is coming in with a much clearer set of ideas of what they want to do right away than after his first election win in 2016. The U.S. president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. 'Trump got elected on a commitment to make life better and more affordable for Americans, and I think people south of the border are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive,' Trudeau said. On the weekend, Trump appeared in an interview with NBC’s 'Meet the Press,' where the president-elect said he can’t guarantee that his promised tariffs on key U.S. foreign trade partners won’t raise prices for American consumers. 'Let’s not kid ourselves in any way, shape or form, 25% tariffs on everything going to the United States would be devastating for the Canadian economy,' Trudeau said. 'It would also, however, mean real hardship for Americans as well. Americans import 65% of their crude oil from Canada, significant amounts of electricity. Just about all the natural gas exported from Canada goes to the United States. They rely on us for steel and aluminum. They rely on us for a range of agriculture imports. All of those things would get more expensive.' If Trump makes good on his threat to slap 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, the price increases that could follow will collide with his campaign promise to give American families a break from inflation. Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods. The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate. 'We will of course, as we did eight years ago, respond to unfair tariffs,' Trudeau said. Trudeau said his government is still mulling over 'the right ways' to respond, referencing when Canada put billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports just $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most of it comes from one plant in Wisconsin, the home state of then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty. 'It was the fact that we put tariffs on bourbon and Harley-Davidsons and playing cards and Heinz ketchup and cherries and a number of other things that were very carefully targeted because they were politically impactful to the president’s party and colleagues,' Trudeau said. Trudeau said when Trump says things he means them but they also know Trump is trying to insert uncertainty and 'a bit of chaos' into democracies. 'One of the most important things for us to do is not freak out, not to panic,' Trudeau said. 'Knowing these would be absolutely devastating means we have to take them seriously but it does mean we have to be thoughtful and strategic and not going around making our opponents arguments for him but making our arguments in a significant and united way.' Canadian officials have said it is unfair to lump Canada in with Mexico. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with irregular migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time. Trump has also claimed the U.S. is 'subsidizing Canada to the tune of over $100 billion a year.' On America’s trade deficit Canada’s ambassador to Washington, Kirsten Hillman, told the AP U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and prices have been high. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing for national security. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trudeau-us-trump-tariffs-f23417b8f6671adf6b4c908be630615f	2024-12-09T15:49:17-08:00	
US hostage envoy in Beirut to seek information on missing journalist Austin Tice	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government's top hostage negotiator is in Beirut in hopes of collecting information on the whereabouts of Austin Tice, an American journalist missing in Syria for 12 years, the State Department said Monday. Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, is talking to officials in the region following the overthrow of Bashar Assad’s government to find out where Tice is and 'get him home as soon as possible,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters Monday. Lebanon has been involved for years in mediating talks about Tice. President Joe Biden said Sunday that his administration believed Tice was alive and was committed to bringing him home, though he also acknowledged that 'we have no direct evidence' of his status. Tice, who has had his work published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and others, disappeared at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus as the Syrian civil war intensified. A video released weeks after Tice went missing showed him blindfolded and held by armed men and saying, 'Oh, Jesus.' He has not been heard from since. Syria has publicly denied that it was holding him.	https://apnews.com/article/tice-journalist-syria-carstens-e20547144d1ad0580e7d64462b8c4135	2024-12-09T11:22:52-08:00	
Virginia man charged in FBI sting with supporting Islamic State goes on trial	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A Virginia man accused of funneling tens of thousands of dollars to the Islamic State group was a lonely man looking for a wife and relentlessly targeted by FBI sting operations, a defense lawyer told jurors Monday, including one undercover operative who pretended to be a willing bride. A jury in U.S. District Court in Alexandria heard opening statements in the terrorism trial of Mohammed Chhipa, 35, of Springfield, Virginia. Prosecutors say he met several times with an undercover FBI operative who gave him hundreds of dollars on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, earmarked for a Syrian woman and Islamic State member known as Umm Dujanah. In his opening statement, prosecutor Andrew Dixon said Chhipa took the money on each occasion, converted it to Bitcoin and sent it to accounts in Turkey, destined for the Islamic State. Dixon said Chhipa sent more than $74,000 in similar fashion to accounts in Turkey, collecting money from willing donors and funneling it to the Islamic State through Umm Dujanah. Chhipa was particularly interested in sending funds to help women from the Islamic State escape prison camps to which they had been sent after the terrorist group was routed from territory it held in Iraq and Syria, Dixon said. Dixon said Chhipa was well aware that what he was doing was illegal, fleeing the country at one point, only to be forced back to the United States. At one point, he said while under surveillance, 'I'm not sure why I'm not in prison.' Chhipa's defense attorney, Zachary Deubler, said the FBI had closely scrutinized Chhipa for years, based largely on advocacy of extremist views on social media. But he said the FBI never came up with a reason to arrest him, even after searching his home in 2019 and finding a cache of Islamic State propaganda. Deubler acknowledged that Chhipa left the country, through Latin America with an ultimate goal of getting to Egypt. The FBI met Chhipa when he returned to the U.S. at Dulles International Airport and questioned him about his activities but never arrested him. Deubler said the government's entrapment efforts intensified, to include a fake bride at one point and a supposed Muslim marriage broker at another. 'He was a lonely, sad, inflated man who the government tried to set up,' Deubler said. The trial began with several quirks. Chhipa appeared at trial in a green jumpsuit from the Alexandria jail, where he is being held. He said he did not want to wear civilian clothes, which are typically provided to defendants out of concern that jail outfits will prejudice the jury against a defendant. After a morning break, Chhipa's family refused to stand when the clerk said 'all rise' as the judge left the bench, and U.S. District Judge David Novak angrily told the family either to stand or be taken into custody. No arrests were made, even though several family members refused repeated directives from court security officers to stand. Last year, after Chhipa's arrest, prosecutors said Chhipa considers himself to be married to Allison Fluke-Ekren, an American from Kansas who is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Fluke-Ekren pleaded guilty last year to organizing and leading the Khatiba Nusaybah, a battalion in the Islamic State in which roughly 100 women and girls learned how to use automatic weapons and detonate grenades and suicide belts. Prosecutors, though, say that the marriage was apparently conducted online and has no legal status in the U.S. They said Chhipa, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from India, has been trying to adopt Fluke-Ekren’s children. The trial is expected to last about a week.	https://apnews.com/article/islamic-state-financing-chhipa-virginia-fbi-77235ab9804887d4ed6692612abd2c7b	2024-12-09T11:22:24-08:00	
A long road ahead to decide Syria’s future after rapid end to Assad’s rule	BEIRUT (AP) — For the first time in 50 years, the question of how Syria will be governed is wide open. The end of the Assad family's rule is for many Syrians a moment of mixed joy and fear, of the total unknown. The insurgency that swept President Bashar Assad out of power is rooted in Islamist jihadi fighters. Its leader says he has renounced past ties to al-Qaida, and he has gone out of his way to assert a vision of creating a pluralistic Syria governed by civil institutions — not dictators and not ideology. But even if he is sincere, he is not the only player. The insurgency is made up of multiple factions, and the country is riven among armed groups, including U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters controlling the east. Remnants of the old regime’s military — and its feared security and intelligence services — could coalesce once again. Foreign powers with their own interests have their hands deep in the country, and any of them — Russia, Iran, Turkey, the United States and Israel — could act as spoilers. Syria’s multifaith and multiethnic population sees itself poised on a moment that could tip either into chaos or cohesion. The country’s Sunni Muslims, Shiite Alawites, Christians and ethnic Kurds have often been pitted against each, whether by Assad’s rule or a 14-year civil war. Divisions from the conflict run deep, and many worry about revenge killings, whether against former figures of Assad’s state or — more frightening — whole communities seen as backing the old system. The civil war displaced half of Syria's prewar population of 23 million. Many who fled are watching developments closely to determine whether the time has come to return. Right now there are only questions. How will Syria be governed? In the short period following Assad’s abrupt fall, rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has sought to reassure Syrians that the group he leads — Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS – does not seek to dominate the country and will continue government services. He has spoken of setting up a decentralized governance system. Government officials who remained in Damascus as Assad fled — including Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali — have met with the rebels to discuss the transfer of power. The Al Jazeera television network reported Monday that HTS had decided to appoint the head of the 'salvation government' running its stronghold in northwest Syria, Mohammed Al-Bashir, to form a transitional government. There was no official confirmation. Details on what form the government will take have been scarce. The rebels likely did not expect to be saddled with running an entire country when they launched their offensive against Aleppo less than two weeks ago, said Qutaiba Idlbi, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs. The rapid fall of Damascus and the melting away of police and military, left security challenges, he said. The only existing framework for a transition is no longer relevant. U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 had called for a political process involving both Assad’s government and opposition groups. 'Everyone’s saying, especially rebels on the ground, ‘That framework is no longer applicable, because there is no longer a regime. We’re not going to give the regime in politics what they lost through military means,’' Idlbi said. So far, public sector workers have not heeded calls from the caretaker prime minister to go back to their jobs -- causing troubles in places like airports, borders and at the Foreign Ministry, said Adam Abdelmoula, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Syria. 'I think it will take a couple of days — and a lot of assurance on the part of the armed groups — for these people to return to work again,' he said. In the current chaos, U.N. workers have had difficulty accessing the country, and that has hampered distribution of humanitarian aid, he said. How inclusive will the insurgents be? The insurgents have sought to reassure Syria’s religious minorities that they will not be targeted, despite HTS' fundamentalist Sunni Muslim origins. So far the civil peace seems to be holding. The insurgents have appeared disciplined, working to keep order, with no sign of reprisals. Experts say only time will tell what post-Assad Syria will look like. 'Everyone’s still willing to really engage, really work with others,' said Haid Haid, a consulting fellow at the Middle East and North Africa program of Chatham House. 'That sort of positive atmosphere is crucial, but it might not last long.' Splits could open as decisions are made. It can’t be guaranteed all the fighters within the HTS will back al-Sharaa’s talk of a pluralist system. Outside Damascus’ historic Hamadiyeh market on Sunday, around a dozen fighters chanted, 'Down, down with a secular state' — a sign that at least some among the insurgents may seek a harder Islamist line. 'The opposition is not a homogenous movement,' said Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow for Middle East Security at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London. There are multiple armed opposition groups, including forces in the south who are distinct from HTS and the Turkish-backed groups in the north. Internal fractures within the HTS-led movement, 'which may become more salient in the weeks and months to come, may lead to discord and threaten Syrian stability,' Ozcelik said. There may be pressure to purge former members of Assad’s large state bureaucracy, especially those employed as part of a vast security state that included informers and officers widely hated for torture, abuses and corruption. Insurgents and many in the public don’t want them to return. But a purge can spark a destabilizing backlash — as when U.S. administrators disbanded Iraq’s army after Saddam Hussein’s fall in 2003, fueling a Sunni insurgency. Syria’s Alawite population is feeling particularly vulnerable. Assad and his family were Alawites — a branch of Shia Islam — and many among the Sunni insurgents see the community as his loyalists. The question of the Kurds looms large Kurdish-led forces allied with the United States have run a semi-autonomous zone in Syria’s northeast for years, where they have been a key player in the fight against the Islamic State militant group. While both were opponents of the government during the civil war, the relationship between the Kurds and the Arab opposition groups is tense. HTS has been extending an olive branch to the Kurds. Reintegrating the east would likely mean some form of concession to Kurdish autonomy. But that risks angering neighboring Turkey, which vehemently opposes the Kurdish factions that run Syria’s east. Already, Turkish-backed insurgents allied with HTS have taken the opportunity to push the Kurds out of some pockets of territory, seizing the northern town of Manbij, and clashes have broken out in other areas. While the insurgents' largely benign approach to minorities so far has allayed many international worries, Abdelmoula said, 'those pockets of fighting are very significant because the fighting is mostly along ethnic lines. And that’s dangerous.' ——— Associated Press writers Danica Kirka in London and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.

Mexican soldiers will get a pay raise after elimination of oversight agencies, president says	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president said Monday that much of the money gained by eliminating independent oversight and regulatory agencies will go to the army to fund a rise in soldiers’ pay. The announcement by President Claudia Sheinbaum is the latest in a a series of new and unusual funding sources to pay for the country’s increasingly influential military. Last week, Mexico’s Congress approved charging every cruise ship passenger a $42 immigration fee, with much of that money also going to the armed forces. Under Sheinbaum's Morena party, since 2019 the military has been given powers to build and run everything from railways, airports and airlines in Mexico, and some of those projects appear to be losing money. For over a century before, Mexico's armed forces were very limited in their actions, restricted from taking any role in politics and didn't have many business interests. But that all changed under Sheinbaum's predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who saw the army as a loyal, unquestioning ally and a safeguard for his political and policy legacy. López Obrador, Sheinbaum's political mentor, also made the armed forces, and the quasi-military National Guard, the country's main law enforcement forces. In late November, Mexico’s Senate voted to eliminate seven independent regulatory and oversight agencies, a move that critics warn will cement the ruling party’s power and avoid outside scrutiny. Sheinbaum called it a money-saving measure, arguing that the government can more efficiently handle functions like freedom of information requests, anti-monopoly enforcement and energy-market regulation. However, critics and foreign investors and critics fear this could open the door to favoritism and a lack of transparency. And earlier this month, Mexico’s Senate — controlled by the president's Morena party — voted to charge cruise ship passengers $42 per head for port calls, drawing sharp criticism from the tourism industry. Mexican business chambers say the immigration charge — from which cruise passengers used to be exempt — may hurt the country’s $500 million per year cruise industry. Two-thirds of the money raised from the cruise ship charges would go to the Mexican army, not to improve port facilities. Moreover, many of the military-run projects appear to be big money losers, which may help explain the government's urge to find extra funding for the armed forces. For example, one of López Obrador's pet projects — the 'Maya Train,' a tourist line which runs in a loop around the Yucatan Peninsula — has drawn only 20% of the ridership expected when it was proposed. The Maya Train started service on Dec. 16, 2023. While it's not completely finished — two relatively little-used stretches are scheduled to enter service later this months — the most popular and heavily-travelled parts of the line are already in service. As of Dec. 8, authorities announced the train line had carried a little more than 600,000 passengers in its first 51 weeks. That is only one-fifth of the 3 million passengers authorities had claimed it would carry per year. On Monday, the government announced a 'package tour' deal in which another military-run, money losing project — the government-owned Mexicana airline — would offer flights to stations along the Maya Train line. The flight would take off, of course, from another military-run project, the new Mexico City Felipe Angeles airport, which is just starting to break even because the government forced cargo planes, and some passenger flights, to use it. Mexico’s ruling Morena party is already running enormous budget deficits to fund its favorite building projects like railways and oil refineries — some of which are being built by the army. The government is desperate to find new revenue sources.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-army-funding-projects-e6ad34e863414c47f5180be63cefccdc	2024-12-09T09:34:13-08:00	
Ghana's ex-leader is declared the winner of the presidential election	ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — Ghana’s former leader John Dramani Mahama was officially declared the winner of the presidential election on Monday evening, after voters vented anger at the government’s handling of the economy. Previously president between 2012 and 2017, Mahama, 65, received 6.3 million votes, or 56.5% of votes cast, the electoral commission said. Mahama’s main opponent, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, conceded defeat on Sunday. Bawumia got 4.6 million votes, or 41%. The turnout based on the votes from 267 constituencies stands at 60.9 percent, said Jean Mensa, the electoral commissioner. Although vote counting was ongoing in nine constituencies, that will not change the final result, Mensa added. Mahama has described his victory as 'emphatic.' He had promised to 'reset' the country on various fronts, during a campaign that prioritized the economy and largely appealed to young Ghanaians who saw the vote as a way out of the country’s economic crisis. After Bawumia conceded defeat, celebrations broke out on Sunday among the supporters of the opposition candidate in parts of the country, including the capital city. Wearing the opposition party’s white, green, red and black colors, women and young people danced to music and trumpet blasts on the streets and at the party’s national headquarters The election for both the president and members of parliament was held against the backdrop of the country’s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. It was seen as a litmus test for democracy in a region shaken by extremist violence and coups. West Africa’s regional bloc of ECOWAS said the election was generally peaceful, a continuing trend in Ghana. Bawumia was running as the flagbearer of the ruling New Patriotic Party, or NPP, which has struggled to resolve the economic crisis under outgoing President Nana Akufo-Addo. Mahama’s National Democratic Congress also won the majority in parliament, he said. Mahama’s win is viewed as following the latest trend of elections around the world, favoring opposition parties against incumbents, from the United States to European countries — such as Britain and France — as well as South Africa. The former president is 'the only person' who can fix the ailing economy in Ghana, one of West Africa’s economic powerhouses, said Jude Agbemava, a policy analyst who voted for him. Like in most other elections in countries where the incumbent lost, the vote in Ghana was about the people making their disaffection known against a government that has lost goodwill, said Seidu Alidu, head of the department of political science at Ghana’s University of Legon. 'I think it has to do with the economy, which is largely a bread and butter issue for every Ghanaian,' said Alidu. 'When the people elect you, they require you to do certain things for them. But it was also about the style of governance (because) even in other countries facing economic challenges, governments were being honest with the people, telling them what the reality is, and the steps they have taken to manage it,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/ghana-election-president-mahama-409cfac5c60e0ab8056b04c867e068bc	2024-12-09T09:15:53-08:00	
As Israel advances on a Syrian buffer zone, it sees peril and opportunity	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The dramatic downfall of Syrian President Bashar Assad presents possible danger, and an opening, for neighboring Israel. After fighting wars on multiple fronts for months, Israel is now concerned that unrest in Syria could spill over into its territory. Israel also views the end of the Assad regime as a chance to disrupt Iran's ability to smuggle weapons through Syria to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The Israeli military over the weekend began seizing control of a demilitarized buffer zone in Syria created as part of a 1974 ceasefire between the countries. It said the move was temporary and meant to secure its border. But the incursion sparked condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria for a land grab. Israel still controls the Golan Heights that it captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed — a move not recognized by most of the international community. Here’s a look at recent developments along the Syrian frontier. Where are the Israeli troops? Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israeli forces were moving to control a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized buffer zone in Syrian territory. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. A U.N. force of about 1,100 troops has patrolled the area since then. On a visit Sunday to a Golan Heights hilltop overlooking Syria, Netanyahu said that because Syrian troops had abandoned their positions, Israel's move into the buffer zone was necessary as a 'temporary defensive position.' 'The peacekeepers at (the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, or UNDOF) informed the Israeli counterparts that these actions would constitute a violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement, that there should be no military forces or activities in the area of separation,' said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric. He added that the buffer zone was calm and UNDOF peacekeepers remained in their position. The Security Council is scheduled to meet for special consultations called by Russia to discuss the buffer zone issue. The rebels who ousted Assad and now control much of Syria are led by a former senior al-Qaida militant, although he severed ties with the extremist group years ago and has promised representative government and religious tolerance. On Monday evening, Netanyahu said Assad’s fall is the 'direct result of the heavy blows we landed on Hamas, on Hezbollah and on Iran.' He added that Israel would occupy the summit of Mount Hermon, which is within the buffer zone on the Syria-Lebanon border, and at 2,814 meters (9,232 feet) is the highest peak in the eastern Mediterranean coast. Israel has sent both ground and air troops into the buffer zone, including on the Syrian side of snow-dusted Mount Hermon, which is divided between the Golan Heights, Lebanon, and Syria. Only the United States recognizes Israel's control of the Golan Heights. How long will Israeli troops be in the buffer zone? Israeli troops began moving into the buffer zone Saturday. Also on Saturday, armed men attacked U.N. forces near the border with Israel, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. '(The Israeli military) took targeted and temporary control of certain areas near the border to prevent an Oct. 7 scenario from Syria,' Saar said, referring to Hamas' surprise 2023 attack into Israel from the Gaza Strip. Many in the region condemned the move. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry accused Israel of 'exploiting the power vacuum … to occupy more Syrian territories and create a fait accompli in violation of international law.' This isn’t the first time Israel has entered the buffer zone this year. An Associated Press report last month examining satellite imagery found that Israel had been working on a construction project, possibly a new road, along the border with Syria from as early as July, and had in some cases entered the buffer zone during construction. Following the AP report, U.N. forces warned that the Israeli military has committed 'severe violations' of its ceasefire deal with Syria. Is Israel invading Syria? Israeli political and military leaders have stressed that the seizure of the buffer zone is temporary and not a prelude to entering other parts of Syrian territory. 'The plan at the moment is that this is a temporary step to make sure stability is kept in the border, making sure the buffer zone is kept, and the U.N. forces can stay,' said a military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military guidelines. The official noted that in 2014, U.N. peacekeepers fled the buffer zone after al-Qaida-linked Syrian rebels attacked their encampments. After armed men attacked U.N. forces over the weekend, Israel wanted to ensure the situation did not repeat itself, the official said. Israel isn’t currently trying to change the border or prepare for an invasion into Syria, said Carmit Valensi, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think-tank. 'Right now, it’s a tactical operation, not a long-term strategy, in response to the dynamic situation in Syria,' she said. With the collapse of the Syrian army, Israel wants to protect its borders until the situation stabilizes, she said. What are Israel’s interests? Israel says its immediate goal is to prevent the instability in Syria from spreading into the border region. Defense Minister Israel Katz on Monday laid out Israel’s plans for the border area. He said that after completing the takeover of the buffer zone, Israel would create a 'security zone' beyond it by destroying heavy artillery across Syria and preventing Iran from smuggling weapons through Syria into Lebanon. Foreign Minister Saar said Monday that Israel has struck multiple sites holding chemical weapons and long-range missiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of hostile actors. Saar did not say when the strikes occurred. Analysts said Israel is likely to continue carrying out strikes against targets across Syria. Israel is planning outreach to Syria’s Druze population, a close-knit religious minority that also lives in Israel, Jordan and Lebanon and has maintained some ties across borders. Israel is also trying to open lines of communication with Syrian rebel groups, to help ensure Iranian-backed factions don’t reclaim any territory, according to Valensi. For many years, Israel quietly provided food, medicine, clothing and other assistance to war-ravaged southern Syria through 'Operation Good Neighbor,' which ended in 2018. More than 4,000 wounded and sick Syrians received medical treatment in Israel or in Israeli field hospitals, and those non-diplomatic connections could now prove crucial. ___ Associated Press writer Edith M.

Assad’s downfall is a humbling blow to Russia. How will it affect Putin's prestige?	Almost exactly seven years ago, President Vladimir Putin stood with Russian troops at their air base in Syria and proudly declared victory over 'terrorists' in that country as part of the Kremlin’s military intervention to prop up the government of Bashar Assad amid a civil war. This weekend, those hard-won gains seemed a distant memory. Assad hastily fled to Moscow as his power crumbled during a lightning offensive by rebels that his main international allies, Russia and Iran, were unable to stem. The Kremlin’s failure to prevent Assad’s swift downfall has exposed limits of Russia’s power and dented its international clout at a pivotal stage of its war in Ukraine. A look at Russia’s involvement in Syria and the possible consequences of Assad’s demise for Moscow: What was Russia's role in Syria and its civil war? The Soviet Union was a longtime ally of Assad's father, Hafez Assad, who ruled the country for nearly 30 years, and provided military advisers and aid. After an 2011 uprising against Bashar Assad’s rule morphed into a civil war, Russia continued to be a key backer of Damascus, offering political support at the United Nations. When Assad’s rule neared collapse after a series of battlefield defeats in 2015, Russia joined Iran to intervene militarily. Russia deployed warplanes to the Hemeimeem air base in Syria’s coastal province of Latakia, delivering thousands of tons of military equipment and supplies in an operation dubbed the 'Syrian Express.' On Sept. 30, 2015, Moscow launched its air campaign. Russia kept only about 50 warplanes at Hemeimeem, but they operated at a frenetic pace, each flying several sorties a day. Most of the Russian air force personnel were rotated through the base, giving them combat experience. At the same time, Moscow expanded and upgraded its naval base in Tartus, the only such outpost outside the former USSR. It deployed special operations forces for critical ground missions and sent hundreds of military advisers to train Syrian troops and direct their operations. Mercenaries from Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner Group military contractor also joined the battle. The military intervention allowed Assad to reclaim control of most of Syria, making the Kremlin a key power broker in the Middle East and boosting Russia’s prestige. Putin's triumphal visit to Hemeimeem on Dec. 11, 2017, came a week after Russia declared victory over the Islamic State group in Syria and shortly after he announced a reelection bid for 2018. It was Russia’s first military operation outside the former Soviet Union since the USSR's collapse in 1991 and gave Moscow a chance to test its latest weapons in combat. That military success emboldened Putin and was a key factor that contributed to his decision to invade Ukraine in 2022. Why did Russia fail to keep Assad in power? After helping Assad regain control over most Syria, Russia urged him to engage in talks with moderate opposition groups. Buoyed by opposition defeats, however, Assad staunchly resisted any initiatives aimed at national reconciliation. 'Trying to minimize its costs in Syria, Russia has increasingly focused on maintaining the shaky and inefficient status quo, preserving the crumbling and delegitimized Assad regime without any perspectives,' said Ruslan Pukhov, a Moscow-based military expert, in an analysis. During recent contacts between Syrian and Turkish officials that Moscow helped broker this year, Assad’s government showed little interest in compromise -– a recalcitrance that paved the way for the offensive by Turkey-backed opposition groups that ousted Assad. Syria’s economic woes, exacerbated by isolating international sanctions, weakened the country and its military. The demoralized Syrian army quickly crumbled under the brunt of the opposition offensive, a rapid meltdown that Tehran and Moscow couldn't avert with the small contingents they had in Syria. Russia dedicated the bulk of its assets to the war in Ukraine, while Iran, weakened by international sanctions and locked in a tense standoff with Israel, similarly lacked resources to help Assad. Alexander Dugin, an ideologue linked to some hawkish Kremlin circles, called Assad’s demise as a painful blow to Russia. 'The Assad regime that we supported through enormous efforts collapsed in just a few days. It’s very sad,' Dugin said. What happens to Russian assets in Syria? With Assad’s demise, the future of Russia bases in Syria — its only military foothold outside the former Soviet Union — is in question. The number of Russian warplanes at Hemeimeem air base has shrunk from several dozen to just a few, although it continues to be a key logistics point. Russian military cargo planes ferrying private contractors and supplies to Africa used it for refueling, and its loss would pose logistical problems for operations there. 'The importance of Syria for Russia’s operations in Africa has been invaluable,' Moscow-based Middle East expert Nikolai Sukhov said in televised comments. The Tartus naval base is used by Russian warships for maintenance, refueling and replenishing supplies on visits to the Mediterranean. While opposition forces that eventually ousted Assad swept across Syria in late November, the Russian navy and air force held drills in the eastern Mediterranean, with Tartus as its operational center. Even as Putin granted Assad and his family an asylum in Russia, Moscow reached out to the new Syrian authorities to try to ensure the security of its bases and to extend their stay. An opposition flag quickly was hoisted at the Syrian Embassy in Moscow. Asked about the bases, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would be a topic for future discussions with the new authorities. 'For now, we are witnessing a period of transformation and extreme instability, so it will obviously take time and require a serious conversation with those who will have power,' he said. Syria's new leaders reportedly promised not to attack Russian military facilities. Bronwen Maddox, director and chief executive at Chatham House, noted in a commentary that 'whatever government emerges in Damascus is expected – for the moment -– to respect the deal that Assad struck granting Russia use of a military base on the Syrian coast.' But she added that this 'important asset is vulnerable,' and that risks Russia's regional influence. What does Assad's demise mean for Russia? Assad's rapid downfall dealt a heavy blow to Putin at a time when he is preparing for a new U.S. administration and what that means for the war in Ukraine. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to negotiate an end to the conflict. Many observers note that the humiliating loss of Russia's only ally in the Middle East has dented Kremlin prestige on the global stage and could weaken Putin’s hand in any negotiations on Ukraine. 'The key issue is how Moscow will now try to adapt to the new realities and whether it will have enough flexibility to deal with the new masters of Syria, who seem to be interested in avoiding conflict with Moscow for now,' Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center wrote in a commentary. There is also the possibility that Putin could take an even more uncompromising stance in negotiations to avoid looking weak. 'Assad’s collapse has also shaken Putin, making him less inclined to demonstrate flexibility with Ukraine,' Stanovaya added. 'The war in Ukraine has, to some extent, cost him Syria, which reinforces his unwillingness to compromise.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-syria-assad-ukraine-war-31fa9b933372b3704ed285c96863892b	2024-12-09T07:59:57-08:00	
A gang leader in Haiti is accused of massacring older people to avenge his son's death	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A gang leader who controls a key port in Haiti's capital is accused of massacring older people and Vodou religious leaders in his community to avenge his son's death, according to the government and human rights organizations that estimate more than 100 killed. Reports on the number of dead in Port-au-Prince can vary wildly in a country where such killings often occur in gang-controlled, largely inaccessible areas. Haiti’s government in a statement Monday acknowledged the massacre, saying over 100 were killed in the Cité Soleil neighborhood, and promised to bring to justice those responsible for 'this unspeakable carnage.' Volker Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told journalists on Monday that at least 184 people were killed by a powerful gang leader. It wasn’t clear where his office had obtained that number, and a spokesperson did not return a request for comment. The U.N. secretary-general's office said 127 of the dead were older people. Haitian watchdogs also estimated more than 100 were killed, at times citing community residents. The Cooperative for Peace and Development, a local rights group, said in a statement Sunday its monitoring unit found that around 20 older people were killed. But it noted that unidentified residents in the community controlled by gang leader Micanor Altès, also known as Monel Felix and Wa Mikanò, claimed there were more than 100 victims. The National Human Rights Defense Network, another local rights group, said at least 110 people were killed between Friday and Saturday. The group and its executive director, Pierre Espérance, did not say where it obtained that information, and Espérance did not return requests for comment. The murky information was a worrying sign in a country in the grip of widespread gang violence. 'The fact that we have so many doubts about what happened days after the massacre is a signal that clearly indicates the level of control (gangs) have on the population,' said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. The accused gang leader controls the coastal communities of Wharf Jérémie, La Saline and Fort Dimanche and was known for robbery, extortion and hijacking of goods and trucks, according to a U.N. report earlier this year. 'Micanor was not known for being as brutal as other gang leaders,' Da Rin said. 'Not until now.' The gang leader could not be reached for comment and has not posted on social media. A spokesman for Haiti's National Police did not return a message for comment. The National Human Rights Defense Network said the massacre occurred because the gang leader's child was severely ill, prompting him to seek advice from a Vodou priest. After his son died, he accused older people in the community 'of practicing witchcraft and harming the child.' The Cooperative for Peace and Development said that according to information circulating in the community, Micanor accused people in the neighborhood for causing his son’s illness. 'He decided to cruelly punish all elderly people and (Vodou) practitioners who, in his imagination, would be capable of casting a bad spell on his son,' the group said. It said gunmen rounded up well-known community leaders and took them to the gang leader’s stronghold, where they were executed. Also killed were motorcycle drivers who tried to save some victims. The group also noted that there’s a ban on people leaving the community 'in order to continue to identify (Vodou) practitioners and the elderly with the aim of carrying out the silent killing.' Da Rin noted that usually killings in Haiti are documented and posted on social media, though they can be difficult to verify. 'In this case, there was not even a message on WhatsApp or a video on TikTok, which is very unusual,' he said. The Cooperative for Peace and Development said Micanor has previously targeted Vodou practitioners, killing a dozen older women and Vodou leaders 'wrongly accused of witchcraft' in recent years. It’s not unusual for Haitians to seek medical and other advice from Vodou priests known as 'oungans.' The religion that mixes Catholicism with animist beliefs was at the root of the revolution that led Haiti to become the world’s first free Black republic in 1804. The massacre in Port-au-Prince comes two months after over 70 people were killed in the central town of Pont-Sondé, where gangs are vying to control more territory. Such killings have overwhelmed Haiti’s National Police and a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police that lacks funds and personnel, with the U.S. and other countries pushing for a U.N. peacekeeping mission. 'The crisis in Haiti has reached catastrophic levels with allied criminal groups intensifying large-scale, coordinated attacks on the population and key state infrastructure,' Human Rights Watch said Monday as it called for a U.N. mission. It noted that 'many Haitians live with the constant fear of being killed, raped, kidnapped, or forcibly recruited even as they struggle every day to find adequate food, water, and health care to survive.' More than 4,500 people have been reported killed in Haiti this year, according to the U.N. ___ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-massacre-gangs-vodou-97c1206c79648b61b43fd6be6ee1079a	2024-12-09T07:55:33-08:00	
Nobel Peace Prize winner urges Putin to understand the destructiveness of nuclear weapons	OSLO, Norway (AP) — Terumi Tanaka, a survivor of the U.S. atomic bombings of Japan and the representative of an organization that won this year's Nobel Peace Prize, called on Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday to stop making nuclear threats. The 92-year-old spoke at a news conference in Oslo, Norway, a day before a ceremony where he is to deliver a lecture on behalf of Nihon Hidankyo, an organization of survivors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that won this year's prize. Asked by a reporter if he had a message for Putin, Tanaka said that the Russian leader's repeated nuclear threats convinced him that Putin must not understand how devastating the use of nuclear weapons would be. He said that his organization's message to Putin — which he said had also been conveyed to the Russian leader directly — is that 'nuclear weapons are things which must never be used.' 'I don’t think he has even thought about this or understood this. Therefore, he is able to say these kind of things. So I think that how we can change his way of thinking is what we need to do to have him really understand what these are,' he said through a translator. The first U.S. atomic bombing killed 140,000 people in the city of Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945. A second on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killed another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, ending World War II. Japan's Kyodo news agency says that Tanaka was 13 and living in Nagasaki when the United States dropped the atomic bomb there. While he did not suffer major injuries himself, he lost five family members, and has said that the images of burned bodies in the devastated city are etched in his memory. Jørgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said in announcing the award weeks ago that it was made as the 'taboo against the use of nuclear weapons is under pressure.' The committee noted that rather than embrace disarmament, nuclear powers are upgrading their arsenals, while other countries appear to be preparing to acquire nuclear weapons. It also noted that threats are being made to use the weapons in ongoing warfare, an apparent reference to Russia's threats amid its war in Ukraine. The Japanese group's elderly members are calling for the abolishment of nuclear weapons, a message also directed at the United States. Tanaka noted that 'we are old now' but still carry a 'heavy sense of responsibility' as witnesses to remind the world of the destructiveness of nuclear weapons. 'Nuclear weapons and humanity cannot coexist,' he said. Back in Japan, Empress Masako on Monday described the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Nihon Hidankyo as a key event of this year that impressed upon her the importance of global peace efforts. In a statement, she said she 'felt anew the importance for the people of the world to strive for mutual understanding and work together in order to build a peaceful world.' ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.	https://apnews.com/article/nobel-peace-prize-nihon-hidankyo-terumi-tanaka-5920653f1f577c591ea3dc644e92b3bb	2024-12-09T05:28:37-08:00	
Zelenskyy open to Western troops providing security for end to war in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that he's open to the potential deployment of Western troops in Ukraine to guarantee the country’s security as part of a broad effort to end the almost three-year war with Russia. The deployment would be a step toward Ukraine joining NATO, Zelenskyy said in a post on his Telegram channel. 'But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO,' Zelenskyy said. His proposals tread a delicate diplomatic path amid international efforts to find a way of ending Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II at a time when Russia has gained an upper hand in the fighting. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is seeking to bring about a ceasefire and met with Zelenskyy in Paris on Saturday. But Zelenskyy said Monday that he would approach outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden about Ukraine’s possible NATO membership because he's still in office, while Trump doesn't yet have 'legal rights' to decide on the matter. The possibilities of Ukraine joining the 32-nation military alliance and of Western troops being stationed on its soil have been deeply divisive and contentious issues since Russia’s full-scale invasion began on Feb. 24, 2022. At their summit in Washington in July, NATO declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership, but stopped short of inviting the country in. The United States and Germany have balked at Ukraine joining NATO while at war with Russia. One obstacle has been the view that Ukraine’s borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the alliance’s pact of mutual defense would come into effect. Russia’s invading army occupies about one-fifth of Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron floated the idea of Western troops on the ground in Ukraine last February. But it raised the same fears of escalation that have led Western leaders to place limits on weapons supplies and permissions for their use. European military heavyweights Germany and Poland immediately said they wouldn't send troops to Ukraine. Macron declined to provide details about which nations were considering sending troops, saying he preferred to maintain some 'strategic ambiguity Meanwhile, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s challenger in the upcoming German election, Friedrich Merz, said that there’s a 'basic consensus' in Germany on continuing to provide military aid to Ukraine. But during a visit to Kyiv, he also highlighted differences with Scholz, who has refused to send Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine as he insists that everything must be done to prevent a wider war between the West and Russia. Merz has been open to providing them and allowing Ukraine to hit military targets inside Russia. As he met Zelenskyy, Merz noted that France, the U.K. and the U.S. have a different position from the current German government. 'Our position is clear, as is that of my parliamentary group: we want to put your army in a position to reach military bases in Russia – not the civilian population, not the infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being fought,' he said. 'With this range restriction, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand behind its back, and that is not our position,' he added. Merz’s center-right Union bloc leads German opinion polls. The election is expected on Feb. 23. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-troops-nato-9bf883670879e2a398fe1a7ebfb71ddb	2024-12-09T04:47:09-08:00	
Indigenous Mayans want their sacred cenotes to have personhood status	HOMUN, Mexico (AP) — A huge poplar tree stands proud in Maribel Ek's courtyard, adorned with a sign that reads: 'Florece desde adentro' ('It blooms from within'). Deep underground, the tree's long roots search for the water that makes this land special: a sinkhole lake, known as a cenote. Cenotes provide an important water source to Ek's community of Homun, in the Mexican state of Yucatan, and a livelihood for locals who lead tourists from around the world into the caverns to bathe in their crystalline waters. But more than that, cenotes are sacred to Indigenous Mayans like her. As she descends into the cavern, Ek shines a light on a stone covered in flowers, pots, and candles —the remains of an offering she made to thank the cenote for everything it has given her. She refers to the sacred space as her 'neighbor,' one that needs protection. That belief is the basis of a lawsuit that seeks personhood status for the Ring of Cenotes, made up of hundreds of subterranean lakes that surround the northwest of the Yucatan peninsula in a semicircle, and provide the main source of freshwater in the region. The lawsuit, from the Indigenous Mayan organization Kana’an Ts’onot, or Guardians of the Cenotes, seeks to protect the area from further contamination by industries that have moved there to take advantage of the plentiful water. The group, as designated guardians, would be able to fight on behalf of the Ring of Cenotes in court. If they win, this would become the first ecosystem in Mexico to have its own rights, following in the wake of other cases worldwide, such as the Whanganui River in New Zealand or the Komi Memem River in the Brazilian Amazon. Ek, a member of the Guardians group, speaks of the cenote and its waters as a person, as she explains the reasons behind their fight. 'Because you have to be the voice, that she doesn’t have,' she said. 'Because you have to be the hands, that she doesn’t have.' Polluting the waters The threats to cenotes have been multiplying in recent years. In addition to uncontrolled urban development and the lack of drainage in cities, new dangers include the increase in breweries and massive soybean fields and the construction of the Maya Train, which has embedded thousands of steel pillars in this underground paradise. But what most worries the Guardians of the Cenotes are the pig farms. According to Mexico’s Ministry of the Environment, 507 pig farms are operating near the Ring of Cenotes, 90% of which don’t have environmental impact studies and more than 60% that don’t have a wastewater discharge permit. That means there is no control over what happens to the thousands of liters of water filled with pig excrement and urine generated at the facilities. In many cases, the pollutant-filled water seeps into the aquifer. The area is particularly vulnerable because the soil is karstic, made up of very thin and porous limestone full of conduits and cavities that allow everything that is dumped on the surface to filter underground, explains biologist Yameli Aguilar, master in environmental engineering from the Autonomous University of Yucatan. A comprehensive report conducted last year by the Ministry of the Environment analyzed the water quality of 20 cenotes near pig farms and found that all of them exceeded the limits for fecal coliform (E. coli), set by Mexican authorities to protect aquatic life. In addition, in 26 of the 51 municipalities in Yucatan where pig farms operate, they found 'critical conditions for the water sustainability of the aquifer' due to high amounts of nitrogen from pig excrement and urine. The state designates the land as a natural protected area, and it is considered a wetland of international importance by the Ramsar Convention, an organization formed around a global treaty to protect wetlands. Yet the government fails to prevent the 'serious contamination' and the cenotes are suffering, said lawyer Lourdes Medina, who represents the Guardians in the process. Ek and other cenotes’ owners created the Guardians of the Cenotes group to lead the fight against a 49,000 pig farm that was installed on the outskirts of Homun in 2017. They organized dozens of protests, sit-ins, public consultations and legal actions, but nothing seemed to have any effect. A year later, a lawsuit filed by six children from Homun demanding their right to water and a healthy environment succeeded in getting a judge to order the farm closed. It remains closed nowadays, but the legal battle continues. In 2022 they filed the personhood lawsuit that would not only protect Homun, but also the other 52 communities located within the Ring of Cenotes. And it's already bearing fruit: a judge of the state of Yucatan ordered the authorities not to grant permits to any project that could impact the area until the lawsuit is resolved. That could happen at the beginning of next year. Without protections, the group fears that their sacred cenotes will be contaminated and lose the pristine waters they depend on. What do the pig farmers say? Pig farms and other large industries are drawn to the area because of the availability of water. The farms use large quantities of water (about 20 liters per kilo of meat produced) to cool the animals and clean their waste. The industry says they are not to blame for the contamination. Carlos Ramayo Navarrete, director of the Pig Farmers Association in Merida, which represents the largest pig companies in Yucatan, said the problem is the lack of drainage in cities and the small-scale and 'backyard' pig operations, because they are not as regulated by the authorities as are the bigger farms he represents. He said around half the water the farms use is then reused. In addition, he said that all of the farms have treatment plants to reduce the load of pollutants in their wastewater, which is then used as fertilizer to irrigate fields. 'An industry that does everything within its reach and more can't be demonized,' he said. However, both the Ministry of the Environment and Aguilar have said that the measures taken by the industry are still not enough to prevent contamination of the aquifer. 'As so much (water) is used, to date there is no treatment plant that can lower the pollution load of all that wastewater,' Aguilar said. What will the future bring? As the lawsuits wend their way through the courts, tension between mega-farms and the local population has increased. In 2023, the residents of Sitilpech, about 50 kilometers from Homun, took to the streets to protest against the 48,000 pig farm located on the outskirts of their village. The demonstrations were repressed by the police and resulted in the arrest of several villagers. When a group of AP reporters approached the farm earlier this year, owned by pig giant Kekén, they saw a security guard with a machete in his hand at the entrance. The Sitilpech house closest to the farm is small and painted green, with a porch overlooking the road and a banner written in capital letters demanding that the pig farm leave. In the backyard, Marcela Chi Eb has just put in a washing machine and is hanging clothes on ropes supported by two lemon trees. Their leaves are dry and brownish; she said they got that way when the farm started operating. At night she is awakened by the farm's stench and, although the heat is unbearable, she closes the windows to keep out the smell that permeates her nose and clothes. While one of her daughters rests in a hammock, Chi Eb talks about what worries her most: that in the future neither she nor her children will be able to use the water that comes from the faucet in her house. Back in Homun, Maribel Ek reaches the end of the cavern and, without a second thought, dives into the turquoise waters of the cenote. As a child she came down here every day to collect water because the public supply didn’t reach her house. Since then she learned this wasn't just 'a dark hole with bats,' but 'a blessing, a dark hole that becomes a friend,' she says. 'That's why we demand rights for our cenotes.' ___ Follow Teresa de Miguel on X at @tdemigueles ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Head of UN human rights promises advice to FIFA and Saudi Arabia over 2034 World Cup issues	GENEVA (AP) — Two days before FIFA confirms Saudi Arabia as the 2034 World Cup host, the United Nations’ top human rights official pledged Monday to try to ensure migrant labor standards are 'properly respected' around the tournament. Saudi Arabia is the only candidate and sure to win Wednesday when FIFA will ask an online meeting of its 211 member federations to award the 2034 hosting rights by acclaim without an itemized vote. The oil-rich kingdom’s World Cup plan needs to build eight of the 15 promised stadiums from scratch, plus add 175,000 hotel rooms. It will rely heavily on migrant workers, often from South Asia, within a labor law framework that activist groups say does not protect them. On Monday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, said his organization in Geneva was not directly engaged by FIFA on World Cup issues. 'What we are involved in though is to make sure that indeed, in each and every major sporting event, human rights are part and parcel of the way that sports events are not only conceived but also conducted,' Türk said at a news conference on the eve of the UN’s annual Human Rights Day. Critics of FIFA say a Saudi-hosted World Cup risks repeating rights abuses seen during a decade of similar preparations for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Allegations of widespread labor abuses in Saudi Arabia are already part of an investigation by the UN-backed International Labor Organization (ILO) after a formal complaint by trade unions. Two United States senators have cited human rights in urging FIFA to find a different host for its marquee men’s event that earns billions of dollars in profit for the soccer body. 'Whatever the decision is, to whoever is going to organize it, we will provide precisely that type of advice to the organizers,' Türk, an Austrian lawyer, said. 'That will include also, of course, the need to make sure that migrant labor standards are properly respected and all the various other human rights dimensions of major sporting events.' FIFA has been criticized for not using its leverage ahead of the World Cup decision with Saudi Arabia, despite its president Gianni Infantino building close ties to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi officials made some promises in a formal bid document to engage with the ILO and domestic agencies but not international groups like unions and rights groups that have limited or no access to work in the country. Soccer’s world body praised the Saudi bid in a mandatory in-house evaluation published Nov. 30 and noted the 48-team, 104-game tournament offers 'significant opportunities for positive human rights impact.' FIFA also acknowledged that Saudi Arabia must invest 'significant effort and time' to comply with international standards, which were widely criticized this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council. In their letter to Infantino in October, U.S. senators Ron Wyden and Dick Durbin — Democrats representing Oregon and Illinois, respectively — urged finding a 2034 host 'with a record of upholding human rights.' 'The kingdom continues to torture dissidents, engage in extrajudicial killings, discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community, oppress women and religious minorities, exploit and abuse foreign workers, and restrict almost all political rights and civil liberties,' the letter said. The FIFA decision to confirm Saudi Arabia on Wednesday will be combined with awarding the 2030 World Cup to Spain, Portugal and Morocco. That project gives one game each to Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which was the original World Cup host in 1930. By teaming up Europe, South America and Africa for 2030 — four years after North American neighbors the United States, Canada and Mexico are due to co-host in 2026 — FIFA was able in October last year to open an unexpected and fast-track 2034 contest limited to bidders from Asia or Oceania. That all-but ensured a Saudi win. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/un-human-rights-2034-world-cup-fifa-saudi-arabia-325e17597c7b10fa49034fa1763e6862	2024-12-09T03:01:29-08:00	
Taiwan says China has sent naval ships into nearby waters ahead of anticipated drills	BEIJING (AP) — China's military appears to be preparing for widely anticipated drills in response to a recent visit by Taiwan's president to Hawaii and Guam. Taiwan's defense ministry said Monday that it detected Chinese naval and coast guard ships entering the Taiwan Strait and the western Pacific and that China had restricted airspace along its southeast coast through Wednesday. There was no immediate confirmation from the Chinese side. It comes as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he would not commit to defending Taiwan if China were to invade during his presidency. China says Taiwan is part of its territory and opposes American support and military sales to the self-governing island. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te made stops in Hawaii and Guam during a weeklong tour of the Pacific that ended Friday. China maintains that Taiwan is a province that should not have its own president or foreign relations. Taiwan's defense ministry said it has set up an emergency response center and launched combat readiness exercises in response to Chinese activity in the Taiwan Strait. It did not say what those exercises entailed. 'It must be pointed out that there is no such thing as a defense ministry in Taiwan,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said when asked about the Taiwanese statement. 'Taiwan is part of China, and the Taiwan issue is China’s internal affairs. China will firmly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.' China, which views Lai as a separatist, held major military exercises around Taiwan following his inauguration in May and his national day speech in October. It also held a major drill after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022. The Taiwan defense ministry statement said China had restricted air space in seven zones off Fujian province, which faces Taiwan, and off Zhejiang province, which stretches north from Fujian to Shanghai. Trump was asked during a televised interview if he would commit to defending Taiwan. 'I never say, because I have to negotiate things, right?' he told NBC's 'Meet the Press.' He said he had spoken in recent days with Chinese leader Xi Jinping but the two did not discuss the Taiwan issue. 'We talked about other things,' he said. 'But I have a very good relationship, and I hope he doesn’t do it.'	https://apnews.com/article/china-taiwan-tensions-military-drills-2ab811378272b53e270e3848ecefa893	2024-12-08T23:09:19-08:00	
Syrian prime minister says government is still functioning but foreign and domestic challenges loom	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syria's prime minister said Monday that most cabinet ministers are still working from offices in Damascus after rebels entered the capital over the weekend and overthrew President Bashar Assad. Streams of refugees crossed in from neighboring countries, hoping for a more peaceful future. But there were already signs of the difficulties ahead for the rebel alliance now in control of much of the country, which is led by a former senior al-Qaida militant who severed ties with the extremist group years ago and has promised representative government and religious tolerance. The rebel command said Monday they would not tell women how to dress. Israel said it is carrying out airstrikes on suspected chemical weapons sites and long-range rockets to keep them from falling into the hands of extremists. Israel has also seized a buffer zone inside Syria after Syrian troops withdrew. In northern Syria, Turkey said allied opposition forces seized the town of Manbij from Kurdish-led forces backed by the United States, a reminder that even after Assad's departure to Russia the country remains split among armed groups that have fought in the past. The Kremlin said Russia has granted political asylum to Assad, a decision made by President Vladimir Putin. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on Assad’s specific whereabouts and said Putin was not planning to meet with him. Damascus was quiet on Monday, with life slowly returning to normal while most shops and public institutions were closed. In public squares, some people were still celebrating. Civilian traffic resumed but there was no public transport. Long lines formed in front of bakeries and other food stores. There was little sign of any security presence, and Associated Press reporters saw a few SUVs on the side of a main boulevard that appeared to have been broken into. In some areas, small groups of armed men were stationed in the streets. A video circulating online showed a man in military fatigues holding a rifle attempting to reassure residents of the Mezzeh neighborhood in Damascus that they would not be harmed. 'We have nothing against you, neither Alawite, nor Christian, nor Shiite, nor Druze, but everyone must behave well, and no one should try to attack us,' the fighter said. Prime minister says the government is still operational Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali, who remained in his post after Assad and most of his top officials vanished over the weekend, has sought to project normalcy. 'We are working so that the transitional period is quick and smooth,' he told Sky News Arabia TV on Monday, saying the security situation had already improved from the day before. He said the government is coordinating with the insurgents, and that he is ready to meet rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who made a triumphal appearance at a famed Damascus mosque on Sunday. Syrians who only days ago were working at all levels of the bureaucracy in Assad’s government were adjusting to the new reality. At the court of Justice in Damascus, which was stormed by the rebels to free detainees, Judge Khitam Haddad, an aide to the justice minister in the outgoing government, said Sunday that judges were ready to resume work quickly. 'We want to give everyone their rights,' Haddad said outside the courthouse. 'We want to build a new Syria and to keep the work, but with new methods.' The rebels, meanwhile, said they would guarantee personal freedoms and would not impose Islamic dress on women. 'It is strictly forbidden to interfere with women’s dress or impose any request related to their clothing or appearance, including requests for modesty,' the General Command said in a statement on social media. Separately, a Syrian opposition war monitor said a top aide to Assad's brother, Maher, was found dead in his office near Damascus. A video that circulated on social media purportedly showed Maj. Gen. Ali Mahmoud covered with blood and with his clothes burned. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was not clear if he was killed or died by suicide. Maher Assad led the army's 4th Armored Division, which played a major role in the civil war that erupted in 2011, after a popular uprising against Assad led to a violent crackdown on dissent and the rise of an insurgency. Israel confirms it has struck suspected chemical weapons, rockets Israelis welcomed the fall of Assad, who was a key ally of Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, while expressing concern over what comes next. Israel says its forces temporarily seized a buffer zone inside Syria dating back to a 1974 agreement after Syrian troops withdrew in the chaos. 'The only interest we have is the security of Israel and its citizens,' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters on Monday. 'That’s why we attacked strategic weapons systems, like, for example, remaining chemical weapons, or long-range missiles and rockets, in order that they will not fall in the hands of extremists.' Saar did not provide details about when or where the strikes took place. An AP journalist in Damascus reported airstrikes in the area of the Mezzeh military airport, southwest of the capital, on Sunday. The airport has previously been targeted in Israeli airstrikes. Strikes were also heard in the capital on Monday. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria in recent years, targeting what it says are military sites related to Iran and Hezbollah. Israeli officials rarely comment on individual strikes. Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons stockpile in 2013, after the government was accused of launching an attack near Damascus that killed hundreds of people. But it is widely believed to have kept some of the weapons and was accused of using them again in subsequent years. Turkey says its allies have taken northern town Officials in Turkey, which is the main supporter of the Syrian opposition to Assad, say its allies have taken full control of the northern Syrian city of Manbij from a U.S.-supported and Kurdish-led force known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. The SDF said a Turkish drone struck in the village of al-Mistriha in eastern Syria, killing 12 civilians, including six children. Turkey views the SDF, which is primarily composed of a Syrian Kurdish militia, as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has waged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey. The SDF has also been a key ally of the United States in the war against the Islamic State group. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Monday expressed hope for a new era in Syria in which ethnic and religious groups can live peacefully under an inclusive government. But he warned against allowing Islamic State or Kurdish fighters to take advantage of the situation, saying Turkey will prevent Syria from turning into a 'haven for terrorism.' ___ Mroue reported from Beirut and Goldenberg from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Middle East latest: Israeli strikes hit Gaza and also target suspected weapons sites in Syria	Israeli strikes killed at least six people in the central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical officials said Monday, while also hitting suspected chemical and long-range weapons sites in Syria to keep them from rebels who seized Damascus. The U.N. Security Council plans to hold emergency closed consultations on Syria later Monday at the request of Russia, which on Monday said it granted asylum to its longtime ally Syrian leader Bashar Assad. Russian President Vladimir Putin personally made the decision to offer asylum to Assad, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov wouldn’t comment on Assad’s specific whereabouts and said that Putin wasn’t planning to meet with him. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in the Gaza since the start of the war, according to local health authorities. They say most of the dead are women and children but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250, including older adults and children. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here's the Latest: Syrian insurgents say they won't interfere with women's dressing or personal freedoms DAMASCUS, Syria — Syrian insurgents who toppled President Bashar Assad said they won't impose any religious dress code on women and vowed to guarantee personal freedom for everyone. In a statement posted on social media, the insurgents' General Command said 'it is strictly forbidden to interfere with women’s dress or impose any request related to their clothing or appearance, including requests for modesty.' The command said it affirms that personal freedom is guaranteed to everyone, and that respect for the rights of individuals is the basis for building a civilized nation. In areas that were controlled by Syrian opposition groups since the civil war erupted in 2011, the vast majority of women dressed modestly, only revealing their faces and hands. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the militant leader whose forces entered Damascus over the weekend, has renounced longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicted himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. T housands of Syrian soldiers cross into Iraq, an official says BAGHDAD — More than 4,000 Syrian army soldiers have crossed into Iraq since rebel forces seized Damascus and overthrew the government of Bashar Assad, a militia official in western Iraq said Monday. The official with the Anbar Tribal Mobilization Forces said that the soldiers had turned over their weapons, ammunition and armored vehicles and would be housed in a camp. He did not say where the camp was located. Another security official said that the governor of the Syrian province of Hasakeh had come to the border late Sunday night with a convoy of Syrian army soldiers who wanted to cross into Iraq, and they were allowed in via the Qaim crossing. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The Iraqi government has close ties with Iran and used to be one of Assad's primary backers but Baghdad has taken a neutral position on the advance of the insurgents and Assad’s downfall. — By Qassim Abdul-Zahra UN human rights chief says Assad and other officials should face justice GENEVA — The U.N. human rights chief said Monday that former President Bashar Assad and other top Syrian officials behind possible war crimes 'should be brought to justice.' Volker Türk also said any transition process in Syria should not be separated from the need for accountability for alleged war crimes that took place in its civil war that began in 2011, leaving hundreds of thousands dead and millions fleeing their homes. Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, also noted that Syria has not ratified the International Criminal Court statute, but the court in The Hague could have jurisdiction if the 'new Syria' decides to ratify it -- an allusion to whoever the new leadership of Syria becomes. Turk said there were 'serious grounds to believe' that Assad and others in serious leadership positions in his government may have committed atrocity crimes, 'and as a result, yes, they should be brought to justice.' Russia grants political asylum to Assad, Kremlin says MOSCOW — The Kremlin said Monday that Russia has granted political asylum to former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Russian President Vladimir Putin has personally made the decision to offer asylum to Assad, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 'Such decisions certainly can’t be made without the head of state,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. 'It was his decision.' Peskov wouldn’t comment on Assad’s specific whereabouts. He said that Putin wasn’t planning to meet with Assad. The Kremlin spokesman said that Moscow has been doing everything needed to ensure the security of its military bases in Syria. He said the future of the Russian bases will be a subject for discussion with the new authorities. 'For now, we are witnessing a period of transformation and extreme instability, so it will obviously take time and require a serious conversation with those who will have power,' he said. 'The developments have surprised the world, and we weren’t an exclusion,' Peskov said when asked whether the Kremlin was surprised by Assad’s quick demise. Turkish foreign minister says Ankara hopes for ‘an inclusive government’ in Syria ANKARA, Turkey — Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday that Ankara hopes the fall of the Syrian government will usher in a new era where different ethnic and religious groups can live peacefully under an inclusive new government. Fidan also said his country hopes that a 'new Syria' would maintain good relations with its neighbors and bring stability to the volatile region. 'The developments in Syria yesterday have given us a glimmer of hope,' Fidan said in a speech to Turkish ambassadors. 'We expect international actors, especially the United Nations, to reach out to the Syrian people and support the formation of an inclusive government.' The minister said Turkey would continue to support Syria’s territorial and political unity and work toward the country’s 'prosperity, security and stability.' But Fidan said it was important that the Islamic State group and Kurdish militants do not take advantage of the situation, adding that Turkey 'would work with determination' to prevent Syria from turning into a 'haven for terrorism.' 'Turkey, which has reached out to its Syrian brothers during difficult times, will also be by their side, as the new page opens in Damascus,' Fidan said. 'We believe that the Syrian people will also make good use of this golden opportunity.' Israel says a drone that appears to have originated in Yemen hit a city in central Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said Monday that a drone that appeared to have originated in Yemen slammed into a city in central Israel. Video posted by Israeli news sites showed a large burst of smoke erupting from a high-rise apartment building. The military said sirens were not sounded to warn of the incoming drone. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Iran-backed militants in Yemen have been attacking Israel since Hamas’ assault on southern Israel in October 2023. Their drones have at times evaded Israel’s sophisticated aerial defense system. Turkey-backed forces take full control of Syrian city from U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led force ANKARA, Turkey — The Turkish-backed forces known as the Syrian National Army launched an offensive against the Syrian Democratic Forces in the northern Syrian city of Manbij on Dec. 6, days after expelling SDF fighters from the city of Tal Rifaat. Turkish security officials said Monday that 'control of Manbij has been secured,' without providing further details. The officials provided the information on condition of anonymity, in line with Turkish regulations. Turkey views the SDF, which is primarily composed of a Syrian Kurdish militia group, as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, and a terrorist organization. The force, however, has been a key partner of the United States in the fight against the Islamic State group. Separately, the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement on Monday that a Turkish drone strike in the village of al-Mistriha north of Raqqa in eastern Syria killed 12 civilians, including six children. Top aide to Assad's brother found dead, war monitor says BEIRUT — A Syrian opposition war monitor says a top aide to the brother of Syria’s ousted president was found dead in his office near the capital, Damascus. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Maj. Gen. Ali Mahmoud, who was in charge of Maher Assad’s office, had led a 2018 military campaign in southern Syria. A video that circulated on social media allegedly showed Mahmoud covered in blood while sitting on a chair. His clothes appear to have been set on fire. It was not clear if he was killed by Maher Assad or he committed suicide, the observatory’s chief Rami Abdurrahman said. Maher Assad was in charge of the army’s 4th Armored Division which played a major role in Syria’s conflict since it began in March 2011. Israel says it has struck suspected chemical weapons sites and long-range rockets in Syria JERUSALEM — Israel’s foreign minister says the strikes were to prevent them from falling into the hands of hostile actors. Gideon Saar said Monday that 'the only interest we have is the security of Israel and its citizens.' 'That’s why we attacked strategic weapons systems, like, for example, remaining chemical weapons, or long-range missiles and rockets so that they will not fall in the hands of extremists.' Syrian prime min ister says Cabinet working to ensure smooth transition of power DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s prime minister says most Cabinet ministers who are in Damascus are performing their duties from their offices to promote security and that food and medicine are available to the public. 'We are working so that the transitional period is quick and smooth,' Mohammed Ghazi Jalali told Sky News Arabia TV station on Monday. The government is working with insurgents, Jalali said, adding that he is ready to meet their leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who heads the jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Israeli strikes kill 6 in central Gaza, Palestinian officials say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes in the central Gaza Strip overnight killed at least six people, including a woman, Palestinian medical officials said Monday. Among the dead were Raed Ghabaien, who was released from Israeli detention in 2014, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the casualties were taken. He was killed along with his wife when an Israeli strike hit their tent in the central town of Zuweida, the hospital records showed. Two other people were killed in a strike that hit their house late Sunday in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp. Another two were killed in a strike in the Wadi Gaza area early Monday. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital’s morgue. Mourners held funeral services Monday morning for the six dead and nine others who were killed in a strike the previous day in the urban refugee camp of Bureij. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in the Gaza since the start of the war, according to local health authorities. They say most of the dead are women and children but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel says it only strikes militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in residential areas. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250, including older adults and children. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. US Central Command forces launch airstrikes in central Syria TAMPA, Fla. – U.S. Central Command says its forces launched dozens of airstrikes targeting Islamic State group camps and operatives in central Syria. The strikes on Sunday were intended to 'disrupt, degrade, and defeat ISIS, in order to prevent the terrorist group from conducting external operations and to ensure that ISIS does not seek to take advantage of the current situation to reconstitute in central Syria,' it said in a statement. The airstrikes hit over 75 targets using B-52s, F-15s and A-10s, it said, noting that damage assessments were underway and there were no indications of civilian casualties. Japanese official says Tokyo is ‘gravely worried’ about situation in Middle East TOKYO — Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi says Tokyo is watching recent development in Syria 'with serious interest,' while hoping for an improvement in human rights conditions for the Syrian people. 'Japan is gravely worried about large number of deaths among citizens and strongly concerned about further worsening of the humanitarian conditions,' Hayashi said Monday. He added that Japan is 'hopeful' that the latest developments could lead to an improvement in the situation. New Zealand foreign minister calls for ‘peaceful transition’ in Syria WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters says his country is closely following developments related to the collapse of former President Bashar Assad’s government in Syria. 'This was a regime that perpetrated significant human rights abuses, including repeated chemical weapons attacks, against its own people for many years,' Peters said in a statement issued on Monday. 'Now we need to see a peaceful transition with civilians protected and UN Security Council resolutions upheld. This is critical for moving towards a sustainable and comprehensive political solution.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-9-december-2024-0a5c8edb3a7dc438f8407f44a0fd7154	2024-12-08T22:40:02-08:00	
Netanyahu is set to take the witness stand for the first time in his corruption trial in Israel	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to take to the witness stand Tuesday for the first time in his trial on corruption allegations, a pivotal point in the drawn-out proceedings that comes as the leader wages war in Gaza and faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes charges. At home, Netanyahu is on trial for accusations of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate affairs. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing, but his appearance on the witness stand will be a low point in his decades-long political career, standing in contrast to the image of a sophisticated, respected leader he has tried to cultivate. The trial will take up a chunk of Netanyahu's time at a crucial point for Israel. While he makes his case for weeks from the stand, he will still be tasked with managing the war in Gaza, maintaining a fragile ceasefire with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and keeping tabs on threats from the wider Middle East, including Iran. It will be the first time an Israeli prime minister has taken the stand as a criminal defendant, and Netanyahu has repeatedly sought to delay the proceedings, citing the ongoing Gaza war and security concerns. The judges ordered the trial to resume Tuesday, moving the proceedings to an underground chamber in a Tel Aviv court as a security precaution. Netanyahu's appearance in the courtroom will also draw attention to other legal issues in the Israeli leader's orbit. Close advisers in his office are embroiled in a separate series of scandals surrounding leaked classified information and doctored documents. While Netanyahu is not suspected of direct involvement in those, they could weaken his public image. Here is a look at the ongoing trial. Where does Netanyahu's trial stand? The trial, which began in 2020, involves three separate cases in which prosecutors say Netanyahu exchanged regulatory favors with media titans for favorable press coverage and advanced the personal interests of a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for lavish gifts. Prosecutors have called roughly 140 witnesses to the stand — fewer than the 300 initially expected to testify. Those witnesses have included some of Netanyahu's closest former confidants who turned against him, as well as a former prime minister, former security chiefs and media personalities. Lawyers have submitted thousands of items of evidence -- recordings, police documents, text messages. A new documentary, 'The Bibi Files,' has shined new light on the cases by obtaining footage of Netanyahu being questioned by police, as well as interrogations of his wife and some key witnesses. In a glimpse of what can be expected in the courtroom, Netanyahu appears both combative and anxious at times, accusing police of unfairly picking on him and denigrating other witnesses as liars. The prosecution called to the stand its final witness over the summer, bringing to an end three years of testimony and setting the stage for the defense to lay out its case, with Netanyahu its first witness. Netanyahu’s appearance will give Israelis a chance to see the long-serving Israeli leader answer to the charges before the three-judge panel. What are some notable moments from Netanyahu's trial? The prosecution has sought to portray Netanyahu as media-obsessed, to push its narrative that he would break the law for favorable coverage. Witness accounts have shed light not only on the three cases but also on sensational details about Netanyahu’s character and his family’s reputation for living lavishly on the backs of taxpayers and wealthy supporters. One former aide and a key prosecution witness called him a 'control freak' over his image. Another witness described expensive gifts for Netanyahu and his wife. Arnon Milchan, an Israeli producer of Hollywood blockbuster films such as 'Pretty Woman,' took the stand last year by videoconference, describing how he routinely delivered tens of thousands of dollars of champagne, cigars and other gifts requested by the Israeli leader. One key witness, a former top aide to Netanyahu, stunned prosecutors by backtracking from his earlier claims against the prime minister, opening the door for the defense to erode his credibility as a witness. The trial was jolted by Israeli media reports that police used sophisticated phone-hacking software to spy on this witness. What happens next in Netanyahu's trial? The prosecution formally rested its case in July, and the court recessed for the summer and fall. The defense has repeatedly asked for delays in Netanyahu's testimony, which have mostly been denied. Like other witnesses, Netanyahu will testify three days a week, for hours at a time, and his testimony is expected to last weeks. The defense will seek to depict Netanyahu as a law-abiding leader who was a victim of careless and biased police investigations. Netanyahu's critics have sought to draw a clear line between the cases and the war in Gaza. They say the allegations led Netanyahu to promote a contentious judicial overhaul plan last year that bitterly divided the country and created an image of weakness that encouraged the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that triggered the war. Netanyahu’s critics, including families of hostages held by Hamas, now accuse him of dragging out the conflict — and risking the lives of their loved ones — to avoid an embarrassing investigation and new elections that could force him from power. If he is eventually voted out of power, being away from the prime minister’s seat would make it harder for Netanyahu to rail against the justice system and delegitimize the verdict in the eyes of the public. A verdict isn’t expected until 2026 — at least — and then Netanyahu can choose to appeal to the Supreme Court. Israel's courts are notoriously sluggish, and the case was further delayed last year when courts went on hiatus for two months after war broke out following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Once the defense rests, each side will summarize their cases before judges convene to deliberate over Netanyahu's fate.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-corruption-trial-gaza-war-a84a5a2743d111bb13982be3a4a1ea7b	2024-12-08T21:53:49-08:00	
Landslides and flash floods hit Indonesia’s Java island, leaving 10 dead and 2 missing	SUKABUMI, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian rescuers recovered 10 bodies that were swept away in flash floods or buried under tons of mud and rocks that hit hilly villages on the country’s main island of Java, officials said Monday. Two people are still missing. Torrential rains since last week have caused rivers to burst their banks, tearing through more than 170 villages in Sukabumi district of West Java province, as mud, rocks and trees tumbled down mountainside hamlets, said Lt. Col. Yudi Hariyanto, who heads a rescue command post in Sukabumi. Landslides, flash floods and strong winds devastated 172 villages and forced more than 3,000 people to flee to temporary government shelters, Hariyanto said. Authorities have warned nearly 1,000 people to evacuate as more than 400 houses are threatened by extreme weather. The disasters also destroyed 31 bridges, 81 roads and 539 hectares (1,332 acres) of rice fields, while 1,170 houses were flooded up to the roof. Extreme weather has also damaged more than 3,300 other houses and buildings, the local Disaster Management Agency said. Rescue workers on Monday pulled out 10 bodies in the worst-hit villages of Tegalbuleud, Simpenan and Ciemas, including three children, and rescuers are searching for two villagers who are reportedly still missing, Hariyanto said. Videos circulating on social media showed flash floods caused by heavy downpours in Sukabumi swept away almost everything in their path, including cars, motorbikes, buffaloes and cows. Footage released by West Java's Search and Rescue Agency showed roads that were transformed into murky brown rivers and villages covered by thick mud, rocks and uprooted trees as soldiers, police and rescue workers pulled mud-caked bodies from a devastated hamlet. Seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains. Last month, a landslide and flash floods triggered by heavy downpours hit Indonesia’s North Sumatra province, leaving 20 dead and two missing. A landslide in the region also hit a tourist bus that killed nine people. ___ Karmini reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-west-java-rain-landslide-flash-floods-cd3ea5fb6ae47b53aa87ba307c73a4c3	2024-12-08T21:41:30-08:00	
Russia has used its hypersonic Oreshnik missile for the first time. What are its capabilities?	The silent black-and-white surveillance camera video of the Russian missile attack in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro was brief but chilling: Six huge fireballs pierced the darkness and slammed into the ground at astonishing speed. Within hours of the Nov. 21 attack on the military facility, Russian President Vladimir Putin took the rare step of speaking on national TV to boast about the new, hypersonic missile. He warned the West that its next use could be against Ukraine’s NATO allies who allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Putin said the missile was called the 'Oreshnik' — Russian for 'hazelnut tree.' A look at the weapon, how it fits into Moscow's battle plan and what political message Russia wants to send by using it: What's known about the Oreshnik? A satisfied smile played across Putin's face as he described how the Oreshnik streaks to its target at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, 'like a meteorite,' and claimed it was immune to any missile defense system. Ukrainian military officials said it reached Mach 11. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, head of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, said the Oreshnik could carry nuclear or conventional warheads and has a range to reach any European target. The Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia's RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. The attack marked the first time such a weapon was used in a war. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019. Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate said the missile had six warheads, each carrying six submunitions. Its payload of independently targetable warheads, like a cluster of hazelnuts growing on a tree, could be the inspiration for the missile's name. Video of the attack appeared to show six warheads surrounded by clouds of plasma raining down in a fiery descent. The six submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives. Putin claimed the weapon is so powerful that using several such missiles — even fitted with conventional warheads — could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. It’s capable of destroying underground bunkers 'three, four or more floors down,' he boasted, threatening to use it against the government district in Kyiv. Ukraine’s Security Service showed The Associated Press wreckage of the missile -- charred, mangled wires and an ashen airframe — at Dnipro's Pivdenmash plant that built missiles when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. There were no fatalities in the attack, and authorities haven’t described the damage to the plant. They said the missile was fired from the 4th Missile Test Range of Kapustin Yar in Russia’s Astrakhan region on the Caspian Sea. What other missiles has Russia used? Russia has used an assortment of missiles to pummel Ukraine since the start of its invasion in February 2022, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik. They included subsonic long-range cruise missiles that carry about 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of explosives, enough to inflict a significant damage to Ukrainian power plants and other key infrastructure. The winged, jet-propelled cruise missiles have a range of up to 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles), able to reach all of Ukraine. Russia also used swarms of inexpensive, Iranian-designed drones that carry only about 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of explosives. The slow-flying drones are relatively easy to intercept, but Russia used dozens of them at a time to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses and divert attention from simultaneously launched cruise missiles. For some priority targets, Russia has used faster and harder-hitting missiles, including the ground-launched Iskander short-range ballistic missile with a range of 500 kilometers (310 miles). For particularly important targets, Moscow has used the hypersonic Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile. Its high speed — able to briefly reach Mach 10 — and ability to maneuver in flight helps it evade air defenses, although Ukraine claims to have shot down a few of them. Oreshnik is even more difficult to intercept than Kinzhal. It can inflict significantly heavier damage because of its multiple high-energy warheads. What message is Putin sending with the Oreshnik? Putin described the Oreshnik as a response to the U.S. and U.K. allowing Ukraine to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory, a move he said gave 'elements of a global character' to the conflict. 'We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,' he said. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Putin’s Security Council, said Oreshnik could reach targets in Europe within minutes, inflicting 'catastrophic' damage. 'Bomb shelters will not save you,' he posted on his messaging app channel. Russian state media extolled the Oreshnik, claiming it will take just 11 minutes to reach an air base in Poland and 17 minutes to reach NATO’s headquarters in Brussels. T-shirts have appeared with images of Putin and the Oreshnik, and he was told at a briefing that a couple planned to name their daughter after the missile. Military expert Mathieu Boulègue of Chatham House in Britain said that while the Oreshnik isn’t a game-changer on the battlefield, 'in terms of psychological warfare, it works great' in serving the Kremlin’s goal to scare a Western audience. The Nov. 21 attack came two days after Putin signed a revised version of Russia’s nuclear doctrine, which lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons. The doctrine allows for a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. The use of the Oreshnik was an expression of Moscow’s anger at the use of longer-range Western missiles and a signal to Ukraine and President-elect Donald Trump that Russia was going to pursue its goals, regardless of the support for Kyiv, said James J. Townsend, senior fellow at the Center for New American Security. 'This is a very powerful message being sent,' Townsend said. 'It’s showing Trump how serious Russia looks on what the Biden administration has been doing and how seriously they look on and how angry they are about this type of assistance.' Putin’s warning about potential strikes on NATO assets follows calls by Russian hawks for such attacks to force Ukraine’s allies to back down. Unlike other Russian conventional weapons with a shorter range, Oreshnik offers the capability to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether Oreshnik carries a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target. 'The enemy must understand that we are ready to take the most resolute steps and strike the territory of NATO members with conventional weapons first,' said Sergei Karaganov, a political expert who advises the Kremlin. 'At the same time, we will warn them that if they respond to that attack in an escalatory way, a nuclear strike would come second, and a third wave will target American bases.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-oreshnik-hypersonic-missile-putin-ukraine-war-345588a399158b9eb0b56990b8149bd9	2024-12-08T20:26:56-08:00	
Fishing boat capsizes after colliding with sand barge in South Korea, killing 7	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A fishing boat capsized after colliding with a sand barge in waters off South Korea’s southeastern coast early Monday, leaving seven crew members dead and one missing, according to local coast guard and fire departments. The 29-ton fishing boat, which had eight passengers, three South Koreans and five Indonesian nationals, capsized after colliding with a 456-ton barge in waters near the city of Gyeongju, according to Kim Eul-dong, an official at the Pohang coast guard. Dozens of emergency workers, along with 15 coast guard vessels and six helicopters, were mobilized to search for the missing passenger, who was Indonesian. None of the passengers from the barge were hurt.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-capsized-fishing-boat-gyeongju-199c41bc8863dae87ea85c9c41439f8e	2024-12-08T20:25:11-08:00	
2 men are standing trial on charges they chopped down Britain's scenic Sycamore Gap tree	LONDON (AP) — It was neither Britain’s biggest tree nor its oldest. But the majestic sycamore that stood for 150 years along a stretch of Hadrian’s Wall in northern England was one of the most beloved. Perched symmetrically in a dip between two hills, the Sycamore Gap tree had been the site of first kisses, wedding proposals and even a place where the ashes of loved ones were scattered. When local residents and admirers woke to the news last fall that it had been cut down in the dark of night, they wanted to know why and who could have committed such a senseless act. On Monday, prosecutors are expected to start providing those answers. Two men are scheduled to go on trial in Newcastle Crown Court on charges related to toppling the tree and damaging the ancient wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire. Little has been said about the case, including a possible motive, to protect the integrity of the trial and rights of the accused. Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, have pleaded not guilty to two counts each of criminal damage. Prosecutors said the value of the tree exceeded 620,000 pounds ($790,000) and damage to the wall was assessed at 1,100 pounds ($1,400). 'This is a case that will be instantly recognizable to you, indeed anyone hearing the charges read out,' prosecutor Rebecca Brown said at a court appearance for the two men in May. 'The prosecution say the tree was deliberately felled on Sept. 28 last year and the resultant fall damaged Hadrian’s Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,' Brown said. 'The prosecution say these defendants are responsible as part of a joint enterprise.' Word of the tree's demise spread swiftly and the impact reverberated through the wild and scenic Northumberland region. 'I still can’t come to terms with the fact that the tree’s not there,' said Catherine Cape, who lives nearby. 'I am still really angry about it. I can’t understand why you would want to destroy something so beautiful.' The tree became famous after being featured in Kevin Costner’s 1991 film 'Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves,' and was a big draw for tourism. Before the tree was cut down, about 80% of the inquiries at Northumberland National Park 's main visitors center were from people planning to walk to the tree, the park's chief executive, Tony Gates, said after the tree was cut down. The sycamore’s broad canopy framed between two hills had long been a popular draw for landscape photographers and a scenic stop for walkers on the path along the wall. Cape walked to the tree on her first and second dates with her future husband. They later watched their daughter take her first steps there. And after her mother and sister both died in 2020, she met her brother-in-law and nephews there when they couldn’t gather indoors during the COVID-19 lockdown. The tree was a huge draw for the guests that stayed at a small cabin Cape owns. Bookings dropped off after the tree was downed but they have largely rebounded. She used to drive past the tree two or three days a week but now takes the highway instead because she doesn't like to see the empty space on the hillside where it stood. The sycamore was removed with a crane and taken to a National Trust property for storage. A section of the trunk went on display at the park visitor center this fall and seeds from the tree that were used to grow saplings are being donated for planting around the U.K. In time, the tree itself may grow back. More than two dozens shoots were discovered sprouting from the stump. 'The tree does still live on, but just not in the form that it was,' Cape said. 'We’ll never see it in our lifetime grow into a tree, or what it was before.'	https://apnews.com/article/sycamore-gap-tree-northumberland-trial-3c65e5416be23dbf2afebefed362345e	2024-12-08T20:12:24-08:00	
Syrian rebels free prisoners from Assad's notorious dungeons who celebrate in Damascus streets	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Bashar Barhoum woke in his dungeon prison cell in Damascus at dawn Sunday, thinking it would be the last day of his life. The 63-year-old writer was supposed to have been executed after being imprisoned for seven months. But he soon realized the men at the door weren't from former Syrian President Bashar Assad ’s notorious security forces, ready to take him to his death. Instead, they were rebels coming to set him free. As the insurgents swept across Syria in just 10 days to bring an end to the Assad family’s 50-year rule, they broke into prisons and security facilities to free political prisoners and many of the tens of thousands of people who disappeared since the conflict began back in 2011. Barhoum was one of those freed who were celebrating in Damascus. 'I haven’t seen the sun until today,' Barhoum told The Associated Press after walking in disbelief through the streets of Damascus. 'Instead of being dead tomorrow, thank God, he gave me a new lease of life.' Barhoum couldn’t find his cellphone and belongings in the prison so set off to find a way to tell his wife and daughters that he’s alive and well. Videos shared widely across social media showed dozens of prisoners running in celebration after the insurgents released them, some barefoot and others wearing little clothing. One of them screams in celebration after he finds out that the government has fallen. Torture, executions and starvation in Syria's prisons Syria's prisons have been infamous for their harsh conditions. Torture is systematic, say human rights groups, whistleblowers, and former detainees. Secret executions have been reported at more than two dozen facilities run by Syrian intelligence, as well as at other sites. In 2013, a Syrian military defector, known as 'Caesar,' smuggled out over 53,000 photographs that human rights groups say showed clear evidence of rampant torture, but also disease and starvation in Syria's prison facilities. Syria’s feared security apparatus and prisons did not only serve to isolate Assad’s opponents, but also to instill fear among his own people said Lina Khatib, Associate Fellow in the Middle East and North Africa program at the London think tank Chatham House. 'Anxiety about being thrown in one of Assad’s notorious prisons created wide mistrust among Syrians,' Khatib said. 'Assad nurtured this culture of fear to maintain control and crush political opposition.' Just north of Damascus in the Saydnaya military prison, known as the 'human slaughterhouse,' women detainees, some with their children, screamed as men broke the locks off their cell doors. Amnesty International and other groups say that dozens of people were secretly executed every week in Saydnaya, estimating that up to 13,000 Syrians were killed between 2011 and 2016. 'Don’t be afraid … Bashar Assad has fallen! Why are you afraid?' said one of the rebels as he tried to rush streams of women out of their jam-packed tiny cells. Tens of thousands of detainees have so far been freed, said Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based pro-opposition war monitor. Over the past 10 days, insurgents freed prisoners in cities including Aleppo, Homs, Hama as well as Damascus. Families seek loved ones who have been missing for years Omar Alshogre, who was detained for three years and survived relentless torture, watched in awe from his home far from Syria as videos showed dozens of detainees fleeing. 'A hundred democracies in the world had done nothing to help them, and now a few military groups came down and broke open prison after prison,' Alshogre, a human rights advocate who now resides in Sweden and the U.S., told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, families of detainees and the disappeared skipped celebrations of the downfall of the Assad dynasty. Instead, they waited outside prisons and security branch centers, hoping their loved ones would be there. They had high expectations for the newcomers who will now run the battered country. 'This happiness will not be completed until I can see my son out of prison and know where he is,' said Bassam Masri. 'I have been searching for him for two hours. He has been detained for 13 years,' since the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011. Rebels struggled to control the chaos as crowds gathered by the Court of Justice in Damascus. Heba, who only gave her first name while speaking to the AP, said she was looking for her brother and brother-in-law who were detained while reporting a stolen car in 2011 and hadn't been seen since. 'They took away so many of us,' said Heba, whose mother’s cousin also disappeared. 'We know nothing about them ... They (the Assad government) burned our hearts.' ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut. Associated Press writers Sarah El-Deeb and Ghaith Alsayed in Damascus contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-prisons-human-rights-detainees-saydnaya-982edfde78e852431d94f3f1a51b26ba	2024-12-08T20:11:22-08:00	
Emilia Pérez' leads Golden Globe nominations with 10, followed by 'The Brutalist' and 'Conclave'	Jacques Audiard’s audacious musical 'Emilia Pérez,' about a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirming surgery to become a woman, led nominations to the 82nd Golden Globes on Monday, scoring 10 nods to lead it over other contenders like the musical smash 'Wicked,' the papal thriller 'Conclave' and the post-war epic 'The Brutalist.' The nominations for Globes, which will be televised by CBS and streamed on Paramount+ on Jan. 5, were announced on Monday morning by Mindy Kaling and Morris Chestnut. The embattled Globes, which are no longer presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are still in comeback mode after years of scandal and organizational upheaval. Working in the Globes favor this year: a especially starry field of nominees. Zendaya, Timothée Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Glen Powell and Selena Gomez all scored nominations. The young Donald Trump drama 'The Apprentice' also landed nominations for its two central performances, by Sebastian Stan as Trump and Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn. The president elect has called 'The Apprentice' a 'politically disgusting hatchet job' made by 'human scum.' How much the recent president election will figure into Hollywood's awards season remains to be seen. In the season's first awards ceremony, the Gotham Awards, Trump went unmentioned but sometimes alluded to. Stan also received a nomination Monday for the dark comedy 'A Different Man.' While 'Oppenheimer' and, to a lesser degree, 'Barbie,' sailed into the Globes nominations as the clear heavyweights of awards season, no such frontrunner has emerged this year. The Globes don’t often align with the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, a much larger group that far more closely reflects the film industry. But they can give movies a major boost, and ripe fodder for their awards marketing. Following 'Emilia Pérez,' Brady Corbet’s 'The Brutalist' landed seven nominations, including best picture, drama, and acting nods for Adrian Brody and Guy Pearce. The soon-to-be-released film, from A24, is uncommonly ambitious, with a runtime of three-and-a-half hours, including an intermission. Close behind it was Edward Berger’s 'Conclave,' starring Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal tasked with leading the conclave to elect a new pope. It landed six nominations, including best picture, drama, and acting nods for Fiennes and Isabella Rossellini. Sean Baker's Palme d'Or-winning 'Anora,' starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn sex worker who marries the son of a Russian Oligarch, was nominated for five awards, including best picture, comedy or musical, and best female actor for Madison and best supporting actor for Yura Borisov. The Golden Globes will be hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser, who scored her own nomination for best stand-up special. CBS, which began airing the Globes last year on a new deal, will hope Glaser manages to do better than last year’s emcee, Jo Koy, whose stint was widely panned. Here’s details from the nominations: Who are this year's Globes nominees? The nominees for best motion picture drama are: 'The Brutalist'; 'A Complete Unknown,'; 'Conclave'; 'Dune: Part Two'; 'Nickel Boys;' 'September 5.' The nominees for best film musical or comedy are: 'Wicked'; 'Anora'; 'Emilia Pérez'; 'Challengers'; 'A Real Pain'; 'The Substance.' The nominees for best male actor in a motion picture musical or comedy are: Jesse Eisenberg, 'A Real Pain'; Hugh Grant, 'Heretic'; Gabriel LaBelle, 'Saturday Night; Jesse Plemons, 'Kinds of Kindness'’ Glen Powell, 'Hitman'; Sebastian Stan, 'A Different Man.' The nominees for best animated film are: 'Flow'; 'Inside Out 2'; 'Memoir of a Snail'; 'Moana 2'; 'Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl'; 'The Wild Robot.' The nominees for cinematic and box office achievement are: 'Alien: Romulus'; Beetlejuice Beetlejuice'; Deadpool &amp; Wolverine'; 'Gladiator II'; 'Inside Out 2'; 'Twisters'; 'Wicked'; 'The Wild Robot.' The nominees for best original score: 'Conclave'; 'The Brutalist'; 'The Wild Robot'; 'Emilia Pérez'; 'Challengers'; 'Dune: Part Two.' How about the TV categories? The nominees for best television drama are: 'Shogun'; 'The Diplomat'; 'Slow Horses'; 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith'; 'The Day of the Jackal'; 'Squid Game.' The nominees for TV series (comedy or musical) are: 'Abbott Elementary'; 'The Bear; 'Hacks'; 'Nobody Wants This'; 'Only Murders in the Building'; 'The Gentlemen.' The nominees for best male actor in a drama series are: Donald Glover, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith'; Jake Gyllenhaal, 'Presumed Innocent'; Gary Oldman, 'Slow Horses'; Eddie Redmayne, 'The Day of the Jackal'; Hiroyuki Sanada, 'Shogun'; Billy Bob Thornton, 'Landman.' The nominees for female actor in a comedy series are: Kristen Bell, 'Nobody wants This'; Quinta Brunson, 'Abbott Elementary'; Ayo Edebiri, 'The Bear'; Selena Gomez, 'Only Murders in the Building'; Kathryn Hahn, 'Agatha All Along'; Jean Smart, 'Hacks.' What’s new this year? Last year, the Globes introduced two new categories that remain this time around: the cinematic and box office achievement award and the best performance in stand-up comedy on television. One tweak this time comes in the lifetime achievement awards. This year, those are going to Ted Danson (for the Carol Burnett Award) and Viola Davis (for the Cecil B. DeMille Award). Those will be handed out in a gala dinner on Friday, Jan. 3, several days before the Globes. What’s the deal with the Golden Globes, anyway? The Globes aren’t ever quite drama-free, but things have settled down for the embattled awards body. Last year’s Globes were the first after the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and their acquisition by Dick Clark Productions and billionaire Todd Boehly’s private equity firm Eldridge Industries. However, earlier this fall, the Ankler reported that former members of the HFPA filed a letter with the California Attorney General’s office questioning 'the validity of the purchase.' ___ For more coverage of the 2025 Golden Globe Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/golden-globe-awards	https://apnews.com/article/golden-globes-nominations-2025-84e022069bd2083252c08918242cf7f9	2024-12-08T20:07:42-08:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mixed as oil prices jump following ouster of Syria's Assad	BANGKOK (AP) — World shares were mixed and oil prices jumped Monday after the weekend overthrow of Syrian leader Bashar Assad, who sought asylum in Moscow after rebels ended the Assad family’s 50 years of iron rule. That added to uncertainty in a region fraught with conflict. U.S. benchmark crude oil jumped 75 cents to $67.95 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard gained 69 cents to $71.81 per barrel. In early European trading, Germany's DAX fell 0.3% to 20,322.32, while the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.3% to 7,448.45. Britain's FTSE 100 edged 0.2% higher. The future for the S&amp;P 500 edged 0.1% lower while that for the Dow was unchanged. Hong Kong shares bounced higher after top Chinese leaders met and agreed on a 'moderately loose' monetary policy, shifting away from a more cautious 'prudent' stance for the first time in 10 years. Chinese shares were mixed, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rebounding from early losses to gain 2.8% to 20,414.09. The Shanghai Composite index fell less than 0.1% to 3,402.53. Investors took heart from the state media’s readout from a meeting of the ruling Communist Party’s Politburo that pledged more support for the sluggish economy. A major planning meeting later this week is expected to set the policy agenda for coming months, possibly bringing fresh stimulus for the world’s No. 2 economy. The Kospi in Seoul slumped 2.8% to 2,360.58. South Korea’s political situation remained tense as local media reported that the police were considering imposing an overseas travel ban on President Yoon Suk Yeol. Yoon’s status was uncertain after he declared martial law last week in the midst of a budget dispute and then reversed that hours later. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index edged 0.2% higher, to 39,160.50 after the government reported that the economy expanded at a 1.2% annual rate in July to September, higher than the initial estimate of 0.9% growth. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 was nearly unchanged at 8,423.00. India's Sensex shed 0.3%, while Taiwan's Taiex gained 0.3%. In Bangkok, the SET declined 0.3%. On Friday, U.S. stocks rose to records after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not strong enough to raise immediate worries about inflation. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.2% to 6,090.27, just enough to log another all-time high, closing a third straight winning week in what looks to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.3% to 44,642.52, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% to set its own record of 19,859.77. The jobs report strengthened traders’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. It showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, but also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. The hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had earlier seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates swiftly to crush inflation. A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan’s survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened. In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 10.6% for one of the S&amp;P 500’s larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stocks were some of the market’s strongest this week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they’re getting from the artificial-intelligence boom. In other dealings early Friday, Bitcoin was sitting near $98,300 after bursting above $103,000 to a record the day before. The euro rose to $1.0583 from $1.0561. The dollar was trading at 150.44 yen early Monday, up from 150.07 yen.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-korea-inflation-syria-2cf5e3044843320565fae24dd99d2ca8	2024-12-08T20:02:22-08:00	
Morocco produces Africa’s first mpox tests as the continent tries to rely less on imports	TAMESNA, Morocco (AP) — After African countries struggled to get testing kits during the COVID-19 pandemic, officials vowed to make the continent less dependent on imported medical supplies. Now, in a first for Africa, a Moroccan company is filling orders for mpox tests as an outbreak continues. Moroccan startup Moldiag began developing mpox tests after the World Health Organization declared the virus a global emergency in August. Africa’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported more than 59,000 mpox cases and 1,164 deaths in 20 countries this year. The WHO has also announced a plan to provide mpox tests, vaccines and treatments to the most vulnerable people in the world’s poorest countries, after facing criticism for moving too slowly on vaccines. It recommends all suspected mpox cases be tested. But in some far-flung areas of the mpox outbreak, tests have to be delivered to distant labs for processing. Most of Congo’s 26 provinces don’t have such facilities. And some areas have no tests. In eastern Congo’s South Kivu province, doctors are still diagnosing patients by taking temperatures and looking for visible symptoms. That makes it difficult to tell how the virus is spreading, health officials say. 'This is a major problem,' said Musole Robert, medical director of the Kavumu Referral Hospital, one of the few treating mpox patients in eastern Congo. 'The main issue remains the laboratory, which is not adequately equipped.' Mpox primarily spreads through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions. A health worker swabs the rash and sends the sample to a lab. Mpox testing is critical because many symptoms resemble diseases like chicken pox or measles. When mpox cases were found in some Western countries like the United States in 2022, some companies began developing rapid test kits that don’t require lab processing. But they shelved those efforts when the virus was largely contained. Then outbreaks emerged again in Africa. Scientists are concerned by the spread of a new version of the disease that might be more easily transmitted among people. Morocco has reported three mpox cases, though most have been in central Africa. At his factory in Morocco, Moldiag founder and chief scientific officer Abdeladim Moumen said the tests they make — sold for $5 each — can help to remedy shortages affordably. The company last month began accepting orders from Burundi, Uganda and Congo and has also sold them to Senegal and Nigeria as well. 'It’s rather easy to send tests from an African nation to another one rather than waiting for tests to come in from China or Europe,' Moumen said. Moldiag was founded out of Morocco’s Foundation for Advanced Science, Innovation and Research, a university-affiliated nonprofit whose research has received funding from the European Commission and Morocco’s government. The startup previously developed similar genetic tests for COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Moldiag won approval to distribute its mpox tests from the Africa CDC in November. But it hasn't submitted paperwork to be considered for expedited approval from the WHO, which during this outbreak has approved three mpox tests and is considering five others. Each is made in North America, Europe or Asia. The Africa CDC’s acting director for laboratory diagnostics and systems, Yenew Tebeje, said the organization created a process to accelerate approval of tests like Moldiag’s because the WHO’s approval process can take months or years and 'be a limiting factor for access to diagnostics.' Historically, international institutions have not always ensured medical supplies like tests are quickly made available for crises in Africa, Tebeje added. Only mpox tests that require laboratory processing have been approved by the WHO and Africa CDC, which has expressed the need for rapid tests that don't need to be sent to labs. Moldiag and other companies are working to develop rapid tests and pursue approval. Moldiag's $5 price for the current tests aligns with recommendations from both the WHO's target product standards and demands of health advocates who have criticized the cost of other tests. The nonprofit Public Citizen last month called on Cepheid — one of the WHO's three approved mpox test manufacturers — to reduce its price from about $20 to $5, citing a Doctors Without Borders analysis showing genetic tests can be produced for less. Africa-based manufacturing fulfills a primary objective that African Union member states agreed on after the COVID-19 pandemic, which revealed global disparities and unequal access to medical supplies, including vaccines, tests and antiviral medications. In 2022, shaken by the pandemic, African leaders called for action to address those disparities plaguing the continent's over 1.4 billion people, who experience the highest incidence of public health emergencies. Moumen said experts were waking up to the fact that it makes more sense for tests to come from regions where outbreaks are taking place so manufacturers can tailor production to address issues close to home. 'They want African tests for Africa,' he said. ___ Alonga reported from Goma, Congo.

Australian synagogue fire declared terrorism in a decision that increases investigation resources	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian law enforcement authorities on Monday declared an arson attack on a synagogue last week a terrorist act in a decision that increases resources available to the investigation. Arson squad detectives have been investigating the blaze that extensively damaged the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne on Friday. But the investigation was taken over on Monday by the Joint Counter-Terrorism Team which involves Victoria state Police and Australian Federal Police as well as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, the nation’s main domestic spy agency. 'The decision ... to transition the Adass Israel Synagogue fire attack to the Victorian Joint Counter-Terrorism Team is a crucial turning point in this investigation,' Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Krissy Barrett told reporters. 'I want to thank Victoria Police investigators for the significant information they have gathered so far, which has helped lead us to believe that this is likely to be a politically motivated attack. This is now a terrorism investigation,' Barrett added. The declaration gave investigators more resources, information and legal powers to pursue the three suspects, police said. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said investigators had made 'significant progress,' but declined to detail that progress. Witnesses reported seeing two masked men spreading a liquid accelerant in the mosque before the fire. Police have not revealed what role the third suspect played. Police have also not revealed if they know the identity of any suspect. The synagogue fire is the first declared terrorist incident in Australia since April when a 16-year-old boy allegedly stabbed a bishop and priest in a Sydney Assyrian church while a service was being streamed online. Some lawmakers had been calling for the arsonists to be charged with terrorism offenses so that they would potentially face longer prison sentences. The blaze is an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and Hamas last year. Cars and buildings have been vandalized and torched around Australia in protests inspired by the war. In a separate initiative, Australian Federal Police announced on Monday the formation of Special Operation Avalite to target antisemiticism around the country. The investigators were brought together in response to arson attacks on the synagogue, Jewish lawmaker Josh Burns' Melbourne office in June and on a car in a Sydney street last month that was related to antisemitic vandalism. 'Special Operation Avalite will be an agile and experienced squad of counter-terrorism investigators who will focus on threats, violence, and hatred towards the Australian Jewish community and parliamentarians,' Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said. Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, who is Jewish, said his government was striving to make the Jewish community 'feel safe.' 'We’ve experienced in Australia, in the last year, the highest level of antisemitism that I’ve experienced in my lifetime. That’s a common reaction from members of the Australian Jewish community,' Dreyfus said. The Victoria government on Friday offered 100,000 Australian dollars ($64,300) to help repair the synagogue and said there would be an increased police presence in the area. The federal government on Sunday offered the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, an umbrella body representing more than 200 Jewish organizations, AU$32.5 million ($20.8 million) to enhance security at community sites including synagogues and schools. ___ This story has corrected the Victoria police official’s surname to Patton not Patterson.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-synagogue-fire-melbourne-terrorism-a9b3940618560648504ce48b02fdcd36	2024-12-08T18:52:22-08:00	
South Korean police considering overseas travel ban on President Yoon over martial law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Police are considering placing an overseas travel ban on South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol as they investigate possible rebellion charges over his brief imposition of martial law last week, reports said Monday. Yoon’s martial law decree last Tuesday, which brought armed special forces troops into Seoul streets, is plunging South Korea into huge political turmoil. On Sunday, he avoided an opposition-led bid to impeach him, with most ruling party lawmakers boycotting a floor vote. But the opposition parties vowed to submit a new impeachment motion against him this week. On Monday, Yonhap news agency cited police as saying that they are considering banning Yoon from leaving the country as they investigate charges of rebellion. Other South Korean media carried similar reports. Repeated calls to the National Police Agency weren’t immediately answered. The main opposition Democratic Party called Yoon’s martial law imposition 'unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or a coup.' It has filed complaints with police against at least nine people, including Yoon and the former defense minister, over the alleged rebellion. While the president mostly has immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. South Korean prosecutors on Sunday detained former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who allegedly recommended Yoon declare martial law. He became the first person detained over the martial law case. The Defense Ministry said it has separately suspended three top military commanders over their alleged involvement in imposing martial law. They were among those facing the opposition-raised rebellion allegations. On Saturday, Yoon issued an apology over the martial law decree, saying he won’t shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country’s political turmoil, 'including matters related to my term in office.' Since taking office in 2022 for a single five-year term, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid scandals involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a 'den of criminals' bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.'	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-a196573506375f39d5645843bcf87828	2024-12-08T17:07:09-08:00	
Mbappé speaks to French TV station for first time about reports of a rape investigation in Sweden	PARIS (AP) — Kylian Mbappé says he reacted with disbelief when he saw media reports from Sweden two months ago that he was the subject of a rape investigation. The Real Madrid star spoke about the case publicly for the first time in an interview that aired Sunday on French TV station Canal Plus. Several Swedish media reported in October that Mbappé was the subject of a rape investigation following a visit to Stockholm during time off from playing for Madrid and France. At the time Mbappé's legal team dismissed those reports as false. 'I was surprised and I still am surprised, by the way. These are things that come into your life like that, you can’t see them coming,' Mbappé told Canal Plus. 'It’s just incomprehension. I don't think it weighed on me in the sense that I have never considered myself involved.' Mbappé added that he 'would go' to Sweden if ever he were summoned but that he has not been contacted by authorities. 'Listen, I haven’t received anything, no summons, nothing,' he told Canal Plus. 'The Swedish government has not said anything, so I’m not concerned (involved).' When the reports emerged in October, Swedish authorities confirmed that they were investigating a suspected rape at a Stockholm hotel but didn't name any suspect.

Georgian journalists allege brutal beatings as protests rage against ending EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Tens of thousands of people joined an 11th straight day of protests in Georgia on Sunday after the governing party suspended negotiations on joining the European Union, while a separate demonstration decried violence against Georgian journalists covering the rallies. Police have been using increasing force in their attempts to curb the demonstrations, which have centered on the parliament building in the capital, Tbilisi. Riot police have used water cannons and tear gas every day to disperse the rallies, beating scores of protesters who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital’s central boulevard. At Saturday night’s demonstration, reporter Maka Chikhladze and her colleague from the independent Pirveli TV channel were targeted by a violent mob, Chikhladze told The Associated Press. Chikladze said her colleague managed to capture footage of men dressed in black who were beating demonstrators before they turned on the pair, violently pushing Chikhladze to the ground. She later told AP that her colleague sustained a head injury and had his camera stolen. Chikhladze charged that Georgia’s government was using bands of thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, an allegation denied by representatives of the Georgian Dream party. On Sunday, several hundred media workers marched down Tbilisi’s central Rustaveli Avenue before putting up posters of colleagues they say had been assaulted while doing their jobs. 'Our colleagues are beaten, injured, some remain in hospital in serious condition,' TV Pirveli anchor Ekaterine Mishveladze told AP. In a separate incident Saturday, AP journalists saw several masked men violently tackle a protester attempting to enter the offices of an opposition party, Ahali. The man, Koba Khabazi, lay slumped on the ground while his attackers repeatedly kicked him. He later showed AP his head injuries. Georgian Dream retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 election, a vote widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president, Salome Zourabichvili, have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia’s help and have boycotted parliament sessions. Opposition protests gained new momentum after the Georgian Dream’s decision last Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. Riot police have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the rallies and beat scores of protesters, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on Rustaveli Avenue. The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials. Speaking Thursday at a ministerial conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken denounced what he described as the brutal 'repression of those calling for their country to stay on the path to closer ties with Europe.' Mamuka Mdinanradze, leader of the Georgian Dream party, condemned mob violence against protesters during a news briefing Sunday, and denied any connection with the government. The office of Georgia’s rights ombudsman on Sunday issued a statement criticizing Georgian police for 'failing to take adequate measures' to ensure safety during the demonstrations. President Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, refused to recognize the official election results and contested them before the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal earlier this week. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. The law requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-protest-opposition-police-violence-russia-tbilisi-6c7bf69d66c468c5833d97a60ba3461b	2024-12-08T11:59:42-08:00	
A passenger tries to divert a domestic flight in Mexico to the United States	MEXICO CITY (AP) — A passenger on a domestic flight in Mexico on Sunday tried to divert an aircraft to the United States by force, Volaris airlines said in a statement on X. The crew managed to detain him and all those aboard the flight are safe, according to the company which is one of the country’s main airlines. The plane was diverted to Guadalajara in central Mexico, where the person was handed over to authorities. Other passengers later continued to their destination of Tijuana on the border with the U.S. Volaris said it has become a plaintiff to ensure that the passenger faces the full weight of the law.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-diverted-plane-flight-867ecc08010c35287f8dd95db5c51e7e	2024-12-08T11:51:38-08:00	
Gaza health officials say latest Israeli airstrikes kill at least 14 including children	DEIR AL BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes in central Gaza killed at least 14 people including children Sunday, Palestinian health officials said, while the bombing of a hospital in northern Gaza wounded a half-dozen patients. Israel’s military continues its latest offensive against Hamas militants in northern Gaza, whose remaining Palestinians have been almost completely cut off from the rest of the territory amid a growing humanitarian crisis. One airstrike flattened a residential building in the urban Bureij refugee camp Sunday afternoon, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the casualties were taken. At least nine people were killed including six children and a woman. An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies at the hospital’s morgue. Earlier on Sunday, another Israeli strike hit a tent in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least five people including two parents and their two children, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said. In northern Gaza, the Health Ministry said a bombing targeted the Indonesian Hospital wounding six patients, one of them seriously. It is the largest hospital north of Gaza City. 'We demand international protection for hospitals, patients and medical staff,' the ministry said in a statement that also urged safe passage to and from hospitals, more medical supplies and fuel and safe evacuation of the wounded. The Israeli military Sunday evening said it was unaware of any attack on the Indonesian Hospital 'in the last three to four hours.' Meanwhile, the military said it briefly closed the key Kerem Shalom crossing after fighters launched mortar shells several meters (feet) from the nearby humanitarian corridor toward its troops. It said Gaza's main cargo crossing was reopened after those who fired were 'eliminated,' though it added that the arrival and distribution of humanitarian aid was delayed. Kerem Shalom is the only crossing between Israel and Gaza that is designed for cargo shipments and has been the main artery for aid since the Rafah crossing with Egypt was shut in May. Last month, nearly two-thirds of aid entering Gaza came through Kerem Shalom. A second cold, rainy winter is beginning in Gaza, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in squalid tent camps and reliant on international aid. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 45,600 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-war-news-20a0d3732f81d88246f446b9e169113e	2024-12-08T09:18:34-08:00	
Cataldi promises hospitalized teammate Bove a goal and delivers as Fiorentina wins 8th straight	ROME (AP) — Danilo Cataldi texted hospitalized Fiorentina teammate Edoardo Bove to say that he would score for him Sunday and then fulfilled his promise in a 1-0 win over Cagliari on Sunday. It was Fiorentina’s first Serie A match since Bove collapsed on the field during a game against Inter Milan last weekend and was placed in a medically induced coma. The 22-year-old has been awake and alert since last Monday as doctors continue to investigate the cause of his collapse. Cataldi found the top corner midway through the first half and that was all Fiorentina needed for its eighth straight win in the Italian league to match the club record set in 1960. After he scored, Cataldi ran toward a TV camera, held up four fingers to match Bove’s No. 4 jersey then created a heart symbol with his fingers as he shouted, 'I told you. I told you.' 'I texted him before the match, saying: ‘Watch the game on TV because I'm going to score a goal into the top corner,’' Cataldi said. 'He said it was ‘impossible.’ We’re pleased that he’s feeling well and about these three points.' Fiorentina, which has a game in hand since the match against Inter was abandoned, moved level on points with third-place Inter. Fiorentina is three points behind new leader Atalanta, which is on a nine-game winning streak, and one point behind second-place Napoli, which was beaten 1-0 at home by Lazio. Gustav Isaksen scored for Lazio with a long-range shot late in the second half. Lazio also moved level on points with Inter and Fiorentina. Napoli had led for most of the season under first-year coach Antonio Conte but has now lost at home to both Atalanta and Lazio. Lazio has won six of its last seven matches. Also, Empoli won 4-1 at Hellas Verona and moved up to ninth; and Venezia and Como drew 2-2. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/fiorentina-cataldi-promise-bove-napoli-lazio-italy-93865f5f3257d73d040e2a0bea0fa9b0	2024-12-08T08:15:00-08:00	
Global reaction to Assad's sudden ouster from Syria ranges from jubilation to alarm	Across the Middle East and beyond, the fall of Syria’s authoritarian government at the hands of jihadi militants set off waves of jubilation, trepidation and alarm. Expatriate Syrians and many residents across the Middle East exulted at the overthrow of a leader who led his country through 14 years of civil strife that left half a million Syrians dead and displaced millions to countries around the world. Others worried about still more instability rocking a region in turmoil. Governments — whether allies or opponents of Assad — scrambled to absorb the sudden, stunning development and assess the implications for the Middle East and the world. Mixed emotions in the Middle East In Lebanon, thousands of Syrians headed for the Masnaa border crossing to return to their home country, despite the uncertainty. 'Anything is better than Bashar,' said Sami Abdel-Latif, a refugee from Hama who was heading back to join his wife and four children. 'This is a feeling we’ve been waiting 14 years for,' said Malak Matar, who was preparing to return to the capital Damascus. Now, he said, 'Syrians have to create a state that is well organized and take care of their country.' Many citizens in Syria's neighboring countries reacted with joy to news Assad was gone. In Jordan’s capital, Amman, resident Muhab al-Majali said his fall marked the end of 'unjust and tyrannical rule.' 'I believe that the future is beautiful and prosperous for the Syrians,' he said. Others were not so sure, in a region that saw the energy of the 2011 Arab Spring democracy movement collapse into conflict and authoritarian rule. Saeed Sawy, an engineer in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, predicted that Syria’s rebel groups would descend into infighting over the country’s future. 'We saw this happen before,' he said. 'We saw this in Libya, in Tunisia, in Yemen and Sudan. People rejoice over the fall of tyrants, then they disagree and fight, and a civil war starts.' Syria’s neighbors stepped up security along their borders. Lebanon said it was closing all but one of its land border crossings with Syria. Jordan also closed a border crossing. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces had — temporarily, he said — seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement, after Syrian troops abandoned their positions. Airstrikes were reported on a military airport near Damascus, which has previously been targeted by Israel, and on other Syrian military sites. Iran, a key ally of Assad, said the Syrian people should decide their country’s future 'without destructive, coercive foreign intervention.' The Foreign Ministry in Tehran said Iran supports Syria’s unity and national sovereignty, and hopes to see 'the end of military conflicts, the prevention of terrorist activities and the start of a national dialogue' with the participation of all groups. The Iraqi government, which is close to Iran, said it 'supports all international and regional efforts seeking to open a dialogue' for Syria. Egypt’s foreign ministry urged a 'comprehensive political process' to establish a new era of peace in the war-torn county. The head of Yemen’s internationally recognized government welcomed the fall of Assad as 'a historic moment.' Yemen’s government is at war with the Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran. Turkey has backed anti-Assad militant groups in Syria, and could play a key role in what happens next. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the fall of Assad brought 'hope.' He called on the world to help 'unite and reconstruct' Syria. Fidan, who met in Qatar on Saturday with diplomats from Russia and Iran, the main backers of the Assad regime, said regional and global powers should try 'to act with prudence and calm.' Europe urges calm The war sent millions of Syrians fleeing to Europe and expatriates took to the streets in celebration in cities including Paris, London, Stockholm, Helsinki and Athens. Many European governments welcomed Assad’s departure while urging a rapid return to stability. 'The end of Assad’s dictatorship is a positive and long-awaited development,' said Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s newly appointed foreign policy chief, in a post on X. 'Our priority is to ensure security in the region. I will work with all the constructive partners, in Syria and the region.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement that the end of Assad’s rule was 'good news,' adding that 'what matters now is that law and order are quickly restored in Syria.' France’s foreign ministry welcomed the fall of Assad, saying 'the Syrian people have suffered too much.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also welcomed the end of Assad’s 'barbaric regime.' 'We call on all sides to protect civilians and minorities and ensure essential aid can reach the most vulnerable in the coming hours and days,' he said. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also called for calm and urged work to ensure an 'orderly political transition to renewed institutions.' Russia, which backed Assad with troops and warplanes, said it has been following the 'dramatic events' in Syria 'with extreme concern.' Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha of Ukraine, which is at war with Russia, wrote on X that the ousted Syrian leader had suffered the fate of 'all dictators who bet on (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. He always betrays those who rely on him.' The U.S. assesses events In Washington, President Joe Biden was meeting with his national security team Sunday for an update on the situation in Syria. President-elect Donald Trump said in a social media post Saturday, before Assad’s fall was confirmed: 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, &amp; THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria, including U.S. forces working with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State group.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-overthrow-world-reaction-7caf6eca9a5f3af01e0801d434076232	2024-12-08T08:07:26-08:00	
Analysis: Collapse of Syria's Assad is a blow to Iran's 'Axis of Resistance'	MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) — For Iran’s theocratic government, it keeps getting worse. Its decadeslong strategy of building an 'Axis of Resistance' supporting militant groups and proxies around the region is falling apart. First came the crushing Israeli campaign in Gaza triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Iranian-backed Hamas. That war spawned another in Lebanon, where Israel has mauled Iran’s most powerful ally, Hezbollah, even as Israel has launched successful airstrikes openly inside of Iran for the first time. And now Iran’s longtime stalwart ally and client in Syria, President Bashar Assad, is gone. As dawn broke Sunday, rebel forces completed a lightning offensive by seizing the ancient capital of Damascus and tearing down symbols of more than 50 years of Assad's rule over the Mideast crossroads. Ali Akbar Velayati, a key adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, once called Assad and Syria 'the golden ring of the resistance chain in the region.' 'Without the Syrian government, this chain will break and the resistance against Israel and its supporters will be weakened.' That break in the chain is literal. Syria was an important geographical link that allowed Iran to move weapons and other supplies to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Its loss now further weakens Hezbollah, whose powerful arsenal in southern Lebanon had put Iranian influence directly on the border of its nemesis Israel. 'Iran’s deterrence thinking is really shattered by events in Gaza, by events in Lebanon and definitely by developments in Syria,' a United Arab Emirates senior diplomat Anwar Gargash said at the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ Manama Dialogue in Bahrain. Iran still holds the card of its nuclear program. Though it denies that intention, it can use the potential for building a weapons capability to cast a shadow of influence in the region. 'Iran remains a critical regional player,' Gargash said. 'We should use this moment to connect and speak about what’s next in my opinion.' It’s a dramatic reversal in Iran’s regional might Only a few years ago, the Islamic Republic loomed ascendant across the wider Middle East. Its 'Axis of Resistance' was at a zenith. Hezbollah in Lebanon stood up against Israel. Assad appeared to have weathered an Arab Spring uprising-turned-civil war. Iraqi insurgents killed U.S. troops with Iranian-designed roadside bombs. Yemen’s Houthi rebels fought a Saudi-led coalition to a stalemate. Syria, at the crossroads, played a vital role. Early in Syria’s civil war, when it appeared Assad might be overthrown, Iran and its ally, Hezbollah, rushed fighters to support him — in the name of defending Shiite shrines in Syria. Russia later joined with a scorched earth campaign of airstrikes. The campaign won back territory, even as Syria remained divided into zones of government and insurgent control. But the speed of Assad’s collapse the past week showed just how reliant he was on support from Iran and Russia – which at the crucial moment didn’t come. Russia remains mired years after launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. For Iran, international sanctions over its advancing nuclear program have ground down its economy. For Israel, breaking Iran’s regional network has been a major goal, though it is wary over jihadi fighters among the insurgents who toppled Assad. Israel on Sunday moved troops into a demilitarized buffer zone with Syria by the Israel-held Golan Heights in what it called a temporary security measure. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Assad's fall a 'historic day,' saying it was 'the direct result of our forceful action against Hezbollah and Iran, Assad’s main supporters.' Iran’s theocratic rulers long touted their regional network to Iranians as a show of their country’s strength, and its crumbling could raise repercussions at home — though there is no immediate sign of their hold weakening. Anger over the tens of billions of dollars Iran is believed to have spent propping up Assad was a rallying cry in rounds of nationwide anti-government protests that have broken out over recent years, most recently in 2022. Iran could respond by revving up its nuclear program The loss of Syria does not mean the end of Iran’s ability to project power in the Mideast. The Houthi rebels continue to launch attacks on Israel and on ships moving through the Red Sea — though the tempo of their attacks have again fallen without a clear explanation from their leadership. Iran also maintains its nuclear program. While insisting it enriches uranium for peaceful purposes, Western intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency say Iran had an organized nuclear weapons program until 2003. The head of the IAEA also warned Friday that Iran is poised to 'quite dramatically' increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium as it has started cascades of advanced centrifuges. 'If Iran would develop nuclear weapons, that would be a great blow to the international nonproliferation regime,' said Thanos Dokos. Greece’s national security adviser, in Bahrain. There remains a risk of wider attacks in the region, particularly on oil infrastructure. An attack in 2019 initially claimed by the Houthis but later assessed by experts to have been carried out by Iran temporarily halved Saudi Arabia’s production of oil. 'If, as a result of escalation, there are attacks against the energy infrastructure of Iran or Saudi Arabia, that would be bad news for the global oil supply,' Dokos warned. Whatever happens next, Iran will need to make the decision weighing the problems it faces at both home and abroad. 'Whereas stability is a difficult commodity to export, instability can travel very fast, which is why stability in the Middle East is very important for all of us,' Dokos said. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — Jon Gambrell, the news director for the Gulf and Iran for The Associated Press, has reported from each of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Iran and other locations across the Mideast and wider world since joining the AP in 2006. ___ The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation.

South Korea's democracy held after a 6-hour power play. What does it say for democracies elsewhere?	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — In an era of rising authoritarianism, at the heels of a six-hour martial law decree that unfolded while many South Koreans slept, something noteworthy happened: Democracy held. The past week in Seoul, officials and academics warn, is what a threat to democracy looks like in 2024. It's a democratically elected president declaring martial law over the nation he leads, asserting sweeping powers to prevent opposition demonstrations, ban political parties and control the media. It's members of the military attempting to block lawmakers from exercising their power to vote on cancelling the power grab. And here's what it took to defeat President Yoon Suk Yeol 's lurch toward government by force: Unified popular support for democracy. Legislators storming the National Assembly past midnight, live-streaming themselves climbing over fences. A politician grabbing at a soldier's rifle and yelling 'Aren't you ashamed?' until he retreated. And finally, decisively, Parliament assembling a quorum and voting unanimously to cancel martial law. It was a victory for a hard-won democracy — and for the idea that checks and balances among branches of government must work to counteract each other's ambitions, as the American founders wrote in the Federalist Papers in 1788. But as the drama played out in Seoul, the scaffolding of democracy rattled around the world. It said something about the rule of law In other countries, the grab for power might have worked. Other would-be authoritarians might have been better prepared than Yoon. In deeply polarized societies — the United States, for example, where Republicans are staunchly loyal to president-elect Donald Trump — there might not have been decisive support from the public or the opposition. The military might have used force. And the members of the legislature might not have voted as one to snuff out the attempted takeover. 'President Yoon's attempt to declare martial law reveals the fragility of the rule of law in divided societies, especially those with governments in which the chief executive cannot be easily dismissed by the legislature,' said Tom Pepinsky, a government professor at Cornell University who studies backsliding among democracies in Southeast Asia. Notably, he said in an email, 'No members of President Yoon’s own party were willing to defend his actions in public.' Nevertheless, Yoon’s surprise attempt to impose martial law revealed both the fragility and resilience of the country’s democratic system. Within three hours of his stunning announcement to impose military rule — claiming the opposition was 'paralyzing' state affairs — 190 lawmakers voted to cancel his actions. In so doing, they demonstrated the strength of the country’s democratic checks and balances. Yoon’s authoritarian push, carried out by hundreds of heavily armed troops with Blackhawk helicopters and armored vehicles sent to the National Assembly, harked back to an era of dictatorial presidents. The country’s democratic transition in the late 1980s came after years of massive protests by millions that eventually overcame violent suppressions by military rulers. Civilian presence was again crucial in shaping the events following Yoon’s late night television announcement on Tuesday. Thousands of people flocked to the National Assembly, shouting slogans for martial law to be lifted and Yoon to step down from power. There were no reports of violent clashes with troops and police officers. 'We restored democracy without having a single casualty this time,' said Seol Dong-hoon, a sociology professor at South Korea’s Jeonbuk National University. It's not that easy to become a dictator It’s virtually impossible for any leader of a democracy to pull off a transition toward martial law without a public willing to support it, or at least tolerate it. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, attracted millions of views as he began live-streaming his journey to the National Assembly, pleading for people to converge on the parliament to help lawmakers get inside. The shaky footage later shows him exiting his car climbing over a fence to get onto the grounds. The vote at the National Assembly was also broadcast live on the YouTube channel of Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik, who also had to scale a fence to get in. Yoon’s sense of crisis clearly wasn’t shared by the public, whose opinions, Seol said, were shaped predominantly by the shocking videos broadcast to their devices. 'Ultimately, democracy is all about moving public opinion,' he said. 'What was most crucial in this case was that everything was broadcast live on smartphones, YouTube and countless other media.' Opposition lawmakers are now pushing to impeach Yoon, saying he failed to meet the constitutional requirement that martial law should only be considered in wartime or a comparable severe crisis — and that he unlawfully deployed troops to the National Assembly. On Saturday, an opposition-led impeachment motion failed after most lawmakers from Yoon’s party boycotted the vote. Yet the president’s troubles persist: The vote’s defeat is expected to intensify nationwide protests and deepen South Korea’s political turmoil, with opposition parties preparing to introduce another impeachment motion when parliament reconvenes on Wednesday. Han Sang-hie, a law professor at Seoul’s Konkuk University, said the martial law debacle highlights what he sees as the most crucial flaw of South Korea’s democracy: that it places too much power in the hands of the president, which is easily abused and often goes unchecked. It's called a ‘self-coup’ Political scientists call what happened in South Korea an 'autogolpe' — a 'self-coup' — defined as one led by incumbent leaders themselves, in which an executive takes or sponsors illegal actions against others in the government. Yoon qualifies because he used troops to try to shut down South Korea's legislature. Self-coups are increasing, with a third of the 46 since 1945 occurring in the past decade, according to a study by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Penn State University. About 80% of self-coups succeed, they reported. In 2021, a power grab by Tunisian President Kais Saied raised similar concerns around the world after the country designed a democracy from scratch and won a Nobel Peace Prize after a largely bloodless revolution. In the United States, some have expresed worry about similar situations arising during the second administration of Donald Trump. He has vowed, after all, to shake some of democracy's pillars. He's mused that he would be justified if he decided to pursue 'the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.' That’s in contrast to the oath of office he took in 2017, and will again next year, to 'preserve, protect and defend the Constitution' as best he can. Nearly half of voters in the Nov. 5 election, which Trump won, said they were 'very concerned' that another Trump presidency would bring the U.S. closer to authoritarianism, according to AP Votecast survey data. Asked before a live audience on Fox News Channel in 2023 to assure Americans that he would not abuse power or use the presidency to seek retribution against anyone, Trump replied, 'except for day one,' when he'll close the border and 'drill, drill, drill.' After that, Trump said, 'I'm not a dictator.' ___ Kellman reported from London.	https://apnews.com/article/coup-yoon-democracy-martial-law-trump-caa2e5c9bbbe59c3af7f3bfab65bdf4b	2024-12-08T06:52:46-08:00

Adam Pemble, AP journalist whose compassionate lens brought stories to life, dies at 52	BERLIN (AP) — Adam Pemble, an Associated Press video journalist who covered some of the biggest global news of the past two decades, from earthquakes and conflicts to political summits and elections, has died. He was 52. Pemble died Thursday in Minneapolis surrounded by friends and family, according to his friend Mike Moe, who helped care for him in the final weeks of his fight against cancer. Known for bringing stories alive with his camera, Pemble epitomized the best of television news traditions, casting a curious and compassionate lens onto the lives of the people and communities whose stories he told. He joined the AP in 2007 in New York before moving to Prague in 2011 to help launch AP’s first cross-format operation combining photography, text stories and video. He enhanced Eastern European news coverage, creating distinctive stories highlighting the region's culture and society. 'Adam was an incredibly talented and passionate journalist and an empathetic storyteller. He had this amazing ability to get anyone to talk to him on camera, which I attribute to the Midwestern charm he embodied throughout his life.' said Sara Gillesby, AP’s Director of Global Video and Pemble’s former manager in New York when he joined the AP. 'He was the best of us.' Pemble was born in Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, in 1972 and grew up in Minneapolis. After graduating with a degree in mass communications from Minnesota State University Moorhead, he started his journalism career in 1997 at KVLY, a television station in Fargo, North Dakota, and later worked at WCCO in Minneapolis. 'He had the skills of the old-school camera people to meet a deadline and turn a beautiful story,' said Arthur Phillips, a cameraman who worked with Pemble at WCCO. 'But he had a calling for greater things.' Moving to New York, Pemble covered some of the biggest stories in the city, including the trial of Bernie Madoff, interviews with former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and with then-real estate developer, now U.S. president-elect, Donald Trump. He went to Haiti to cover the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, where he captured shocking images of devastation. A few weeks later he was in Vancouver, covering the Winter Olympics. With his transfer to Prague, Pemble quickly became the go-to video journalist deployed to the biggest news events in Europe, interviewing government leaders, covering violent protests, the aftermath of terror attacks and numerous national elections across the continent. 'An inquiring mind, a keen eye and a healthy skepticism for those in power who tried to spin away from truth all combined to make Adam’s stories as rich in color as he was in character,' said Sandy MacIntyre, former AP head of global video. 'Time and again he was asked to do the impossible and without fail he delivered the exceptional.' 'But more than all of that, he was the colleague and friend you wanted by your side because if Adam was there we knew we were going to be the winning team.' As civil unrest rocked Ukraine in 2014, Pemble reported from Kyiv and later Donetsk, where he covered the first Russian-backed demonstrations before spending weeks in Crimea during Russia's annexation of the strategic peninsula. His video reports included the last remaining Ukrainian sailors loyal to Kyiv finally abandoning their ship and coming ashore. With the Russian national anthem playing from a car in the background, his final shot showed two distraught sailors heckled as they walked away. Pemble returned to Ukraine following Russia's invasion of the country in 2022. Among his many assignments was filming the exclusive March 2023 AP interview by Executive Editor Julie Pace with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a train shuttled them across Ukraine to cities near some of the fiercest fighting. 'Adam showed up to every assignment with enthusiasm, creativity and commitment to his work and his colleagues. He loved what he did, and so many of us at AP are better for having worked alongside him,' Pace said. When not deployed overseas, Pemble set his camera's gaze on his new home in the Czech Republic, offering insight into the traditions and unique stories of Eastern Europe. From Christmas carp fishing at sunrise to graffiti artists in Prague, to the intimate story of a Slovak priest challenging the celibacy rules of the Catholic Church, he brought his unmistakable style. He worked with a traditional large broadcast camera in an era where many video shooters shifted to smaller, lighter cameras. He always put himself in the right place to let reality unfold like 'an old school analog painter in an often fast and furious digital age,' former AP cameraman Ben Jary recalled. Pemble's interest in visual storytelling led to experimenting with new technologies, including aerial videography. In 2015, he was the first major news agency camera operator to film live drone footage when reporting on the migration crisis in the Balkans. An avid gardener who planted trees and chilis on his rooftop in Prague, he was adventurous in the kitchen and especially proud of his vegan 'meatloaf,' friends said. He loved a seedy dive bar as much as a Michelin restaurant, and foods as varied as charcoal choux pastry with truffle creme and his favorite road trip junk food, Slim Jim’s jerky and Salted Nut Rolls. Pemble’s wit, wisdom, energy and positivity enriched the lives and experiences of those around him, friends and colleagues recalled. 'If someone asked me to see a picture of quiet strength and courage, dignity and grace, and most of all kindness, I would show them a picture of a man for all seasons,' said Dan Huff, a Washington-based AP video journalist, 'I would show them a picture of Adam Pemble.'	https://apnews.com/article/ap-video-journalist-adam-pemble-obituary-prague-a156914f1fa3dcbba712357b0048a0c6	2024-12-08T05:30:15-08:00	
How it happened: Two seismic weeks that toppled Syria's government	LONDON (AP) — Half a century of rule by the Assad family in Syria crumbled with astonishing speed after insurgents burst out of a rebel-held enclave and converged on the capital, Damascus, taking city after city in a matter of days. Opposition forces swept across the country and entered Damascus with little or no resistance as the Syrian army melted away. President Bashar Assad, Syria’s ruler for 24 years — succeeding his father, Hafez Assad — was reported to have fled the country for an undisclosed location. It’s a stunning development in Syria’s devastating 13-year conflict. Anti-government protests in 2011 met with a brutal crackdown, escalating into a civil war that has killed more than half a million people and displaced half of Syria’s prewar population of 23 million. Assad, backed by Iran and Russia, gradually regained control of more than two-thirds of Syria, leaving the rebels with one stronghold in the northwest of the country. And there the conflict remained, largely frozen, for years until late November. Here’s a look at a seismic two weeks for the Middle East. Wednesday, Nov. 27: Rebel offensive begins Armed opposition groups launch a large-scale attack on areas controlled by government forces in northwestern Syria and claim to have wrested control of over 15 villages from government forces in northwestern Aleppo province. The government and its allies respond with airstrikes and shelling in an attempt to halt the insurgent advances. The offensive is led by the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Formerly the Syrian branch of al-Qaida and known as the Nusra Front, HTS later distanced itself from al-Qaida, seeking to market itself as a more moderate group. It is classed as a terrorist group by the United Nations and the U.S. The attack on Aleppo follows weeks of simmering low-level violence, including government attacks on opposition-held areas. Turkey, a main backer of Syrian opposition groups, says the rebels began a limited offensive to stop the attacks, but it expanded as government forces began to retreat. Thursday, Nov. 28: The offensive expands The offensive expands to reach the countryside of Idlib province amid reports government troops are retreating. Friday, Nov. 29: Rebels enter Aleppo The insurgents enter Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, for the first time since they were pushed out in 2016 after a grueling military campaign by Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran. They meet with little resistance. Saturday, Nov. 30: Aleppo falls under insurgent control The rebels say they control Aleppo, raising a flag over the city’s citadel and occupying the international airport. The Syrian armed forces claim to have redeployed troops and equipment in preparation for a counterattack. By evening, the insurgents have seized at least four towns in the central Hama province and claim to have entered the provincial capital. Sunday, Dec. 1: The government fights back The Syrian military launches a counterattack with troops and airstrikes on Idlib and Aleppo. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visits Damascus, telling Assad that Tehran will support the counteroffensive. But Assad receives little, if any, help from his allies. Russia is busy with its war in Ukraine, and Iran has seen its proxies across the region degraded by regular airstrikes. Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up Assad’s forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Monday, Dec. 2-Wednesday, Dec. 4: Fighting rages near Hama The insurgents push south, advancing to within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of Hama, the country’s fourth-largest city and a key crossroads in central Syria, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Damascus. State media reports fierce fighting in the province, and both state media and a U.K.-based observer group say government forces, backed by Russian airstrikes, have recaptured some territory. Turkey urges Assad to hold talks with the opposition. Thursday, Dec. 5: Insurgents capture Hama After several days of fighting the rebels sweep into Hama. Dozens of jubilant fighters are seen firing into the air in celebration in Assi Square, the site of massive anti-government protests in the early days of the uprising in 2011. The Syrian army says it has redeployed to positions outside the city to protect civilians. Friday, Dec. 6: Rebels advance on Homs Rapidly advancing now, the rebels seize two towns on the outskirts of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city. About 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Hama, Homs is the gateway to Damascus and the location of one of Syria’s two state-owned oil refineries. Capturing it would cut the link between Damascus, Assad’s seat of power, and the coastal region where he enjoys wide support. The government denies reports that its military has withdrawn from the city. Top diplomats from countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Iran and Russia, hold talks on Syria in the Qatari capital, Doha. Saturday, Dec. 7: Homs falls and Assad’s grip weakens Opposition forces take Homs after government forces abandon it. The insurgents say they have encircled Damascus and are carrying out the 'final stage' of their offensive. The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, seeks urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition,' as Syrian state media denies Assad has fled the country. Sunday, Dec. 8: Assad is toppled Syrian state television airs a video statement by a group of men saying that President Bashar Assad has been overthrown and all prisoners have been set free. Russian officials and Iranian state TV say Assad has left Syria; his whereabouts are unknown. Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali says the government is ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-ousted-rebel-offensive-timeline-8c54a8b97803d4b10cde53b97227128e	2024-12-08T05:26:33-08:00	
Syria latest: Syrians celebrate Bashar Assad's fall as his whereabouts remain unknown	Crowds gathered in Syria's Damascus on Sunday to celebrate the fall of Bashar Assad’s government with chants, prayers and the occasional gunfire after opposition fighters entered the capital following a stunning advance. Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Syrian opposition war monitor, said Assad took a flight from Damascus and left early Sunday. There was no immediate official statement from the Syrian government and Assad's whereabouts remain unknown. It was the first time opposition forces had reached Damascus since 2018 when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege. The night before, opposition forces had taken the central city of Homs, Syria’s third largest, as government forces abandoned it. The rapidly developing events have shaken the region. Lebanon said it was closing all its land border crossings with Syria except for one that links Beirut with Damascus. Jordan closed a border crossing with Syria, too. ___ Here's the Latest: Many Jordanian people welcome the fall of Assad's regime AMMAN, Jordan — The vast majority of the Jordanian people are welcoming the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime and the success of the Syrian revolution. 'There is no doubt that I felt overwhelming joy at the fall of the Assad regime,' said Badi Al-Rafaia, Engineer, union activist and member of the Islamic Action Front. 'There is no doubt that we are happy with what happened in Syria, happy with the success of the revolution, happy with the Syrian people getting rid of an oppressor and criminal who treated the Syrian people and made the Syrian state a failed state.' Al-Rafaia said that Jordan is benefiting from what happened in Syria, and 'we hope that Jordan will help the revolution succeed and not work against it.' Amman resident Muhab al-Majali said the fall of the Assad regime is 'The end of every unjust and tyrannical rule, and more than that, it mortgaged the country and its people to the Iranians, who abandoned it in minutes... I believe that the future is beautiful and prosperous for the Syrians.' The International Committee of the Red Cross calls for safe humanitarian access and protection of civilians in Syria BERLIN — The International Committee of the Red Cross is calling for safe humanitarian access and protection of civilians in Syria after the fall of Bashir Assad’s government. 'Our teams in Syria, including in Damascus, have been closely monitoring the fast-evolving security and humanitarian situation in coordination with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent,' the ICRC’s head of delegation in Syria, Stephan Sakalian, said in a written statement Sunday. The ICRC is 'responding wherever possible, with further efforts underway, as hundreds of thousands of people need care and humanitarian assistance,' he said. Sakalian called 'on all parties to urgently enable safe and unhindered access for medical and humanitarian workers to reach those in need, to protect civilians, and to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law.' Iraqi government supports efforts seeking to open a dialogue for Syria's future BAGHDAD — The Iraqi government said in a statement Sunday that it 'supports all international and regional efforts seeking to open a dialogue' for Syria 'leading to the adoption of a pluralistic constitution that preserves the human and civil rights of Syrians, and supports cultural, ethnic and religious diversity.' The statement from government spokesperson Bassem al-Awadi, said that Iraq understands 'the necessity of respecting the free will of all Syrians, and stresses that the security of Syria, the unity of its territories, and the preservation of its independence are of utmost importance, not only for Iraq but also for its connection to the security and stability of the region.' It cautioned against 'interfering in Syria’s internal affairs, or supporting one party for the benefit of another.' Iraq, which has a close relationship with Iran - once a strong ally of former Syrian President Bashar Assad - has taken in some 2,000 Syrian army soldiers who fled the country amid the advance of armed opposition groups. Yemen's leader welcomes the fall of Syria's government CAIRO — The head of Yemen’s internationally recognized government welcomed the fall of the government of President Bashar Assad of Syria. 'It’s a historic moment,' Rashad al-Alimi, who chairs the ruling presidential council, wrote on X platform of Assad’s downfall. 'It’s time for the Iranian regime to stop meddling in Yemen, respect its sovereignty and identity.' Al-Alimi, who is backed by Saudi Arabia, was referring to Iran’s support of Houthi rebels who are at war with Yemen’s internationally recognized government for a decade. Families wander through the presidential palace in Damascus, taking pictures DAMASCUS — Families wandered through the high-ceilinged halls of the presidential palace in Damascus on Sunday, along with some armed men. Some paused to take family portraits or selfies on the few remaining couches against the backdrop of mosaiced walls, while others walked out with chairs and other items under their arms. On the massive parking lot out front, cars drove in circles honking ecstatically. In central Damascus’ Umayyad Square, drivers passing by also honked jubilantly, while young men piled onto a tank abandoned in the square. But for some the celebration was bittersweet. 'I am very happy, but this happiness will not be completed until I can see my son out of the prison and know where is he is,' said Damascus resident Bassam Masr. 'I have been searching for him for two hours - he has been detained for 13 years.' Iran, which had closely backed Assad, says Syrians should decide country’s future TEHRAN, Iran — Iran says the Syrian people should decide their country’s future 'without destructive, coercive foreign intervention.' The Foreign Ministry statement issued Sunday marked Iran’s first official reaction to the overthrow of President Bashar Assad, who it had strongly backed through nearly 14 years of civil war. Assad’s government was a close ally of Iran that served as a crucial conduit between it and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. The rebels who toppled Assad view Iran as a hostile foreign influence, and the abandoned Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked as they entered the city. The Foreign Ministry statement said Iran supports Syria’s unity and national sovereignty, and hopes to see 'the end of military conflicts, the prevention of terrorist activities and the start of a national dialogue' with the participation of all groups. 'It is expected that the wise and farsighted relations of the two nations will continue based on mutual ties and interests,' the statement said. Netanyahu says Israeli forces have seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights after Syrian unrest TEL AVIV, Israel – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israeli forces have seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement with Syria. He spoke from an overlook near the border between Syria and the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, after Syrian rebels tore through the country and dramatically ended Assad’s rule on Sunday morning. Netanyahu said the 50-year-old agreement had collapsed and that Syrian troops had abandoned their positions, necessitating the Israeli takeover as a 'temporary defensive position.' Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it. The international community, except for the United States, views it as occupied Syrian territory. Satellite images analyzed by the Associated Press show that as early as September, Israel began construction of what could possibly be a new road right along the so-called Alpha Line that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria. The United Nations confirmed that Israeli troops entered the demilitarized zone during the work. The United Nations maintains a peacekeeping force in the demilitarized zone called the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, or UNDOF, with around 1,100 peacekeepers from Fiji, India, Kazakhstan, Nepal, and Uruguay. After the 1973 Mideast war, the U.N. Secretary Council voted to create UNDOF to patrol a roughly 400 square kilometer (155 square mile) demilitarized zone and maintain the peace there. Syrians cross over from Lebanon, facing an uncertain future but hopeful for change MASNAA, Lebanon — At Lebanon’s Masnaa crossing into Syria, the mood was festive Sunday with some local Lebanese residents handing out congratulatory sweets to Syrians lined up to return to their country. Sami Abdel-Latif, a refugee from Hama who was heading to Syria to join his wife and four children, said while the future in Syria is still uncertain, 'anything is better than Bashar.' He said he expected some chaos initially but that eventually the situation would settle down. 'Look at Aleppo now,' he said, referring to the first major city taken over by opposition forces more than a week ago, where life has continued more or less as normal. Abdel-Latif, a construction worker, said he is also hoping that there will now be plentiful work in Syria to rebuild. Malak Matar, who was preparing to return to Damascus, said, 'This is a feeling we’ve been waiting 14 years for. 'You feel yourself psychologically free - you can express yourself,' he said. 'The country is free and the barriers have been broken down.' Now, he said, 'Syrians have to create a state that is well-organized and take care of their country. It’s a new phase.' Egyptians express mixed feelings over collapse of Assad's government CAIRO — Egyptians expressed mixed feelings following the downfall of Syria's Bashar Assad. Many welcomed Assad’s ouster after decades of repression under his rule and that of his father Hafez Assad. Others, however, expressed concerns about the future of Syria, mostly given the extremist past of rebel commanders, especially Abu Mohammed al-Golani who leads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, labeled a terrorist by the United States. 'It’s good news for Syrians,' Adel Salah, a retired school teacher, said while following a news TV channel in a Cairo coffee shop. 'But there is a big question: the future of the country.' Saeed Sawy, an engineer, painted a rather grim picture. He said it’s likely that these rebel groups, with their differences and competing alliances, will engage in infighting over the country’s future. 'We saw this happen before. We saw this in Libya, in Tunisia, in Yemen and Sudan. People rejoice over the fall of tyrants, then they disagree and fight, and a civil war starts,' he said. EU top diplomat welcomes Bashar Assad's ouster BRUSSELS — The European Union’s top diplomat welcomed the fall of Bashar Assad and said that the collapse of his rule underlines how weak his supporters in Moscow and Tehran have become. 'The end of Assad’s dictatorship is a positive and long-awaited development,' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas posted on X. 'Our priority is to ensure security in the region. I will work with all the constructive partners, in Syria and the region,' said Kallas, who took over as the 27-nation bloc’s top diplomat last week. German Chancellor calls for speedy return of order in Syria BERLIN — Reacting to the fall of Bashir Assad’s government, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday that 'what matters now is that law and order are quickly restored in Syria.' 'The Syrian people have experienced appalling suffering,' the chancellor said in an emailed statement. 'The end of Assad’s rule over Syria is therefore good news.' He stressed that 'all religious communities, all minorities must enjoy protection now and in the future.' 'We will judge the future rulers by whether they make it possible for all Syrians to live in dignity and self-determination, defend Syria’s sovereignty against malicious interference by third parties and live in peace with their neighbors,' Scholz added. Airstrikes reported in the area of the Mezzeh military airport DAMASCUS, Syria — An Associated Press journalist in Damascus reported airstrikes in the area of the Mezzeh military airport, southwest of the capital Sunday. The airport has previously been targeted in Israeli airstrikes, but it was not immediately clear who launched Sunday's strike. The Israeli military refused to comment on the airport strike. Israel often does not publicly claim responsibility for attacks in Syria. On Saturday and Sunday, the Israeli military sent additional troops to the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights to bolster Israel’s presence along the border between Israel and Syria. Agricultural areas along the border were declared closed military zones and some schools shifted to online classes in anticipation of unrest. China hopes for stability soon in Syria BEIJING — China said it was closely monitoring the situation in Syria and that it hoped stability would return as soon as possible, according to a statement published Sunday on the Foreign Ministry’s website. Beijing said it has been helping Chinese nationals who wish to leave Syria to do so in a safe manner and that it remained in contact with those still in the country. 'We urge relevant parties in Syria to ensure the safety and security of the Chinese institutions and personnel in Syria,' the statement read. 'The Chinese Embassy is still up and running and carrying out its duty in Syria. We will continue to make every possible assistance to Chinese nationals in need.' Opposition forces announce curfew in Damascus BEIRUT — The command of the Syrian armed opposition says it will impose Sunday a curfew in Damascus, starting at 4 p.m. local time till 5 a.m. on Monday. The Military Operations Administration, which posted the decision on Telegram, did not give a reason for the curfew. Russia claims Assad left Syria after giving instructions to transfer power peacefully MOSCOW — Russia’s Foreign Ministry claimed Sunday that Bashar Assad had left Syria after negotiations with rebel groups, and gave 'instructions' to 'transfer power peacefully.' In a post on the Telegram messaging app on Sunday, the ministry said Moscow had not directly participated in these talks. It also said it has been following the 'dramatic events' in Syria 'with extreme concern.' It also said Russian troops stationed in Syria have been put on high alert and that as of early afternoon Sunday, there was 'no serious threat' to the security of Russia’s military bases there. Russia has waged a military campaign in Syria since September 2015, teaming up with Iran to allow Assad’s government to fight armed opposition groups and reclaim control over most of the country. While Russia now concentrates the bulk of its military resources in Ukraine, it has maintained a military foothold in Syria and keeps troops at its bases there. Turkey-backed forces are about to wrest control of city from a U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led force ANKARA, Turkey — Turkish security officials said Sunday that Turkey-backed opposition forces were close to wresting control of the city of Manbij from a U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led force. The opposition group, known as the Syrian National Army, SNA, was now in control of 80% of Manbij, after pushing back against the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units, the YPG, the officials said. They provided the information on condition of anonymity due to regulations. Last week, the Turkish-backed force similarly expelled YPG fighters from the city of Tal Rifaat. The Syrian Kurdish militia group is a key U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria. Turkey however, considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization due to its link to the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has led a decades-long insurgency in Turkey. Turkey has conducted several incursions into Syria since 2016 to push the YPG away from its borders with Syria. France welcomes the fall of Bashar Assad PARIS — The French Foreign Affairs ministry said France 'welcomes' the fall of Bashar Assad’s government 'after more than 13 years of violent repression against its own people.' The ministry said in a statement: 'The Syrian people have suffered too much. Bashar Assad has bled dry country, emptied of a large part of its people who, if not forced into exile, have been massacred, tortured and bombarded with chemical weapons by the regime and its allies.' France also called for a peaceful political transition that respects the diversity of the Syrian people and protects civilians and minorities and on its international partners to help the Syrian people move towards 'reconciliation and reconstruction,' saying France is ready to 'play its full part' in the process. UN envoy for Syria expresses hope but warns of immense challenges DOHA, Qatar — The U.N. envoy for Syria says the ouster of President Bashar Assad has created an opportunity to address the country’s deep problems and create a brighter future after years of conflict. But he says 'immense' challenges remain. Geir Pederson told reporters that the changes in Syria now raise hope for millions of refugees, internally displaced, political prisoners and families whose loved ones have disappeared. 'Today we look forward to the cautious hope for the opening of a new time for the peace, reconciliation, dignity and inclusion of all Syrians,' he said. He said the U.N. was closely monitoring the situation on the ground and urging all groups to avoid violence, protect civilians and respect human rights. 'Let me stress that there must be a collective effort to secure peace and dignity for all, and that I stand ready to support the Syrian people in their journey toward a stable and inclusive future, decided and shaped by the Syrian people themselves,' Pederson said at the Doha Summit. He said he did not know where Assad has fled to and declined to say whether the former president should be prosecuted for war crimes. Pederson said international efforts should focus now on a stable and peaceful transition before addressing deeper questions like justice for Assad. Turkish foreign minister calls on world to help stabilize Syria BEIRUT — Hakan Fidan said Sunday that 'Syria has reached a stage where the Syrian people will shape the future of their own country,' calling on the international community to support Syrians. Fidan is attending the Qatari diplomatic forum that started late Saturday and is hosting eight countries with an interest in Syria, including the U.S. and Iran. 'The new administration must be established in an orderly manner. The principle of inclusiveness must never be compromised,' the Turkish foreign minister told reporters. 'There must never be a desire for revenge. It is time to unite and reconstruct the country.' When asked where Bashar Assad was, he said: 'I cannot say for sure.' Hakan Fidan, adding, 'he is somewhere, but I cannot comment on that' and that he was 'probably outside of Syria.' Fidan, who on Saturday met with his counterparts from Russia and Iran, the main backers of the Assad regime, said regional and global powers should try 'to act with prudence and calm and to refrain from steps that could further destabilize the region.' Turkey has been in contact with Syrian opposition factions to ensure terrorist groups do not take advantage of the situation, Fidan added, referring to the Islamic State group and Kurdish militants. He also stressed that any chemical weapon stockpiles should be secured.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-israel-hamas-war-gaza-lebanon-82ceb102928e842154d91201b16cf2ab	2024-12-08T05:07:02-08:00	
Trump calls for 'immediate ceasefire' in Ukraine after meeting Zelenskyy in Paris	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, shortly after a meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders, claiming Kyiv 'would like to make a deal' to end the more than 1,000-day war. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Moscow and Kyiv have both lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a war that 'should never have started.' 'There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed,' he said, as he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to act to bring the fighting to an end. Trump’s remarks came after a meeting Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, that Zelenskyy later described as 'constructive'. Speaking to reporters later that day, Zelenskyy insisted that any peace deal 'should be just' for Ukrainians, 'so that Russia and Putin or any other aggressors will not have the opportunity to return.' In a separate social media update Sunday, Zelenskyy asserted that Kyiv has so far lost 43,000 soldiers since Moscow's all-out invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, while a further 370,000 have been wounded. Both Russia and Ukraine have been reluctant to publish official casualty figures, but Western officials have said that the past few months of grinding positional warfare in eastern Ukraine have meant record losses for both sides, with tens of thousands killed and wounded each month.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-ceasefire-e00a18db202ef74b38e009bb2a5381cf	2024-12-08T03:02:22-08:00	
Who is Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of the insurgency that toppled Syria's Assad?	BEIRUT (AP) — Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the militant leader whose stunning insurgency toppled Syria’s President Bashar Assad, has spent years working to remake his public image, renouncing longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicting himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. In recent days, the insurgency even dropped his nom de guerre and began referring to him by his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa. The extent of that transformation from jihadi extremist to would-be state builder is now put to the test. Insurgents control capital Damascus, Assad has fled into hiding, and for the first time after 50 years of his family’s iron hand, it is an open question how Syria will be governed. Syria is home to multiple ethnic and religious communities, often pitted against each other by Assad’s state and years of war. Many of them fear the possibility Sunni Islamist extremists will take over. The country is also fragmented among disparate armed factions, and foreign powers from Russia and Iran to the United States, Turkey and Israel all have their hands in the mix. The 42-year-old al-Golani -- labeled a terrorist by the United States -- has not appeared publicly since Damascus fell early Sunday. But he and his insurgent force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS – many of whose fighters are jihadis -- stand to be a major player. For years, al-Golani worked to consolidate power, while bottled up in the province of Idlib in Syria’s northwest corner as Assad’s Iranian- and Russian-backed rule over much of the country appeared solid. He maneuvered among extremist organizations while eliminating competitors and former allies. He sought to polish the image of his de-facto 'salvation government' that has been running Idlib to win over international governments and reassure Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities. And he built ties with various tribes and other groups. Along the way, al-Golani shed his garb as a hard-line Islamist guerrilla and put on suits for press interviews, talking of building state institutions and decentralizing power to reflect Syria’s diversity. 'Syria deserves a governing system that is institutional, no one where a single ruler makes arbitrary decisions,' he said in an interview with CNN last week, offering the possibility HTS would eventually be dissolved after Assad falls. 'Don’t judge by words, but by actions,' he said. Al-Golani’s beginnings in Iraq Al-Golani’s ties to al-Qaida stretch back to 2003, when he joined extremists battling U.S. troops in Iraq. The Syrian native was detained by the U.S. military but remained in Iraq. During that time, al-Qaida usurped like-minded groups and formed the extremist Islamic State of Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In 2011, a popular uprising against Syria’s Assad triggered a brutal government crackdown and led to all-out war. Al-Golani’s prominence grew when al-Baghdadi sent him to Syria to establish a branch of al-Qaida called the Nusra Front. The United States labeled the new group as a terrorist organization. That designation still remains in place and the U.S. government has put a $10 million bounty on him. The Nusra Front and the Syrian conflict As Syria’s civil war intensified in 2013, so did al-Golani’s ambitions. He defied al-Baghdadi’s calls to dissolve the Nusra Front and merge it with al-Qaida’s operation in Iraq, to form the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Al-Golani nonetheless pledged his allegiance to al-Qaida, which later disassociated itself from ISIS. The Nusra Front battled ISIS and eliminated much of its competition among the Syrian armed opposition to Assad. In his first interview in 2014, al-Golani kept his face covered, telling a reporter for Qatari network Al-Jazeera that he rejected political talks in Geneva to end the conflict. He said his goal was to see Syria ruled under Islamic law and made clear that there was no room for the country’s Alawite, Shiite, Druze and Christian minorities. Consolidating power and rebranding In 2016, al-Golani revealed his face to the public for the first time in a video message that announced his group was renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham -– the Syria Conquest Front -- and cutting its ties to al-Qaida. 'This new organization has no affiliation to any external entity,' he said in the video, filmed wearing military garb and a turban. The move paved the way for al-Golani to assert full control over fracturing militant groups. A year later, his alliance rebranded again as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham -– meaning Organization for Liberating Syria -- as the groups merged, consolidating al-Golani’s power in northwest Syria’s Idlib province. HTS later clashed with independent Islamist militants who opposed the merger, further emboldening al-Golani and his group as the leading power in northwestern Syria, able to rule with an iron fist. With his power consolidated, al-Golani set in motion a transformation that few could have imagined. Replacing his military garb with shirt and trousers, he began calling for religious tolerance and pluralism. He appealed to the Druze community in Idlib, which the Nusra Front had previously targeted, and visited the families of Kurds who were killed by Turkish-backed militias. In 2021, al-Golani had his first interview with an American journalist on PBS. Wearing a blazer, with his short hair gelled back, the now more soft-spoken HTS leader said that his group posed no threat to the West and that sanctions imposed against it were unjust.

Romania's far-right presidential candidate denounces canceled vote at closed polling station	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania’s defiant far-right presidential candidate, Calin Georgescu, on Sunday stood outside a closed polling station to denounce a top court’s unprecedented decision to annul the first round of the vote in which he emerged as the frontrunner. The Constitutional Court on Friday canceled the election after a trove of declassified intelligence alleged Russia organized a sprawling campaign across social media to promote Georgescu. 'Today is Constitution Day and there is nothing constitutional in Romania anymore. I am here in the name of democracy,' Georgescu, 62, told media in Mogosoaia, outside Bucharest. 'By canceling democracy, our very freedom is canceled.' The court cited the illegal use of digital technologies including artificial intelligence, as well as undeclared sources of funding. Without naming Georgescu, the court said one candidate received 'preferential treatment' on social media platforms, distorting voters’ expressed will. Despite being a huge outsider who declared zero campaign spending, Georgescu topped the polls in the first round on Nov. 24, and was due on Sunday to face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a runoff. Thirteen candidates ran in the first round of the presidential race in the European Union and NATO member country, the aftermath of which was gripped by myriad controversies including a recount of the vote ordered by the same court. New dates will be set to rerun the presidential vote from scratch. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said in a statement marking Constitution Day on Sunday that 'we find ourselves in a moment of profound responsibility toward the values ​​that characterize us as a nation.' 'The Romanian Constitution defines the framework within which the state and political life operate, serving as a shield against threats to democracy,' he said. 'In turbulent times, state institutions are called upon to act with calm, wisdom and respect for the law, the Constitution and democracy.' George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, told reporters outside a closed polling station in Bucharest on Sunday that the annulment amounted to an attack against democracy, saying Iohannis should 'take a step back and respect the Constitution, not mock it.' 'It is Constitution Day. It is a day of significance for Romanians. It is a day when Romanians should have gone to vote freely,' he said, adding that 'blood was shed for this 35 years ago,' referring to Romania’s revolution in December 1989 that overthrew communism. After Georgescu unexpectedly topped the polls in the first round, his success left many political observers wondering how most local surveys had placed him behind at least five other candidates before the vote. Many observers attributed his success to his TikTok account, which now has 6.2 million likes and 565,000 followers. But some experts suspected Georgescu’s online following was artificially inflated, while Romania’s top security body alleged he was given preferential treatment by TikTok over other candidates. On Saturday, Romanian prosecutors conducted raids at three properties in the central city of Brasov linked to Bogdan Peschir, who is suspected of illegally financing a campaign to promote Georgescu. The raids were based on suspicions of voter corruption, money laundering and cyber fraud, prosecutors said. The secret services alleged that Peschir paid $381,000 (361,000 euros) to TikTok users to promote Georgescu content on the Chinese-owned platform. Intelligence authorities said information they obtained 'revealed an aggressive promotion campaign' to increase and accelerate Georgescu’s popularity. There is no clear link between Peschir and alleged Russian interference. Russia denies meddling in Romania. On Friday, Georgescu's would-be opponent Lasconi also strongly condemned the court’s decision to annul the elections, saying it was 'illegal, immoral, and crushes the very essence of democracy' and that the second round should have gone forward.	https://apnews.com/article/georgescu-romania-elections-9e64a5420df7314f07d34644b5cbeaa9	2024-12-08T01:37:02-08:00	
Ghana's ex-President John Mahama is set to return after rival concedes election	ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — Ghana’s former President John Dramani Mahama is set to return to office in the West African nation’s presidential election after the ruling party candidate, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, on Sunday conceded defeat and voters vented anger at the government’s handling of the economy. Ahead of the official announcement, Bawumia told reporters that he respects the decision of Ghanaians to vote for change. 'I’ve just called His Excellency John Mahama to congratulate him as president-elect of the Republic of Ghana,' he said at his residence in the capital, Accra. Previously president of Ghana between July 2012 and January 2017, Mahama, 65, acknowledged the call from the ruling party candidate in a post on the X platform, describing his victory as 'emphatic.' He had promised to 'reset' the country on various fronts during a campaign that prioritized the economy and largely appealed to young Ghanaians who saw the vote as a way out of the country’s economic crisis. Celebrations broke out among the supporters of the opposition candidate in parts of the country, including the capital city. Wearing the opposition party's white, green, red and black colors, women and young people danced to music and trumpet blasts on the streets and at the party's national headquarters The election for both the president and members of parliament was held against the backdrop of the country’s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation and was seen as a litmus test for democracy in a region shaken by extremist violence and coups. West Africa's regional bloc of ECOWAS said the election was generally peaceful, a continuing trend in Ghana. Bawumia was running as the flagbearer of the ruling New Patriotic Party, or NPP, which has struggled to resolve the economic crisis under outgoing President Nana Akufo-Addo. Mahama's National Democratic Congress also won the majority in parliament, he said. Mahama's win is viewed as following the latest trend of elections around the world, favoring opposition parties against incumbents, from the United States to European countries — such as Britain and France — as well as South Africa. The former president is 'the only person' who can fix the ailing economy in Ghana, one of West Africa's economic powerhouses, said Jude Agbemava, a policy analyst who voted for him. Like in most other elections in countries where the incumbent lost, the vote in Ghana was about the people making their disaffection known against a government that has lost goodwill, said Seidu Alidu, head of the department of political science at Ghana's University of Legon. 'I think it has to do with the economy, which is largely a bread and butter issue for every Ghanaian,' said Alidu. 'When the people elect you, they require you to do certain things for them. But it was also about the style of governance (because) even in other countries facing economic challenges, governments were being honest with the people, telling them what the reality is, and the steps they have taken to manage it,' he added. —— Asadu reported from Abuja, Nigeria.	https://apnews.com/article/ghana-bawumia-mahama-election-e2d8fafcb85af36fb625480b24ea9535	2024-12-08T01:00:20-08:00	
Syrian government falls to fast-moving rebels, ending 50 years of iron rule by the Assad family	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The Syrian government collapsed early Sunday, falling to a lightning rebel offensive that seized control of the capital of Damascus and sent crowds into the streets to celebrate the end of the Assad family's 50 years of iron rule. Syrian state television aired a video statement by a group of men saying that President Bashar Assad had been overthrown and all prisoners had been set free. The man who read the statement said the opposition group, known as the Operations Room to Conquer Damascus, called on all rebel fighters and citizens to preserve the institutions of 'the free Syrian state.' The statement emerged hours after the head of a Syrian opposition war monitor said Assad had left the country for an undisclosed location, fleeing ahead of insurgents who said they had entered Damascus following a remarkably swift advance across the country. Many of the capital’s residents were in disbelief at the speed at which Assad lost his hold on the country after nearly 14 years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced half the country's prewar population of 23 million and drew in several foreign powers. Celebrations erupt across the capital As daylight broke over Damascus, crowds gathered to pray in the city’s mosques and to celebrate in the squares, chanting 'God is great.' People also chanted anti-Assad slogans and honked car horns. Teen boys picked up weapons that had apparently been discarded by security forces and fired them in the air. Revelers filled Umayyad Square in the city center, where the Defense Ministry is located. Men fired celebratory gunshots into the air and some waved the three-starred Syrian flag that predates the Assad government and was adopted by the revolutionaries. A few kilometers (miles) away, Syrians stormed the presidential palace, tearing up portraits of the toppled president. Soldiers and police officers left their posts and fled, and looters broke into the Defense Ministry. Videos from Damascus showed families wandering into the presidential palace, with some emerging carrying stacks of plates and other household items. 'I did not sleep last night, and I refused to sleep until I heard the news of his fall,' said Mohammed Amer Al-Oulabi, 44, who works in the electricity sector. 'From Idlib to Damascus, it only took them (the opposition forces) a few days, thank God. May God bless them, the heroic lions who made us proud.' Syria’s al-Watan newspaper, which was historically pro-government, wrote: 'We are facing a new page for Syria. We thank God for not shedding more blood. We believe and trust that Syria will be for all Syrians.' The newspaper added that media workers should not be blamed for publishing government statements in the past. 'We only carried out the instructions and published the news they sent us,' it said. 'It quickly became clear now that it was false.' A statement from the Alawite sect — to which Assad belongs and which has formed the core of his base — called on young Syrians to be 'calm, rational and prudent and not to be dragged into what tears apart the unity of our country.' Assad's whereabouts are unknown Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said in a video statement that the government was ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and turn its functions over to a transitional government. He later told Saudi television network Al Arabiya that he does not know where Assad and the defense minister are. He said he lost communication with Assad late Saturday. Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The Associated Press that Assad took a flight Sunday from Damascus. A senior diplomat from the United Arab Emirates, which had sought to rehabilitate Assad's image and has welcomed high-profile exiles in recent years, declined to comment on his whereabouts when asked by reporters at a conference in Bahrain. Anwar Gargash said Assad's destination at this point is a 'footnote in history,' comparing it to the long exile of German Kaiser Wilhelm II after World War I. Assad has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war, including a 2013 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of the capital. There was no immediate comment from Iran, which had been Assad’s staunchest supporter. The Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked after apparently having been abandoned. AP footage showed broken windows and documents scattered in the entryway. Entry into Damascus caps lightning advance Opposition forces had not reached Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege. The night before, opposition forces took the central city of Homs, Syria’s third largest, as government forces abandoned it. The city stands at an important intersection between Damascus, the capital, and Syria’s coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus — the Syrian leader’s base of support and home to a Russian strategic naval base. The rebels had already seized the cities of Aleppo and Hama, as well as large parts of the south, in a fast-moving offensive that began Nov. 27. The advances in the past week were by far the largest in recent years by opposition factions, led by a group that has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. In their push to overthrow Assad’s government, the insurgents, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, have met little resistance from the Syrian army. Calls for an orderly transition as it remains unclear what comes next HTS set up a 'salvation government' in 2017 to administer a large region in northwestern Syria under its control. In recent years, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the group’s image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance. 'Golani has made history and sparked hope among millions of Syrians,' said Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and an expert on Syrian groups. 'But he and the rebels now face a formidable challenge ahead. One can only hope they rise to the occasion.' The U.N.’s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called Saturday for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose country is Assad’s chief international backer, said he feels 'sorry for the Syrian people.' The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key regional mediator, hosted an emergency meeting of foreign ministers and top officials from eight countries with interests in Syria late Saturday. The participants included Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Turkey. Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman and an adviser to the prime minister, told reporters that they agreed on the need 'to engage all parties on the ground,' including the HTS, and that the main concern is 'stability and safe transition.' The Israeli military said Sunday it has deployed forces in a demilitarized buffer zone along its northern frontier with Syria following the rebel offensive there. The military, which said it also sent troops to 'other places necessary for its defense,' said the deployment was meant to provide security for residents of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war and the international community, except for the United States, views it as occupied. ___ Associated Press writers Bassem Mroue, Sarah El Deeb and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Samar Kassaballi, Omar Sanadiki and Ghaith Alsayed in Damascus, Syria, Jon Gambrell in Manama, Bahrain, Josef Federman in Doha, Qatar, and Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-sweida-daraa-homs-hts-qatar-816e538565d1ae47e016b5765b044d31	2024-12-07T22:23:26-08:00	
Europe's economy needs help. Political chaos in France and Germany means it may be slower in coming	BRUSSELS (AP) — Even before the French and German governments collapsed, Europe’s economy had enough difficulties. Tepid growth and lagging competitiveness versus the U.S. and China. An auto industry that's struggling. Where to find billions for defense against Russia? And now Donald Trump threatening tariffs. Solutions will be harder to find while the two countries that make up almost half of the eurozone economy remain stuck in political paralysis well into 2025. Where once there was the so-called French-German axis to push Europe ahead, now there’s a vacuum. French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned Thursday after losing a vote of confidence, and while President Emmanuel Macron will appoint a successor, the new head of government will lack a majority. Elections are not constitutionally permitted until at least June. Germany's coalition led by Social Democratic Chancellor Olaf Scholz with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats fractured in November, triggering an early election on Feb. 23. Talks to form a new government could last into April. At least Germany's likely new chancellor, conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz, appears open to loosening constitutional restrictions on borrowing to enable pro-growth spending and investment, said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director Europe at Eurasia Group. France, however, could be facing 'complete paralysis on the economic question,' Rahman said. 'It's highly unlikely they're going to get a political equilibrium that has a mandate to implement a credible fiscal course correction.' 'And that's obviously a problem for Europe because it means the great potential of the European economy is not what it otherwise should be, because you don't have France and Germany firing on all cylinders,' he said. Then there's Europe's lagging business environment, dissected by former European Central Bank head Mario Draghi in a report that contains recommendations such as common borrowing to support public investment; EU-wide industrial policy; and integrating financial markets to help startups raise capital. Yet 'nothing can move in Europe without Franco-German alignment,' Rahman said. Meanwhile, Europe's auto industry has sought a review of tough EU emissions standards in 2025 instead of 2026, saying slackening demand for electric cars means they won't be able to avoid heavy fines and that the money would be better used to develop new electric vehicles. Anne-Laure Delatte, a French economist and head of research at the National Center for Scientific Research, said financial markets remain cautious but are not overly alarmed by France’s political instability. But economic weakness in France and Germany could have broader implications for the European Union. 'This could either weaken Europe’s position globally or shift power and influence to other European countries like the Netherlands or Spain, which are performing well at the moment,' she said. France is expected to see growth of 1.1% this year and 0.8% next year, while Germany’s economy is expected to shrink 0.1% this year, the second consecutive year of contraction, and rebound modestly with 0.7% next year. Germany faces headwinds from a shortage of skilled labor, excessive bureaucracy and higher energy prices, and efforts to address those issues have been stalled by squabbling in Scholz’s coalition. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU’s executive arm, is equipped with serious powers, especially on trade, a key EU authority delegated to Brussels by member countries. But there’s only so much von der Leyen can do without political backing from the two biggest member countries, whose national budgets are bigger than the EU's. The most urgent matter may be how to respond to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20. European officials are trying to defuse a potential trade conflict involving new U.S. tariffs or import taxes on European goods that would seriously ding the continent’s export-focused economy. Europe could decide not to retaliate to any U.S. tariffs, thus avoiding a mutually destructive tit-for-tat cycle. The bloc could also commit to buying U.S. liquefied natural gas to mollify Trump, or spend billions more on defense for Ukraine to answer his complaint that European countries don't meet NATO commitments on defense spending. Europe is seeing only modest growth as consumers pummeled by inflation remain cautious about spending. The economy is expected to expand 0.8% this year and 1.3% next year for the 20 EU member countries that use the euro currency, according to the European Commission. While the direct impact on growth is small, the political logjam means Europe is missing an important opportunity to engage Trump, said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank. 'It would be ideal if Europe — at the moment when Trump is not yet in office — would prepare a big offer for Trump, such as: We spend significantly more on defense, if on trade and on Ukraine you don’t disappoint us. This is unfortunately not happening.' 'The risk is that Trump on trade might be tougher on us than otherwise because Germany and France are missing in action,' he said. Von der Leyen can offer to get countries to purchase more U.S. natural gas and remind Trump that the EU could retaliate, but 'the offer that Europe can make to Trump is small, rather than a big offer where there would be German and French money behind it.' The EU commission estimates that as much as 500 billion euros ($528 billion) will be needed over the next decade to help meet the bloc’s security needs. Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius has indicated common defense bonds could raise that enormous sum. But moving ahead without Germany, the bloc's biggest member, is hard to imagine. The big issues such as defense and competitiveness 'require the fiscal and parliamentary resources of the biggest member states and the question is whether Germany and France are in a position to enable that at the European level,' said Rahman. 'I think the answer is probably yes, but I feel a bit less certain than I would have had Germany and France not had this very difficult political time.' ___ McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.

The spiritual heart of Paris awakens: Notre Dame hosts first Mass since 2019 fire	PARIS (AP) — Notre Dame Cathedral on Sunday will host its first Mass since the catastrophic fire of 2019, a moment that transcends religious significance to become a powerful symbol of Paris’ resilience. For Catholics, it marks the revival of the city’s spiritual heart, a place where faith has been nurtured for centuries. For the world, it signals the rebirth of one of world heritage's most famous landmarks. The event is both solemn and historic. Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will preside over the morning Mass, including consecrating a new bronze altar. This liturgy, attended by French President Emmanuel Macron, clergy, dignitaries and guests, is closed to the general public. Nearly 170 bishops from France and around the world are taking part in this celebration, along with one priest from each of the parishes in the Paris diocese and one priest from each of the seven Eastern-rite Catholic churches, accompanied by worshippers from these communities. It is a milestone in Notre Dame’s journey from ruin to resurrection — a process defined by extraordinary craftsmanship, nearly $1 billion in global donations and an unyielding determination to rebuild what seemed lost. Later on Sunday, an evening Mass will welcome members of the public who secured reservations last week. The Associated Press learned that tickets for this service were claimed within 25 minutes, underscoring Notre Dame’s enduring ability to inspire awe, devotion, and curiosity. Public viewing areas along the Seine are expected to draw thousands more who wish to witness this historic moment from afar. What's more extraordinary is that this is taking place in a country with a strong emphasis on secularism and a low rate of church attendance. A sacred space reborn Sunday’s Masses follow Saturday evening’s ceremonial reopening in which Archbishop Ulrich symbolically reopened the cathedral’s massive wooden doors by striking them three times with a crosier crafted from charred beams salvaged from the fire. As the doors swung open, choirs filled the cathedral with song and the cathedral’s great organ — silent since the fire — resounded with majestic melodies. Inside, the restoration reveals a cathedral transformed with now-gleaming limestone walls cleaned of centuries of grime. The restored stained-glass windows project dazzling patterns of color across the nave. 'No one alive has seen the cathedral like this,' said the Rev. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, Notre Dame’s rector. 'It is more than restored — it is reborn.' Sunday morning’s liturgy will consecrate the new altar, a pivotal moment in Notre Dame’s return to full liturgical life. The altar houses relics of five saints tied to Paris, including St. Catherine Labouré and St. Charles de Foucauld, continuing a centuries-old tradition of embedding sacred artifacts at the heart of worship spaces. The consecration, involving holy water, chrism oil, incense and prayer, transforms the altar into a sacred centerpiece of the cathedral. A moment of unity The reopening of Notre Dame is more than a religious milestone, it is a moment of cultural and national unity. Macron, who vowed to restore the cathedral within five years after the fire, attended Saturday’s ceremonies and called the project 'a jolt of hope' for France, a nation often divided by political crises. The Sunday Masses underscore Notre Dame’s dual role as a place of worship and a symbol of communal resilience. They also ensure that members of the broader Catholic community can partake in the cathedral’s spiritual revival. 'This was not just about restoring a building. It was about restoring the heart of the nation,' Dumas said. Challenges overcome The path to restoration has been fraught with challenges. Lead contamination forced work to pause, and the COVID-19 pandemic added delays. Yet the project, overseen by architect Philippe Villeneuve, has been hailed as a triumph of human ingenuity and collective resolve. Cutting-edge fire prevention systems, including thermal cameras and a misting system, have been installed to safeguard the cathedral’s future. Villeneuve described the effort as 'restoring not just a building but the soul of a nation,' emphasizing the personal and national significance of the work. A sacred future and ‘octave’ With its spire once again piercing the Parisian sky, Notre Dame is poised to reclaim its role as a global beacon of faith and art. The cathedral, which previously welcomed 12 million annual visitors, is expected to draw 15 million in its new chapter. This monumental revival is not confined to a single day. Ulrich has announced an 'octave' of celebrations—eight days of special religious services, each with its own theme, running through Dec. 15. These daily liturgies, open to diverse groups from local parishioners to international pilgrims, emphasize Notre Dame’s role as a unifying spiritual hub.	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-1st-mass-fire-restoration-273a44fbce8465561e558e1029457eda	2024-12-07T20:46:48-08:00	
Reindeer' volunteers bring holiday magic to Ukrainian children living on the frontlines	IZIUM, Ukraine (AP) — Hopes for victory, a swift end to the war and prayers for their loved ones' survival or return from Russian captivity are among the wishes scattered throughout letters sent to a volunteer group by Ukrainian children living in frontline areas. While the volunteers, who are named reindeer after the magical beasts that pull Santa’s sleigh, cannot fulfill many of these dreams, they strive to deliver on the simpler ones, such as requests for power banks to help families endure outages, bicycles, books, and even pets. Every winter, the volunteers travel to heavily damaged cities to deliver gifts and ensure that, despite the war, Ukrainian children can celebrate the holiday season just like their peers around the world. This year, the group received 2,310 letters, according to project manager Inna Achkasova from the NGO Ukrainian Frontiers, who launched the St. Nicholas’ Reindeers initiative in 2015. The children’s wishes are published on the project’s website. Donors affectionately known as magicians then choose a letter and buy the requested gift to make that child's dreams come true. The reindeer then deliver those gifts. 'Children are those who have no choice whatsoever. No one asks them whether they want to stay or leave,' says project psychologist Kateryna Shutalova. 'What happens to them is never their choice. And this makes them the most vulnerable.' But every child gets only one childhood, even if it’s shaped by war. That’s why, in their letters, the horrors that have impacted their lives coexist with wishes similar to those of children everywhere. 'My father is in captivity, and I live with my mother and brother,' one boy wrote in his letter. He continued: 'I love playing football and practice it professionally. I want a leather football.' Volunteers sift through all the letters, enduring the tragic stories of each child, to sort and deliver the gifts correctly. Among the writers are children who have lost loved ones to shelling, endured Russian occupation, seen their homes destroyed, have parents serving on the frontlines, or were forced to flee to escape the war. 'What struck me wasn’t their wishes but how deeply children feel the need to tell their stories,' Shutalova says. Wearing reindeer antlers, the volunteers set out on their journey on Dec. 6, when Ukraine celebrates St. Nicholas Day. Their journey is expected to last until mid-January. On a frosty morning in Kharkiv, covered by the season’s first snow, a team of volunteers departs in two buses filled with gifts, headed for the formerly Russian-occupied city of Izium, around 55 kilometers (35 miles) from the frontline. At first, when the celebration has started, the children observe cautiously, their expressions somber, but that mood doesn't last. With each activity, they became more cheerful and engaged. One of them is 9-year-old Alina Soboleva, who remains detached despite the volunteers’ efforts. She watches the festivities unfold with a quiet gaze. Her grandmother, Svitlana Lokotosh, explains that Alina has been withdrawn since witnessing the deaths of her mother and other grandmother in a shelling in the courtyard of their home. Alina had been watching through the window as her mother spoke on the phone. When the shell struck, a fragment hit her mother in the neck. Her grandmother rushed outside to help and was killed by another shell. In her letter, Alina asked for two pet mice. She said it was her dream. 'Our only wish is for peace and quiet,' says Lokotosh, who took Alina in after her mother’s death. 'So the children don’t have to be afraid.' Shutalova explains that parents often find it hard to talk to their children about the war. They’re either afraid, lack the emotional resources, or are overwhelmed by their feelings. 'But for children to process what they’ve been through, they need to talk, play, and express those emotions,' she says. At the celebration, parents stand against the walls, smiling as their children laugh and play despite having endured so much at such a young age. Among them is Anna Bolharska, a 32-year-old mother of two. Her father-in-law was killed and her brother-in-law was injured during the occupation. In the spring of 2022, she and her children fled Izium amid relentless shelling, only returning after Ukrainian forces liberated the city in September that year. 'I don’t like to remember those times. We try to move forward because dwelling on it is too hard mentally,' Bolharska says. 'We try not to remind the children and to keep them distracted.' Her 9-year-old daughter, Myroslava Bolharska, dreams of becoming a veterinarian. In her letter, she asked for a guitar. 'During the war it seems everyone’s dreams have changed — to wish for the war to end,' she wrote. The reindeers' winter journey will take them to over 40 towns in the coming weeks. They hope to realize many dreams and bring joy to the kids, even though some of their wishes are impossible to fulfill. 'Some children wrote in their letters that they want their childhood back,' project co-founder Inna Achkasova says, adding that the reindeer volunteers aim to ensure that every child feels seen, heard and loved. ___ Associated Press journalist Hanna Arhirova contributed to this report in Kyiv, Ukraine. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-children-55edecb85450421ba69eda70c17ed307	2024-12-07T20:13:05-08:00	
The fall of Bashar Assad after 14 years of war in Syria brings to an end a decades-long dynasty	BEIRUT (AP) — The fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government Sunday brought to a dramatic close his nearly 14-year struggle to hold onto power as his country fragmented amid a brutal civil war that became a proxy battlefield for regional and international powers. Assad’s downfall came as a stark contrast to his first months as Syria’s unlikely president in 2000, when many hoped he would be a young reformer after three decades of his father’s iron grip. Only 34 years old, the Western-educated ophthalmologist was a rather geeky tech-savvy fan of computers with a gentle demeanor. But when faced with protests against his rule that erupted in March 2011, Assad turned to the brutal tactics of his father in an attempt to crush them. As the uprising hemorrhaged into an outright civil war, he unleashed his military to blast opposition-held cities, with support from allies Iran and Russia. International rights groups and prosecutors alleged widespread use of torture and extrajudicial executions in Syria's government-run detention centers. The Syrian war has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country’s pre-war population of 23 million. As the uprising spiraled into a civil war, millions of Syrians fled across the borders into Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon and on to Europe. His departure brings an end to the Assad family rule, spanning just under 54 years. With no clear successor, it throws the country into further uncertainty. Until recently, it seemed that Assad was almost out of the woods. The long-running conflict had settled along frozen conflict lines in recent years, with Assad's government regaining control of most of Syria's territory while the northwest remained under the control of opposition groups and the northeast under Kurdish control. While Damascus remained under crippling Western sanctions, neighboring countries had begun to resign themselves to Assad's continued hold on power. The Arab League reinstated Syria's membership last year, and Saudi Arabia in May announced the appointment of its first ambassador to Syria since severing ties with Damascus 12 years earlier. However, the geopolitical tide turned quickly with a surprise offensive launched by opposition groups based in northwest Syria in late November. Government forces quickly collapsed, while Assad's allies, preoccupied by other conflicts — including Russia's war in Ukraine and the yearlong wars between Israel and the Iran-backed militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas — appeared reluctant to forcefully intervene. Assad's whereabouts were not clear Sunday, amid reports he had left the country as insurgents took control of the Syrian capital. He came to power in 2000 by a twist of fate. His father had been cultivating Bashar’s oldest brother Basil as his successor, but in 1994 Basil was killed in a car crash in Damascus. Bashar was brought home from his ophthalmology practice in London, put through military training and elevated to the rank of colonel to establish his credentials so he could one day rule. When Hafez Assad died in 2000, parliament quickly lowered the presidential age requirement from 40 to 34. Bashar’s elevation was sealed by a nationwide referendum, in which he was the only candidate. Hafez, a lifelong military man, ruled the country for nearly 30 years during which he set up a Soviet-style centralized economy and kept such a stifling hand over dissent that Syrians feared even to joke about politics to their friends. He pursued a secular ideology that sought to bury sectarian differences under Arab nationalism and the image of heroic resistance to Israel. He formed an alliance with the Shiite clerical leadership in Iran, sealed Syrian domination over Lebanon and set up a network of Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups. Bashar initially seemed completely unlike his strongman father. Tall and lanky with a slight lisp, he had a quiet, gentle demeanor. His only official position before becoming president was head of the Syrian Computer Society. His wife, Asma al-Akhras, whom he married several months after taking office, was attractive, stylish and British-born. The young couple, who eventually had three children, seemed to shun trappings of power. They lived in an apartment in the upscale Abu Rummaneh district of Damascus, as opposed to a palatial mansion like other Arab leaders. Initially upon coming to office, Assad freed political prisoners and allowed more open discourse. In the 'Damascus Spring,' salons for intellectuals emerged where Syrians could discuss art, culture and politics to a degree impossible under his father. But after 1,000 intellectuals signed a public petition calling for multiparty democracy and greater freedoms in 2001 and others tried to form a political party, the salons were snuffed out by the feared secret police who jailed dozens of activists. Instead of a political opening, Assad turned to economic reforms. He slowly lifted economic restrictions, let in foreign banks, threw the doors open to imports and empowered the private sector. Damascus and other cities long mired in drabness saw a flourishing of shopping malls, new restaurants and consumer goods. Tourism swelled. Abroad, he stuck to the line his father had set, based on the alliance with Iran and a policy of insisting on a full return of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, although in practice Assad never militarily confronted Israel. In 2005, he suffered a heavy blow with the loss of Syria’s decades-old control over neighboring Lebanon after the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri. With many Lebanese accusing Damascus of being behind the slaying, Syria was forced to withdraw its troops from the country and a pro-American government came into power. At the same time, the Arab world became split into two camps - one of U.S.-allied, Sunni-led countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, the other Syria and Shiite-led Iran with their ties to Hezbollah and Palestinian militants. Throughout, Assad relied for largely on the same power base at home as his father: his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam comprising around 10 percent of the population. Many of the positions in his government went to younger generations of the same families that had worked for his father. Drawn in as well were the new middle class created by his reforms, including prominent Sunni merchant families. Assad also turned to his own family. His younger brother Maher headed the elite Presidential Guard and would lead the crackdown against the uprising. Their sister Bushra was a strong voice in his inner circle, along with her husband Deputy Defense Minister Assef Shawkat, until he was killed in a 2012 bombing. Bashar’s cousin, Rami Makhlouf, became the country’s biggest businessman, heading a financial empire before the two had a falling out that led to Makhlouf being pushed aside. Assad also increasingly entrusted key roles to his wife, Asma, before she announced in May that she was undergoing treatment for leukemia and stepped out of the limelight. When protests erupted in Tunisa and Egypt, eventually toppling their rulers, Assad dismissed the possibility of the same occurring in his country, insisting his regime was more in tune with its people. After the Arab Spring wave did move to Syria, his security forces staged a brutal crackdown while Assad consistently denied he was facing a popular revolt, instead blaming 'foreign-backed terrorists' trying to destabilize his regime. His rhetoric struck a chord with many in Syria’s minority groups - including Christians, Druze and Shiites - as well as some Sunnis who feared the prospect of rule by Sunni extremists even more than they disliked Assad’s authoritarian rule. Ironically, on Feb. 26, 2001, two days after the fall of Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak to protesters and just before the wave of Arab Spring protests swept into Syria — in an email released by Wikileaks as part of a cache in 2012 — Assad e-mailed a joke he’d run across mocking the Egyptian leader’s stubborn refusal to step down. 'NEW WORD ADDED TO DICTIONARY: Mubarak (verb): To stick something, or to glue something. ... Mubarak (adjective): slow to learn or understand,' it read.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-bashar-assad-war-1468a97ff95bb782f5933856d99c9a8d	2024-12-07T20:11:00-08:00	
Taiwan reports 14 Chinese warships and 4 balloons near the island	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China sent 14 warships, seven military aircraft and four balloons near Taiwan between Saturday and Sunday, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry, as Beijing ramps up pressure on the island it claims as its own. China’s military activities come amid speculation Beijing might organize military drills around the island in response to Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te’s recent visit to Pacific allies, including U.S. stops in Hawaii and Guam. China claims Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy of 23 million people, as its own territory, and bristles at other countries’ formal exchanges with Taiwan. The United States, like most countries, doesn’t recognize Taiwan as a country but is its main unofficial backer and sells it arms. The Chinese government has pledged to annex Taiwan, through military force if necessary, and sends ships and military planes near the island almost daily. The 14 warships, seven military planes and four balloons were reported over 24 hours between 6 a.m. on Saturday and 6 a.m. on Sunday, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. The ministry said six of the aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial demarcation zone between Taiwan and China. One of the balloons brushed over the island’s northern tip, according to the ministry. Lai on Friday called on China to refrain from threats and said Beijing’s military exercises 'will not be able to win the respect' of neighboring countries. Lai’s first overseas trip since taking office in May included visits to the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau, three of the 12 countries that have diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The rest of the world, including the U.S., has official ties with China. Lai’s stops in Hawaii and Guam — from where he had phone calls with U.S. Congress leaders — angered China, which opposes U.S. arms sales and military assistance to Taiwan. There was widespread speculation China might organize war games around Taiwan in response to the visit, though it was unclear when they might start. In October, China held drills around Taiwan involving a record one-day total of 153 aircraft, 14 navy vessels and 12 Chinese government ships in response to a Lai speech in which he rejected Beijing’s claims over Taiwan. Beijing has labeled Lai a separatist and refuses to speak to him.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-balloons-navy-ships-aircraft-fb944dbf5350400a4371380885c028b3	2024-12-07T19:22:10-08:00	
Hemingway look-alikes visit Cuba and some of the late writer's favorite places	HAVANA (AP) — Ernest Hemingway has returned to Cuba... in a way. Eighteen white-bearded men who resemble the late U.S. author arrived in Havana to visit some of his favorite places when he lived on the island decades ago. The members of the Hemingway Look-alike Society on Saturday visited the author’s favorite bar in Havana, 'El Floridita,' where the music immediately picked up, and tourists and locals gathered around to take photos. Earlier, they went to the San Francisco de Paula municipality and Finca Vigia, a former home to Hemingway that is now a museum. There, they played baseball with children. 'That is the reason for our visit: the kids and their families,' said Joe Maxy, from Tennessee, who is one of the bearded men honoring the author of 'The Old Man and the Sea.' The visit comes as Cuba and the United States are in the midst of tense relations. Washington maintains sanctions on the islands, and things are unlikely to change as Donald Trump prepares to assume the presidency in January. After former President Barack Obama lifted some restrictions in 2017, Trump largely shut down U.S. cooperation with Cuba and hit the country with new sanctions. The U.S. generally prohibits Americans from traveling to Cuba for tourism, although it gives some permits. The look-alikes arrived in Havana on Friday when they took part in a ceremony at the Hemingway marina in honor of Diana Nyad, the first swimmer to cross the Gulf of Mexico from Cuba to Florida, and they will leave the island on Sunday. Hemingway lived in Cuba from 1939 to 1960.	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-hemingway-author-havana-lookalike-1c6e7a08bc45edd216810bead3cecd6b	2024-12-07T18:51:38-08:00	
South Korean prosecutors detain ex-defense chief over martial law imposition, reports say	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean prosecutors on Sunday detained a former defense minister who allegedly recommended last week’s brief but stunning martial law imposition to President Yoon Suk Yeol, making him the first figure detained over the case, news reports said. The reported development came a day after Yoon avoided an opposition-led bid to impeach him in parliament, with most ruling party lawmakers boycotting a floor vote to prevent the two-thirds majority needed to suspend his presidential powers. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party said it will prepare a new impeachment motion against Yoon. On Sunday, ex-Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun voluntarily appeared at a Seoul prosecutors’ office, where he had his mobile phone confiscated and was detained, Yonhap news agency reported. Other South Korean media carried similar reports, saying Kim was moved to a Seoul detention center. The reports said police were searching Kim's former office and residence on Sunday. Repeated calls to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office and the National Police Agency were unanswered. An official at the detention facility in eastern Seoul hung up the phone when The Associated Press called. Yoon accepted Kim’s resignation offer on Thursday after opposition parties submitted a separate impeachment motion against him. Kim is a central figure in Yoon’s martial law enforcement, which led to special forces troops encircling the National Assembly building and army helicopters hovering over it. The military withdrew after the parliament unanimously voted to overturn Yoon’s decree, forcing his Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Wednesday. Park Se-hyun, chief of the Seoul High Prosecutors Office, said in a televised statement that the prosecution was investigating the martial law incident with a 62-member team, including both public and military prosecutors, and pledged a thorough probe that would 'leave no suspicions.' In Kim’s impeachment motion document, the Democratic Party and other opposition parties accused him of proposing martial law to Yoon. Ruling People Power Party leader Han Dong-hun made a similar comment on Kim’s role. Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho told parliament that Kim Yong Hyun ordered the deployment of troops to the National Assembly. The Democratic Party called Yoon’s martial law imposition 'unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or a coup.' It has filed complaints with police against at least nine people, including Yoon and Kim, over the alleged rebellion. In a statement distributed by the Defense Ministry on Wednesday, Kim said that 'all troops who performed duties related to martial law were acting on my instructions, and all responsibility lies with me.' Prosecutor General Shim Woo Jung told reporters on Thursday the prosecution plans to investigate the rebellion charges against Yoon following complaints filed by the opposition. While the president mostly has immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. It wasn’t immediately clear how the prosecution plans to proceed with an investigation into Yoon. The Defense Ministry said it has suspended three top military commanders over their alleged involvement in the martial law imposition. They were among those facing the opposition-raised rebellion allegations. Han said Sunday the ruling party will try to make sure that investigations of those involved in the martial law imposition would be conducted in a transparent manner. But the Democratic Party said authorities should immediately arrest Yoon and all others implicated in the case. On Saturday, Yoon issued an apology over the martial law decree, saying he won’t shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration and promising not to make another attempt to impose it. He said would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country’s political turmoil, 'including matters related to my term in office.' Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid scandals involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a 'den of criminals' bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.' The declaration of martial law was the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea. The turmoil has paralyzed South Korean politics and sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners like the U.S. and Japan. The scrapping of Yoon's impeachment motion is expected to intensify protests calling for his ouster and deepen political chaos in South Korea, with a survey suggesting a majority of South Koreans support the president’s impeachment. Yoon’s martial law declaration drew criticism from the ruling party, but it is determined to oppose Yoon’s impeachment apparently because it fears losing the presidency to liberals. In a joint address with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Sunday, Han, the ruling party chief, said the PPP will work with the government to chart out Yoon’s early and orderly exit from office in a way that minimizes confusion, but he didn't say when that would happen. The ruling party chief claimed Yoon will not be involved in state affairs, including foreign policy, but it wasn’t immediately clear whether that would align with the constitution. Han Duck-soo said the government will work with the ruling party on state affairs but didn't make any comments that supported Han Dong-hun's remarks on Yoon's early exit or his exclusion from state affairs. Yoon's presidential office didn't immediately respond. The Democratic Party criticized Han Dong-hun’s comments, saying that the exclusion of an incumbent president from state affairs isn’t supported by the constitution. Kim Min-seok, head of a party task force on the martial law case, said that Yoon's immediate impeachment is the only way to resolve the turmoil. He said Han Dong-hun, who holds no government post, has no constitutional rights to be involved in handling state affairs.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-defense-minister-5bb4ed3108a9c7fb0ff1d01df924bf0b	2024-12-07T17:19:04-08:00

Opposition fighters are at Damascus' gates. Who are they and what now?	Opposition fighters are closing in on Syria’s capital in a swiftly developing crisis that has taken much of the world by surprise. Syria's army has abandoned key cities with little resistance. Nervous residents in Damascus describe security forces on the streets. The state news agency has been forced to deny rumors that President Bashar Assad has left the country. Who are these opposition fighters? If they enter Damascus after taking some of Syria’s largest cities, what then? Here’s a look at the stunning reversal of fortune for Assad and his government in just the past 10 days, and what might lie ahead as Syria’s 13-year civil war reignites. The aim? Overthrow the government This is the first time that opposition forces have reached the outskirts of the Syrian capital since 2018, when the country’s troops recaptured the area following a yearslong siege. The approaching fighters are led by the most powerful insurgent group in Syria, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, along with an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Both have been entrenched in the northwest. They launched the shock offensive on Nov. 27 with gunmen capturing Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, and the central city of Hama, the fourth largest. The HTS has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. But the group said in recent years it cut ties with al-Qaida, and experts say HTS has sought to remake itself in recent years by focusing on promoting civilian government in their territory as well as military action. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday from Syria that the aim of the offensive is to overthrow Assad’s government. Possible rifts ahead The HTS and Syrian National Army have been allies at times and rivals at times, and their aims might diverge. The Turkish-backed militias also have an interest in creating a buffer zone near the Turkish border to keep away Kurdish militants at odds with Ankara. Turkey has been a main backer of the fighters seeking to overthrow Assad but more recently has urged reconciliation, and Turkish officials have strongly rejected claims of any involvement in the current offensive. Whether the HTS and the Syrian National Army will work together if they succeed in overthrowing Assad or turn on each other again is a major question. Others take advantage While the flash offensive against Syria’s government began in the north, armed opposition groups have also mobilized elsewhere. The southern areas of Sweida and Daraa have both been taken locally. Sweida is the heartland of Syria’s Druze religious minority and had been the site of regular anti-government protests even after Assad seemingly consolidated his control over the area. Daraa is a Sunni Muslim area that was widely seen as the cradle of the uprising against Assad’s rule that erupted in 2011. Daraa was recaptured by Syrian government troops in 2018, but rebels remained in some areas. In recent years, Daraa was in a state of uneasy quiet under a Russian-mediated ceasefire deal. And much of Syria's east is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led group backed by the United States that in the past has clashed with most other armed groups in the country. Syria's government now has control of only three of 14 provincial capitals: Damascus, Latakia and Tartus. What’s next? Much depends on Assad’s next moves and his forces' will to fight the rebels. A commander with the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, posted on the Telegram messaging app that opposition forces have started carrying out the 'final stage' of their offensive by encircling Damascus. And Syrian troops withdrew Saturday from much of the central city of Homs, Syria's third largest, according to a pro-government outlet and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. If that city is captured, the link would be cut between Damascus, Assad’s seat of power, and the coastal region where he enjoys wide support. 'Homs to the coastal cities will be a very huge red line politically and socially. Politically, if this line is crossed, then we are talking about the end of the entire Syria, the one that we knew in the past,' said a Damascus resident, Anas Joudeh. Assad appears to be largely on his own as allies Russia and Iran are distracted by other conflicts and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah has been weakened by its war with Israel, now under a fragile ceasefire. The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, seeks urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition,' saying the situation is changing by the minute. He met with foreign ministers and senior diplomats from eight key countries including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran on the sidelines of the Doha Summit. President-elect Donald Trump in his first extensive comments on the developments in Syria said the besieged Assad didn’t deserve U.S. support to stay in power. 'THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,' Trump posted on social media. ___ Associated Press writer Abby Sewell in Beirut contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-civil-war-rebels-turkey-iran-russia-0a5fddb5ee4065e93be374cbcdb01ff7	2024-12-07T11:45:59-08:00	
Nobel Literature Prize winner Han Kang talks about how writing connects her to readers	STOCKHOLM (AP) — South Korean author Han Kang, this year’s winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, spoke passionately on Saturday about the process of writing and her evolution as a writer — all the way back to when she was 8 years old. Han, the first Asian woman and the first South Korean writer to win the Nobel literature prize, was delivering her Nobel lecture in Stockholm, the Swedish capital. She described in a soft-spoken voice how in January she found an old shoe box containing several several diaries dating back to her childhood. Among the stack of journals, she found a poem about love she had written. 'The lines penned by my eight-year-old self were suitably innocent and unpolished,' she said. Han was awarded for her novels, including 'The Vegetarian' and 'Human Acts,' that explore the pain of being human and the scars of Korea’s turbulent history. She is known for her experimental and often disturbing stories that incorporate the brutal moments of modern South Korea. The Nobel Committee praised Han 'for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life.' The author spoke Saturday about how she involves all of her senses in the creation of some of her best known works. 'When I write, I use my body,' she said. 'I use all the sensory details of seeing, of listening, of smelling, of tasting, of experiencing tenderness and warmth and cold and pain, of noticing my heart racing and my body needing food and water, of walking and running, of feeling the wind and rain and snow on my skin, of holding hands.' In her lecture she expressed gratitude at those moments when she senses that she was able to transmit those 'vivid sensations' to her readers. 'In these moments I experience ... the thread of language that connects us, how my questions are relating with readers through that electric, living thing,' Han said as she finished her lecture. 'I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all those who have connected with me through that thread, as well as to all those who may come to do so.' Han delivered her speech in Korean, but a translation into English and Swedish was posted on the Nobel Prize's website. There will be a ceremony and banquet for her and the other laureates on Tuesday Nov. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death.	https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-literature-han-kang-lecture-4737e87ea19c791da046236de9736335	2024-12-07T08:44:30-08:00	
How 'Mufasa' rose with Aaron Pierre and Blue Ivy's voices along with new Lin-Manuel Miranda music	SAN DIEGO (AP) — When Aaron Pierre was cast as Mufasa, the weight of following in the late James Earl Jones' legendary footsteps was enough to rattle any actor. But instead of letting the pressure roar too loudly, he harnessed his nerves to breathe fresh life into his young lion character. 'I had a lot of nerves and I actually think those nerves served me because that is what the adolescent version of that lion is,' Pierre said in an interview Friday at the San Diego Safari Park about his leading role in 'Mufasa: The Lion King.' He took the reins as the new voice of Mufasa after Jones played the iconic King Mufasa in both the 1994 and 2019 versions of Disney's 'The Lion King.' Here are some details and insights about 'Mufasa' ahead of its release in theaters on Dec. 20. First, a tribute to James Earl Jones Jones’ voice isn’t heard in the movie, but it opens with a brief tribute to the beloved actor, who died in September. Pierre had hoped to meet Jones for the first time, but didn’t get the chance. Now, he’s determined to honor his idol by building on his character’s legacy. 'I imagine that an individual experiencing those things might have moments of not being sure and I wasn’t sure about myself,' he said. 'Aaron wasn’t sure about Aaron going into this, I tried to channel those emotions as opposed to being something that prohibited me as something that propelled me forward. I gave it my best. I hope that I was able to serve James Earl Jones and honor James Earl Jones and the character.' Mufasa’s heart-wrenching origin story The live-action prequel offers a fresh exploration into Mufasa's origin. After the events in the 2019 film, Rafiki takes on the role of a storytelling sage, weaving the untold tale of Mufasa for Kiara — the spirited granddaughter of Mufasa and the daughter of Simba and Nala. The duo Timon and Pumbaa stick around for Rafiki’s flashback. Rafiki reveals that Mufasa’s cubhood wasn’t all royal ease and sunlit horizons. After a heart-wrenching tragedy of being separated from his parents, young Mufasa finds himself lost and alone. 'He’s been separated from his family. He’s an orphan. He’s been ostracized, he’s been dismissed. He’s been degraded,' said Pierre, the British actor who's starred in the 'Genius: MLK/X' series and the Netflix action hit 'Rebel Ridge.' Mufasa was a stray until fate led him to Taka, the compassionate heir of a different pride. Taka, with his fierce yet nurturing mother, offer the displaced cub a new beginning in their pride. Over the years, Mufasa and Taka’s bond grows from camaraderie to brotherhood. But their loyalty is put to the ultimate test during a journey that uncovers Mufasa’s true origins and rightful kingdom as well as the reasons behind Taka becoming Scar. 'There was a bit of Taka resting on the privilege that he was supposed to be afforded,' said Kelvin Harrison Jr., who plays Taka. He drew some inspiration from Jeremy Irons, who voiced the villainous Scar in the 1994 original. 'There’s a little bit of ‘Well, it seems like I need to command attention,'' continued Harrison, who starred in 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' and 'Waves.' 'It seems like the only way to win over a pride of anything is to assert dominance. That was Taka’s version of that, which ended up being a staple as Scar.' Beyonce’s daughter Blue Ivy makes her feature film debut Beyoncé might have a small role in 'Mufasa,' but her daughter Blue Ivy Carter is the family's shining star in the film. The eldest daughter of Beyoncé and Jay-Z makes her feature film debut, lending her voice as Kiara, the daughter of Simba and Nala, who is portrayed by her superstar mother. 'She came into this prepared,' said director Barry Jenkins, who heard Blue Ivy's narration on the audio book of Oscar winner Matthew Cherry's 'Hair Love.' He said the 12-year-old phenom displayed some skills that could not be ignored. 'She was the main character and this whole movie starts with just voices,' Jenkins said. 'They’re doing almost like a radio play and hearing that quality in her voice, I thought, ‘Oh, I think that’s my character,’' he continued. 'Then she auditioned and it was clear that she is my character.' While recording for Kiara's character, Jenkins said Blue Ivy, who won a Grammy for co-writing her mom’s 2019 hit 'Brown Skin Girl,' was a pro. 'I don’t know Blue Ivy’s life, but I imagine she grows up a little bit different than everyone else,' he said. 'I think because of that she’s grown up and so she had all these wells of understanding, experience, emotional knowledge that she brought to the character. She was awesome.' Jenkins likens the Kiara character to the many children who will see the movie. In the film, she eagerly listens to John Kani's Rafiki tell her grandfather's origin story while Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) accompany them in a cave. 'They get to see themselves in that character and she’s learning the story about Mufasa,' Jenkins said. 'She’s learning how he went through the same trials and tribulations, the same growth as she is.' Blue Ivy did not record her vocals with the three cast members, but Rogen applauded her skills. 'She was great,' he said. 'I could have sworn we were in that cave with her.' Lin-Manuel Miranda’s secret ingredient When Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote new songs for the film, he often leaned on the famous Billie Jean King quote: 'Pressure is a privilege.' Miranda was up for the challenge to leave his own imprint on the storied franchise much like his predecessors. He said there are seven new songs on the soundtrack, which will be released Dec. 13. 'I was emboldened by the fact that there’s the ’94 original which is like an immortal classic,' said Miranda, the 'Hamilton' creator and Grammy, Emmy and Tony winner. 'But there’s also the Broadway musical and there’s also Beyoncé‘s album ‘The Lion King: The Gift,' which I think expanded the musical vocabulary of what can be a ‘Lion King’ song. So I felt a lot of space to create because I felt like ‘Lion King’ is practically a genre of music and there was room to play and find new stuff within it.' Miranda said his 'secret ingredient' was Lebo M, who's known for his opening vocals on the classic melody 'Circle of Life.' He said his lyrics were inspired by the script. 'His harmonies, the choral arrangements he created for the Broadway musical and for the show, I think were so important to the success of the music of these movies,' Miranda said. 'I think it was exciting for him to work on new songs.'	https://apnews.com/article/musfasa-lion-king-aaron-pierre-blue-ivy-d900717873cb2fe7daa23de278fc3422	2024-12-07T08:08:05-08:00	
Pope Francis presides over ceremony for new cardinals with wide bruise on his chin	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis was seen with a significant bruise on his chin Saturday, but presided over a ceremony to install new cardinals without apparent problems. A Vatican spokesman said later Saturday that the bruise was caused by a contusion on Friday morning, when Francis hit a night stand with his chin. The pontiff, who turns 88 later this month, appeared slightly fatigued, but carried on as normal with the scheduled ceremony to create 21 new cardinals in St. Peter's Basilica. Francis has suffered several health problems in recent years and now uses a wheelchair due to knee and back pain. In 2017, while on a trip to Colombia, Francis sported a black eye after he hit his head on a support bar when his popemobile stopped short.	https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-bruise-chin-health-cardinals-consistory-a4329e36f9e36809511f0b461155b396	2024-12-07T07:46:07-08:00	
The Latest: The famed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris reopens to great fanfare	PARIS (AP) — Notre Dame is reopening its doors for the first time since a fire in 2019 nearly destroyed Paris' beloved 12th-century cathedral. World leaders — including President-elect Donald Trump, America’s first lady Jill Biden, Britain’s Prince William and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — gathered Saturday among more than 2,500 guests to celebrate the restoration of the landmark widely considered to be a pinnacle of French architectural heritage. Saturday's events started with Archbishop Laurent Ulrich symbolically reopening Notre Dame’s grand wooden doors with three resounding knocks. Following the 2019 fire, nearly $1 billion in donations poured in from around the world, a tribute to its worldwide appeal. For more of AP’s coverage on Notre Dame, visit https://apnews.com/hub/notre-dame-cathedral ___ Here's the latest: Macron welcomes Trump to Paris with presidential pomp, includes him in talks with Zelenskyy French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Donald Trump to Paris on Saturday with a full a dose of presidential pomp as the two held a hastily arranged meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy before the grand reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. The once and future American president was warmly embraced by Macron upon arriving at the Elysee Palace. 'It’s a great honor for French people to welcome you five years later,' Macron told Trump. 'Welcome back again.' Trump said it was a 'very great honor' to be there, while hinting at challenges ahead. 'It certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now. And we’ll be talking about that.' An actual red carpet was rolled out for Trump as Macron bestowed the kind of full diplomatic welcome that France offers sitting American presidents, complete with trumpets blaring and members of the Republican Guard in full uniform. It was a clear sign that even though Trump doesn’t take office until Jan. 20, 2025, Macron and other European leaders are already working to win his favor and treating him as America’s representative on the world stage. President Joe Biden declined an invitation to attend the Notre Dame ceremony, marking five years after a devastating fire, and first lady Jill Biden was the official U.S. representative. The White House cited a scheduling conflict. Macron and leaders across Europe are trying to persuade the president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion. Macron’s office said the war, along with conflicts in the Mideast, would be discussed. Great organ of Notre Dame fills reborn cathedral with awesome sound With a first deep rumble like a grumbling giant, the great organ of Notre Dame has awakened from its more than 5-year silence, its awesome sound once again filling the reborn cathedral. Archbishop Laurent Ulrich roused it from its long sleep, intoning the words 'wake up, organ, sacred instrument.' To which the gargantuan organ, perched high above the congregation, responded with a low rumble, like a dragon clearing its throat. Then, the four organists who took turns formulating improvised responses to the archbishop’s prompts literally pulled out the stops and let rip. Eight times, the archbishop addressed the instrument. Eight times, it responded with a symphony of notes and sounds — as though rediscovering and relearning the joy and power from its nearly 8,000 pipes. Macron praises the bravery of fire fighters Macron praised the bravery of fire fighters and recalled how, at 10:47 p.m. on the night of April 15, 2019, the first message came through saying that the inferno was being beaten. 'Notre Dame of Paris was saved. Disfigured but saved,' he said. Moving onto the rebuilding effort, he detailed the toil of the more than 2,000 workers and artisans who worked to a 5-year reconstruction deadline set by Macron. 'We decided to rebuild Notre Dame of Paris even more beautiful than before.' Macron delivered the entire speech in French despite the multinational mix of VIP guests. At the end, Trump and Macron shook hands. Macron expresses ‘gratitude’ to those who saved, helped and rebuilt Notre Dame Cathedral French President Emmanuel Macron expressed 'gratitude' Saturday to those who saved, helped and rebuilt Notre Dame Cathedral. 'I stand before you ... to express the gratitude of the French nation,' Macron said at the reopening ceremony. 'Tonight, the bells of Notre Dame are ringing again. And in a moment, the organ will awaken,' sending the 'music of hope' to Parisians, France and the world. Macron spoke in front of more than 2,500 guests invited to celebrate the restoration of Paris’ 12th-century cathedral which was nearly destroyed by a fire in 2019. They included world leaders like President-elect Donald Trump, U.S. first lady Jill Biden, Britain’s Prince William and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Guests give standing ovation after short film documenting the rebuilding efforts Notre Dame echoed to the sound of a sustained standing ovation after the showing of a short movie that documented the gargantuan rebuilding effort by thousands of workers who labored — and ultimately met — a 5-year deadline set by French President Emmanuel Macron in the aftermath of the blaze. Outside, the word 'MERCI' — thank you — was projected against the cathedral’s iconic western facade in multiple languages. The movie showed the terrible wounds left by the inferno — the gaping holes torn into its vaulted ceilings and the burned roof. But that was followed by images of all types of artisans, many using traditional hand-craft techniques, who collectively restored Notre Dame to look better now than ever. 'We went from night to light,' said one of the workers in the movie. Notre Dame's largest bell, the 13-ton Emmanuel, rings out The congregation inside the huge cathedral was ghostly quiet as its largest bell, the 13-ton Emmanuel, rang out into the Paris night, signaling the start of the ceremony. Inside, Elon Musk gazed up at the renovated vaulted ceilings. Jill Biden was the last VIP welcomed outside by President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, before Archbishop Laurent Ulrich then took over. 'Brothers and sisters, let us enter now into Notre Dame,' he said as he stood outside, before its closed doors. 'It is she who accompanies us on our path to peace.' He then banged on the door three times with the base of his crosier, or bishop’s cross. Inside, the choir erupted into song, the crystalline voices filing what — until recently — had been a building site. Three times, Ulrich appealed to the cathedral to open its doors. Three times, the choir responded in song. He then pushed open the heavy door: Notre Dame’s rebirth was underway. Archibishop Laurent Ulrich knocks three times on Notre Dame's doors, officially marking cathedral's reopening With three resounding knocks on its doors by Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich, wielding a staff carved from fire-scorched beams, the cathedral roared back to life Saturday evening. For the first time since a devastating 2019 blaze, the towering Gothic masterpiece reopened for worship, its rebirth marked by song, prayer, and awe beneath its soaring arches. While the ceremony was initially planned to begin on the forecourt, unusually fierce December winds whipping across the central Paris island, flanked by the River Seine, forced all events inside. Yet the occasion lost none of its splendor. Inside the luminous nave, choirs are singing psalms, and the cathedral’s mighty organ, silent for nearly five years, is thundering to life in a triumphant interplay of melodies. The evening’s celebration, being attended by more than 2,500 guests and dignitaries, including President-elect Donald Trump, U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, Britain’s Prince William, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, underscores Notre Dame’s enduring role as both a spiritual and cultural beacon. Groups gather in Paris to protest Trump A small group of American expats gathered near Notre Dame Cathedral on Saturday to protest the presence of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at the reopening ceremony. Organized under the banner 'Paris Against Trump,' the group criticized French President Emmanuel Macron for inviting Trump but chose not to organize a large demonstration to avoid disrupting the event. 'We find this a bit shameful and sad that Trump is invited here, especially since he has gone against everything the Church stands for,' said Ehlyr O’Rourke, 34, a spokesperson for the association. 'We don’t understand why a criminal, a sex offender, a felon can actually be invited in here.' Later in the day, thousands marched through Paris, denouncing Trump’s visit and expressing support for Palestine. Organized by left-wing parties, unions, and pro-Palestinian groups, the demonstration featured Palestinian flags, keffiyehs, and chants calling for Palestinian resistance, President Macron’s impeachment, and criticizing Trump’s alleged complicity in Middle East conflicts. 'We are protesting every week to support Palestine, but what’s special today is the arrival of Donald Trump,' said Nadia Messai, one of the protesters in the crowd. 'Trump has been supporting Israel, much like the United States has been since the beginning of the creation of this rogue state that is occupying Palestine illegally.' Cathedral's renovation chief hopes the reopening is a moment of unity Philippe Jost, Notre Dame cathedral renovation chief, said the reopening is an opportunity for unity as so many divisions remain in the world. 'We hope it will be a great moment of unity for the French people, for guests from all over the world and for spectators from all over the world,' he said. 'Notre Dame de Paris unites. There are so many divisive factors. An event like this must unite, must help concord and peace to grow throughout the world.' Notre Dame's rector emphasizes the importance of the separation of church and state rector of Notre Dame and chief of the reconstruction project: (credit to Mark Carlson) Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, the Notre Dame rector called the reopening an important moment that has been awaited a long time. 'Notre Dame de Paris is the very sign of the presence of a soul in the heart of our city. It’s important for Parisians, it’s important for Catholics, it’s important for the French and for the whole world,' he said. 'In general, the sphere of politics doesn’t enter the sphere of the religious, and shouldn’t. In the same way, the religious sphere doesn’t enter politics,' he added. 'The Archbishop of Paris invited the President of the Republic to speak inside the cathedral as a sign of the unity that could be seen in the reconstruction. The archbishop allowed him to speak inside because the weather conditions did not allow him to speak outside.' Guests file into Notre Dame Cathedral for the ceremonies Guests gradually filing the cathedral for the evening reopening ceremonies are reveling at the renovated interiors, with many whipping out cell phones to take souvenir photos. 'It’s a sense of perfection,' said François Le Page, who works for the Notre Dame foundation that raised nearly half of the nearly 900 million euros of donations. He last set foot in the cathedral in 2021, on a visit 'It’s night and day,' said Rev. Andriy Morkvas, a Ukrainian pastor who leads the The Cathedral of Saint Volodymyr the Great church in Paris’ St. Germain des Pres said it had been 10 years since he last stepped foot inside Notre Dame. 'God is very powerful, he can change things.' He expressed hope that the cathedral could help bring peace to his country and he drew heart from the expected attendance of Ukraine’s president. 'I hope Notre Dame and Mary will help us resolve this conflict,' he said. French government security agents are helping to ensure Trump's safety alongside the Secret Service Outside the Elysee Palace, the official residence of the French president, dozens of members of the French Republican Guard stood by awaiting Donald Trump’s arrival. Trump was in Paris on Saturday for his first international trip as president-elect, ready to join world leaders celebrating the renovation of Notre Dame Cathedral and meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s Prince William. More than 20 French government security agents have been helping ensure Trump’s safety alongside the Secret Service, according to French national police. A special French police van was providing anti-drone protection for Trump’s convoy. Security was tighter than usual outside the U.S. Embassy and other sites around Paris for the Notre Dame reopening, where dozens of international VIPs were expected. Macron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made a point of cultivating a relationship since the Republican defeated Democrat Kamala Harris last month. But Macron’s office nonetheless played down the significance of the invitation, saying other politicians not now in office had been invited as well. Trump was invited as president-elect of a 'friendly nation,' Macron’s office said, adding, 'This is in no way exceptional, we’ve done it before.' Notre Dame in numbers Perhaps not surprisingly for such a big cathedral, some of the numbers that help tell the story of Notre Dame’s reopening are on the very big side, too. The bell that will sound to signal the start of the service weighs 13 tons, making it the cathedral’s largest. It has a name - Emmanuel – given to it by King Louis XIV after it was cast in 1683. It rings in F sharp. Inside, 42,000 square meters of stonework were cleaned during the renovation — an area equivalent to roughly six soccer pitches. The first stone of Notre Dame was laid in 1163. The thunderous great organ of Notre Dame that will be heard in public at Saturday’s service for the first time since April 15, 2019, has 7,952 pipes — the largest as broad as a human torso; the smallest no larger than a pen. The renovated giant console that controls the instrument has five keyboards of 56 notes each, foot pedals for 30 notes, and 115 stops. Unseen, above the congregation and the repaired vaulted ceilings, is a framework of beams holding up the roof and spire – so dense and intricate that it’s nicknamed 'the forest.' Some 2,000 oak trees were felled to rebuild it. Trump to meet with Macron ahead of the reopening ceremonies President-elect Donald Trump is to meet Saturday with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee presidential palace ahead of the reopening ceremony for Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. This is Trump’s first foreign trip since the election. Macron’s office said both leaders will discuss global crisis, including wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine as well as French-American bilateral relations. Macron is scheduled to have a meeting with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy right after his meeting with Trump. Notre Dame celebrations comes as Macron’s presidency now faces its gravest crisis after the government’s collapse this week in a historic no-confidence vote that toppled Prime Minister Michel Barnier. Devout Catholics say the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening will ‘nourish us’ For devout Catholics Patricia and Cyrille Brenner, waiting in the cold outside Notre Dame for its reopening service that they weren’t invited to was the place to be. The couple traveled by night train from Cannes on the French Riviera – famous for its movie festival – to be among the onlookers Saturday hoping for some of the 40,000 spots set aside for the public on the banks of the River Seine facing the cathedral. They bought their train tickets six months ago. 'I’m from Cannes. It’s a bit like the festival. You have to be there to experience it,' said Patricia, 65. 'It’s a pilgrimage for us.' Cyrille, 66, said they were the only members of their parish to make the long trip. 'We like to be at the heart of things and, as Christians, it will nourish us,' he said. While Cyrille said they’d felt 'distress, sadness' when Notre Dame burned, they both also noted how sacred relics, statues and the golden cross on the altar – almost miraculously – survived the inferno. They both marveled at the renovation works that have not only eradicated nearly all traces of the fire inside but made it more resplendent than ever. Some visitors hope talks on the sidelines will be good for Ukraine Andrey Alexeev, a Ukrainian among onlookers gathering for the reopening of Notre Dame, hopes U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy can meet and talk on the ceremony’s sidelines. Their host, French President Emmanuel Macron, was meeting with both leaders before they attend the reopening service for the cathedral. Alexeev was hoping Trump and Zelenskyy would meet, too. 'I hope that meeting can change something in a good way for Ukraine,' he said. 'It’s good that Zelenskyy has a chance to speak with Trump and Macron. At least it’s an opportunity for Ukraine.' Alexeev, who lives in Poland, was visiting Paris with his mother, Olha, who travelled from Ukraine. They were hoping for two of the 40,000 places that were set aside for the public in fenced-off areas on the banks of the River Seine, facing the cathedral. Alexeev said he’s agnostic but that it felt important for him to be as close to the ceremonies as possible. By coincidence, his sister was visiting Paris when Notre Dame burned on April 15, 2019. 'It’s one of the greatest places not only in Europe but also the whole world,' he said. Such an occasion 'happens once in 1,000 years, I think. So we are part of history.' What to expect Saturday’s events will blend solemn religious tradition with an official presidential speech and cultural grandeur. French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte will welcome the dozens of heads of state and government. Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will then take over — with a rite to symbolically reopen Notre Dame’s doors, kicking off the ceremonies at 7 p.m. The ceremony that was to have been held outside will then unfold inside, with a film retracing the renovations, music and a speech by Macron. Ulrich will then take over again, with a rite to reawaken Notre Dame’s organ and the rest of the religious service scheduled to last about 55 minutes. Notre Dame reopening falls victim to bad weather PARIS — After more than 5 years of renovation, the reopening of Notre Dame — like the Paris Olympics before it — has fallen victim to bad weather. Forecasted strong winds have upended the running order of the reopening ceremonies on Saturday evening, and forced the whole thing indoors. The original plan was for an initial outdoor state ceremony led by President Emmanuel Macron, after which Archbishop Laurent Ulrich was to have taken over, leading rites and a religious service inside the cathedral. Those plans would have emphasized France’s carefully policed divide between state and church. But expected stormy winds prompted the Paris diocese and Macron’s office to telescope the ceremonies together, now all to be held inside the cathedral. It’s the second time this year that weather has intervened in significant moments for Paris. Rains drenched the July 26 opening ceremony of the Summer Games, dampening the show and the spirits of some spectators.	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-paris-latest-e50813cf016f08607c20ab115bc4b153	2024-12-07T05:12:28-08:00	
La Scala's gala premiere is a Verdi opera with a reputation for bringing bad luck	MILAN (AP) — Milan’s storied Teatro alla Scala presents Giuseppe Verdi’s 'La Forza del Destino' for its gala season premiere Saturday for the first time in 59 years, seeking to shake the opera's reputation for bringing bad luck. The premiere is a highlight of the Milan cultural calendar, attracting top figures from the world of politics, business and the arts, although this year, both President Sergio Mattarella and Premier Giorgia Meloni have chosen instead to attend ceremonies marking the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Russian soprano Anna Netrebk o sings the role of Leonora to American tenor Brian Jagde's Don Alvaro. Jagde was brought in on short notice to substitute for German tenor Jonas Kaufmann, who dropped out for family reasons. It is Jagde’s fourth time singing the role of Don Alvaro this year alone, and his third La Scala performance — he was previously twice brought in as a substitute alongside Netrebko in 'Turandot.' Netrebko called the score of 'La Forza del Destino' a 'masterpiece,' but confessed that she could not identify with her character, Leonora, ’’as a woman of the 21st century.' 'If you are looking at the story, it is basically nonsense, sorry,' she told a recent press conference. 'If we are being serious and trying to follow the story, and try to understand, especially the character of Leonora, hunted by fear, guilt, desperation, and in the end what did she find?' The opera is an ill-fated love story between Don Alvaro and Leonora set against the background of a world on the brink of apocalypse, which has resonance in current global turbulence. There was also a pro-Palestinian protest in the center of Milan just ahead of the VIP arrivals at La Scala. Unions also traditionally protest the lavish event in the piazza opposite the opera house. Verdi’s opera has been long dogged by superstition that it brings bad luck, so much so that some in Italy will not say the full title aloud. It’s a reputation that the staging director of the La Scala production hopes to shake once and for all. 'We will be the catalyzers of good luck,’’ Leo Muscato told Corriere della Sera, adding that every production has its 'accidents.'	https://apnews.com/article/italy-la-scala-gala-season-premiere-58870d7d530c711a68f87a350fbcdeb4	2024-12-07T05:08:38-08:00	
Storm Darragh batters UK and Ireland, leaving 1 dead and hundreds of thousands without power	LONDON (AP) — A man died and hundreds of thousands of people in Britain and Ireland were left without power Saturday as high winds and heavy rain battered the region. Gusts of up to 93 miles per hour were recorded as officials sent a rare emergency alert by phone to about 3 million households in Wales and southwest England early Saturday. The official alert, which came with a loud siren-like sound, warned people to stay indoors and was sent to every compatible mobile phone in the areas impacted by Storm Darragh. In northwest England, a man in his 40s died when a tree fell onto his van while he was driving on a highway near Preston, about 36 miles (58 kilometers) north of Manchester. On Friday the U.K.'s weather forecasters, the Met Office, issued a red weather warning — the most serious type. Thousands of homes, many in Northern Ireland, Wales and western England, were left without power overnight. Major highways and bridges across the country were closed because of strong winds, and multiple train services were suspended. In Ireland, almost 400,000 homes, farms or businesses were without power as a result of the storm. Some flights at Dublin Airport were cancelled.	https://apnews.com/article/storm-darragh-britain-ireland-wind-rain-wales-f9d74be4f3516eea499033aaf0f4f0d1	2024-12-07T04:43:18-08:00	
Analysis: At dueling Mideast forums, officials ask what will happen when Donald Trump takes office	MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) — At glittering ballrooms in the Mideast this weekend, discussions of the wars and chaos gripping the region gave way to one central question: What's going to happen when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month? Summits in both Bahrain and Qatar, neighboring Persian Gulf autocracies with a long history of a brothers' rivalry, saw Trump discussed in open sessions, hushed chatter and pull-aside meetings among politicians, diplomats and uniformed military officers. The reasons for the conversations are many. Chief among them is the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, with over 44,000 Palestinians killed, and the tenuous ceasefire holding in Lebanon. Israel's conduct in the wars, sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage, enraged the wider Arab world. President Joe Biden's tight embrace of Israel in the time since has alienated many. Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal, a prominent royal who led the kingdom's intelligence service for more than two decades and served as ambassador to the U.S. and Britain, referred directly to Trump's own online messages about the wars. 'Friendly countries in the region are hoping that Mr. Trump pursues what he started before — to bring PEACE with capital letters to the Middle East,' the prince told the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Manama Dialogue in Bahrain. 'The Gulf countries, including my country, Saudi Arabia, are willing to walk with you, Mr. President, to achieve this noble order. It is time for America under your presidency to change the course of this troubled region.' Prince Turki underlined the standard Saudi call for a peace that requires a two-state solution for the decadeslong Israeli-Palestinian crisis to end, with a Palestinian capital in east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip and the West Bank based on 1967 borders fully under Palestinian control. But Trump in 2020 in his first term unveiled a peace plan that sided heavily with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-line nationalist vision for the region and pushed aside many of the Palestinians’ core demands. Biden's administration, meanwhile, made no headway on the conflict prior to the Hamas attack. Barbara A. Leaf, the top Mideast official at the U.S. State Department, described the Hamas assault as having 'plunged the region into renewed conflict' in brief remarks at a side event in Bahrain. At the Doha Forum in Qatar, Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide referred to the Mideast before the Oct. 7 attack as 'not a stable, lasting situation — it was like a minefield.' Despite that, Trump's experience reaching diplomatic recognition deals for Israel with both Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates might make a larger Mideast peace deal possible, Barth Eide said. 'I think the message now from this region is that that is perfectly doable. There might actually be a major deal, but it has to happen with Palestine,' he said. 'It’s not one conflict, but there is a root conflict that connects to all of them, which is the absence of a solution to the Palestinian question.' That extends all the way to Yemen, where the Houthi rebels who have held the country's capital for over a decade now have gained acclaim in the Arab world for their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the wars. Trump listed the Houthis as a foreign terrorist group, something rescinded by the Biden administration over their assessment it halted needed aid from getting into Yemen. 'I think in Yemen the upcoming Trump administration is most likely implement heavy sanctions,' said analyst Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert. 'That may push the Houthis to retaliate. ... The idea that (sanctions) alone will pressure the Houthis to commit to peace and cease fire in the Red Sea — I don't think that will happen.' Then there's Iran's nuclear program, which the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Friday in Bahrain was poised to 'quite dramatically' increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium. Yet Iranian officials and the public have been openly musing whether Trump might strike a deal with Iran — even as he was the one who unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that saw it get sanctions relief in exchange for greatly limiting its program. And finally, there's the Gulf states themselves. Some attendees at the two summits discussed their flight plans for trying to attend both. That would have been impossible during the yearslong Qatar crisis, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE cut ties and boycott Qatar from 2017 until January 2021. The crisis began after Trump's first foreign trip as president to Saudi Arabia. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — Jon Gambrell, the news director for the Gulf and Iran for The Associated Press, has reported from each of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Iran and other locations across the Mideast and wider world since joining the AP in 2006. ___ The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation.

6 Pakistani security personnel killed in a checkpoint attack	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Armed men killed six Pakistani security personnel and wounded seven in a checkpoint attack in the country’s northwest, a police official said Saturday. The assault happened in Kurram district, where fierce sectarian fighting has killed at least 130 people during the past few weeks. A ceasefire between the area’s Sunni and Shiite communities is holding and Saturday’s incident is not connected to the recent clashes. Local official Saleem Khan said armed men attacked a Frontier Corps checkpoint in Bagam, 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Peshawar city. The wounded were taken to a military hospital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Also Saturday, an intelligence official said an operation against the Pakistani Taliban in Tank district had killed 20 militants in the past 24 hours. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. Among the dead is a commander, the official said. The militants who were killed were involved in attacks on security forces, extortion and the targeted killings of civilians, the official said. Kurram and Tank are both in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-kurram-checkpoint-attack-taliban-e784f6cd506841decc0b8367ad4bb03f	2024-12-07T02:50:25-08:00	
Syrian troops withdraw from the south of the country as they rush to defend Homs	BEIRUT (AP) — The Syrian army withdrew from much of southern Syria on Saturday, leaving more areas of the country, including two provincial capitals, under the control of opposition fighters, the military and an opposition war monitor said. The redeployment away from the provinces of Daraa and Sweida came as Syria’s military sent large numbers of reinforcements to defend the key central city of Homs, Syria’s third largest, as insurgents approached its outskirts. The rapid advances by insurgents is a stunning reversal of fortunes for Syria's President Bashar Assad, who appears to be largely on his own, with erstwhile allies preoccupied with other conflicts. His chief international backer, Russia, is busy with its war in Ukraine, and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up his forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran, meanwhile, has seen its proxies across the region degraded by Israeli regular airstrikes. Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Syria war monitor, reported Saturday that Iran’s military advisers have started leaving Syria. He added that Iran-backed fighters in eastern Syria, mainly from Afghanistan and Pakistan, have withdrawn into central Syria. The shock offensive began Nov. 27 led by the jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, during which gunmen captured the northern city of Aleppo, Syria’s largest, and the central city of Hama, the country’s fourth largest city. The group has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday from Syria that the aim of the offensive is to overthrow Assad’s government. The Britain-based Observatory said Syrian troops have withdrawn from much of the two southern provinces and are sending reinforcements to Homs, where a battle is looming. If the insurgents capture Homs, they would cut the link between Damascus, Assad’s seat of power, and the coastal region where the president enjoys wide support. The Syrian army said in a statement Saturday that it has carried out redeployment and repositioning in Sweida and Daraa after its checkpoints came under attack by 'terrorists.' The army said it is setting up a 'strong and coherent defensive and security belt in the area,' apparently to defend Damascus from the south. Since Syria’s conflict broke out in March 2011, the Syrian government has been referring to opposition gunmen as terrorists. In the gas-rich nation of Qatar, the foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkey were scheduled to meet to discuss the situation in Syria. Turkey is a main backer of the rebels seeking to overthrow Assad. Qatar's top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, criticized Assad for failing to take advantage of the lull in fighting in recent years to address the country’s underlying problems. 'Assad didn’t seize this opportunity to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people,' he said. Sheikh Mohammed said he was surprised by how quickly the rebels have advanced and said there is a real threat to Syria’s 'territorial integrity.' He said the war could 'damage and destroy what is left if there is no sense of urgency' to start a political process. After the fall of the cities of Daraa and Sweida early Saturday, Syrian government forces remain in control of five provincial capitals — Damascus, Homs and Quneitra, as well as Latakia and Tartus on the Mediterranean cost. Tartus is home to the only Russian naval base outside the former Soviet Union while Latakia is home to a major Russian air base. On Friday, U.S.-backed fighters of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces captured wide parts of the eastern province of Deir el-Zour that borders Iraq as well as the provincial capital that carries the same name. The capture of areas in Deir el-Zour is a blow to Iran’s influence in the region as the area is the gateway to the corridor linking the Mediterranean to Iran, a supply line for Iran-backed fighters, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah. With the capture of a main border crossing with Iraq by the SDF and after opposition fighters took control of the Naseeb border crossing to Jordan in southern Syria, the Syrian government's only gateway to the outside world is the Masnaa border crossing with Lebanon. ____ Associated Press writers Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria and Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-sweida-daraa-homs-hts-qatar-7f65823bbf0a7bd331109e8dff419430	2024-12-07T02:08:16-08:00	
Ukraine confirms second Danish delivery of F-16s as Zelenskyy seeks support in Paris	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Denmark has delivered a second batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday as he traveled to Paris to meet with top politicians and dignitaries. In a message on Telegram, Zelenskyy praised Denmark and lamented a lack of dedication from other allies. 'The first batch of planes provided by the Danes are already shooting down Russian missiles: rescuing our people and our infrastructure. Now our air shield is reinforced even further,' he said. 'If all partners were so determined, we would have been able to make Russian terror impossible.' The announcement comes as Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region marks a day of mourning for 10 people killed in a Russian attack on Friday. A further 24 people, including two children, were injured when a missile struck a local service station, said regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov. Another three people were killed in a strike on the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih Friday, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. Addressing the attacks, Zelenskyy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not seek 'real peace.' Putin 'only seeks the ability to treat any country this way, with bombs, missiles, and all other forms of violence,' Zelenskyy said. 'Only through strength can we resist this. And only through strength can real peace be established.' Zelenskyy is due to meet other world leaders Saturday, including French President Emmanuel Macron, at an event in Paris celebrating the renovation of Notre Dame Cathedral after a devastating fire in 2019. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is among those expected to be in attendance, with European leaders keen to cultivate the incoming leader's favor to persuade him to maintain support for Ukraine against Russia’s three-year invasion. It’s not clear whether Trump will meet Zelenskyy. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-f16-denmark-86c2d6631869cc8f5217482e22bf52d8	2024-12-07T01:48:06-08:00	
An explosion has caused several injuries and damaged apartments in a Dutch city	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — An explosion and fire rocked a neighborhood in the Dutch city of The Hague early Saturday, destroying several apartments and injuring multiple people, according to authorities. The cause of the disaster is unclear, but police said they are looking for a car seen leaving the scene. Emergency authorities said four people have been rescued from the rubble and taken to the hospital, but could not say how many people may still be under the rubble. Local media reported that one of those hospitalized was a child. A line of ambulances could be seen waiting nearby in anticipation of more victims. The spokesperson for the local hospital said that they were on standby to deal with injuries. Residents of the northeastern neighborhood of Mariahoeve in The Hague heard a huge bang and screams before dawn. One woman told local media that she thought an earthquake had happened. Dutch authorities deployed a specialized urban search and rescue team to the scene, with four dogs trained to find victims. The team was previously used during the devastating earthquake in Turkey in 2023. Prime Minister Dick Schoof said in a statement he was shocked by the images of the disaster. 'My thoughts go out to the victims, all other people involved and the emergency services who are now working on the scene,' he said. The Dutch royal family expressed similar sentiments. 'Our thoughts are with those affected in The Hague after the explosion and fire this morning,'' including those 'who are afraid of the fate of their loved ones,' King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-hague-explosion-54f06b68677dcfda4ee7af75deed4947	2024-12-07T00:50:14-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes continue in Gaza and neighbors close their borders with Syria	Palestinian officials say at least 29 people were killed, including four medical staff, when Israeli strikes pummeled the area around one of the last remaining hospitals in northern Gaza. Elsewhere in the region, Lebanon said it is closing all its land border crossings with Syria except for a main one that links Beirut with the Syrian capital, Damascus. Jordan also closed a border crossing with Syria because of the security situation on the Syrian side. Syrian insurgents have entered the central towns of Rastan and Talbiseh, just north of the central city of Homs, bringing them closer to Syria’s third largest city. A day earlier, jihadi-led opposition fighters captured the central city of Hama, Syria’s fourth largest. Israel's war against Hamas has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel in October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Israel’s blistering retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,600 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the Latest: Syrian army withdraws from much of southern Syria BEIRUT — The Syrian army withdrew from much of southern Syria on Saturday, leaving more areas of the country, including two provincial capitals, under the control of opposition fighters, the military and an opposition war monitor said. The redeployment away from the provinces of Daraa and Sweida came as Syria’s military sent large numbers of reinforcements to defend the key central city of Homs, Syria’s third largest, as insurgents approached its outskirts. The rapid advances by insurgents are a stunning reversal of fortunes for Syria’s President Bashar Assad, who appears to be largely on his own, with erstwhile allies preoccupied with other conflicts. His chief international backer, Russia, is busy with its war in Ukraine, and Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up his forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran, meanwhile, has seen its proxies across the region degraded by Israeli regular airstrikes. Israel kills Palestinian man who attacked security forces at border crossing JERUSALEM — Israeli security forces killed a Palestinian man after he attacked them at a border crossing in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Saturday morning, police said. The man shot firecrackers at security forces at the checkpoint and threatened them with a knife, the police statement said. The man wore a t-shirt emblazoned with a symbol of the Islamic State militant group, according to an Associated Press reporter Israeli fire has killed at least 700 Palestinians in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war began last year, Palestinian health officials said. In that time, Palestinian militants have launched a number of attacks on soldiers at checkpoints and within Israel. Qatari prime minister sees movement in Gaza ceasefire negotiations DOHA, Qatar — The prime minister of Qatar says he has seen new momentum in Gaza ceasefire efforts since the U.S. presidential election, with the incoming Trump administration seeking an end to the conflict before it takes office. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, a key mediator in the ceasefire efforts, declined to give specifics of the negotiations but told an international conference in Doha that the gaps between the sides are not large. Qatar, which has served as a mediator throughout the 14-month war, suspended its efforts last month in frustration over the lack of progress. But Sheikh Mohammed said his government has re-engaged in recent days after determining a new willingness by both parties to reach a deal. ’We have sensed after the election that the momentum is coming back,' he told the Doha Forum on Saturday. He said has been in touch with both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration and found that while there are some differences in approach, both are committed to the same goal of ending the war. ’We have seen a lot of encouragement from the incoming administration in order to achieve a deal, even before the president comes to the office,' Sheikh Mohammed said. He declined to discuss details, saying he wanted to 'protect the process,' but expressed hope for a deal 'as soon as possible.' ’If you look at the gaps and the disagreements, they are not something substantial that really affects the agreement,' he said. Israeli strikes kill at least 29 at hard-hit Gaza hospital CAIRO — At least 29 people were killed, including four medical staff, when Israeli strikes pummeled the area around one of the last remaining hospitals in northern Gaza, Palestinian officials said. The situation in and around the Kamal Adwan hospital is 'catastrophic,' according to Dr. Hussam Abu Safia, the director of the hospital. The dead included five children and five women, according to the hospital casualty list, which was obtained by The Associated Press. Friday’s strikes also wounded 55 people including six children and the five women, according to the hospital. Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya is one of the few hospitals still partially operating in the Gaza’s northernmost province, where Israeli forces are pressing an offensive that has almost completely sealed off the area from humanitarian aid for two months. Israel’s military denied that its forces had struck the hospital or operated inside it. The army said that in the past few weeks, 'coordinated efforts with international organizations have been underway in order to transfer patients, companions, and medical staff to other hospitals.' An Indonesian medical team which had been assisting in Kamal Adwan for the past week was forced to evacuate on foot after the area was surrounded by Israeli soldiers, according to a statement from the team. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the medical team’s expulsion. Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization representative in the Palestinian territories, said an Israeli tank approached the hospital at around 4 a.m. Friday. Although no official Israeli evacuation order was issued, 'people started to climb the wall to escape, and this panic attracted IDF (Israeli) fire,' he said. He spoke by video from Gaza to journalists in Geneva. Kamal Adwan Hospital has been struck multiple times over the past two months since Israel launched a fierce military operation in northern Gaza against Hamas militants. In October, Israeli forces raided the hospital, saying that militants were sheltering inside and arrested a number of people, including some staff. Hospital officials denied the claim. Saudi Arabia calls for and end to Gaza war and attacks Israel's actions MANAMA, Bahrain — Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister has reiterated the kingdom’s call for an end to the war in the Gaza Strip. Prince Faisal bin Farhan described Israel as acting with 'impunity and is getting away without punishment' in its war on Hamas there. The prince said that any permanent solution requires a two-state solution, with the Palestinians having east Jerusalem as their capital. After the speech, Prince Turki al-Faisal, a prominent royal in the kingdom who led Saudi intelligence for more than two decades and served as ambassador to the U.S. and Britain, took the stage. He harshly criticized Israel’s conduct in the wars. 'Israel has become an apartheid, colonial and genocidal state,' Prince Turki said. 'It is about time for the world to address that issue and take the necessary steps to bring those who are thus charged by the International Criminal Court to justice.' Israeli officials could not be immediately reached for comment on Prince Turki’s remarks. The Saudis spoke at the International Institute for Security Studies’ Manama Dialogue in Bahrain.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-lebanon-news-7-december-2024-53419e23991cfc14a7857c82f49eb26f	2024-12-06T23:25:49-08:00	
Notre Dame reopens its doors to Macron and other world leaders in a rare symbol of unity	PARIS (AP) — France's iconic Notre Dame Cathedral is formally reopening its doors on Saturday for the first time since a devastating fire nearly destroyed the 861-year-old landmark in 2019. The restoration, a spectacular achievement in just five years for a structure that took nearly two centuries to build, is seen as a moment of triumph for French President Emmanuel Macron, who championed the ambitious timeline — and a welcome respite from his domestic political woes. Under the luminous stained glass, many world leaders, dignitaries, and worshippers will gather in the evening to mark the occasion — a rare moment of unity against the backdrop of global divisions and conflicts. President-elect Donald Trump, America's first lady Jill Biden, Britain's Prince William and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are among 1,500 guests attending the reopening celebration under Notre Dame’s soaring Gothic arches, led by Archbishop Laurent Ulrich. Because of strong winds forecast for Saturday evening in Paris, the French presidential palace and the Paris diocese said Friday the entire opening ceremony will be held inside Notre Dame, instead of starting from the cathedral’s forecourt as initially planned. A sign of hope Notre Dame’s rector, Rev. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, says the cathedral is 'more than just a French monument' and a beloved treasure of world's cultural heritage. 'The cathedral is a magnificent symbol of unity,' the rector said. 'A sign of hope, because what seemed impossible has become possible.' Saturday’s events will blend solemn religious tradition with an official presidential speech and cultural grandeur, starting with Ulrich symbolically reopening Notre Dame’s grand wooden doors. Tapping them three times with a staff crafted from charred wood salvaged from the cathedral’s fire-ravaged roof, he will declare the cathedral open for worship once more. Huguette Euphrasie’s 79-year-old mother, Marie-Yolande, is battling cancer. So as she stared intently up at Notre Dame’s towers, the daughter appealed Saturday to the cathedral for help, with a prayer on the day of the monument’s reopening. 'It has huge spiritual value for me,' Euphrasie said, gathering with people from around the world to watch the reopening from screens on nearby riverbanks. 'It's very moving.' Solemn rituals Psalms, prayers, and hymns will fill the cavernous space as the cathedral’s thunderous organ, silenced since the fire, is reawakened. The 8,000-pipe instrument, painstakingly restored and cleaned of toxic lead dust, will respond to the archbishop’s invocation, with four organists performing an improvised interplay of melodies. Later in the evening, a star-studded concert will take center stage inside the cathedral and pay tribute to its resurrection and to those who labored to restore it, offering a universal message of harmony. Pianist Lang Lang, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and soprano Pretty Yende are among the world-famous artists slated to perform. On Sunday, Ulrich will lead the inaugural Mass and consecrate the cathedral’s new altar, designed by contemporary artist Guillaume Bardet to replace the one crushed beneath the flaming spire in the blaze. Unity in times of global challenges The reopening of Notre Dame comes at a time of profound global unrest, with wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East. For Catholics, Notre Dame's rector said the cathedral 'carries the enveloping presence of the Virgin Mary, a maternal and embracing presence.'' 'It is a magnificent symbol of unity,' Dumas said. The range of dignitaries coming to Paris from Africa to the Mideast and the U.S. underline the cathedral's significance as a symbol of shared heritage and peace. Macron's political woes The celebration is expected to give a much-needed boost to embattled Macron, whose prime minister was ousted this week, plunging the nation’s political scene into more turmoil. The French president, who has called Notre Dame's reopening 'a jolt of hope,' will address the gathering. He had hoped the occasion would briefly silence his critics and showcase France’s unity and resilience under his leadership, and the achievement of restoring Notre Dame in just five years — a timeline that had seemed improbable to many. Macron's presidency now faces its gravest crisis after the government's collapse this week in a historic no-confidence vote that toppled Prime Minister Michel Barnier. The vote followed months of political gridlock after snap elections. Calls are now growing louder from opposition forces for Macron to resign. But he vowed Thursday to remain in office until the end of his term in 2027, and said he'll name a new prime minister within days. As France struggles with economic woes and social unrest, Notre Dame's rebirth celebrations form a stark contrast to the crisis. Security is tight for this global event Security will be high through the weekend, echoing measures taken during the Paris Olympics earlier this year. The Île de la Cité — the small island in the River Seine that is home to Notre Dame and the historic heart of Paris— is closed to tourists and non-residents. Police vans and barriers blocked cobblestoned streets in a large perimeter around the island, while soldiers in thick body armor and sniffer dogs patrolled embankments. A special security detail is following Trump. Public viewing areas along the Seine’s southern bank will accommodate 40,000 spectators, who can follow the celebrations on large screens. For many, Notre Dame’s rebirth is not just a French achievement but a global one — after the reopening, the cathedral is set to welcome 15 million visitors annually, up from 12 million before the fire. Following the 2019 fire, nearly $1 billion in donations quickly poured in from around the world, testifying to Notre Dame's universal appeal. Among those who traveled from afar for the reopening was Canadian Noelle Alexandria. 'It’s not the first time she (Notre Dame) has been nearly in ruin, and every time it’s happened, she’s always managed to bounce back. Not many of us could really say that we would do the same, be able to keep coming back no matter what tragedy strike us. But she has,' Alexandria said. ___ John Leicester and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through The AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Pope creates 21 cardinals, many of them reformers in their own right, to carry out his reform plans	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis is installing 21 new cardinals, many of whom are key figures in his reform agenda: A Dominican preacher who acted as the spiritual father for Francis' recent gathering of bishops, a Neapolitan 'street priest' like himself, and a Peruvian bishop who has strongly backed his crackdown on abuse. Francis’ 10th consistory to create new princes of the church is also the biggest infusion of voting-age cardinals in his 11-year pontificate, further cementing his imprint on the group of men who will one day elect his successor. With Saturday's additions, Francis will have created 110 of the 140 cardinals under 80, thus eligible to vote in a conclave. This consistory also brings the number of voting-age cardinals well over the 120-man limit set by St. John Paul II. But 13 existing cardinals will turn 80 next year, bringing the numbers back down. This consistory is notable too because the 21 men being elevated aren’t the same ones Francis named Oct. 6 when he announced an unusual December consistory. One of Francis’ original picks, Indonesian Bishop Paskalis Bruno Syukur, the bishop of Bogor, asked not to be made a cardinal 'because of his desire to grow more in his life as a priest,' the Vatican said. Francis quickly substituted him with the Naples archbishop, Domenico Battaglia, known for his pastoral work in the slums and rough parts of Naples. Which country gets the most new cardinals? Battaglia is one of five Italians getting the red hat, keeping the once-dominant Italian presence in the College of Cardinals strong. Turin is getting a cardinal in its archbishop, Roberto Repole, as is Rome: Baldassare Reina, who on the same day Francis announced he was becoming a cardinal also learned that Francis had promoted him to be his top administrator for the diocese of Rome. Francis, who is technically bishop of Rome, has been conducting a years-long reorganization of the Rome diocese and its pontifical universities. Reina – who is also grand chancellor of the pre-eminent Pontifical Lateran University – will be expected to execute the reform. Another Italian is the oldest cardinal: Angelo Acerbi, a 99-year-old retired Vatican diplomat. He is the only one among the 21 new cardinals to be older than 80 and thus ineligible to vote in a conclave. Francis' picks on Saturday also include the youngest cardinal: the 44-year-old head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Melbourne, Australia, Mykola Bychok. Yet another Italian is one of two Vatican priests who do jobs in the Holy See that don’t usually carry the red hat: Fabio Baggio is undersecretary in the Vatican development office. Francis also decided to make a cardinal out of George Jacob Koovakad, the priest who organizes the pope’s foreign travels. Other picks have high-profile roles in Francis’ reforms. The archbishop of Lima, Peru, Carlos Gustavo Castillo Mattasoglio, made headlines recently because of an extraordinary essay he penned for El Pais newspaper in which he called for the suppression of an influential Peruvian Catholic movement, the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, which also has a presence in the U.S. Castillo called the group a 'failed experiment' of the church in Latin America, one of several conservative, right-wing movements that cropped up in the 1970s and 1980s as a counterweight to the more left-leaning liberation theology. 'My hypothesis is that the Sodalitium obeys a political project,' Castillo wrote. 'It is the resurrection of fascism in Latin America, artfully using the church by means of sectarian methods.' Francis has recently expelled the Sodalitium's founder and several top members following a Vatican investigation. What are the geographic breakdowns? Castillo is one of five new Latin American cardinals named by history’s first Latin American pope. They include the archbishop of Santiago del Estero, Argentina, Vicente Bokalic Iglic; the archbishop of Porto Alegre, Brazil, Jaime Spengler; the archbishop of Santiago, Chile, Fernando Natalio Chomali Garib and the archbishop of Guayaquil, Ecuador, Luis Gerardo Cabrera Herrera. Francis has long sought to broaden the geographic diversity of the College of Cardinals to show the universality of the church, particularly where it is growing. Asia got two new cardinals: Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi, the archbishop of Tokyo; and Pablo Virgilio Sinogco David, the bishop of Kalookan, Philippines. Africa also got two new cardinals: the archbishop of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Ignace Bessi Dogbo, and the bishop of Algiers, Algeria, Jean-Paul Vesco. 'There hasn’t been an African pope, but it’s a possibility in the church,' Dogbo said in an interview on the eve of his installation. 'And I think that this eventuality — which is not necessarily a demand — if this eventuality were to arise, the universal church would have to be ready to take it on.' Francis also tapped the archbishop of Tehran, Iran, Dominique Joseph Mathieu, the bishop of Belgrade, Serbia, Ladislav Nemet, while the lone North American cardinal named is the archbishop of Toronto, Frank Leo. The Lithuanian-born cardinal-elect, Rolandas Makrickas, has a special job in this pontificate: As the archpriest of the St. Mary Major basilica, he hosts Francis every time the pope returns from a foreign trip, since the pope likes to pray before an icon of the Madonna in the church. Additionally, Makrickas oversaw a recent financial reform of the basilica and would have been involved in identifying the future final resting place for Francis, since the Argentine pope has said he will be buried there. The pope's preacher Perhaps the most familiar new cardinal to anyone who has been following Francis’ reform agenda is the Dominican Timothy Radcliff, the spiritual father of the just-concluded synod, or gathering of bishops. The years-long process aimed to make the church more inclusive and responsive to the needs of rank-and-file Catholics, especially women. A British theologian, the white-robed Radcliffe often provided clarifying, if not humorous interventions during the weeks-long debate and retreats. At one point he set off a mini-firestorm by suggesting that external financial pressures influenced African bishops to reject Francis' permission to allow blessings for gay couples. He later said he just meant that the African Catholic Church is under pressure from other well-financed faiths. As the synod was winding down, he offered some valuable perspective. 'Often we can have no idea as to how God’s providence is at work in our lives. We do what we believe to be right and the rest is in the hands of the Lord,' he told the gathering. 'This is just one synod. There will be others. We do not have to do everything, just try to take the next step.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

100-year-old Pearl Harbor survivor recalls confusion and chaos during Japanese bombing 83 years ago	PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) — Bob Fernandez thought he'd go dancing and see the world when he joined the U.S. Navy as a 17-year-old high school student in August 1941. Four months later he found himself shaking from explosions and passing ammunition to artillery crews so his ship's guns could return fire on Japanese planes bombing Pearl Harbor, a Navy base in Hawaii. 'When those things go off like that, we didn’t know what’s what,' said Fernandez, who is now 100. 'We didn’t even know we were in a war.' Two survivors of the bombing — each 100 or older — are planning to return to Pearl Harbor on Saturday to observe the 83rd anniversary of the attack that thrust the U.S. into World War II. They will join active-duty troops, veterans and members of the public for a remembrance ceremony hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service. Fernandez was initially planning to join them but had to cancel because of health issues. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle. The remains of more than 900 Arizona crew members are still entombed on the submerged vessel. A moment of silence will be held at 7:54 a.m., the same time the attack began eight decades ago. Aircraft in missing man formation are due to fly overhead to break the silence. Dozens of survivors once joined the annual remembrance but attendance has declined as survivors have aged. Today there are only 16 still living, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Military historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated there were some 87,000 military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack. Many laud Pearl Harbor survivors as heroes, but Fernandez doesn't view himself that way. 'I’m not a hero. I’m just nothing but an ammunition passer,' he told The Associated Press in a phone interview from California, where he now lives with his nephew in Lodi. Fernandez was working as a mess cook on his ship, the USS Curtiss, the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, and planned to go dancing that night at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Waikiki. He brought sailors coffee and food as he waited tables during breakfast. Then they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane with the red ball insignia painted on Japanese aircraft fly by. Fernandez rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing 5-inch (12.7-centimeter), 38-caliber shells so they could begin passing them to the ship's guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire up above. 'I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,' Fernandez said. The ship's guns hit a Japanese plane that crashed into one of its cranes. Shortly after, its guns hit a dive bomber which then slammed into the ship and exploded below deck, setting the hangar and main decks on fire, according to the Navy History and Heritage Command. Fernandez's ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. 'We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,' Fernandez said. 'But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.' After the attack, Fernandez had to sweep up debris. That night, he stood guard with a rifle to make sure no one tried to come aboard. When it came time to rest, he fell asleep next to where the ship’s dead were lying. He only realized that when a fellow sailor woke him up and told him. After the war, Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014. His oldest son is now 82 and lives in Arizona. Two other sons and a stepdaughter have died. He has traveled to Hawaii three times to participate in the Pearl Harbor remembrance. This year would have been his fourth trip. Fernandez still enjoys music and goes dancing at a nearby restaurant once a week if he can. His favorite tune is Frank Sinatra’s rendition of 'All of Me,' a song his nephew Joe Guthrie said he still knows by heart. 'The ladies flock to him like moths to a flame,' Guthrie said. ___ Associated Press journalist Terry Chea contributed to this report from Lodi, California.	https://apnews.com/article/pearl-harbor-attack-anniversary-hawaii-97e21f0b36f969bf0c5b3a8bb2641694	2024-12-06T20:05:10-08:00	
Trump is traveling to Paris for Notre Dame Cathedral's reopening celebration, will meet with Macron	PARIS (AP) — Donald Trump is off on his first international trip as president-elect, ready to join world leaders and dignitaries in Paris for a Saturday celebration of the renovation of Notre Dame Cathedral after a devastating fire in 2019. Trump wrote when he accepted the invitation earlier this week that French President Emmanuel Macron had done 'a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!' Macron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made a point of cultivating a relationship with the president-elect since he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris last month. But his office nonetheless played down the significance of the invitation, saying that other politicians who do not currently hold office had been invited as well. Trump was invited as president-elect of a 'friendly nation,' Macron's office said, adding, 'This is in no way exceptional, we’ve done it before.' President Joe Biden was invited as well but will not attend. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre cited a scheduling conflict and said the U.S. would instead be represented by first lady Jill Biden. Trump and the U.S. first lady last encountered one another shortly after the election, when he visited the White House for the traditional meeting between outgoing and incoming presidents. Trump's visit to France comes as Macron and other European leaders are trying to cultivate the president-elect's favor and persuade him to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s three-year invasion. Ahead of the Notre Dame event, Macron will be meeting with Trump and then separately with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the French president’s office said. Relations between France and the U.S. during Trump’s first term began warmly enough but grew increasingly strained over time. Macron was the guest of honor at Trump’s first state dinner, and Trump traveled to France several times. But the relationship suffered after Macron criticized Trump for questioning the need for NATO and raising doubts about America’s commitment to the mutual-defense pact. On the campaign trail this year, Trump often mocked Macron, imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep tariffs on wine and champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France tried to tax American companies. But Macron was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Trump last month after the election. 'Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump,' Macron posted on X early on the morning after the election. 'Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.' Trump was president in 2019 when a massive fire engulfed Notre Dame, collapsing its spire and threatening to destroy one of the world’s greatest architectural treasures, known for its mesmerizing stained glass. 'So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris,' he wrote on what was then Twitter, offering his advice to the city. 'Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!' he wrote. French officials appeared to respond shortly after, noting that 'All means' were being used to extinguish the flames, 'except for water-bombing aircrafts which, if used, could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral.' Last weekend, Trump announced that he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France. ______ Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Alone and broke against a renewed insurgency, is Assad's rule at risk of collapse?	BEIRUT (AP) — The last time Syrian President Bashar Assad was in serious trouble was 10 years ago, at the height of the country’s civil war, when his forces lost control over parts of the largest city, Aleppo, and his opponents were closing in on the capital, Damascus. Back then, he was rescued by his chief international backer, Russia, and longtime regional ally Iran, which along with Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah militia helped Assad's forces retake Aleppo, tipping the war firmly in his favor. Now, as insurgents pursue a shock offensive that quickly captured not just Aleppo, but the key city of Hama and a string of other towns across the country’s northwest, the Syrian leader appears to be largely on his own. Russia is preoccupied with its war in Ukraine, and Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of its fighters to shore up Assad’s forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran, meanwhile, has seen its proxies across the region degraded by Israeli airstrikes. Moreover, Syrian troops are exhausted and hollowed out by 13 years of war and economic crises, with little will left to fight. So will Assad's rule collapse in the near future? 'The coming days and weeks will be critical in determining whether the rebel offensive poses an existential threat to the Assad regime or whether the regime manages to regain its footing and push back on recent rebel gains,' said Mona Yacoubian, an analyst with the United States Institute for Peace. 'While weakened and distracted, Assad’s allies are unlikely to simply cave to the rebels’ offensive,' she wrote in an analysis. Not out of the woods Until recently, it seemed that Syria’s president was almost out of the woods. He never really won the long-running civil war, and large parts of the country were still outside his control. But after 13 years of conflict, it appeared that the worst was over, and that the world was ready to forget. Once viewed as a regional pariah, Assad saw Arab countries warming up to him again, renewing ties and reinstating Syria’s membership in the Arab League. Earlier this year, Italy also decided to reopen its embassy in Damascus after a decade of strained relations. In the aftermath of one of the world's largest humanitarian crises, aid groups and international donors in Syria began pivoting toward spending more on the country's recovery than on emergency assistance, providing a lifeline for Syrians and restoring basic services. But then the sudden offensive launched by insurgents on Nov. 27 reignited the war and caught everyone off guard with its scope and speed. It also left Syria’s neighbors anxious, wary that violence and refugees could spill across borders and worried about the growing influence of Islamist groups, a major concern for most of Syria’s Arab neighbors. Geopolitical shifts Analysts say a confluence of geopolitical developments beginning with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, followed by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that started on Oct. 7, 2023, helped create the opportunity for Assad’s opponents to pounce. As the rebels advanced this past week, Syrian forces appeared to melt away, putting up no resistance, with several reports of defection. Russian forces carried out occasional airstrikes. Hezbollah’s leader in Lebanon said the group will continue to support Syria, but made no mention of sending fighters again. 'The rebel assault underscores the precarious nature of regime control in Syria,' Yacoubian wrote. 'Its sudden eruption and the speed with which rebel groups managed to overtake Aleppo ... expose the complex dynamics that reside just below the surface in Syria and can transform superficial calm into major conflict.' Aron Lund, a Syria expert with Century International, a New York-based think tank and a researcher with the Swedish Defense Research Agency, said the developments in Syria are a geopolitical disaster for Russia and Iran. 'They too were surely surprised by what happened, and they have all sorts of resource constraints,' including Russia's war in Ukraine and Hezbollah's losses in Lebanon and Syria. Exhausted and broken While the country’s conflict lines have been largely stalemated since 2020, Syria’s economic woes have only multiplied in the past few years. The imposition of U.S. sanctions, a banking crisis in neighboring Lebanon and an earthquake last year contributed to the fact that almost all Syrians face extreme financial hardship. That has caused state institutions and salaries to wither. 'If you can’t pay your soldiers a living wage, then maybe you can’t expect them to stay and fight when thousands of Islamists storm' their cities, Lund said. 'It is just an exhausted, broken and dysfunctional regime' to start with. Part of the insurgents’ attempt to reassert their grip on Aleppo, the city where they were ousted in 2016 after a grueling military campaign, was to issue a call to government soldiers and security agencies to defect, granting them what they called 'protection cards,' which offer some sort of amnesty and assurances that they won’t be hunted down. The spokesman for the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, said more than 1,600 soldiers have applied for the cards over two days in Aleppo city. Hundreds of defectors lined up outside city police stations Thursday to register their details with the insurgents. Hossam al-Bakr, 33, originally from Hama who served in Damascus and defected four years earlier to Aleppo, said he came to 'settle his position' and get a new ID. The laminated card handed out to each defector was titled the 'defection card.' It showed the name, ID number and place of service of each defector. It is issued by 'The general command: Military Operations room.' On Thursday, Maj. Mohamed Ghoneim, who was in charge of registering the defectors, said more than 1,000 soldiers or police officers came to register. Some who were in possession of their official guns handed them over, he added. 'There are thousands who want to apply,' he said. Charles Lister, a longtime Syria expert, said while most of the international community has written off the conflict as either frozen or finished, the armed opposition has never given up and has been training for such a scenario for years. A rag tag group of militias, plagued by infighting and rivalry, spent years preparing and organizing, propelled by a dream to regain control of territory from Assad. 'The regime has been more vulnerable over the last year or two than it has perhaps been throughout the entirety of the conflict,' Lister said. 'And it has gotten used to the idea that if it can wait things out, it will ultimately prove to be the victor.' ___ Karam contributed reporting from London.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-civil-war-assad-insurgents-55921ce70395892d2955eb1654e5a8c1	2024-12-06T20:04:03-08:00	
Hospital founded by Spanish conqueror persists 500 years later in Mexico's capital	MEXICO CITY (AP) — In Mexico City’s bustling historic center, the Hospital de Jesus covers most of a city block. Its faded unassuming yellow facade, characteristic of the middle of the last century, obscures the medical center within founded 500 years ago by Spanish conqueror Hernán Cortés. Entering between street-level shoe stores, visitors find the oldest continuously operating hospital in the Americas. Stone arches lead to expansive patios filled with lush vegetation. The hospital was founded to treat the conquering Spanish, then later opened to the local Indigenous inhabitants to ensure a healthy workforce. Today it provides 24/7 emergency care, as well as affordable access to medical specialists for current residents of what was at the time of its founding the center of the Aztec empire. 'You can feel the Mexican heritage here,' said Dr. Pedro Álvarez Sánchez. 'For 500 years, the hospital has never closed its doors.' On Nov. 8, 1519, Cortés and his soldiers entered Tenochtitlan, the Aztec name for the capital, and met Aztec emperor Moctezuma in a place known as Huitzilan, just in front of the present-day hospital. Cortés had conquered the city by 1521, and to honor that original encounter, he founded the hospital in 1524. The meeting of Cortés and Moctezuma is depicted in a floor-to-ceiling tile mural beside one of the central patios. The main temple of Tenochtitlan — only a few blocks from the hospital — sits in the background. The union of two suns represents the meeting of two cultures. Cortés is buried in a small church adjacent to the hospital. Descendants of him and Moctezuma met here in 2019 to mark the anniversary of that initial encounter. Around the world, only a handful of hospitals can boast such longevity. For example, St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London founded in 1123 and Bellevue Hospital in New York City founded in 1736 also continue to provide full medical services. Much of the hospital has remained intact thanks to a board of trustees founded in the 16th century. Over the years, countless doctors have quietly worked to conserve the hospital’s mission of affordable care and to preserve the building’s unique architectural features. 'We want to ensure that this hospital continues to provide quality medical attention to patients,' said Dr. Octaviano Rosalez Serafín, 71, president of the hospital’s board of trustees. 'We want to continue the tradition of care the hospital has had for years.' Celia Chávez Escamilla, 56, arrived at the hospital at dawn recently for an appointment with her dermatologist. 'Here they take good care of us,' said Chávez. 'The prices here are accessible. If you go somewhere else it’s too expensive.' Her consultation was just 400 pesos or under $20. Escamilla was accompanied by her daughter Myriam Rafael Sanchez, 26, who was fascinated by the medical center. 'I’ve seen (the hospital) a lot in movies and TV shows,' she said excitedly. 'We have all of Mexico’s history around us.' The hospital didn’t always serve the entire public, according to Sandra Elena Guevara Flores, an anthropologist focusing on medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Guevara said the hospital was not open to the Indigenous population initially, but only to the Spanish who had recently arrived in the Americas. However, as epidemics began to spread, the hospital opened its doors to more patients. 'It was a strategy by the Spanish governors in the new Spain to treat the whole population,' said Guevara. 'It (was) so the servants and the whole labor system wouldn’t die.' Early Spanish doctors at the hospital often used native Mexican herbs to cure their patients. 'It’s said that traditional Galenic Hippocratic medicine was used in the hospital, but really it was Indigenous medicine,' said Guevara. 'They (Indigenous peoples) would share their knowledge.' The Spanish imprint can be seen in the hospital’s architecture, said Hugo Antonio Arciniega Ávila, a historian and archaeological expert from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The hospital, like some other colonial structures in Mexico City, is ‘encapsulated’ inside a newer building from the 1950s. Because the Spanish built low stone structures on huge lots with massive stone walls, people who wanted to build newer facilities a century or two later would often just build over, around or among the colonial-era structures. Sometimes they would incorporate the old masonry walls into the new building, either for preservation reasons or because it was cheaper to use them than to tear them down. So from the street, there is often no sign that behind a Victorian or functionalist facade, there is a partially preserved Spanish structure within. The hospital was built in the form of a T, with two large patios and a grand staircase devised by Spanish architect Claudio de Arciniega in the 16th century. The design provided constant ventilation and sunshine to patients. The architect also included a chapel on each of the two original floors. 'The architecture of this hospital is fascinating,' said Arciniega about the intentional layout of religious spaces and access to open air. 'If you cure the soul, you can cure the body – it’s the same way the doctors thought.' For the 67-year-old Álvarez, who has worked at the hospital for nearly 50 years and also serves as the board of trustees’ treasurer, the center has been a constant in his life. He began working at the hospital as a lab assistant at age 18. 'A lot of people ask me, why do you keep working at the Hospital de Jesus?' he said. 'I tell them because I love it.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-moctezuma-hernan-cortes-hospital-dadf563137d82f5ae5c9534aa3e216b4	2024-12-06T19:01:01-08:00	
South Korean president apologizes, saying he won't shirk responsibility for attempt at martial law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s president apologized Saturday for public anxiety caused by his short-lived attempt to impose martial law earlier this week hours ahead of a parliamentary vote on impeaching him. Yoon said in a brief televised address Saturday morning he won’t shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration and promised not to make another attempt to impose it. He said he would leave it to his conservative political party to chart a course through the country's political turmoil, 'including matters related to my term in office.' South Korean lawmakers are set to vote later Saturday on impeaching President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, as protests grew nationwide calling for his removal. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the motion submitted by opposition lawmakers would get the two-thirds majority required for Yoon to be impeached. But it appeared more likely after the leader of Yoon’s own party on Friday called for suspending his constitutional powers, describing him as unfit to hold the office and capable of taking more extreme action, including renewed attempts to impose martial law. Impeaching Yoon would require support from 200 of the National Assembly’s 300 members. The opposition parties that jointly brought the impeachment motion have 192 seats combined. That means they would need at least eight votes from Yoon’s People Power Party. On Wednesday, 18 members of the PPP joined a vote that unanimously canceled martial law 190-0 less than three hours after Yoon declared the measure on television, calling the opposition-controlled parliament a 'den of criminals' bogging down state affairs. The vote took place as hundreds of heavily-armed troops encircled the National Assembly in an attempt to disrupt the vote and possibly to detain key politicians. Parliament said Saturday that it would meet at 5 p.m. It will first vote on a bill appointing a special prosecutor to investigate influence peddling allegations surrounding Yoon's wife, and then on impeaching Yoon. The turmoil resulting from Yoon’s bizarre and poorly-thought-out stunt has paralyzed South Korean politics and sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners, including neighboring Japan and Seoul’s top ally the United States, as one of the strongest democracies in Asia faces a political crisis that could unseat its leader. Opposition lawmakers claim that Yoon’s martial law declaration amounted to a self-coup and drafted the impeachment motion around rebellion charges. The PPP decided to oppose impeachment at a lawmakers' meeting, despite pleas by its leader Han Dong-hun, who isn’t a lawmaker and has no vote. Following a party meeting on Friday, Han stressed the need to suspend Yoon’s presidential duties and power swiftly, saying he 'could potentially put the Republic of Korea and its citizens in great danger.' Han said he had received intelligence that during the brief period of martial law Yoon ordered the country’s defense counterintelligence commander to arrest and detain unspecified key politicians based on accusations of 'anti-state activities.' Hong Jang-won, first deputy director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, later told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing that Yoon called after imposing martial law and ordered him to help the defense counterintelligence unit to detain key politicians. The targeted politicians included Han, opposition leader Lee Jae-myung and National Assembly speaker Woo Won Shik, according to Kim Byung-kee, one of the lawmakers who attended the meeting. The Defense Ministry said it had suspended the defense counterintelligence commander, Yeo In-hyung, who Han alleged had received orders from Yoon to detain the politicians. The ministry also suspended Lee Jin-woo, commander of the capital defense command, and Kwak Jong-geun, commander of the special warfare command, over their involvement in enforcing martial law. Former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who has been accused of recommending Yoon to enforce martial law, has been placed under a travel ban and faces an investigation by prosecutors over rebellion charges. Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho, who became acting defense minister after Yoon accepted Kim Yong Hyun’s resignation on Thursday, has testified to parliament that it was Kim Yong Hyun who ordered troops to be deployed to the National Assembly after Yoon imposed martial law.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-politics-yoon-martial-law-impeachment-3f2a9190bf5cec83b49e2c6ad5cf5379	2024-12-06T15:39:47-08:00	
TikTok is inching closer to a potential ban in the US. So what's next?	TikTok's future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge to a law that requires the social media platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January. A panel of three judges on The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the law withstood constitutional scrutiny, rebuffing arguments from the two companies that the statute violated their rights and the rights of TikTok users in the U.S. The government has said it wants ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its stakes. But if it doesn't and the platform goes away, it would have a seismic impact on the lives of content creators who rely on the platform for income as well as users who use it for entertainment and connection. Here are some details on the ruling and what could happen next: What does the ruling say? In their lawsuit, TikTok and ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, had challenged the law on various fronts, arguing in part that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and was an unconstitutional bill of attainder that unfairly targeted the two companies. But the court sided with attorneys for the Justice Department who said that the government was attempting to address national security concerns and the way in which it chose to do so did not violate the constitution. The Justice Department has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say that Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread, or suppress, information. However, the U.S. hasn't publicly provided examples of that happening. The appeals court ruling, written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said the law was 'carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary.' The judges also rejected the claim that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, Ginsburg wrote the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to 'suppress content or require a certain mix of content' on TikTok. What happens next? TikTok and ByteDance are expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether the court will take up the case. TikTok indicated in a statement on Friday the two companies are preparing to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has 'an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech.' 'We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,' a company spokesperson said. Alan Morrison, a professor at The George Washington University Law School, said he expects the Supreme Court to take up the case because of the novelty of the issues raised in the lawsuit. If that happens, attorneys for the two companies still have to convince the court to grant them an emergency stay that will prevent the government from enforcing the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline stipulated in the law, Morrison said. Such a move could drag out the process until the Justices make a ruling. Tiffany Cianci, a TikTok content creator who has supported the platform, said she was not shocked about the outcome of the court's ruling on Friday because lower courts typically defer to the executive branch on these types of cases. She believes the company will have a stronger case at the Supreme Court. 'I believe that the next stages are more likely to produce a victory for TikTokers and for TikTok as a whole,' Cianci said. What about Trump? Another wild card is President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the recent presidential campaign that he is now against such action. The Trump transition team has not offered details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to 'save TikTok.' But spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month that he plans to 'deliver' on his campaign promises. After Trump takes office on Jan. 20th, it would fall on his Justice Department to enforce the law and punish any potential violators. Penalties would apply to any app stores that would violate a prohibition on TikTok and to internet hosting services which would be barred from supporting it. Some have speculated that Trump could ask his Justice Department to abstain from enforcing the law. But tech companies like Apple and Google, which offer TikTok's app on their app stores, would then have to trust that the administration would not come after them for any violations. Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said enforcement discretion — or executive orders — can not override existing law, leaving Trump with 'limited room for unilateral action.' There are other things Trump could potentially do. It's possible he could invoke provisions of the law that allow the president to determine whether a sale or a similar transaction frees TikTok from 'foreign adversary' control. Another option is to urge Congress to repeal the law. But that too would require support from congressional Republicans who have overwhelmingly supported the prospect of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company. In a statement issued Friday, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said he was 'optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok' and allow its continued use in the United States. Is anyone trying to buy TikTok? ByteDance has said it won't sell TikTok. And even if it wanted to, a sale of the proprietary algorithm that powers TikTok is likely to get blocked under Chinese export controls that the country issued in 2020. That means if TikTok is sold without the algorithm, its likely that the buyer would only purchase a shell of the platform that doesn't contain the technology that made the app a cultural powerhouse. Still, some investors, including Trump’s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in buying it. This week, a spokesperson for McCourt’s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. The spokesperson did not disclose the identity of the participants.	https://apnews.com/article/bytedance-tiktok-ban-court-trump-2f8c86057073f9412ddb7e5b3a427e0a	2024-12-06T13:47:12-08:00	
Mother of Austin Tice, journalist missing in Syria, says new information proves her son is alive	WASHINGTON (AP) — The mother of Austin Tice, an American journalist missing in Syria for more than a decade, said Friday that she was confident her son was alive, citing information she said had come from a 'significant source' that she did not identify but said had been vetted by the U.S. government and treated as credible. 'He is being cared for and he is well — we do know that,' Debra Tice said. Tice's mother and other relatives spoke at an event Friday following a White House meeting with national security officials that unfolded amid ongoing turmoil in Syria, as insurgent fighters who have already captured the northern city of Aleppo, the country's largest, are pressing their march against President Bashar Assad's forces. 'The news we're hearing from the Middle East is the kind of thing that can unsettle a mom,' Debra Tice said, later adding, 'When I think about war, I never have a happy moment.' Austin Tice's sister, Naomi, said she asked officials whether there was a way to leverage the unrest to help secure Austin's freedom. 'We were basically just told that we need to wait and see how it pans out' — a response she said may have been 'understandable' but was 'beyond frustrating.' Tice's father, Marc, echoed that sentiment, noting that meetings this week with White House and State Department officials had devolved into finger-pointing and frustration. 'We have seen what real commitment looks like. We've seen it in Russia. We've seen it in China, we've seen in Venezuela, we see it in Gaza,' he said, referring to places where hostages have been released in recent months. 'And we've yet to see it for us.' He, too, declined to speak about the information pointing to his son being alive but said, 'We are confident that this information is fresh. It indicated as late as earlier this year that Austin is alive and being cared for. And we do hope to make as much of this public as we can.' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed Friday that the Tice family had met with Biden administration national security adviser Jake Sullivan, but said she didn't know specifics of what was said. 'Austin Tice's family, I can't even imagine what they're going through,' she said. Tice, who is from Houston and whose work had been published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and other outlets, disappeared in August 2012 at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus. A video released weeks later showed him blindfolded and held by armed men and saying, 'Oh, Jesus.' He has not been heard from since. Syria has publicly denied that it was holding him. In the final months of the Trump administration, two U.S. officials — the government’s top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens, and Kash Patel, now Trump's pick to lead the FBI — made a secret visit to Damascus to seek information on Tice and other Americans who have disappeared in Syria. It was the highest-level talk in years between the U.S. and Assad's government, though Syrian officials offered no meaningful information on Tice.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-austin-tice-washington-hostage-58e79b5bcb117cac5674b27ff66d5d69	2024-12-06T11:59:59-08:00	
Mexico study's surprising finding: Killer heat hit harder for the young than the elderly	A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50. For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older. The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50. Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits. The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team. 'We found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,' study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. 'As the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.' Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study. 'People of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,' said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team. 'Heat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,' Romanello said in an email. Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said. Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity. Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don’t reach that level. Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher. Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said. Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did. Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said. 'There is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,' Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover. Younger people often have a sense of invulnerability to weather extremes and do things that increase their risk, such as play sports in high heat, Cavazos said. 'High humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating – which is how our body primarily stays cool,' said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was not part of the study team. 'So someone young and healthy working outside in heat and high humidity can reach a point where the body can no longer cool itself safely – causing a deadly form of heat injury called heat stroke.' ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Closely-watched international climate case in the Hague wraps up its first week of testimony	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A closely-watched international climate case that could yield guidance for governments around the world wrapped its first week of arguments before the top court of the United Nations in The Hague Friday. The case, though not binding, is expected to spell out what countries are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact. The push for the International Court of Justice to hear this case comes — like much of the call to address climate change — from island nations who are losing territory and fear they could disappear under rising seas. The U.N. General Assembly asked the court last year for an opinion on 'the obligations of States in respect of climate change.' 'The stakes could not be higher. The survival of my people and so many others is on the line,' Arnold Kiel Loughman, attorney general of the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Hague-based court. For years his country has spearheaded calls for reductions of the greenhouse gases that are causing sea ice to melt and oceans to expand, making the seas rise. Vanuatu led this push for international legal intervention as well. Fifteen judges from around the world must now answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments when their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? With 99 participating countries, it is the largest case in the court’s history. Countries including Vanuatu, Chile and the Philippines want countries like the United States, China and Russia to reduce their emissions and provide financial help to alleviate the devastating impact of climate change that they feel endangers their very existence. 'This is a crisis of survival. It is also a crisis of equity. Fiji contributes 0.004 percent of global emissions but our people bear the brunt of climate impacts. In climate-vulnerable nations, marginalized groups ⎯ women, children and the poor ⎯ are disproportionately affected,' Luke Daunivalu, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said. The South Pacific island nation spoke directly after the United States and Russia, both of whom are major petroleum-producing states and staunchly opposed to the court mandating emissions reductions. Instead, what the United States and other major greenhouse gas emitters want the court to do is defer to the landmark Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to keep global warming to a 1.5 degree C (2.7 F) limit. The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees C (2.3 F) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Between 1990 and 2020, sea levels rose by a global average of 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) and parts of the South Pacific have seen significantly more. 'States designed this international legal framework to address the uniquely complex collective action problem posed by anthropogenic global warming, and it embodies the clearest, most specific and the most current expression of states’ consent to be bound by international law in respect of climate change,' Margaret Taylor said on behalf of the United States, referring to the Paris Agreement. The U.S. also pushed back on an idea proposed by several countries that developed countries have a great obligation to reduce emissions and pay reparations because they have been contributing to the problem for a much longer time. 'A state cannot have international responsibility for acts that take place prior to the date on which its international legal obligation came into existence,' Taylor said. What small states like Vanuatu are hoping for does push the norms of international law. Historically, all countries are held to the same standard. Every country that is a party to the 1948 Genocide Convention, for example, has the exact same obligation to 'punish and prevent' genocide. 'What I have heard is a concerted effort by major polluters seeking to avoid their responsibilities,' Joie Chowdhury, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, told The Associated Press. She said the conduct of major polluters responsible for the climate crisis and its catastrophic consequences is unlawful under multiple international laws. Alongside the hearings, environmental groups held a series of events to promote climate justice. On Sunday, ahead of the hearing, Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change — who first developed the idea of requesting an advisory opinion — together with World Youth for Climate Justice held an afternoon of speeches, music and discussions. Kjelld Kroon, a climate activist who is involved in a lawsuit against the Dutch state for failing to protect his Caribbean island homeland of Bonaire, watched several days of the proceedings and said he wasn’t surprised that rich countries were opposed to more legal obligations. 'This is how a lot of powerful countries in the Global North extract from the Global South,' he told the AP. But Kroon said he found the presentations by many developing states powerful and said they gave him hope. Any decision by the court would be unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. 'If I look at history, I am skeptical,' Kroon said. 'But if I look towards the future, I am a little bit positive.'	https://apnews.com/article/climate-international-court-justice-a7449cb84e5bc555ddee909a1967719e	2024-12-06T09:53:00-08:00	
US opens investigation into Spain's reported port denials of cargo ships carrying arms to Israel	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States has opened an investigation into whether NATO ally Spain has been denying port entry to cargo vessels reportedly transporting U.S. weapons to Israel. The Federal Maritime Commission, an independent body charged with monitoring and evaluating conditions that may affect shipping and U.S. international trade, said it had opened the probe after receiving information that Spain had refused to allow at least three cargo vessels into its ports. 'The commission is concerned that this apparent policy of denying entry to certain vessels will create conditions unfavorable to shipping in the foreign trade,' it said Thursday in a notice published in the Federal Register. If the investigation determines that Spain has interfered with such commerce, the commission could levy millions of dollars in fines, up to $2.3 million per voyage, it said. The notice said the commission had been informed on Nov. 19 that Spain was denying port entry to ships, including those enrolled in the U.S.-run Maritime Security Program, which is supposed to afford vessels and their owners protection against 'restrictive and discriminatory' licensing because their services are often used by the U.S. military. Two of the three incidents noted by the commission involved vessels run by the Danish shipping giant Maersk in November. The other occurred in May. Spanish authorities did not immediately comment on the November incidents. But in May, Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente said the foreign ministry had denied a request to dock by the Danish-flagged ship Marianne Danica, saying it 'was carrying weapons to Israel.' A day later, on May 17, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told Spain’s state broadcaster RTVE that this was the first ship carrying arms to Israel that had been denied entry. 'We are not going to contribute to any more arms reaching the Middle East,' he said. 'The Middle East needs peace. That is why that this first denial of authorization will start a policy for any boat carrying arms to Israel that wants to dock at a Spanish port.' The refusal to allow the Marianne Danica to dock at the Mediterranean port of Cartegena came just days before Spain, along with Ireland and Norway, recognized a Palestinian state on May 28. Spain stopped its own defense companies from shipping arms to Israel in October 2023.	https://apnews.com/article/us-spain-israel-weapons-shipping-7cb890af47716111445f7726ce19ddb4	2024-12-06T08:59:11-08:00	
Car rams and injures orchestral musicians in Belgrade during a protest over station roof collapse	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — The Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra said four of its musicians were injured Friday in an incident during a weekly 15-minute traffic blockade commemorating the 15 people who died when a concrete canopy collapsed at a railway station in a northern Serbian city last month. The traffic blockades have been held every Friday in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, and other cities and towns since the fall of the concrete construction in Novi Sad on Nov. 1. Hundreds also took part in protests this Friday at various locations throughout the country, standing in silence to commemorate the victims and demanding accountability for their deaths. Some members of the Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra joined a traffic blockade at a pedestrian crossing near their place of work on Friday, a statement said. A man refused to stop and drove his car through the protesters, hurting the musicians, the statement added. Serbian media said police arrested a 67-year-old man from the northern town of Kikinda. The musicians received medical care, reports said. The Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra 'most harshly condemns the act of violence against them (musicians) while they were expressing their personal civic opinion,' the orchestra said. It cancelled a scheduled performance on Friday evening. Serbian university students have joined the protests in recent days, organizing 24-hour blockades at their faculties. Hundreds came out on Friday to halt traffic on busy streets in Belgrade and elsewhere. Rallies in past weeks have occasionally been marred by violent incidents when pro-government supporters showed up and tried to disrupt the protesters blocking traffic. The railway station building in Novi Sad was renovated twice in recent years. Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption and opaque deals resulted in sloppy work and led to the collapse of the canopy. While prosecutors have announced the arrests of 13 people, a Serbian court has since released from detention former government construction minister Goran Vesic. This has fueled widespread skepticism of the ongoing investigation, as the ruling populists control both the police and judiciary.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-protest-belgrade-orchestra-musicians-6180768fac904818cd2b5fd0b8b342d0	2024-12-06T08:44:16-08:00	
Ex-British soldier pleads not guilty to 'Bloody Sunday' murders after judge clears the way for trial	LONDON (AP) — A former British soldier will be tried for the murder of two men killed during the 1972 'Bloody Sunday' disturbances in Londonderry, Northern Ireland’s second-biggest city, after a judge refused to dismiss the charges against him. The veteran, known only as Soldier F, is charged with two counts of murder and five counts of attempted murder stemming from a civil rights march and the rioting that followed it on Jan. 30, 1972. Thirteen people were killed by British Army gunfire that day, the largest number of deaths in a shooting incident during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland known as 'The Troubles.' During a hearing Friday at Belfast Crown Court, Justice Stephen Fowler rejected an application from the ex-soldier’s lawyers to dismiss the charges on the grounds that there wasn’t enough evidence to convict him. Following the ruling, Soldier F pleaded not guilty. The veteran entered his plea from behind a blue floor-to-ceiling curtain after the judge granted a request to shield his identity. The veteran’s lawyers had argued that he would be a 'prized target' for dissident Irish Republicans if his identity were made public. The judge said he expected the trial to take place early next year and scheduled the next hearing in the case for Jan. 24. Soldier F is the only British Army veteran to face trial for the Bloody Sunday killings after years of investigations and aborted efforts to bring charges against the former soldiers. The first government-commissioned inquiry, published less than three months after the deaths, found that the soldiers had only opened fire after they had been fired upon. A second inquiry in 2010 rejected that conclusion, finding that the soldiers violated their rules of engagement and opened fire on people who didn’t pose a threat to them. That cleared the way for the prosecution of Soldier F. Bloody Sunday remains a source of tension in Northern Ireland more than 25 years after the peace agreement that largely ended the Troubles. Families of the victims continue to demand justice for their loved ones, while supporters of army veterans who fought in the conflict complain that they continue to be dogged by investigations and potential charges decades after their service ended. Outside the court, Mickey McKinney, the brother of one of the men killed in 1972, said it was a 'good day' for the victims and their families. 'The events of Bloody Sunday took place 53 years ago next month,' he said. 'It is imperative that the court does not tolerate any more delay and that this trial proceeds as a matter of urgency.'	https://apnews.com/article/britain-bloody-sunday-northern-ireland-troubles-c9261a4cb3a2131be1ec0c49f9637820	2024-12-06T07:45:26-08:00	
TikTok's future uncertain after appeals court rejects its bid to overturn possible US ban	A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in a few short months, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok's petition to overturn the law — which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January — and rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment. 'The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,' said the court's opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. 'Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States.' TikTok and ByteDance — another plaintiff in the lawsuit — are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, though its unclear whether the court will take up the case. 'The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,' TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement. 'Unfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,' Hughes said. Unless stopped, he argued the statute 'will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.' Though the case is squarely in the court system, its also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a years-long saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China. 'Today’s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday. The U.S. has said it’s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect — a concern mirrored by the European Union on Friday as it scrutinizes the video-sharing app’s role in the Romanian elections. TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn’t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing’s benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government. Friday’s ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republican and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September. In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok’s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three of them denied TikTok’s petition. In the court's ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok's main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to 'suppress content or require a certain mix of content' on TikTok. 'Content on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,' Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion. TikTok’s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators - for which the company is covering legal costs - as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok. 'This is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans’ access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,' said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. 'We hope that the appeals court’s ruling won’t be the last word.' Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court's ruling. 'I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,' said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China. Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said 'it's time for ByteDance to accept' the law. To assuage concerns about the company’s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data. The company has also argued the government’s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient. Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it’s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm - the platform’s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan - would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content. Still, some investors, including Trump’s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok’s U.S. business. This week, a spokesperson for McCourt’s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital.	https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-court-ruling-china-6bfd505295ad44126df0544fc083d6a6	2024-12-06T06:35:41-08:00	
Princess of Wales takes another step in return to public life after chemotherapy with carol service	LONDON (AP) — The Princess of Wales took another step Friday in her return to public life following cancer treatment, in hosting her annual Christmas carol service at Westminster Abbey. Dressed in a festive red coat featuring a large black bow on the collar and black buttons, the princess, often referred to simply as Kate, arrived with her husband Prince William and their three children. They were met by clergy in front of a row of Christmas trees decorated with glittering white lights. Inside the abbey, Kate chatted with members of the congregation and performers, including Gregory Porter. This year’s concert is designed to celebrate the support people give to one another, especially as they struggle through difficult times, a theme that may have particular resonance for the princess after abdominal surgery and chemotherapy forced her to step back from public duties for much of 2024. Kate alluded to this in a letter thanking the 1,600 people invited to attend the event because of their efforts to help others in their communities. 'The Christmas story encourages us to consider the experiences and feelings of others,' Kate wrote. 'It also reflects our own vulnerabilities and reminds us of the importance of giving and receiving empathy, as well as just how much we need each other in spite of our differences.' Kate has hosted the carol service since it began in 2021, celebrating the work of doctors, nurses and emergency workers as Britain returned to normal following the COVID-19 pandemic. The princess wowed the audience, playing the piano to accompany Scottish singer Tom Walker on his song 'For Those Who Can’t Be Here,' inspired by the loss and separation caused by the pandemic. The order of service Friday will also feature a cover image by British artist Charlie Mackesy, who wrote and illustrated 'The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse.’’ The 2019 book highlighted the importance of kindness through the unlikely friendship of the four title characters as they search for the boy’s home. Kate and her husband have been open about the challenges they faced this year as both the princess and King Charles III were diagnosed with cancer. The princess has made only a few public appearances since she underwent abdominal surgery in February and then announced she was undergoing treatment for cancer a few weeks later. Her first post-chemotherapy appearances were geared toward moments of national significance, such as the king’s birthday parade and the annual Remembrance Day ceremonies to honor the nation’s war dead. But earlier this week she helped greet the emir of Qatar during his state visit to Britain, and now she’s returning to her signature event. Charles was sidelined after revealing in February that he was suffering from an undisclosed form of cancer. But while he began returning to public duties at the end of April, Kate needed more time. The carol service will feature performances by singers Porter and Paloma Faith. Prince William, actors Richard E. Grant, Michelle Dockery and Sophie Okonedo, as well as Olympic swimming champion Adam Peaty will give readings linked to the theme of love and empathy. The event will be taped for broadcast on Christmas Eve by the British channel ITV1 and its streaming service ITVX. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/royalty	https://apnews.com/article/princess-kate-carols-christmas-service-mackesy-royal-fb2d9330ac9da508afbd2064d30440b5	2024-12-06T06:32:46-08:00	
Under assault by gangs in Haiti, a Kenyan-led mission fights back	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — An armored vehicle carrying Kenyan police rumbles through Haiti's capital with a shattered window that a high-caliber bullet failed to penetrate, a permanent sign of violence the officers face almost daily in Port-au-Prince. The Kenyans, who were deployed to Haiti earlier this year to help quell gang violence, have faced relentless attacks. On Thursday, gunfire erupted in Port-au-Prince as Kenyan officers repelled heavily armed gangs that run 85% of the city and are fighting to seize full control. The Kenyans, joined by Haitian officers, crouched behind sandbags and a concrete wall at the former offices of the National Police that authorities were forced to abandon in recent years by encroaching gangs. Bullets whizzed by as police kept their heads down low and returned fire. 'The days are numbered for the gangs,' Godfrey Otunge, commander of the United Nations-backed mission led by Kenya, told The Associated Press. 'Either you surrender … or we are coming for you.' Police face a daunting task. More than 4,500 people have been reported killed in Haiti so far this year, and another 2,060 injured, according to the U.N. Gang violence also has displaced an estimated 700,000 people in recent years as gunmen burn and pillage communities in a push to control more territory. A growing number of people have criticized the Kenyan-led mission, noting that police have not seized control of gang strongholds nor arrested any gang leaders. On patrol in their heavily armored vehicle, one of its windows previously damaged by a bullet strike, police returned fire with smoke rising from their automatic weapons. The vehicle lumbered past charred cars, makeshift blockades and the body of a person burned to death, the skull poking through a burned tire. Last week alone, some 42,000 people were left homeless, half of them children, according to UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency. An estimated six million people, including 3.3 million children, will need humanitarian aid next year, the agency said. Gang violence worsened last month as the United States and other countries pushed for a U.N. peacekeeping mission, noting that the current Kenyan-led mission lacks resources and funding.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-violence-kenya-police-united-nations-767d0ca23708d17631b41626a7168429	2024-12-06T05:55:15-08:00	
Where Turkey stands as opposition insurgents advance in neighboring Syria	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — As forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad make swift and significant advances in Syria, Turkey is watching closely for any spillover. Turkey, which shares a 911-kilometer- (566 mile-) long frontier with Syria, has been a main backer of opposition groups aiming to topple Assad since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011. The conflict led to a refugee influx and Turkey now hosts 3 million Syrians. Turkish officials have strongly rejected claims of any involvement in the offensive that is being led by the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham as well as an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Analysts however, believe that the offensive, which appears to be aligned with Turkey’s long-time goals, could not have gone ahead without Ankara's consent. It has allowed Turkey to push back against Kurdish forces in Syria allied to its sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday appeared to blame his Syrian counterpart, Bashar Assad, for the recent developments. 'We had made a call to Assad. We said, ‘Come, let’s meet, let’s determine the future of Syria together.’ Unfortunately, we could not get a positive response from Assad,' Erdogan said. 'These troublesome marches that continue throughout the region are not what we want.' Here’s a look at Turkey’s position, how the flareup could serve the country’s objectives and possible risks ahead: Ties with Syria Turkey has stated its support for Syria’s territorial integrity: the last thing it wants is a Kurdish-controlled autonomous region on it border. Ankara has conducted several incursions into Syria since 2016 with the aim of pushing back the Islamic State group or Kurdish militants and creating a buffer zone along its border, and now controls a stretch of territory in northern Syria. Turkey has called for a reduction of tensions and reconciliation between Syria’s government and the opposition. It has been involved in diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict, including holding talks with Assad’s main supporters, Russia and Iran. Recently Ankara has sought a reconciliation with Assad in order to mitigate the threat to Turkey from Kurdish militias and ensure the safe return of refugees. Assad has rebuffed Turkey’s overtures. Where Turkey stands Turkish officials have strongly rejected claims of involvement in the anti-government offensive, stating opposition to developments that increase instability in the region. 'All statements that claim Turkey provoked or that Turkey supported this are untrue. They are all lies,' said Omer Celik, spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party. 'What we want in Syria is not in any way an increase in violence or clashes.' Analysts say, however, that the rebel offensive would have been impossible without a green light from Turkey. Despite designating HTS as a terrorist organization, Turkey is believed to exert significant influence over the group. Turkish officials say Ankara stalled the offensive for months. Opposition forces finally went ahead with the assault after the Syrian government attacked opposition-held areas, violating agreements between Russia, Iran and Turkey to de-escalate the conflict. The offensive was initially meant to be limited, the officials said, but expanded after Syrian government forces began retreating from their positions. Gonul Tol, director of the U.S.-based Middle East Institutes' Turkish Program, says Ankara does not have full control over HTS, but has provided indirect support, allowing aid trucks to pass to the HTS stronghold of Idlib. The agreement between Turkey, Russia and Iran also helped the group to thrive, Tol said. Risks ahead The offensive could pose several risks to Turkey, including stoking tensions with Syria’s backers, Iran and Russia. Turkey, a NATO member, has sought to balance close relations with both Ukraine and Russia in the face of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of its southern neighbor. Increasing instability in Syria could send a new wave of refugees toward the Turkish border. Tol, who is the author of a book on Turkey and Syria, said that although Russia is preoccupied with the war in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin would be unwilling to see Assad fall. 'I doubt Russia is going to give up on Assad,' Tol said. 'Syria is just too important for Putin.' Alignment of goals The insurgents’ offensive has raised hopes that Turkey may achieve its strategic objectives in Syria, including securing its southern borders and facilitating the safe return of Syrian refugees. Since 2022, Turkey has sought to normalize relations with Syria. However, Assad insists on the withdrawal of Turkish troops from northern Syria, while Turkey maintains it cannot withdraw as long as threats from Kurdish militias persist. Analysts believe the offensive could pressure Assad into reconciliation with Turkey and engaging in negotiations with the Syrian opposition. Additionally, it may allow Turkey to push the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units, the YPG, away from its borders. Despite the YPG’s alliance with the U.S. against the Islamic State group, Turkey views it as a terrorist organization. Recently, another opposition force, the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, expelled the YPG from Tal Rifaat, north of Aleppo. The leader of Turkey’s nationalist party, an Erdogan ally, has called for targeting the Kurdish-held city of Manbij next. There are also hopes that opposition control of Aleppo will encourage refugees to return, with Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya noting that about 40% of Syrian refugees in Turkey are from Aleppo. However, Tol noted that Turkey may not be able to control the HTS as it forges ahead and pursues its own interests. 'The question is, will the HTS listen to Erdogan after having gained so much ground?' she said. Tol added: 'HTS are a wild card. Does Turkey really want a jihadist organization to be running a neighboring country?'	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-syria-insurgents-explainer-kurds-ypg-refugees-f60dc859c7843569124282ea750f1477	2024-12-06T04:37:34-08:00	
Sale of UK's Observer, world's oldest Sunday newspaper and a bastion of liberal values, is agreed	LONDON (AP) — The sale of the Observer, the world's oldest Sunday newspaper and a bastion of liberal values in Britain's media landscape, was approved Friday despite two days of strike action from journalists this week. The Scott Trust, the owner of the Guardian Media Group, which includes the Observer and its sister paper the Guardian, said the sale to Tortoise Media is expected to be signed in the coming days. The Scott Trust said it will invest in Tortoise Media, becoming a key shareholder, and take a seat on both its editorial and commercial boards. Under the terms of the deal, Tortoise will invest 25 million pounds ($32 million) in the Observer, which was founded in 1791 and became part of the Guardian Media Group in 1993, and has committed to continue its Sunday print edition and build up its digital brand. It has also committed to safeguarding journalistic freedom and the editorial independence of the Observer, undertaking to honor the 'liberal values and journalistic standards' of the Scott Trust in its editorial code. Tortoise was launched in 2019 by James Harding, a former editor of the London Times and director of news at the BBC, and the former U.S. ambassador to London, Matthew Barzun. Harding said the Observer name represents 'the best of liberal, pioneering journalism,' and promised readers that 'we will do all we can to live up to its history as a defender of human dignity and to give it a new lease of life as a powerful, progressive voice in the world.' Ole Jacob Sunde, who chairs the Scott Trust, said the Observer needed 'an ally to be sufficiently funded, long-term in nature and respect editorial independence and liberal values.' Journalists at both the Guardian, which publishes print editions between Monday and Saturday and has a deep digital footprint around the world, and the Observer, have protested the sale and went on a 48-hour strike on Wednesday and Thursday. Though the Guardian is clearly the bigger brand, especially in the digital space, the two newspapers had a very close relationship, operating from the same building in London and sharing resources. 'I recognize how unsettling this period has been for Observer staff but we’re confident we have agreed the best possible way forward for the title’s journalists, its readers and the future of both the Observer and the Guardian,' said Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief of Guardian News &amp; Media. Members of the National Union of Journalists from both papers will meet later Friday to consider next steps, its general secretary-elect Laura Davison said. 'The timing of the decision, before the end of two extremely well-supported days of action, is particularly shabby,' she said. Giao Pacey, a partner at media and entertainment law firm Simkins LLP, said the Observer's new leadership will have to be careful in safeguarding the value of the newspaper, which is intrinsically linked to its brand, established over centuries. 'Once the sale is completed, the leadership team will need to strike the right balance between preserving the legacy, culture and integrity of the business while ensuring that it has sufficient resources and support to thrive in a rapidly evolving market,' said Pacey.	https://apnews.com/article/guardian-observer-britain-sale-strikes-tortoise-media-f522a7438dfc52f04aa243da3b253761	2024-12-06T04:37:09-08:00	
Romania's top court annuls first round of presidential vote won by far-right candidate	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — A top Romanian court on Friday annulled the first round of the country's presidential election, days after allegations that Russia ran a coordinated online campaign to promote the far-right outside r who won the first round. The Constitutional Court’s unprecedented decision — which is final — came after President Klaus Iohannis declassified intelligence on Wednesday that alleged Russia ran a sprawling campaign comprising thousands of social media accounts to promote Calin Georgescu across platforms such as TikTok and Telegram. The intelligence files were from the Romanian Intelligence Service, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Special Telecommunication Service and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Despite being an outsider who declared zero campaign spending, Georgescu emerged as the frontrunner on Nov. 24. He was due to face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a runoff on Sunday. A new date will now be set to rerun the vote from scratch. Some 951 voting stations had already opened abroad on Friday for the runoff for Romania's large diaspora but had to be halted. Lasconi strongly condemned the court's decision, saying it was 'illegal, immoral, and crushes the very essence of democracy.' 'We should have moved forward with the vote. We should have respected the will of the Romanian people. Whether we like it or not, from a legal and legitimate standpoint, 9 million Romanian citizens, both in the country and the diaspora, expressed their preference for a particular candidate through their votes. We cannot ignore their will!' she said. 'I know I would have won. And I will win because the Romanian people know I will fight for them, that I will unite them for a better Romania,' she added. 'I will defend our democracy. I will not give up.' She said the issue of Russian interference should have been tackled after the election was completed. Some 9.4 million people — about 52.5% of eligible voters — had cast ballots in the first round. Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said in a statement the annulment was 'the only correct solution' following the intelligence drop which revealed the 'Romanian people’s vote was flagrantly distorted as a result of Russian interference.' 'The presidential elections must be held again,' he said in a post on Facebook. 'At the same time, investigations by the authorities must uncover who is responsible for the massive attempt to influence the outcome of the presidential election.' The same court last week ordered a recount of the first-round votes, which added to the myriad controversies that have engulfed a chaotic election cycle. Following a recount, the court then validated the first-round results on Monday. Many observers have expressed concerns that annulling the vote could trigger civil unrest. George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, said the development was a 'coup d’état in full swing' but urged people not to take to the streets. 'We don’t let ourselves be provoked, this system has to fall democratically,' he said. Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, said the court's decision amounts to a 'crisis mode situation for the Romanian democracy.' 'In light of the information about the external interference, the massive interference in elections, I think this was not normal but predictable, because it’s not normal times at all, Romania is an uncharted territory,' he told The Associated Press. 'The problem is here, do we have the institutions to manage such an interference in the future?' Thirteen candidates ran in the first round presidential vote in this European Union and NATO member country. The president serves a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments. On Dec. 1, Romania also held a parliamentary election which saw pro-Western parties win the most votes, but also a surge of support for far-right nationalists. Before the first round vote, most surveys predicted the top three candidates would be Ciolacu, who came in third place, and Simion or Lasconi in second place. As the surprising results came in with Georgescu on top, and Lasconi narrowly beating Ciolacu, it sent shockwaves through the political establishment and plunged it into turmoil. Georgescu’s surprising success in the presidential race left many political observers wondering how most local surveys were so far off, putting him behind at least five other candidates before the vote. Many observers attributed his success to his TikTok account, which now has 6 million likes and 541,000 followers. But some experts suspect Georgescu’s online following was artificially inflated while Romania’s top security body alleged he was given preferential treatment by TikTok over other candidates. In the intelligence release, the secret services alleged that one TikTok user paid more $381,000 (361,000 euros) to other users to promote Georgescu content. Intelligence authorities said information they obtained 'revealed an aggressive promotion campaign' to increase and accelerate his popularity. Georgescu, when asked by the AP in an interview Wednesday whether he believes the Chinese-owned TikTok poses a threat to democracy, defended social media platforms. 'The most important existing function for promoting free speech and freedom of expression is social media,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/romania-election-president-georgescu-court-585e8f8f3ce7013951f5c7cf4054179b	2024-12-06T04:19:49-08:00	
Thousands march through Greek capital on anniversary of fatal police shooting	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Several thousand people marched through the Greek capital on Friday on the anniversary of a fatal police shooting of a teenager in 2008, and minor violence broke out later as youths attacked police. No injuries or arrests were reported from clashes after the end of the march in Athens. Rioters threw fuel bombs and stones at riot police, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades in the central Exarcheia district where the 2008 shooting occurred. Alexandros Grigoropoulos, a 15-year-old high school student, was fatally shot by a police officer, sparking days of rioting. His death remains a rallying point for annual demonstrations by left-wing and student groups that often turn violent. Despite heavy rainfall in the Greek capital, some 5,000 police officers patrolled the city Friday, focusing on Exarcheia. Police deployed water cannon vehicles, drones and helicopters to monitor the demonstrations and maintained a strong presence near embassies and ministries. Road closures and traffic diversions were imposed for the march, while public transportation was disrupted and two central subway stations were closed for much of the day. A police officer arrested for the shooting of Grigoropoulos was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2010 but was released in 2019 after his sentence was reduced. That decision was upheld at a retrial three years later. A second officer was also convicted as an accomplice and released on parole after serving three years in prison.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-athens-shooting-anniversary-6180bdb61c1fb37a03fdf74be0c4c42c	2024-12-06T01:30:15-08:00	
In the 6-hour mayhem of South Korea's martial law, a woman's act of resistance was a defining moment	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — In the groundswell of fury and defiance that erupted among South Koreans after their president declared martial law, curtailing the country's hard-won freedoms, it was perhaps the iconic moment. As parliamentarians scrambled to get inside the National Assembly building to reverse the emergency measure, a woman in a leather coat confronted one of the soldiers who was trying to stop the lawmakers, grabbed his automatic rifle and tried to tug it away while yelling 'Aren't you ashamed?' As the soldier backed away, he raised the rifle's barrel toward the woman. She pressed on, grabbing it as it was pointed at her chest, still yelling, before he gave up, turned and walked away. Video of the encounter quickly went viral and became a social media rallying cry that helped fuel the six-hour outburst of protest before President Yoon Suk Yeol was forced to rescind the martial law order early Wednesday morning. But the woman in the leather coat, An Gwiryeong, told The Associated Press it was just one of many acts of resistance that cold Tuesday night in Seoul. 'I don't think my actions were that special, in fact, there were many people at the scene that day who were much braver than I was,' the 35-year-old said in an interview Friday in a parliamentary office. 'For example, the citizens who couldn’t enter the National Assembly were outside, blocking the armored vehicles and showing such courage,' she said. 'So I don’t think my actions were particularly special or braver than anyone else’s.' A former television anchor, An left her job at YTN television in 2022 and joined opposition leader Lee Jae-myung's presidential campaign in 2022 as a spokesperson. She was the Democratic Party's candidate for Dobong district in Seoul in the 2024 general election but lost, and is currently a party spokesperson. When Yoon declared martial law late on Tuesday, An, like many South Koreans, watched the 10:29 p.m. national address on television. Shocked at the announcement, she jumped into a taxi and headed for the National Assembly, one of the thousands of people who did the same. While South Korea’s president can declare martial law, which Yoon used to announce bans on anti-government demonstrations and political parties and controls on the media, the constitution allows the National Assembly to vote to end it. Following his announcement, Yoon dispatched police and soldiers to the National Assembly to prevent lawmakers from getting inside to hold a vote, and people like An streamed to the building to make sure that they could. 'When I arrived at the National Assembly, I could hear the sound of helicopters,' she recalled. 'The martial law troops were already in a standoff with the citizens.' She said troops were trying to enter the building, and she joined the growing throng of people trying to hold them back. 'I thought, we have to prevent that,' she said. 'If the entrance here is breached and the martial law troops get inside, they will block the vote, and then not only will the martial law not be lifted, but our country’s democracy will be over. There will be no next time.' That's when she found herself confronting a soldier in full battle gear, grabbed his rifle and tried to wrest it from him. 'At that moment, I thought, 'Is this real?' she recalled. 'I was scared because I’m just a human. But as I said, the thought that we must stop them was stronger than my fear. I didn’t feel it was real because armed soldiers with guns entering the National Assembly? I thought it was ridiculous.' An and the others succeeded, and enough lawmakers, including members of Yoon's own party, were able to get into the main hall of the assembly to form a quorum. Just after 1 a.m. they voted 190-0 to end martial law and the security forces began leaving the area minutes later. At 4:30 a.m. martial law was officially lifted following an emergency meeting of Yoon's Cabinet. But An stayed on at the National Assembly, unconvinced it was all over. 'I didn't know what might happen next,' she said. 'I couldn't let my guard down.' Eventually she did go home, but said it took until Thursday for her to start coming down from the adrenaline-fueled mayhem of that night. 'I've started to feel my body aching a bit as the tension has somewhat eased,' she said. Now, she said warily, it's a matter of seeing whether calls for Yoon's impeachment will be successful. 'I don't think it's over yet,' she said. ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.

Middle East latest: Negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire have resumed, Hamas says	A Hamas official says international mediators have resumed negotiations with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he is hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war is within reach. Ceasefire negotiations were halted last month when Qatar suspended talks with mediators from Egypt and the United States because of frustration over a lack of progress between Israel and Hamas. But Bassem Naim, an official in Hamas’ political bureau, said in Turkey on Thursday that there has been a 'reactivation' of efforts in recent days to end the fighting, release hostages from Gaza and free Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Iran, meanwhile, said Friday it conducted a successful space launch, the latest in a program the West alleges improves its missile technology. The announcement comes as heightened tensions grip the wider Middle East over Israel’s continued war with Hamas and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon. Israel's war against Hamas has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel in October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Israel’s blistering retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the Latest: Iran says it conducted a successful space launch in a program long criticized by the West MANAMA, Bahrain — Iran said Friday it conducted a successful space launch, the latest for its program the West alleges improves Tehran’s ballistic missile technology. Iran conducted the launch using its Simorgh program, a satellite-carrying rocket that had had a series of failed launches, at Iran’s Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province. That’s the site of Iran’s civilian space program. The Simorgh carried what Iran described as an 'orbital propulsion system,' as well as two research systems to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) orbit above the Earth. A system that could change the orbit of a spacecraft would allow Iran to geo-synchronize the orbits of its satellites. Tehran has long sought that ability. Iran also put the payload of the Simorgh at 300 kilograms (660 pounds), heavier than its previous successful launches. There was no immediate independent confirmation the launch was successful. The U.S. military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The announcement comes as heightened tensions grip the wider Middle East over Israel’s continued war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon. Australian leader blames antisemitism for arson that extensively damaged a Melbourne synagogue MELBOURNE, Australia — Arsonists extensively damaged a Melbourne synagogue on Friday in what Australia’s prime minister condemned as an antisemitic attack on Australian values. The blaze in the Adass Israel Synagogue is an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and Hamas last year. Cars and buildings have been vandalized and torched around Australia in protests inspired by the war. A witness who had come to the synagogue to pray saw two masked men spreading a liquid accelerant with brooms inside the building at 4:10 a.m., officials said. About 60 firefighters with 17 fire trucks responded to the blaze, which police said caused extensive damage. Investigators have yet to identify a motive, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese blamed antisemitism. 'This was a shocking incident to be unequivocally condemned. There is no place in Australia for an outrage such as this,' Albanese told reporters. 'To attack a place of worship is an attack on Australian values. To attack a synagogue is an act of antisemitism, is attacking the right that all Australians should have to practice their faith in peace and security,' he added. Hamas official says Gaza ceasefire talks have resumed after weekslong hiatus ISTANBUL — A Hamas official says international mediators have resumed negotiating with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he was hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war was within reach. Ceasefire negotiations were halted last month when Qatar suspended talks with mediators from Egypt and the United States because of frustration over a lack of progress between Israel and Hamas. But there has been a 'reactivation' of efforts in recent days to end the fighting, release hostages from Gaza and free Palestinian prisoners in Israel, according to Bassem Naim, an official in Hamas’ political bureau who spoke with The Associated Press in Turkey on Thursday. Another official familiar with the talks confirmed the return of Qatari mediators. The official spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations with the media. Since the talks broke down, there have been significant shifts in the global and regional landscape. Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, and a ceasefire was declared last week between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Trump is a staunch supporter of Israel, but Naim said he believes the incoming administration could 'affect the situation positively' given that Trump had made halting wars in the region part of his campaign platform. Trump this week called for the release of all hostages held in Gaza by the time he takes office on Jan. 20, saying there would be 'hell to pay' if that doesn’t happen. Attack near US base in eastern Syria may have wounded 3 service members, Pentagon says WASHINGTON -- Three U.S. service members were being evaluated for potential traumatic brain injuries following an attack near a base in eastern Syria this week, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday. Ryder said U.S. Central Command is still evaluating who was behind the attack near Mission Support Site Euphrates, which prompted the U.S. to conduct counter strikes on Tuesday. At the time, the Pentagon said rockets and mortars had landed in the vicinity of the base. The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria to conduct missions to counter the Islamic Stage group. ___ By Lolita Baldor	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-lebanon-news-6-december-2024-59b74360c1b44c99b47e1c6d80118bd1	2024-12-06T00:25:27-08:00	
Syrian insurgents enter 2 central towns, bringing them close to the city of Homs	BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian insurgents entered two central towns early Friday just north of the central city of Homs, bringing them closer Syria’s third largest city, an opposition war monitor and pro-government media both reported. The break into Rastan and Talbiseh came a day after opposition gunmen captured the central city of Hama, Syria’s fourth largest, after the Syrian army said it withdrew to avoid fighting inside the city and spare the lives of civilians. The insurgents, led by the jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, have said that they will march to Homs and Damascus, President Bashar Assad’s seat of power. The city of Homs, parts of which were controlled by insurgents until 2014, is a major intersection point between the capital, Damascus, and Syria’s coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus where Assad enjoys wide support. Homs province is Syria’s largest in size and borders Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. Insurgents are now 5 kilometers (3 miles) away from Homs, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor. 'The battle of Homs is the mother of all battles and will decide who will rule Syria,' said Rami Abdurrahman, the Observatory’s chief. Pro-government Sham FM said the insurgents entered Rastan and Talbiseh without facing any resistance. There was no immediate comment from the Syrian military on whether it has withdrawn from the towns. State news agency SANA quoted an unnamed military official as saying Friday that Syrian and Russian air force are attacking insurgents in Hama province, killing dozens of fighters. After the fall of Hama, opposition activists said that thousands of Homs residents who are loyal to Assad were seen fleeing toward Damascus and the coastal region. Syria’s defense minister said in a televised statement late Thursday that the withdrawal of government forces from Hama was a tactical measure and vowed to gain back lost areas. Gen. Ali Mahmoud Abbas said that the insurgents, whom he described as 'takfiri' or Muslim extremists, are backed by foreign countries. He did not name the countries but appeared to be referring to Turkey, which is a main backer of the opposition, and the United States. 'We are in a good position on the ground,' Abbas said, adding that Thursday’s withdrawal of the Syrian army from Hama was 'a temporary tactical measure and our forces are at the gates of Hama.' His comments were made before the insurgents marched south of Hama, getting close to Homs. The offensive is being led by HTS as well as an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Their sudden capture of the northern city of Aleppo, an ancient business hub, was a stunning prize for Assad’s opponents and reignited the conflict which had been largely stalemated for the past few years. ____ Associated Press writer Albert Aji contributed to this report from Damascus, Syria.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-08d18aa519dd9883eb291f5a534a02f3	2024-12-06T00:15:32-08:00	
Foreign minister says in interview that Russia will use 'all means' to defend its interests	MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s top diplomat said in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson released Friday that Moscow doesn't want a war with the United States but will use 'all means' to defend its interests. Sergey Lavrov argued that while Russia and the U.S. are officially not at war, Washington’s permission for Ukraine to use American longer-range missiles for strikes on Russian territory marked a dangerous escalation. 'It is obvious that the Ukrainians would not be able to do what they’re doing with long-range modern weapons without direct participation of the American servicemen. And this is dangerous, no doubt about this,' he said, adding that the Western belief that Russia's red lines could be 'moved again and again' is 'a very serious mistake.' Lavrov, the world’s longest-serving foreign minister who has been on the job for 20 years, said that a recent Russian strike on Ukraine with a new hypersonic intermediate range ballistic missile called Oreshnik was a signal to the West that Russia is prepared to use all means to achieve its goals in Ukraine. 'The message which we wanted to send by testing in real action this hypersonic system is that we will be ready to do anything to defend our legitimate interests,' he said. 'The United States, and the allies of the United States who also provide these long-range weapons to the Kyiv regime, they must understand that we would be ready to use any means not to allow them to succeed in what they call strategic defeat of Russia.' Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the Nov. 21 attack with Oreshnik as a response to Ukrainian strikes on Russian military facilities in Bryansk and Kursk regions with Western-supplied weapons. He has declared that in the case of new attacks on Russia with Western longer-range weapons, Russia could use Oreshnik to hit the government district in Kyiv. Putin also warned that Russia could use the new missile to strike military facilities of Kyiv’s Western allies that allow Ukraine to use their weapons for attacks on Russian territory. Putin hailed Oreshnik’s capability, saying that its multiple warheads that plunge to a target at 10 times the speed of sound are immune to intercept by any existing air defense systems. Russia’s missile forces chief said that the missile, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, has a range allowing it to reach all of Europe. Lavrov said that Russia has issued a warning to the U.S. about the Oreshnik launch 30 minutes before it happened using an automated system used to exchange such advance notices. He said that 'we hate even to think about war with the United States, which will take nuclear character,' but he warned that any potential exchange of nuclear strikes between Russia and NATO allies in Europe will inevitably escalate into a wider conflict in which the U.S. will be targeted. 'To speak about limited exchange of nuclear strikes is an invitation to disaster, which we don’t want to have,' Lavrov said. Speaking about the Kremlin conditions for a potential peace deal, he reaffirmed Putin’s demand that Ukraine should pull back its forces from the four regions that Russia annexed in September 2022 and renounce its bid to join NATO. He added that any peace agreement must secure the rights of Russian speakers in Ukraine. Asked about his view of Donald Trump, Lavrov described him as 'a very strong person, a person who wants results, who doesn’t like procrastination on anything.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-us-lavrov-carlson-ukraine-war-nuclear-d9bc9c0f7bf889e5babd33a57f4bd025	2024-12-05T23:41:15-08:00	
China's ban on key high-tech materials could have broad impact on industries, economy	BANGKOK (AP) — China has banned exports of key materials used to make a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, radar systems and CT scanners, swiping back at Washington after it expanded export controls to include dozens of Chinese companies that make equipment used to produce advanced computer chips. Both sides say their controls are justified by national security concerns and both accuse the other of 'weaponizing' trade. Analysts say the latest restrictions could have a wide impact on manufacturing in many industries and supply chains. 'Critical mineral security is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech trade war,' Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz of the Center for Strategic International Studies, wrote in a report on Beijing's decision. The full impact will depend partly on whether U.S. industries can compensate for any loss of access to the strategically important materials, equipment and components. Here’s why this could be a tipping point in trade conflict between the two biggest economies, coming at a time when antagonisms already were expected to heat up once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, given his vows to hike tariffs on imports of Chinese-made products. WHAT DID CHINA DO AND WHY? China has banned, in principle, exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and antimony — critical minerals needed to make advanced semiconductors, among many other types of equipment. Beijing also tightened controls on exports of graphite, which is used in EV and grid-storage batteries. China is the largest source for most of these materials and also dominates refining of those materials, which are used both for consumer goods and for military purposes. The limits announced Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. Next on the list of potential bans, experts say: tungsten, magnesium and aluminum alloys. WHAT DID THE US DO AND WHY? The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced its measures after the U.S. government ordered a slew of new measures meant to prevent sales to China of certain types of advanced semiconductors and the tools and software needed to make them. Washington also expanded its 'entity list' of companies facing strict export controls to include 140 more companies, nearly all of them based in China or Chinese-owned. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the revised rules were intended to impair China’s ability to use advanced technologies that 'pose a risk to our national security.' The updated regulations also limit exports to China of high-bandwidth memory chips that are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence. Export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with the 140 companies newly added to the 'entity list,' as well as the dozens of others already on the list. The aim, officials said, is to stop Chinese companies from leveraging U.S. technology to make their own semiconductors. The Biden administration has been expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls while encouraging an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. and other Western countries. Washington also extended the restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor technology to companies in other countries, though it excluded companies in key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands that are thought to have adequate export controls of their own. HOW IMPORTANT ARE THOSE MATERIALS? In a word: very. For the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other producers of advanced technology and components, access to materials with such properties as high conductivity is crucial: gallium and germanium increasingly are used in advanced semiconductors in place of silicon. The materials subject to Chinese export controls are among 50 the United States Geologic Survey has designated as 'critical minerals' — non-fuel minerals essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption. Gallium topped that list. It is needed to make the same high-bandwidth memory chips the U.S. wants to avoid allowing China to access for use in artificial intelligence and defense applications. It's used to make LEDs, lasers and magnets used in many products. Germanium is used for optical fiber and solar panels, among other uses. A USGS study recently estimated the likely total cost to the U.S. economy from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at more than $3 billion. But the situation is complicated. China imposed licensing requirements on exports of both metals in July 2023. It has not exported either to the U.S. this year, according to Chinese customs data. Antimony exports also have plunged. China produces the lion's share of most critical minerals, but there are alternatives. Japan also imports nearly all of its gallium, for example, but it also extracts it by recycling scrap metal. Washington has been moving to tap sources other than China, forming a 'Minerals Security Partnership' with the EU and 15 other countries. President Joe Biden's visit to Africa this week highlighted that effort. Potential supply disruptions also have spurred efforts to tap U.S. deposits of rare earths and other critical materials in southeastern Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, Minnesota and parts of the American Southwest. Germanium has been extracted from zinc mined in Alaska and Tennessee and the U.S. government has a stockpile. The Department of Defense has a recycling program that can extract scrap germanium from night vision lenses and tank turret windows. But China's dominance as a supplier gives it an overwhelming cost advantage, and U.S. resource companies face strong pressures over the potential environmental impact of mines and refineries. WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN NEXT? Since then-President Trump launched a trade war against Beijing that has ramped up over time, China has adopted a relatively constrained and cautious approach in responding to the U.S. limits on access to advanced technology. Much depends on the future course of overall relations. It is unclear if Trump will follow through on his vows to push tariffs sharply higher once he takes office or if such declarations are the opening gambits in future trade negotiations. China hit back with its own tariff hikes, but excluded many items crucial for its own economy. It sanctioned certain companies, especially defense contractors doing business with Taiwan, but refrained from outright bans on exports of vital materials to the U.S. This time may be different. Just after China's Commerce Ministry announced its export ban, various Chinese industry associations including automakers and the China Semiconductor Association issued statements denouncing Washington's moves to curb access to strategically sensitive technologies and declaring that U.S. computer chips are unreliable. Beijing's announcement also extends its ban on exporting Chinese-produced gallium and other critical minerals to the U.S. to apply to all countries, entities and individuals, saying violators will 'be held accountable according to law.'	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-gallium-critical-tech-ban-711fdfcb7c09e0e0e6374192fd2e24fa	2024-12-05T23:24:08-08:00	
American tenor Brian Jagde gets last-minute call to sing in La Scala's gala season premiere	MILAN (AP) — American tenor Brian Jagde was just wrapping up Verdi’s 'La Forza del Destino' in Barcelona last month when he got a last-minute offer to sing the same role in La Scala’s gala season premiere this Saturday, arguably the opera world’s most prestigious gig. Jagde’s appearance as Don Alvaro opposite soprano Anna Netrebko will mark his third performance at Milan’s storied Teatro alla Scala. He appeared twice as a substitute tenor opposite Netrebko, replacing Roberto Alagna in 'Turandot' this summer, and now he will replace Jonas Kaufmann in the coveted season opener. 'I’m happy to be their guy,’’ Jagde told The Associated Press in a phone interview. While it is not unheard of for Americans to sing on La Scala’s opening night, a highlight of the European cultural calendar, it remains a rarity in an opera house where Europeans tend to dominate. Beside Maria Callas last century, American Brian Hymel opened the 2016 season in 'Madame Butterfly' and Lisette Oropesa was cast in 'Lucia di Lammermoor' but sang in a gala concert to an empty theater when the 2020 season premiere was shuttered by the pandemic. In 2008, American tenor Stuart Neill was promoted from understudy to the 'Don Carlo' opening night cast after the headlining tenor made too many dress rehearsal mistakes. Neill received generous applause from the tough La Scala crowd. 'It's definitely one of the things that every artist dreams about,’’ Jagde said. 'I think it is about the artist and meeting the moment at the right time. I think that is more of what it's about than necessarily where they are from.' Jagde said singers are drawn to La Scala's 'rich tradition.' 'Every artist wants to not just perform there, but have great success there,' Jagde said. 'The public is known to be a very devoted fanship — and they can love you or they can hate you. You really want to be embraced by that audience specifically.' So far, the reviews from La Scala’s upper balconies of exacting opera fans have been positive on his previous two outings, Jagde said, adding that artists should accept all feedback. 'It’s our job as artists to embrace the fact that we are making people feel something. Whatever they feel is appropriate to them,' he said. Jagde, 45, grew up outside of New York City, and started singing in musicals in high schools and choirs in college, but never gave a thought to the opera. He started studying computer science and business upstate but then a classical music program at Purchase College closer to home grabbed his attention, thinking it might lead him to Broadway. 'I didn’t know at the time that classical voice meant opera,' he said laughing. He got accepted off the waiting list, and quickly fell in love with opera as the purest expression of the unadulterated voice. 'I remember being on stage and experiencing something I had never experienced on stage before, which was a completely acoustic, magical sound,' Jagde said. 'This was completely natural, hearing an orchestra underneath me, and my voice carrying over that. I remember committing full-heartedly (to opera) on stage at the moment.' His college teachers pegged him as a baritone, and he spent eight years doing auditions and artists programs in that range until he realized that 'I was still warming up to high Cs and still had no low notes.' Once he started auditioning as a tenor, the offers started rolling in. He made his principal role debut at the Metropolitan opera in 2021 in the role of Cavaradossi in 'Tosca,' and has sung on such renowned stages as the Paris Opera, the Vienna Staatsoper and Naples' Teatro di San Carlo. During the 2023/24 season, he warmed up his Don Alvaro at the Metropolitan Opera House and London's Royal Opera House. His La Scala debut last spring was as Turiddu in 'Cavalleria rusticana.' La Scala general manager Dominique Meyer said his only consideration in casting an opera is whether a singer 'is up to the role.' Jagde, he said, is among five or six tenors who could sing the Don Alvaro role, 'and he was available.' Jagde finished his Barcelona performances on Nov. 18, and showed up for rehearsals at La Scala the next day. Don Alvaro, he said, is a role, 'that has kind of grown with me, as I have grown as an artist.' Jagde said singing alongside an international opera star like Netrebko for the second time this year will help take some of the jitters out of the gala premiere. 'She is a wonderful colleague. She is a good person to work with, always available to you. She is nothing but smiles and fun,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/la-scala-jagde-season-premiere-a31b6d539097d696b6cb31e7998aafab	2024-12-05T22:36:14-08:00	
Ailing kids wait months for Israeli permission to leave Gaza for treatment. Some die in the meantime	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The 12-year-old Palestinian boy was lying in a hospital bed in central Gaza, wracked with leukemia, malnourished and whimpering in pain despite the morphine doctors were giving him, when Rosalia Bollen, a UNICEF official, said she saw him in late October. Islam al-Rayahen’s family had asked Israeli authorities six times over the past months for permission to evacuate him from Gaza for a desperately needed stem cell transplant, Bollen said. Six times, the request was refused for unexplained security reasons, she said. Islam died three days after she saw him, Bollen said. Thousands of patients in Gaza are waiting for Israeli permission for urgently needed medical evacuation from Gaza for treatment of war wounds or chronic diseases they can’t get after the destruction of much of the territory’s health care system by Israel’s 15-month military campaign. Among them are at least 2,500 children who UNICEF says must be transported immediately. 'They cannot afford to wait. These children will die. They’re dying in waiting and I find it striking that the world is letting that happen,' Bollen said. The Israeli military often takes months to respond to medical evacuation requests, and the number of evacuations has plunged in recent months. In some cases, the military rejects either the patient or, in the case of children, the caregivers accompanying them on vague security grounds or with no explanation. The Israeli decisions appear to be 'arbitrary and are not made on a criteria nor logic,' said Moeen Mahmood, the Jordan country director for Doctors Without Borders. COGAT, the Israeli military agency in charge of humanitarian affairs for Palestinians, said in a statement to The Associated Press that it 'makes every effort to approve the departure of children and their families for medical treatments, subject to a security check.' It did not respond when asked for details about Islam's case. A military official said Israel's internal intelligence service reviews whether the patient or their escort have what he called 'a connection to terrorism,' and if one is found they are refused. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential procedures. Osaid Shaheen, who is nearly 2, now faces having his eyes removed after Israel rejected his evacuation for treatment of cancer in his retinas. The toddler was diagnosed with the cancer in April, after his mother, Sondos Abu Libda, noticed his left eyelid was droopy. The World Health Organization requested his evacuation through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza, but the crossing was shut down in May when Israeli troops took it over in an offensive, Abu Libda said. WHO applied again, this time for Osaid to leave through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Israel, now the only route for evacuees to travel. During the long wait, the cancer spread to the child’s other eye and reached stage 4. In November, Abu Libda was told Osaid was rejected on security grounds with no further explanation. She was stunned, she said. 'I didn’t expect that a child could get a security rejection.' Doctors have given the boy three doses of chemotherapy. But with supplies short in Gaza, they’re struggling to get more. If they can’t, they will have to remove Osaid's eyes or the cancer will spread to other parts of his body, Abu Libda said. 'He’s just a child. How will he live his life without seeing? How will he play? How will he see his future and how will his life turn out?' Abu Libda asked, standing outside the house where her family is sheltering in the Beni Suheil district of southern Gaza. Nearby, little Osaid — who so far still has his sight — toddled around in the rubble of a building destroyed by Israeli forces, smiling as he played with chunks of rubble. When asked about his case, COGAT did not reply. WHO says 14,000 patients of all ages need medical evacuation from Gaza, the territory's Health Ministry puts the number higher, at 22,000, including 7,000 patients in extreme need who could die soon without treatment, according to Mohamed Abu Salmeya, a ministry official in charge of evacuation referrals. Since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, 5,230 patients have been evacuated, said Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson. Since May, when the Rafah crossing shut down, the rate has slowed down, with only 342 patients evacuated, she said, an average of less than two a day. Before the war, when Israeli permission was also necessary, around 100 patients a day were transferred out of Gaza, according to WHO. More than 44,500 Palestinians have been killed and more than 105,000 wounded by Israel’s bombardment and ground offensives, launched in retaliation for Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The casualty toll, by Gaza’s Health Ministry, does not distinguish combatants from civilians — but more than half are women and children. Gaza’s health system has been decimated, with only 17 of the territory’s original 36 hospitals functioning — and those only partially. They struggle with the waves of war wounded on top of patients with other conditions. Carrying out specialized surgeries or treatments in Gaza is difficult or impossible, with equipment destroyed, some specialist doctors killed or arrested and medical supplies limited. Gaza’s only dedicated cancer hospital was seized by Israeli troops early in the war, heavily damaged and has been shut down. Doctors without Borders said in August, it sought to evacuate 32 children along with their caregivers, but only six were allowed to leave. In November, it applied for eight others, including a 2-year-old with leg amputations, but Israeli authorities blocked evacuation, it said The military official said five of the eight requests in November were approved but the caregivers trying to travel with the children were rejected on security grounds. The official said Doctors Without Borders would have to resubmit the requests with alternate escorts. The official didn't say why the other three children weren't approved. The rejected caregivers were the children's mothers and grandmothers, said Mahmood, the Doctor's Without Borders official, who said no explanation was given for the security concern. Children long waiting for permission face dire consequences if they don’t get treatment. Nima al-Askari said doctors told her that 4-year-old Qusay could become paralyzed if her son doesn’t get surgery in the next two or three months for a heart defect that constricts his aorta. 'Should I wait until my son becomes paralyzed?' al-Askari said. 'Everyone is telling me to wait until he gets evacuated. ... This is my only son. I can’t see him in a wheelchair.' Asma Saed said she has been waiting for three months to hear whether her 2-year-old son, Al-Hassan, can travel for treatment for kidney failure. In the meantime, they are living in a squalid tent camp in Khan Younis, with little clean water or food. She said her son doesn’t sleep, screaming all night. 'I wish I could see him like any child in the world who can move, walk, and play,' she said. 'He’s a child, he can’t express his pain.' ___ Khaled reported from Cairo.

Iran says it conducted a successful space launch in a program long criticized by West	MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) — Iran said Friday it conducted a successful space launch, the latest for its program the West alleges improves Tehran’s ballistic missile program. Iran conducted the launch using its Simorgh program, a satellite-carrying rocket that had had a series of failed launches, at Iran's Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province. That's the site of Iran's civilian space program. The Simorgh carried what Iran described as an 'orbital propulsion system,' as well as two research systems to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) orbit above the Earth. The system could allow Iran to change the orbit of a spacecraft, something Tehran long has wanted to have geo-synchronized orbits for its satellites. Iran also put the payload of the Simorgh at 300 kilograms (660 pounds), heavier than its previous successful launches. There was no immediate independent confirmation the launch was successful. The U.S. military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The announcement comes as heightened tensions grip the wider Middle East over Israel’s continued war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon. The United States has previously said Iran’s satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran’s ballistic missile program expired in October 2023. 'Iran’s work on space-launch vehicles — including its Simorgh — probably would shorten the timeline to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, if it decided to develop one, because the systems use similar technologies,' a U.S. intelligence community report released in July said. Under Iran’s relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. The late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a protégé of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May. Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who has been signaling he wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions, has yet to offer strategy when it comes to Iran's ambitions in space. The Simorgh launch represented the first for his administration from the country's civil space program. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard conducted a successful launch in its parallel program in September. Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for 'several' nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003. ___ Associated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-space-launch-mideast-tensions-26b332d54d39173db8524b006848b6c8	2024-12-05T21:18:32-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian stocks are mixed after Wall Street falls ahead of key US jobs report	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks were mixed Friday after Wall Street retreated from record highs as investors awaited a U.S. jobs report due later in the day. U.S. futures were lower and oil prices were little changed. This week’s highlight for markets will be Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. government, which will show how many people employers hired and fired last month. A report on Thursday said the number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits rose last week but remains at historically healthy levels. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.8% to 39,091.17. The U.S. dollar rose to 150.14 Japanese yen from 150.10 yen. Chinese stocks rallied. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.6% to 19,873.90 and the Shanghai Composite index surged 1% to 3,402.80. Markets are watching for the outcome of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week. Analysts said policymakers might lean toward caution as they brace for President-elect Donald Trump's moves on tariffs and trade. South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.6% to 2,428.16. On Friday, South Korea’s ruling party chief showed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked that earlier this week. Yoon is facing calls to resign and be investigated and may be impeached. Thousands of protesters have marched in the streets and thousands of autoworkers and other members of the Korean Metal Workers’ Union, one of the country’s biggest umbrella labor groups, began partial strikes Thursday to protest against Yoon. The union said its members will begin indefinite strikes starting on Wednesday if Yoon does not leave office by then. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 lost 0.6% to 8,420.90. Bitcoin briefly burst above $103,000 on Thursday before pulling back after exceeding $100,000 for the first time following President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of financier Paul Atkins, who’s seen as a crypto advocate, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin was trading at 98,093.07 early Friday, according to CoinDesk. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.2% to 6,075.11 but it's still set to close out one of its best years of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% to 44,765.71, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% from its own record set the day before to close at 19,700.26. Solid consumer spending is a key reason the U.S. economy has avoided a recession that had seemed inevitable after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to crush inflation. But shoppers are now contending with still-high prices and a slowing job market. Expectations are high that the Fed will cut its main interest rate again when it meets before Christmas. The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September, hoping to offer more support for the job market. Also Thursday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.17% from 4.18% late Wednesday. In other dealings Friday, benchmark U.S. crude lost 14 cents to $68.16 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was down 18 cents at $72.03 a barrel. The euro inched down to $1.0570 from $1.05895 after French President Emmanuel Macron announced Thursday local time that he plans to stay in office until the end of his term and to name a new prime minister within days. This comes after far-right and left-wing lawmakers approved a no-confidence motion due to budget disputes, forcing Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet to resign.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-jobs-china-bitcoin-f066b9725ca1eaf8de1fa700555920e4	2024-12-05T20:15:40-08:00	
Notre Dame's reopening will begin with an archbishop's knock on the doors. Here's what comes next	PARIS (AP) — The reopening this weekend of Notre Dame is a succession of ceremonies to breathe life back into the iconic cathedral and celebrate the recovery from its devastating fire in 2019. High points will be the ritualized reopening of the cathedral's massive doors, the reawakening of its thunderous organ and the celebration of the first Mass. For both France and the Catholic Church, the televised and tightly scripted ceremonies will be an opportunity to display can-do resilience and global influence. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and dozens of heads of state and government accepted invites from French President Emmanuel Macron. The Catholic faithful are so eager to worship again inside Notre Dame that tickets for the first week of Masses were snapped up in 25 minutes, the cathedral's rector says. During part one of Notre Dame's rebirth on Saturday evening, Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will lead more than 1,500 guests through a reopening service. Part two, on Sunday, is an inaugural Mass, with special rites to consecrate the main altar. Open, great doors On Saturday, Ulrich will first reopen Notre Dame's great doors — by tapping them with his crosier, or bishop's staff. The staff was created for the occasion by designer Sylvain Dubuisson. The wood — bearing visible black traces from the blaze — was made with pieces of the cathedral roof that collapsed in the inferno, Dubuisson told The Associated Press. In response to the archbishop's door-knocks, the cathedral will erupt into song, its choirs once again filling the cavernous spaces. That back-and-forth will happen three times. The doors will then open so guests can stream inside past their sculptures of biblical figures. Reawakening the great organ The voice of Notre Dame's great organ hasn't been heard in public since the blaze coated the nearly 8,000 pipes with toxic dust released when the lead roofing burned. After the door-opening rites, Ulrich will reawaken the giant instrument. He'll address it directly with a series of eight incantations, starting with 'Awaken, organ, sacred instrument: Sing the praise of God.' That prompt will launch a conversation with the organ, with four organists (Olivier Latry, Vincent Dubois, Thibault Fajoles and Thierry Escaich) taking turns to play its responses. They'll be perched high above the congregation, seated at the newly renovated giant console that controls the instrument — through five keyboards of 56 notes each, foot pedals for 30 notes, and 115 stops. Off-the-cuff responses Latry says he and the other organists will improvise their responses to the archbishop's prompts — depending on their own and the congregation's mood. 'Since it's improvisation, you really need to feel the moment,' Latry told AP. 'When I am there, I will know what I am going to do. Before that, I simply have a few ideas but the ideas are not fully formed — because they will change depending on the atmosphere, the lighting, the people who'll be down below, their reaction.' The organ has a vast palette of sounds to play with. The deepest of its 7,952 pipes are as large as a human torso, producing a low rumbling sound. The smallest are no larger than a pen. The painstaking re-tuning of the organ — after it was dismantled, cleaned and put back together — took around six months, with tuners working at night so they could tweak the notes in silence. Billionaires and poor Parisians among the guests Before the fire, efforts to fund renovations of the nearly 900-year-old cathedral had been struggling. But that changed with the blaze. 'We had an outpouring of support,' says fund-raising committee member Michel Picaud. 'I received 400 donations an hour, so my smartphone completely crashed.' In all, 340,000 people from more than 150 countries donated 846 million euros (US$364 million), the public body in charge of Notre Dame's restauration says. The support testifies to global affection for the monument that transcends frontiers and faiths. 'It’s something which belongs to everybody,' Picaud told AP. The nonprofit he leads, Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, has raised $57 million from 50,000 international donors, most of them Americans. 'It’s not only a Parisian cathedral or monument,' he said. 'All over the world, I think, people have the feeling that this is part of their — I would say — heritage.' At the reopening, billionaire donors from France and beyond will rub shoulders with other guests far less fortunate. They'll include 'the poorest among Parisians, all those who are helped by charitable associations and who will be several hundred inside the cathedral,' Rev. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, Notre Dame's rector, told AP. Primped for the occasion Although construction work continues outside, the restored interiors look more magnificent than they have for generations. The limestone walls are creamy and luminous, cleaned of years of accumulated grime. Vaulted ceilings that collapsed have been repaired. The archbishop and other members have new garments, from a designer who has also dressed Beyoncé, Rihanna and others. The cathedral also has new furniture, including a new altar to replace one crushed when the flaming spire collapsed. The rector says 'no one alive has seen the cathedral' as it looks now. 'The blondness of the stone, the brilliance of the paintings, the light through the stained glass windows, all the artworks, all the paintings, that were cleaned, the statues that were restored,' he said. 'All of that did not exist before the fire.' ___ AP journalists Thomas Adamson and Alex Turnbull contributed to this report. ___ For more of AP’s coverage on Notre Dame, visit https://apnews.com/hub/notre-dame-cathedral	https://apnews.com/article/france-paris-notre-dame-trump-macron-religion-fire-e76aee3fdb9d391943e7955424d330cc	2024-12-05T20:09:01-08:00	
Russia's LGBTQ+ community is living in fear following new laws and court rulings, activists say	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Gela Gogishvili and Haoyang Xu led a happy life as a gay couple in Russia, even as President Vladimir Putin’s government took an increasingly anti-LGBTQ+ stance. Their social media posts and videos drew thousands of followers, and they were greeted by them sometimes on the streets in Kazan, in Russia's Tatarstan region, where Gogishvili was a pharmacist and Xu, from China, studied international relations at a university. But the online threats began after the Kremlin in December 2022 expanded its ban of 'propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations' from minors to adults, effectively outlawing any public endorsement of LGBTQ+ activities. Then came the complaints about them to authorities. They were detained in 2023 and accused of spreading 'LGBT propaganda' among minors. Gogishvili was given a hefty fine, while Xu was put in a detention center for migrants to await deportation. They eventually fled abroad separately. Now reunited in France, where they’re seeking asylum, they look with concern at Russia, where new, even harsher anti-LGBTQ+ measures have been adopted. Just over a year ago, Russia’s Supreme Court effectively outlawed any LGBTQ+ activism in a ruling that designated 'the international LGBT movement' as extremist. The move exposed anyone in the community or connected to it to criminal prosecution and prison, ushering in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. 'I’m scared for the queer community in Russia that remains in the country,' Gogishvili told The Associated Press. Linking LGBTQ+ rights to the war in Ukraine That community in Russia has been under legal and public pressure for over a decade but especially since the Kremlin sent troops to Ukraine in 2022. Putin has argued that the war is a proxy battle with the West, which he says aims to destroy Russia and its 'traditional family values' by pushing for LGBTQ+ rights. Putin insists Russia isn't discriminating against LGBTQ+ people, but he also decries 'perversions that lead to degradation and extinction.' Parliament Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin last year called gender transitioning 'pure satanism' and 'diabolical policy' that should stay in the U.S. Any public representation of gay and transgender people is banned. Gender-affirming medical care and changing one’s gender in official documents are prohibited. With the Supreme Court's ruling in November 2023, anyone involved with the LGBTQ+ community could be imprisoned for up to six years. As a result, many left the country. But others remain -– and find themselves in a community pushed into the shadows, marginalized even further and dogged by fear of repression. 'Six years, it's not a joke,' Olga Baranova, head of the Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives, said in an interview from outside Russia. ''What is worth me going to prison for six years?' Every person who's doing something right now (in LGBTQ+ activism in Russia) has to answer this question these days.' Targeting nightclubs, rainbow flags and gay tourism Just days after the Supreme Court ruling, the LGBTQ+ community was rattled by news of police raiding gay bars, nightclubs and venues that hosted drag shows in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities. Last spring, the first criminal case on charges of involvement with the 'LGBT movement' extremist group was lodged against the owner and the staff of a bar in the southwestern city of Orenburg that held drag performances. A handful of similar cases came elsewhere. Charges have been launched for displaying symbols such as a rainbow flag — even though many of those accused had nothing to do with the LGBTQ+ community, said human rights lawyer Max Olenichev. More raids of bars and nightclubs were reported in Moscow last month, almost exactly a year since the Supreme Court ruling. State media quoted law enforcement as saying they targeted those spreading 'LGBT propaganda.' One man arrested for allegedly running a travel agency for gay customers faces charges of organizing activities of an extremist organization. Independent news outlet Mediazona reported that Andrei Kotov rejected the charges and said in court that law enforcement officers beat him and administered electric shocks during the arrest, even though he didn’t resist. On Nov. 23, Putin signed into law a bill banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender-affirming care is legal. He also approved legislation outlawing the spread of material that encourages people not to have children. 'All this, in general, speaks more about the desire of the authorities to create some kind of atmosphere of fear. It's not repressions, it's terror,' said Vladimir, an LGBTQ+ rights advocate in Russia who like many interviewed by AP asked to be identified only by a first name out of security concerns. Ikar, a fellow activist and transgender man, described the actions by authorities as 'an attempt to intimidate ... to make people lose their social connections, stay silent, stay home.' Going underground, online or abroad Vladimir and Ikar belong to an underground LGBTQ+ rights group that offers legal aid and holds offline events without fanfare. Activists thoroughly verify identities of anyone seeking its help. The group is seeing a growing number of cases related to violence against LGBTQ+ people, Vladimir said. Some regional organizations have shut down completely; others operate openly, but in a drastically different way. The Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives moved its community-building efforts into a sprawling online network of chats and Zoom meeting rooms, according to Baranova. 'Our strategy today is to preserve the community in some form and size at least, for the people to just know each other, support each other,' she said. Center T, a prominent trans rights group, closed its Moscow shelter after visits from police and opened one in Yerevan, Armenia, said group leader Yan Dvorkin. Center T helps emigres as well as those still in Russia to find doctors and medical care, trying to resolve crises and still be a part of a community, if only online. Anna, a 25-year-old transgender woman in Moscow, said being part of the community provided the courage to transition. 'I can’t imagine what it’s like for new people, who are only opening up the possibility for themselves,' she said. Anna transitioned and came out to her family and friends last year, after the ban on gender-affirming care was enacted. The ban and other repressive laws and rulings hit the already-vulnerable transgender community hard, Dvorkin said. Finding a job has become more difficult, both for those who haven’t changed their gender marker in documents and those who have, he said. Access to gender-affirming medical care is a major issue, with doctors wary of working with transgender people and with many turning to shoddy underground medications. Violence against transgender people has spiked, as has harassment and discrimination, Dvorkin said. 'Nowadays, you can intimidate people — blackmail them — by (saying) that ‘I will report you and you will go to prison for extremism,’' the activist said. Those who stay in Russia, despite the risks Anna considers herself lucky and 'privileged.' She has a well-paying job, can afford a doctor advising her from abroad on hormonal therapy, and can get the medicine in Moscow. She wouldn't elaborate on how and where she gets it, so authorities 'don’t pull the plug.' But she said she hasn’t come out to her colleagues for fear of losing her job, and she is sometimes harassed on the street because of her appearance. Her identity documents can't be changed under the ban. She says she has a support network of friends and doesn’t want to leave Russia, even though she’s acutely aware of the risks. 'I somehow have managed to adapt,' she said. 'I know how to live here.' Yulia, another transgender woman, also vowed to stay, describing it as sort of a mission to show that 'people like me are not necessarily weak, are not necessarily useless.' In her mid-40s, Yulia has a family and children, a successful career in a male-dominated industry, and the respect and acceptance from her colleagues and friends. For her, 'it’s about normalizing' being trans, she said. How much 'normalizing' is possible in the current climate and the years ahead is still an open question. The ban on 'propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations' forces print, TV and movie censorship of LGBTQ+ relations. In a recent example, two Russian streaming services cut a transgender character from the 1990 drama series 'Twin Peaks.' At the same time, there is abundant official rhetoric from politicians, the Russian Orthodox clergy and media figures condemning LGBTQ+ people. Many like Gela Gogishvili, the gay man who fled Russia last year, worry about the next generation of LGBTQ+ people. He said he's 'even more scared for those who are born there and are currently growing up -– from their childhood years onwards, they will be taught that (being queer) is bad.' 'Like it was with me,' Gogishvili adds. 'I couldn’t accept myself until I was 20 years old.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-lgbtq-crackdown-putin-moscow-aef5650c6fdadbe1ac13e0d0b9f93f3b	2024-12-05T20:04:06-08:00	
Belarus seeks to copy neighboring Russia’s repressive LGBTQ+ policies, activists say	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — As police raided the home of a gay couple in the Belarusian capital of Minsk and brutally beat them, the officers didn't hide that the crackdown was aligned to similar moves in neighboring Russia. The students, Andrei and Sasha, said security forces demanded that they unlock their smartphones and surrender the names of 'gays in Minsk and Moscow.' 'They slammed our heads against the door frame, threatened to report us to the university and said that this was just the beginning,' said Andrei, 20, who like other gay and transgender Belarusians interviewed by The Associated Press insisted on being identified only by his first name because of safety concerns. 'They wanted to expose an ‘underground network’ of gay people in Belarus, following the example of Russia,' he said of the autumn raid. 'They openly told us that if it is banned in Russia, then it should be banned in Belarus too.' Belarus decriminalized homosexuality in 1994 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but the deeply conservative country under authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko doesn’t recognize same-sex marriages, and there are no laws protecting LGBTQ+ rights. Russian President Vladimir Putin adopted repressive laws curtailing LGBTQ+ rights in recent years, and close ally Belarus is poised to follow suit, proposing legislation to ban 'gay propaganda.' While still to be defined in Belarus, the Russian version bans any endorsement of LGBTQ+ activities and nontraditional sexual relations. But even before the measure is drafted, life has gotten worse for the LGBTQ+ community in Belarus, rights advocates say. They say 32 people were detained and beaten in seven cities in the last three months, including 10 transgender or nonbinary individuals and activists. Some were released after questioning, fined and allowed to emigrate, they say, while several remain in custody, facing charges of 'disseminating pornography' and up to four years in prison. More people probably have been detained but might be afraid to contact advocates, according to LGBTQ+ rights group TG House Belarus. Lukashenko 'uses repressions against the LGBTQ+ community in order to gain some kind of praise from Russian authorities and shore up support among conservative residents of Belarus,' said the group's coordinator, Alisa Sarmant. 'To a large extent, it’s a carbon copy of what is happening in Russia, but in Belarus all these discriminatory practices take on uglier and harsher forms,' Sarmant said. Moscow has close ties with Minsk, using Belarusian territory as a springboard for the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Last year, the Russian Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism, designating 'the international LGBT movement' as an extremist group. 'We will also need to take similar measures,' said Natalya Kochanova, Lukashenko’s closest adviser and speaker of the upper chamber of parliament. 'We have family values, traditions we pass from generation to generation -– traditions of family, Orthodox Christianity,' she said, echoing the Kremlin line. After Russia banned gender transitioning last year, transgender individuals in Belarus began having problems, even though the procedures are not forbidden. According to Sarmant, the government this year rejected over 80% of those seeking official authorization for gender-affirming procedures and changing their gender marker in official documents. By comparison, 10%-15% were rejected in 2020, she said. Among other issues, she lists 'catastrophic shortages' of hormonal treatments, humiliating medical procedures and prosecutions on political grounds. LGBTQ+ activists participated in mass protests that engulfed Belarus in 2020 after Lukashenko won a sixth term in an election the opposition and the West criticized as rigged. Authorities responded with a brutal crackdown, arresting about 65,000 people over the next four years. There are about 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski. Many imprisoned opposition leaders and activists have spent more than a year in complete isolation, without medical assistance. As the crackdown widens, LGBTQ+ people are leaving Belarus, seeking asylum abroad. Tania, a 39-year-old transgender woman, told AP she was arrested twice for following opposition sites that were outlawed as extremist and for supporting Ukraine, adding that she was beaten and subjected to electric shocks in custody. She eventually fled the country. During the final raid of her apartment, security forces broke her tooth and two ribs, jailed her for 12 days and ordered her to repent on camera, she said. 'Abuse behind bars continued day and night,' she said. 'I was humiliated. They tried to shove the taser into my rectum or put it against my genitals. ... In a country where terror reigns, you either agree with the government's line, or have little chance of surviving without access to hormonal treatment.' Marat, a 37-year-old transgender man, told AP that authorities demanded last year that he detransition and change his documents to restore the gender marker he was assigned at birth. By that time, he said he had 'pumped-up muscles and had grown a beard.' 'I couldn't believe that the doctors are demanding to bring everything back to the way it was and this absurdity is happening in the 21st century,' he said, adding that he tried to contest it but eventually fled to France with his four children. Lukashenko, who has run Belarus with an iron first for three decades, has publicly mocked homosexuals. After Germany's openly gay foreign minister in 2012 called him 'the last dictator in Europe,' Lukashenko replied, 'Better to be a dictator than gay.' All independent LGBTQ+ groups have been shut down in Belarus, security forces regularly raid Minsk nightclubs where underground parties are held, and advocates say the KGB blackmails members of the community into cooperating. 'Intimidation, arrests and blackmail have been used in Belarus for years to create a so-called ‘LGBTQ+ database’ and declare an entire social group dangerous,' said Pavel Sapelka of the Viasna Center, the country’s most prominent rights group. In April, the Culture Ministry expanded its definition of pornography to include 'nontraditional relations,' meaning anyone possessing such material can face criminal prosecution and up to four years in prison. 'Belarus must abolish these outrageous amendments and stop the cynical persecution of LGBTQ+ people,' said Anastasiia Kruope, assistant researcher for Europe and Central Asia with Human Rights Watch. Rights advocates say LGBTQ+ people in Belarus continue to face stigmatization in society, noting a high suicide rate in the community. 'The state’s policy has a particularly strong impact on young LGBT+ people, who have been living for four years in the conditions of an artificially created ‘sterile’ space, a Russian agenda and the constant broadcast of hate speech,' according to a report last month by the rights group Justice Initiative. The legislation being prepared ahead of next month's presidential election seeks to punish anyone promoting 'nontraditional sexual relations, gender change (or) pedophilia.' TG House Belarus began a petition drive against the legislation, collecting 33,000 signatures. Sarmant suggests the recent raids were 'revenge for this campaign in order for everyone to hide, get scared, and — best of all -– keep silent.' Andrei and Sasha, whose home was raided, said if the bill becomes law, they would leave Minsk rather than 'wait for a prison term.'	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-lgbtq-crackdown-russia-putin-lukashenko-a46db4f815ff563a49a09b96ab408630	2024-12-05T19:30:20-08:00	
Trump names former Sen. David Perdue of Georgia to be ambassador to China	WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday he has selected former Sen. David Perdue of Georgia to serve as his ambassador to China, leaning on a former business executive turned politician to serve as the administration's envoy to America's most potent economic and military adversary. Trump said in a social media post that Perdue 'brings valuable expertise to help build our relationship with China.' Perdue lost his Senate seat to Democrat Jon Ossoff four years ago and ran unsuccessfully in a 2022 primary against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Perdue pushed Trump’s debunked lies about electoral fraud during his failed bid for Georgia governor. During his time in the Senate, Perdue was labeled as 'anti-China' in a 2019 Chinese think tank report. The former Georgia lawmaker advocated that the U.S. needed to build a more robust naval force to cope with threats, including from China. Before launching his political career, Perdue held a string of top executive positions, including at Sara Lee, Reebok and Dollar General. Economic tensions will be a big part of the U.S.-China picture for the new administration. Trump has threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The Chinese Embassy in Washington cautioned earlier this week that there will be losers on all sides if there is a trade war. 'China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature,' embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu posted on X. 'No one will win a trade war or a #tariff war.' He added that China had taken steps in the last year to help stem drug trafficking. The embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening about Perdue's nomination. It is unclear whether Trump will actually go through with the threats or if he is using them as a negotiating tactic. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent U.S. Census data. Perdue, if confirmed, will have to negotiate a difficult set of issues that goes beyond trade. Washington and Beijing have long had deep differences on the support China has given to Russia during its war in Ukraine, human rights issues, technology and Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a meeting with outgoing President Joe Biden last month that Beijing stood 'ready to work with a new U.S. administration.' But Xi also warned that a stable China-U.S. relationship was critical not only to the two nations but to the 'future and destiny of humanity.' 'Make the wise choice,' Xi cautioned during his November meeting with Biden on the sidelines of an international summit in Peru. 'Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other.' Trump’s relationship with Xi started out well during his first term before becoming strained over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump seems particularly focused on using tariffs as a pressure point on Xi, even threatening he would use tariffs as a cudgel to pressure Beijing to crack down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl in Mexico that is illegally sold in the United States. A second Trump administration is expected to test U.S.-China relations even more than the Republican’s first term, when the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion in Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020, the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A couple years later, a research group showed that China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised. Ahead of Trump's return to power, many American companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year. Trump also filled out more of his immigration team Thursday, as he promises mass deportations and border crackdowns. He said he’s nominating former Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott to head U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Scott, a career official, was appointed head of the border agency in January 2020 and enthusiastically embraced then-President Trump’s policies, particularly on building a U.S.-Mexico border wall. He was forced out by the Biden administration. Trump also said he’d nominate Caleb Vitello as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that, among other things, arrests migrants in the U.S. illegally. Vitello is a career ICE official with more than 23 years in the agency and most recently has been the assistant director for the office of firearms and tactical programs. The president-elect named the head of the Border Patrol Union, Brandon Judd, as ambassador to Chile. Judd has been a longtime supporter of Trump’s, appearing with him during his visits to the U.S.-Mexico border, though he notably supported a Senate immigration bill championed by Biden that Trump sank in part because he didn’t want to give Democrats an election-year win on the issue. — AP writer Didi Tang contributed reporting.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-transition-administration-c481302fb42d7b6fc9d90dda23b45258	2024-12-05T17:57:22-08:00

Australian leader blames antisemitism for arson that extensively damaged a Melbourne synagogue	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Arsonists extensively damaged a Melbourne synagogue on Friday in what Australia’s prime minister condemned as an antisemitic attack on Australian values. The blaze in the Adass Israel Synagogue is an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and Hamas last year. Cars and buildings have been vandalized and torched around Australia in protests inspired by the war. A witness who had come to the synagogue to pray saw two masked men spreading a liquid accelerant with brooms inside the building at 4:10 a.m., officials said. About 60 firefighters with 17 fire trucks responded to the blaze, which police said caused extensive damage. Investigators have yet to identify a motive, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese blamed antisemitism. 'This was a shocking incident to be unequivocally condemned. There is no place in Australia for an outrage such as this,' Albanese told reporters. 'To attack a place of worship is an attack on Australian values. To attack a synagogue is an act of antisemitism, is attacking the right that all Australians should have to practice their faith in peace and security,' he added. Israel’s Ambassador to Australia Amir Maimon noted that dozens of pro-Palestinian activists staged a three-hour protest outside The Great Synagogue in downtown Sydney on Wednesday, demanding sanctions against Israel. Worshippers were prevented from leaving the synagogue during the demonstration. 'We are talking about the values you expect Australians to follow, not my own values. And for me it’s clear that everyone should have the right to worship his own religion, own beliefs, as long as they also respect others,' Maimon said. A religious leader at the torched mosque, Rabbi Gabi Kaltmann, described the arsonists as 'thugs.' 'Tonight is the Sabbath. We must all go and find a sense of calmness, comradery and community by gathering for the Sabbath tonight and praying together as one community,' Klatmann told reporters outside the synagogue. Federal law in January banned the Nazi salute and the public display of Nazi symbols in response to growing antisemitism. The government appointed special envoys this year to combat antisemitism and Islamophobia in the community. The Jewish envoy, Jillian Segal, a Sydney lawyer and business executive, said the Jewish community in Australia was 'feeling ever more rattled by what is going on.' 'I'm very concerned. Here is one major escalation in terms of burning synagogues which has resonance as to what happened during the Holocaust,' Segal said. Victoria state Premier Jacinta Allan noted in a statement that the synagogue was 'built by Holocaust survivors.' Many of the synagogue's original worshippers were post-World War II immigrants from Hungary. Allan offered 100,000 Australian dollars ($64,300) to help repair the synagogue and said there would be an increased police presence in the area. 'Every available resource will be deployed to find these criminals who tried to tear a community apart,' Allan said. 'We stand against antisemitism now and forever,' she added. Daniel Aghion, president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said the broader Australian community needed to condemn the arson attack. 'I've been getting phone calls this morning from the Hindu community, from other people, from good people who are prepared to stand up and that's my message for this morning to Australia, to the good people of Australia,' Aghion told reporters. 'Don't leave the Jewish people behind. Don't isolate us. Don't leave us exposed to the risk of attacks upon our religious institutions, our communal institutions. Stand with us. Stand against this hate. And stand against this kind of horrendous attack which should not occur on Australian soil,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-arsonists-melbourne-synagogue-antisemitism-d6452045beaac39bd11a97a8fe851d37	2024-12-05T16:35:50-08:00	
South Korea's governing party head supports suspending Yoon's powers, making impeachment more likely	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s governing party chief expressed support Friday for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol for imposing martial law this week, in a bombshell reversal that makes Yoon’s impeachment more likely. Opposition parties are pushing for a parliamentary vote on Yoon’s impeachment on Saturday, calling his short-lived martial law declaration an 'unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or coup.' But they need support from some members of the president’s People Power Party to get the two-thirds majority required to pass the impeachment motion. The turmoil resulting from Yoon’s nighttime martial law decree has frozen South Korean politics and caused worry among neighbors, including fellow democracy Japan, and Seoul’s top ally, the United States, as one of the strongest democracies in Asia faces a political crisis that could unseat its leader. During a party meeting, PPP leader Han Dong-hun stressed the need to suspend Yoon’s presidential duties and power swiftly, saying he poses a 'significant risk of extreme actions, like reattempting to impose martial law, which could potentially put the Republic of Korea and its citizens in great danger.' Han said he had received intelligence that Yoon had ordered the country’s defense counterintelligence commander to arrest and detain unspecified key politicians based on accusations of 'anti-state activities' during the brief period martial law was in force. 'It’s my judgment that an immediate suspension of President Yoon Suk Yeol’s official duties is necessary to protect the Republic of Korea and its people,' Han said. In a closed-door briefing to lawmakers, Hong Jang-won, first deputy director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, said Yoon called him on the phone after imposing martial law and read out a long list of politicians he wanted detained. They included Han, opposition leader Lee Jae-myung and National Assembly speaker Woo Won Shik, said Kim Byung-kee, one of the lawmakers who attended the meeting. Kim said Hong told lawmakers he ignored Yoon’s orders. Speaking to reporters at the National Assembly, the spy agency’s director, Cho Taeyong, questioned Hong’s account. Cho said such an order would have come to him, rather than Hong, and that he never received any orders from Yoon to detain politicians. Han earlier said he would work to defeat the impeachment motion even though he criticized Yoon’s martial law declaration as 'unconstitutional.' Han said there was a need to 'prevent damage to citizens and supporters caused by unprepared chaos.' Thousands of protesters have marched in the streets Seoul since Wednesday, calling for Yoon to resign and be investigated. Thousands of autoworkers and other members of the Korean Metal Workers’ Union, one of the country’s biggest umbrella labor groups, have started hourly strikes since Thursday to protest Yoon. The union said its members will start on indefinite strikes beginning on Dec. 11 if Yoon was still in office then. Impeaching Yoon would require support from 200 of the National Assembly’s 300 members. The opposition parties who jointly brought the impeachment motion have 192 seats combined. PPP has 108 lawmakers. In a televised statement, South Korean Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho promised the ministry’s 'active cooperation' with an investigation by prosecutors into the military’s role in Yoon’s martial law enforcement. He said military prosecutors will also be involved in the probe. He denied media speculation that Yoon and his military confidantes might consider imposing martial law a second time. 'Even if there’s a demand to enforce martial law, the Ministry of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff will absolutely not accept it,' Kim said. Kim became the acting defense minister after Yoon’s office on Thursday accepted the resignation of Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who has been hit with a travel ban and faces an investigation over his role in Yoon’s imposition of martial law. Opposition parties and Han allege that it was Kim Yong Hyun who recommended that Yoon take the step. During a parliamentary hearing on Thursday, Kim Seon Ho said Kim Yong Hyun also ordered troops to be deployed to the National Assembly after Yoon imposed martial law. Han was previously regarded as a close associate of Yoon as they spent years working together as prosecutors and he served as Yoon’s first justice minister. But after Han entered party politics and became PPP leader, their ties soured badly as they differed over how to handle scandals involving Yoon and his wife. Han leads a minority faction within the ruling party, and 18 lawmakers in his faction voted with opposition lawmakers to overturn Yoon’s martial law decree. Martial law ultimately lasted about six hours, after the quick overrule by the National Assembly forced Yoon’s Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Wednesday. If Yoon is impeached, he would be suspended until the Constitutional Court rules on whether to remove him from office or restore his presidential power. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s No. 2 official, would take over presidential responsibilities. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung said in a televised speech Friday that it was crucial to suspend Yoon as 'quickly as possible.' Lee said Yoon’s martial law enforcement amounted to 'rebellion and also a self-coup.' He said Yoon’s move caused serious damage to the country’s image and paralyzed foreign policy, pointing to criticism from the Biden administration and foreign leaders canceling their visits to South Korea. Yoon has made no immediate response to Han’s comments. He hasn’t made public appearances since he made a televised announcement that his martial law decree was lifted. Prosecutor General Shim Woo Jung told reporters Friday that the prosecution plans to investigate rebellion charges against Yoon following complaints filed by the opposition. While the president mostly enjoys immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. It wasn’t immediately clear how the prosecution plans to proceed with an investigation on Yoon. Democratic Party spokesperson Jo Seoung-lae said Friday the party is considering filing a legal complaint against PPP floor leader Choo Kyung-ho, whom they accuse of attempting to facilitate Yoon’s martial law enforcement. Choo, a Yoon loyalist, had asked party lawmakers to convene at the party’s headquarters rather than the National Assembly after martial law began. That meant fewer lawmakers were present for parliament’s crucial vote on lifting martial law. The Biden administration, which has worked closely with Yoon’s government while strengthening trilateral security cooperation with Japan to counter North Korean threats and regional instability, has expressed deep concern about Yoon’s actions. In a telephone conversation with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken welcomed the lifting of martial law following the parliamentary vote and conveyed his confidence in South Korea’s democratic resilience, the State Department said. A U.S. defense official said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has canceled a planned visit to South Korea, determining that it would not be an appropriate time. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss travel planning not usually made public, said the Pentagon consulted with Austin’s counterparts in South Korea about the decision. Austin is leaving for California on Friday to speak at the Reagan National Defense Forum, and will then travel on to Japan. ___ Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Canada expands list of firearms outlawed and proposes to donate guns to Ukraine	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Canada said Thursday it is outlawing another 324 firearm varieties — guns the public safety minister said belong on the battlefield, not in the hands of hunters or sport shooters. Ottawa also said it is working with the government of Ukraine to see how the guns can be donated to support the fight against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The move follows the May 2020 ban of 1,500 makes and models of firearms, a number that grew to more than 2,000 by November of this year as new variants were identified. The latest restriction, announced Thursday by Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, follows expressions of concern from gun-control advocates that many assault-style firearms were not included in the 2020 ban. 'This means these firearms can no longer be used,' LeBlanc said. Defense Minister Bill Blair said Canada approached Ukrainian authorities, who expressed interest in some of the guns. 'Every bit of assistance we can offer to the Ukrainians is one step toward their victory,' Blair said. The federal government says it is working with provinces, territories and police on a planned buyback of prohibited weapons from individual owners. Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada, but the newly announced measures come on the eve of the 35th anniversary of the École Polytechnique in Montreal, where a gunman killed 14 women before killing himself. The Ruger Mini-14 used by the gunman, Marc Lepine, was among the weapons included in the 2020 ban. Nathalie Provost, a survivor who was wounded in the attack, said Thursday she was targeted for being a woman studying engineering. 'These are just killing weapons, war weapons, military weapons, so I'm proud we are doing something,' Provost said. Canada has had far fewer mass shootings than the U.S. in part because of a lack of easy access to guns, though the U.S. population also is far larger than Canada’s. Officials have acknowledged guns smuggled into Canada illegally are often used by criminals. Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre called the announcement a 'stunt' by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government that attacks 'licensed &amp; law-abiding hunters and sport shooters.'	https://apnews.com/article/canada-firearms-ban-ukraine-81ccaa341badb74bb27d34fc4bb29b17	2024-12-05T14:03:33-08:00	
Dwarfed by China in shipbuilding, US looks to build its defense base to fend off war	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. severely lags behind China in shipbuilding capacity, lawmakers and experts have warned, as the Biden administration tries to build up the country's ability to develop and produce weapons and other defense supplies to fend off war. Speaking at a congressional hearing Thursday, Rep. John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said the country lacks the capacity to 'deter and win a fight' with China and called for action. 'Bold policy changes and significant resources are now needed to restore deterrence and prevent a fight' with China, Moolenaar said. China’s navy is already the world’s largest, and its shipbuilding capacity, estimated to be 230 times larger, dwarfs that of the U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democratic member of the committee, told Fox News last week that 'for every one oceangoing vessel that we can produce, China can produce 359 in one single year.' The U.S. government has come to see China as its 'pacing challenge,' and officials have warned that Beijing is pursuing the largest peacetime military buildup in history, raising concerns about how the U.S. would respond and ensure victory in case of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific, where tensions are high in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Krishnamoorthi on Thursday warned that a weak military industrial base could invite aggression and argued that strengthening it is necessary to avoid war with China. 'History tells us we need a healthy defense industrial base now to deter aggression and make sure the world’s dictators think again before dragging the U.S. and the world into yet another disastrous conflict,' Krishnamoorthi said. National security adviser Jake Sullivan called it a 'generational project' to fix the problem after the American shipbuilding industry had its 'bottom fell out' in the early 1980s. 'Part of it is we don't have the backbone of a healthy commercial shipbuilding base to rest our naval shipbuilding on top of,' Sullivan said Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum in Washington. 'And that's part of the fragility of what we're contending with and why this is going to be such a generational project to fix.' The challenge in shipbuilding has been 'especially immense,' stemming from the hollowing-out of the U.S. manufacturing base where its workforce shrank and suppliers left, Sullivan said. And it is part of the broader problem of a weakened U.S. military industrial base, as manifested in the weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, Sullivan said, when Kyiv in eight weeks 'burned through a year's worth of U.S. 155-millimeter artillery production.' 'Decades of underinvestments and consolidation had seriously eroded our defense industrial base, and there was no way around it,' Sullivan said. The head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Samuel Paparo, warned last month that the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East were eating away at critical U.S. weapons stockpiles and could hamper the military’s ability to respond to China should a conflict arise. He said providing or selling billions of dollars worth of air defenses to both Ukraine and Israel were hampering U.S. ability to respond to threats in the Indo-Pacific. 'It’s now eating into stocks, and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he told an audience at the Brookings Institution in Washington on Nov . 19. Several researchers at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said China’s rapid military buildup could allow the country to prevail over the U.S., especially in case of a prolonged conflict. 'China’s massive shipbuilding industry would provide a strategic advantage in a war that stretches beyond a few weeks, allowing it to repair damaged vessels or construct replacements much faster than the United States,' the researchers wrote in June. On Thursday, the congressional panel heard suggestions from experts who said it would take time to rebuild the defense industrial base, but for quicker fixes, the U.S. could innovate to make low-cost and autonomous systems and tap resources of its allies. 'We need to look at co-production of whether it's munitions in Australia or shipbuilding in Korea,' said William Greenwalt, a non-resident senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank American Enterprise Institute. 'We need to get numbers as fast as we can,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-shipbuilding-us-defense-base-2a24238bdbf255bac821145d7b299d8d	2024-12-05T13:57:36-08:00	
Stowaway who boarded New York-to-Paris flight claims she sought asylum in France	NEW YORK (AP) — A Russian woman with permanent U.S. residency who was returned to the United States after authorities said she snuck on board a flight from New York to Paris made her first appearance in court Thursday, claiming she has been abused. Svetlana Dali, wearing jeans, seemed agitated as she spoke through a Russian interpreter to her attorney during a brief appearance before a Brooklyn magistrate judge. Her lawyer, Michael Schneider, said she claims she was poisoned after arriving in Paris and then was returned to the United States despite requesting asylum there. She also claimed through Schneider that her treatment at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn amounted to torture after she was placed in a 'very cold' room where she felt sick and eventually lost consciousness. 'She believes if she's staying at the MDC, her life will be in danger,' Schneider said. When he told Magistrate Judge Robert M. Levy that she was requesting a spectrometer be used to test her blood and determine if she had been poisoned, the judge responded that he's 'not sure' the device was in the jail's commissary. She will be housed in the federal lockup a second night after lawyers agreed to postpone a bail hearing until Friday so enough information could be gathered to create a bail package. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Theodora said the government's chief concern was that Dali was a risk of flight. She did not protest when Schneider said the single federal stowaway charge she faced was a 'minor charge' comparable to being arrested for jumping a turnstyle to enter the city's subway system. A criminal complaint filed in Brooklyn federal court said Dali admitted to an FBI agent who interviewed her when she returned to Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday that she flew to Paris as a stowaway on a Delta Air Lines flight on Nov. 26. The complaint said airport surveillance footage showed that she was initially rebuffed by a Transportation Security Administration official because she lacked a boarding pass when she first tried to enter Kennedy's Terminal 4. Five minutes later, she successfully accessed the security screening machines without a boarding pass by entering a special lane for airline employees at the same time that a large Air Europa flight crew walked through, the complaint said. It said she got onto the Delta flight without presenting a boarding pass as airline agents who were helping other ticketed passengers board failed to stop her or ask her to present a boarding pass. Once on the flight but before it landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport, Delta employees realized she was not authorized to be on the plane and asked for her boarding pass, which she could not provide, the complaint said. When the plane landed in Paris early on Nov. 27, French law enforcement met her at the gate and detained her before she entered customs, it said. During her interview with U.S. law enforcement, Dali was shown images from airport security showing her bypassing TSA officials and Delta employees. The complaint said she confirmed the images were of her and 'also stated that she knew her conduct was illegal.' In a statement, Delta Air Lines thanked French and U.S. authorities for their assistance and said a review had concluded that its security infrastructure was 'sound and that deviation from standard procedures is the root cause of this event.' It added: 'We are thoroughly addressing this matter and will continue to work closely with our regulators, law enforcement and other relevant stakeholders. Nothing is of greater importance than safety and security.'	https://apnews.com/article/paris-stowaway-svetlana-dali-acbec8eff4a215cc29e93e642ef51767	2024-12-05T13:54:50-08:00	
El Salvador's president is triumphant after his bet on bitcoin comes true	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — As bitcoin reached historic highs, surpassing $100,000 for the first tim e, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele was triumphant on Thursday about his big bet on the cryptocurrency. The adoption of bitcoin — which has been legal tender in the Central American nation since 2021 — never quite matched the president’s enthusiasm, but the value of the government’s reported investment now stands at more than $600 million. Bitcoin has rallied mightily since Donald Trump’s election victory last month, exceeding the $100,000 mark on Wednesday night, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Just two years ago, bitcoin’s volatile value fell below $17,000. Bitcoin fell back below the $100,000 by Thursday afternoon, sitting just above $99,000 by 3 p.m. E.T. Bukele on Thursday blamed his beleaguered political opposition for causing many Salvadorans to miss out on the bonanza. There were street protests when the Congress made bitcoin legal tender in June 2021, though that move was not the only motivation for the protesters. The tiny Central American country has long used the dollar as currency, but Bukele promised bitcoin would provide new opportunities for El Salvador’s unbanked and cut out money transfer services from the remittances Salvadorans abroad send home. The government offered $30 in bitcoin to those who signed up for digital wallets. Many did so, but quickly cashed out the cryptocurrency. 'It’s important to emphasize that not only did the opposition err resoundingly with bitcoin, but rather, differently from other issues (where they have also been wrong), this time their opposition affected many,' Bukele wrote on Facebook. Bukele drew an 'impressive' comment from Elon Musk on the social media platform X Thursday. El Salvador’s former Central Bank President Carlos Acevedo pointed out on Thursday that while there has been a gain, it remains an unrealized one until the government’s bitcoin is sold. That said, he credited Bukele’s administration with doing well on the bitcoin move, especially in light of Trump’s election. Acevedo said 'the markets’ optimism that a Trump administration will be friendly with the markets and particularly with bitcoin' explained its sustained rally over the past month. But the cryptocurrency’s volatility was a persistent risk, he said. 'The average Salvadoran doesn’t use bitcoin, but obviously there are Salvadorans with economic resources who even before had already invested in bitcoin, but it is a small group,' Acevedo said. Esteban Escamilla, a worker in a clothing store in Santa Tecla, outside the capital San Salvador, said he had cashed out the original $30 of bitcoin offered in 2021. 'I don’t use bitcoin because I don’t have (money) to invest and speculate with, but I know it has gone up a lot,' he said, recognizing that he would have more money now if he had kept it in bitcoin. Josefa Torres, 45, said as she was doing her grocery shopping that she didn’t have any bitcoin either. 'I took out the money and used it for household expenses,' she said. At the conclusion of meetings between the International Monetary Fund and El Salvador’s government in August, the IMF issued a statement that mentioned the country’s bitcoin holdings. 'While many of the risks have not yet materialized, there is joint recognition that further efforts are needed to enhance transparency and mitigate potential fiscal and financial stability risks from the Bitcoin project,' the IMf said.	https://apnews.com/article/bitcoin-elsalvador-bukele-musk-trump-5be81d375da5bbce883008b0799c0c1a	2024-12-05T13:17:57-08:00	
Exiled Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof's definition of home is shifting	NEW YORK (AP) — Shortly before he was to be flogged and imprisoned for eight years, Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran. His weekslong journey would take him from Tehran, through rural Iranian villages, on foot across a mountainous borderland and ultimately to Hamburg, Germany. As arduous and dangerous as the trip was, Rasoulof’s travels had an added wrinkle: He was trying to finish a movie at the same time. A week after arriving in Germany, Rasoulof would premiere his film, 'The Seed of the Sacred Fig' at the Cannes Film Festival in France. As he fled, Rasoulof was preoccupied with the movie’s edit, which was being carried out in Germany. 'I remember when I was sitting in the car that was driving me to the border,' Rasoulof says. 'I had my laptop and I was taking notes and sending them to my editor. The two friends who were taking me kept saying, ‘Put that thing away for a second.’' In Cannes, 'The Seed of the Sacred Fig' won a special jury prize and Rasoulof was celebrated with a 13-minute standing ovation. The movie has since been hailed as one of the best of the year, and arguably its most daring. Rasoulof made 'Sacred Fig' clandestinely in Iran, directing scenes from a separate location to avoid raising suspicions. (The opening titles read: 'When there is no way, a way must be made.') Its story — a devastating family drama set during the 2022 protests that engulfed Iran — would surely only add to Rasoulof’s prison sentence. So after all of this, how is he feeling? When he recently met with The Associated Press for an interview, Rasoulof shrugged. 'Ordinary,' he says. Rasoulof, 52, has a more gentle, bemused presence than some of his films would suggest. But how could Rasoulof, after what he’s lived through this year, feel anything like ordinary? 'I still haven’t grasped the meaning of exile,' he explains. 'I think it will take some time. The feeling of that void has not hit me yet, and I think it may never come.' Rasoulof has been busy traveling from film festival to film festival. In September, he and his 24-year-old daughter attended the Telluride festival in Colorado. Many more such stops were to come. Since fleeing Iran, Rasoulof has effectively been immersed in the world he’s long known: cinema. 'Maybe I am living in the world of cinema, and maybe that’s why things are so familiar,' he agrees. 'Maybe that’s why I don’t feel I’m in exile.' 'The Seed of the Sacred Fig,' currently playing in theaters, is the Oscar submission from Rasoulof’s adoptive home, Germany. He’s settled in with his family, grateful for how the country has welcomed him. Speaking through an interpreter, Rasoulof grants that he’ll probably always mentally have a bag packed, ready to return to Iran should the chance ever come. But what 'home' constitutes has changed for him. 'I might be able to change this concept of home for myself,' he says. 'I walk on the streets here and I see people of different colors and forms from all over the place, and they all call this place home. So there’s always the chance that one can build something new.' How oppressive politics can infiltrate the home is central to 'The Seed of the Sacred Fig.' It concerns a family of four: Iman (Missagh Zareh), a lawyer newly appointed to the Revolutionary Court in Tehran; his wife, Najmeh (Soheila Golestani) and their two daughters, Rezvan (Mahsa Rostami) and Sana (Setareh Maleki). Iman is proud of his high position, but, when the government crackdown on protesters following the death of Mahsa Amini accelerates, his daughters are increasingly at odds with him. After Iman's gun goes missing, his wife and daughters turn into suspects. 'The Seed of the Sacred Fig,' populated with real cellphone videos from the protests, plays out as an excruciating microcosm of Iranian society. 'It wasn’t like I put those videos in. They just came in,' says Rasoulof. 'The reality is that it was through those videos I realized what happened. When the Woman, Life, Freedom movement occurred, I was in prison.' Rasoulof has spent several spells in Tehran’s Evin Prison. In 2010, he was arrested on set for filming without a permit. In 2022, he was jailed for seven months after pursuing the release of another of Iran’s most prominent filmmakers, Jafar Panahi. Panahi, who secretly made the film 'No Bears,' was only released in 2023 after commencing a hunger strike. 'My windows at home opened to the hills that have the Evin prison in them,' says Rasoulof. 'I knew behind those walls many of my friends were sitting.' Rasoulof, inspired by the courage of the younger generation, resolved to pour the same spirit into 'The Seed of the Sacred Fig.' Although it wasn’t until Rasoulof’s appeal of his sentence failed that he resolved to flee, he grants that deciding to make 'Sacred Fig' essentially sealed his fate. 'Making this film was part of that decision,' he says. 'Although I had made up my mind earlier, because it was such a bitter decision, I was denying it and delaying it, waiting for a miracle to allow me to stay.' 'I would open the fridge to make sure there was nothing there that would go bad,' he adds. 'It was a strange circumstance.' For the film's actors and crew members, signing up for the movie meant also becoming co-conspirators. Everyone knew the risks. And, like Rasoulof, many of them have since left Iran. Rostami and Maleki also now live in Germany. Asked if his collaborators are all currently safe, Rasoulof responds: 'No one is safe from the Islamic Republic.' In his new life, Rasoulof is experiencing freedoms he never had in Iran. His films, for example, are widely available outside his native country but not in Iran. His prize-winning 2020 drama 'There Is No Evil,' about capital punishment in Iran, is banned — though, ironically, Rasoulof’s prison guards enjoyed watching it with him from a flash drive. 'I haven’t seen many of my films on a big screen, especially my last film,' he says. 'I really want to see ‘There Is No Evil’ on a big screen. A festival in Portugal has promised to take me to see my own film.' The name of Rasoulof’s film comes from his memory of an ancient fig tree he once visited on an island in the south of Iran. It’s a tree that, with apparent metaphorical meaning for the Iranian government, spreads its seeds onto other trees, killing them and growing in their place. Rasoulof pulls out his phone to share a photo of his apartment in Tehran. Outside a large window, you can see the walls of Evin running along a craggy hillside. Inside are many houseplants. 'This is my home,' he says. 'I have a lot of plants. I really miss my plants. I have a neighbor who takes care of them for me. I actually have a fig tree at home.'	https://apnews.com/article/seed-of-sacred-fig-mohammad-rasoulof-iran-603b808fb953ca9cf23dcde46189b89f	2024-12-05T12:43:33-08:00	
Quake prompts brief tsunami warning on the West Coast. Here's what to know about tsunamis	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The powerful earthquake that struck in Northern California on Thursday prompted a brief tsunami warning affecting about 5 million people along a stretch of the West Coast — from Northern California to Oregon — before being canceled. Here are some things to know about tsunamis: What is a tsunami? A tsunami, a word that comes from the Japanese characters for harbor and wave, is a series of extremely long waves caused by the sudden displacement of the ocean, according to the National Weather Service. 'Most tsunamis, and the largest, result from earthquakes on reverse faults. These tsunami-generating earthquakes originate mainly in subduction zones, where tectonic plates collide and one is forced under the other,' the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. If this is large enough and closer to the ocean floor, the energy from the earthquake can cause the ocean floor to suddenly rise or fall. 'This sudden vertical displacement of the ocean floor is what typically sets a tsunami in motion,' NOAA said. 'Tsunamis radiate outward in all directions from the point of origin and can move across entire ocean basins,' the service says. When the waves reach land, they can cause coastal flooding, and the powerful currents can last several hours or days. The weather service calls a tsunami as 'one of the most powerful and destructive natural forces.' How often to they happen? Tsunamis that cause damage or death near earthquakes occur about two times a year, according to the Global Historical Tsunami Database. A tsunami racing across an ocean and causing damage or deaths more than 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) away happens about twice a decade. Where do they occur? Tsunamis can occur in any ocean, sea or large body of water. But certain areas are prone to tsunamis because of their proximity to the source and other factors, such as depth and the shape of the ocean floor. The database says between 1900 and 2015, there were 754 confirmed events. Of those, 78% were in the Pacific Ocean. According to the database, Japan has had the most tsunamis since 1900, followed by Russia and Indonesia. A magnitude 9.2 temblor, the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded globally, caused widespread damage in the Anchorage area in 1964 and killed 131 people, including some in Oregon and California by the ensuing tsunami. Most destructive tsunamis In 2004, a magnitude 9.1 earthquake occurred off Sumatra, an Indonesian island in the Indian Ocean. It generated a tsunami that was as high as 167 feet (51 meters), causing an estimated 230,000 deaths. Another magnitude 9.1 earthquake struck in Japan in 2011, creating a tsunami with waves reaching 127 feet (39 meters). The tsunami caused about 18,000 deaths and prompted a nuclear power plant accident.	https://apnews.com/article/california-tsunami-what-to-know-37a08ee0cc122c88864de7e4ca5fc2af	2024-12-05T11:48:47-08:00	
Why the rebel capture of Syria's Hama, a city with a dark history, matters	BEIRUT (AP) — One of the darkest moments in the modern history of the Arab world happened more than four decades ago, when then-Syrian President Hafez Assad launched what came to be known as the Hama Massacre. From 10,000 to 40,000 people were killed or disappeared in the government attack on the central Syrian city that began on Feb. 2, 1982, and lasted for nearly a month, turning it to ruins. The memory of the government assault and the monthlong siege on the city, which at the time was a stronghold of Syria’s Muslim Brotherhood, remains visceral in Syrian and Arab minds. Now Islamist insurgents have captured the city, tearing down a poster of Hafez Assad’s son, President Bashar Assad, in a moment many Syrians have awaited for over 40 years. The moment carried great symbolism in Syria’s long-running war, which began 13 years ago but many say is rooted in Hama. A dark history Hama, Syria’s fourth-largest city, is known for its quaint waterwheels, a landmark attraction along the banks of the Orontes River. But in the early 1980s, its name became synonymous with death. For years, the city was the scene of Muslim Brotherhood-led anti-government attacks that targeted military officers, state institutions and ruling party offices. In February 1982, government forces under Hafez Assad launched an assault. Within a matter of days, government warplanes destroyed most of the city, opening the way for ground troops. Hafez Assad’s brother, Rifaat, led the artillery unit that shelled the city, earning him the nickname the 'Butcher of Hama.' This year, Rifaat Assad was indicted in Switzerland for war crimes and crimes against humanity in connection with Hama. An international arrest warrant was issued for him three years earlier. The massacre created hatred that fanned the flames of another uprising against his son years later. The epicenter of protests In 2011, Hama and surrounding towns became the epicenter of some of the biggest protests against Bashar Assad, which started in 2011 amid a wave of Arab uprisings. The protests and widespread popular resentment forced government security forces to withdraw from the city briefly in June 2012, leaving the opposition in control and fueling a sense of liberation in a place that had once been pounded by Syrian warplanes. Residents at that time painted walls around the city in red, threw red paint on the waterwheels to symbolize the Hama massacre and tried to organize local administration. About 800,000 people lived there at the start of the uprising. 'Erhal ya Bashar,' a protest chant that means 'Come on, leave, Bashar' was popularized in the Hama protests. But government forces returned in August of that year, with a brutal assault that caused mass casualties in the first 24 hours. The leader of the chants was later killed, his throat slit by government forces. Aron Lund, a longtime Syria expert at Century International, a New York-based think tank, said Hama has obvious symbolic value because of the history of the massacre. He described it as a 'huge event in Syrian history and really formative for the opposition and the Islamist opposition in particular,' which commemorate it each year. It was also formative for the regime, because many of the current military leaders were young at the time. 'When 2011 rolled around, they all realized that, you know, we all remember, you all remember Hama. So there’s no there’s no compromising here,' Lund said. In a video message Thursday, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the de facto leader of the Syrian insurgency, announced that fighters had reached Hama 'to clean the wound that has bled for 40 years.' One of the opposition fighters' first moves was to free prisoners held in the city's central prison. The city's strategic importance Hama is a major intersection in Syria that links the country’s center with the north as well as the east and west. It is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital, Damascus, Assad’s seat of power. Hama province also borders the coastal province of Latakia, a main base of popular support for Assad. The region is predominantly Sunni Muslim but also has a minority from the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, to which Assad’s family belongs. Hama’s fall would have been a massive development in its own right, Lund said. But coming after the fall of Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, and after government forces had time to prepare defense lines, the government's defeat 'will absolutely encourage Assad’s enemies and discourage his supporters.' Next stop for the insurgents is Homs, which analysts say would be a game-changer if it falls into rebel hands. Lund said Homs is also where Damascus connects to the coast, where Assad has his base and his village of origin, and home to a Russian naval base. 'Should the rebels be able to seize Homs, which they now have a shot at doing after seizing Hama, then they could theoretically have grabbed' three of Syria's largest cities and severed the capital, he said.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-aleppo-hama-massacre-assad-799f37fd2608532a253cccb48df4e613	2024-12-05T11:26:31-08:00	
Hamas official says Gaza ceasefire talks have resumed after weekslong hiatus	ISTANBUL (AP) — A Hamas official said Thursday that international mediators have resumed negotiating with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he was hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war was within reach. Ceasefire negotiations were halted last month when Qatar suspended talks with mediators from Egypt and the United States because of frustration over a lack of progress between Israel and Hamas. But there has been a 'reactivation' of efforts in recent days to end the fighting, release hostages from Gaza and free Palestinian prisoners in Israel, according to Bassem Naim, an official in Hamas’ political bureau who spoke with The Associated Press in Turkey. Another official familiar with the talks confirmed the return of Qatari mediators. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations with the media. Since the talks broke down, there have been significant shifts in the global and regional landscape. Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, and a ceasefire was declared last week between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Trump is a staunch supporter of Israel, but Naim said he believes the incoming administration could 'affect the situation positively' given that Trump had made halting wars in the region part of his campaign platform. Trump this week called for the release of all hostages held in Gaza by the time he takes office on Jan. 20, saying there would be 'hell to pay' if that doesn't happen. Previous rounds of negotiations focused on variations of a proposal calling for a multiphased ceasefire — beginning with a preliminary six-week halt in fighting during which female, elderly and sick hostages would be freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. During that time, Israel would pull back some forces, and displaced Palestinians would be allowed to return home. The sides would also begin talks on the next phase that would include the full withdrawal of Israeli forces, the release of remaining hostages and the terms of a permanent end to the war. A third, final phase would focus on reconstruction. Naim said that no 'solid, well-formed' new ceasefire proposal has yet been presented to Hamas. And even though ceasefire talks have broken down on multiple occasions throughout the war, he added: 'I think it is not a big challenge to reach a deal … if there are intentions on the other side.' Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Israel’s blistering retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, whose count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. In the negotiations to end the conflict, the two sides have been at odds on some major points, including whether any halt in the fighting would be permanent or temporary and whether Israeli forces would withdraw from all of the enclave, and on what timetable. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain a long-term military presence in the territory and vowed to dismantle Hamas' military capabilities and ensure that the militant group never governs again. Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff met separately in recent weeks with Netanyahu and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani to discuss Gaza ceasefire talks, according to a U.S. official who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to comment publicly. In an interview with British broadcaster Sky News on Wednesday, the Qatari prime minister said officials in his country are aiming to reach a ceasefire before president-elect Trump takes office. Naim said Hamas is sticking to the core demands it has held to during previous rounds of negotiations, including a permanent ceasefire, total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, and the right of internally displaced Palestinians in Gaza to return to their homes. But he also said the Palestinian militant group is 'ready to show flexibility' on implementation, including on the timeline for withdrawal of Israeli forces from key parts of Gaza. A previous round of talks in August reached an impasse in part because Israel demanded that it after any ceasefire it should maintain a military presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strategic strip along the enclave’s border with Egypt, and in the Netzarim corrider that cuts from east to west across the territory's midsection. 'There can be a discussion about these points, but at the end, Israel has to withdraw totally from the Philadelphi corridor, and the Rafah border (with Egypt) has to be opened immediately,' Naim said. Naim said Palestinian factions were also making progress in deciding who would rule Gaza politically after the war. He confirmed that Hamas and its rival Fatah — which dominates the Western-backed Palestinian Authority — have reached an agreement in principle on forming a temporary committee of Palestinian technocrats that would govern Gaza in the immediate aftermath of the war. Under this arrangement, Hamas would give up its political rule of the enclave, but not lay down its arms. 'Originally we are a Palestinian national liberation movement. We are not a movement to govern,' he said. 'When it comes to the military wing ... as long as we are people under occupation, we have all the right to resist this occupation by all means, including armed resistance. Israel says it will never let Hamas rule Gaza again, and is demanding the group disarm. Hamas political official Khalil al-Hayya had previously told AP that if an independent Palestinian state were established along 1967 borders, the group would lay down its arms. Naim said that remains the group’s position. 'Resistance, including armed resistance, is a tool,' he said. 'It is not a goal in itself.' ___ Associated Press writers Josef Federman in Jerusalem, and Aamer Madhani in Washington, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-geasefire-negotiations-qatar-d09bb192b298adb3fa76d0e819721fdf	2024-12-05T10:33:12-08:00	
The Latest: French President Macron will name a new prime minister 'in coming days'	PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron came out fighting Thursday in his first comments following the resignation of ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier, a day after a historic no-confidence vote at the National Assembly left France without a functioning government. Macron said he will serve as president 'until the end' of his five-year term scheduled in 2027. He also said he would name a new prime minister within days, but gave no hints who that might be. Macron laid blame at the door of his opponents on the far right for bringing down the government of Michel Barnier. He said they chose 'Not to do but to undo.' 'They chose disorder,' he said. The president said the far right and the far left had united in what he called 'an anti-Republican front' and stressed: 'I won’t shoulder other people’s irresponsibility.' The National Assembly ousted Barnier by 331 votes, making him the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history. Macron faces pressure to quickly name a new leader capable of navigating a fractured parliament, where no party holds a majority. Here is the the Latest: Macron warns that France cannot afford stasis Macron noted that France’s constitution prevents a new round of legislative elections so soon after the last ones, meaning the country is stuck with the current National Assembly until next July at the earliest. That reality means lawmakers have a duty 'to work together, at the service of France and the French.' 'The world, Europe, are moving ahead, and we need a government that can take decisions,' Macron said. 'We cannot allow ourselves neither division nor immobility. That is why I will name a prime minister in the coming days.' French president acknowledges his own role in chaos now shaking France While critical of his political opponents, Macron also acknowledged his own role in the chaos now shaking French politics and alarming financial markets. He revisited his decision in June to dissolve parliament. That precipitated the crisis, leading to new legislative elections that produced the now hung parliament, divided between three minority blocs that don’t have enough seats to govern alone and are proving largely incapable of working together – except to bring down Barnier. 'I do recognize that this decision wasn’t understood. Many people criticized me for it. I know many continue to criticize me for it. It’s a fact. And it’s my responsibility.' Macron tears into lawmakers who backed the no-confidence vote Macron tore into lawmakers who backed the no-confidence vote that forced Barnier’s resignation, accusing them of pursuing their own political interests. He noted that the vote came with the end of year holidays just around the corner. 'Why did lawmakers act this way? They’re not thinking of you, of your lives, your difficulties,' he said. 'They’re thinking of just one thing: the presidential election – to prepare it, to provoke it, to precipitate it.' But Macron said he’d see out the 30 months still left in his second and last term as president. Macron lays blame on political opponents for bringing down the government of Michel Barnier In his address, Macron came out fighting, laying blame at the door of his opponents on the far right for bringing down the government of Michel Barnier. He said they chose 'Not to do but to undo.' 'They chose disorder,' he said. The president said the far right and the far left had united in what he called 'an anti-Republican front' and stressed: 'I won’t shoulder other people’s irresponsibility.' He said he’d name a new prime minister within days but gave no hints who that might be. Macron vows to stay in office Macron, in his address Thursday, vowed to stay in office until his term expires in 2027. Macron still holds extensive powers for France on the international stage despite weakened powers at home French President Emmanuel Macron faces the challenge to pick a prime minister capable of leading a minority government in a parliament where no party holds a majority. The prime minister is accountable to the parliament, leads the government and introduces bills – to the risk of being ousted via a no-confidence motion. Macron previously ruled out choosing the nominee of the left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, because it includes the hard-left France Unbowed party. French media have reported a shortlist of centrist candidates who might appeal to both sides of the political spectrum. With no majority in parliament, the president is weakened at home, but still holds some extensive powers over foreign policy, European affairs and defense and is in charge of negotiating and ratifying international treaties. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the country’s armed forces and holds the nuclear codes. French President Emmanuel Macron was elected in 2017, before being reelected in 2022 for a five-year term. Teachers' protests take new tone linking demands to the political crisis A planned protest by teachers against education budget cuts took on a new tone Thursday, as demonstrators in Paris linked their demands to the political crisis sparked by the collapse of Barnier. 'Macron démission!' ('Quit Macron!') read a sign held by Dylan Quenon, 28, a PE teacher at a middle school in Aubervilliers, just north of Paris. Quenon said President Emmanuel Macron bears responsibility for what he described as the dismantling of public services. 'He is the one responsible for our dismay, after all he is the one in charge,' Quenon said. 'The only way for this to change is to have him out of office.' Quenon cited examples of budget constraints in his school, where teachers are limited in making photocopies to save paper and wait months for basic sports equipment like pinnies and balls. The protest, which drew thousands of people, featured chants targeting Macron, Barnier, and their now-defunct budget bill. Demonstrators sang: 'Macron, Barnier et leur budget, et hop tout ça à la poubelle' ('Macron, Barnier, and their budget, throw it all in the trash'). Protesters also expressed little optimism that Macron’s next appointee would reverse course. 'I’m glad this government is falling, but it could possibly lead to something even worse,' said Élise De La Gorce, a 33-year-old philosophy teacher in Stains, north of Paris. 'Given the way the previous government was appointed, I don’t have an ounce of hope that Macron could make the right choice for me.' What will happen to the French government’s budget? France is at no risk of a government shutdown that in the United States would disrupt many services and squeeze federal employees. An outgoing government could present a special law to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year’s rules. It would also be able to decide on renewing spending by decree in order to pay civil servants, pensions and other key government expenses. However, this would suspend any potential tax hike — like one initially expected on big companies — and freeze any new spending. In particular, an additional 3.3 billion euro ($3.5 billion) package for the French military was planned as the country supports Ukraine in its war against Russia. Later, a new government could present its own budget proposals at parliament. There’s pressure on Macron to appoint a new PM swiftly Macron faces the critical task of naming a replacement capable of leading a minority government in a parliament where no party holds a majority. Yaël Braun-Pivet, president of the National Assembly and a member of Macron’s party, urged the president to move quickly. 'I recommend he decide rapidly on a new prime minister,' Braun-Pivet said Thursday on France Inter radio. 'There must not be any political hesitation. We need a leader who can speak to everyone and work to pass a new budget bill.' The process may prove challenging. Macron’s administration has yet to confirm any names, though French media have reported a shortlist of centrist candidates who might appeal to both sides of the political spectrum. Why is the National Assembly so volatile? Following the June-July parliamentary elections, the National Assembly, France’s powerful lower house of parliament, is divided into three major blocs: a left-wing coalition known as the New Popular Front, Macron’s centrist allies, and the far-right National Rally party. None won an outright majority. In September, Macron asked Barnier, a conservative, to form a government dominated by Republicans and centrists — implicitly relying on the far right’s goodwill to be able to stay in power. However, in the days before his ousting, far-right leader Marine Le Pen accused Barnier of ignoring her demands and the left-wing coalition denounced an 'austerity budget' and criticized 'the absence of dialogue and disregard for parliamentary work.' What did Barnier say after being voted out? 'I can tell you that it will remain an honor for me to have served France and the French with dignity,' Barnier said in his final speech before the vote. 'This no-confidence motion … will make everything more serious and more difficult. That’s what I’m sure of,' he said. How was Barnier ousted? France’s far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined together Wednesday in a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes. It was the first successful no-confidence vote since 1962. The National Assembly, the lower house of France’s parliament, approved the motion by 331 votes. A minimum of 288 were needed. Who is Michel Barnier, the ousted former prime minister? Barnier, 73, was the oldest of the 26 prime ministers who have served modern France’s Fifth Republic. He replaced the youngest, Gabriel Attal, who was 34 when he was appointed. He is a career politician with humble roots in France’s Alpine region of Haute-Savoie. He was the European Union’s chief negotiator in the difficult talks with Britain over its departure from the bloc. He also has the shortest tenure of any prime minister. When will Macron speak? French President Emmanuel Macron’s speech is scheduled to address the nation in less than an hour and a half. He is expected to address France’s economic challenges while setting a course for the future government.	https://apnews.com/article/emmanuel-macron-france-government-collapse-b78c1f78b0a793f94f2f65da55589e3c	2024-12-05T09:09:20-08:00	
Sierra Leone begins nationwide rollout of Ebola vaccine a decade after deadly outbreak	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) — Authorities in Sierra Leone on Thursday started a nationwide rollout of the single-dose Ebola vaccine, the first such campaign in West Africa where a deadly outbreak 10 years ago resulted in the death of thousands. The 2014 Ebola outbreak – the deadliest in history – was primarily in West Africa but affected Sierra Leone the most, with nearly 4,000 deaths out of the more than 11,000 recorded globally. The country also lost 7% of its healthcare workforce to the outbreak. The nationwide vaccine campaign, implemented by the government in partnership with the global vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization and the United Nations children’s agency, will target 20,000 frontline workers across the country, officials said. 'This is an investment in the safety of our people and a healthier Sierra Leone,' Health Minister Dr. Austin Demby said. There had been no approved vaccine at the time of the 2014 outbreak that recorded up to 28,000 cases, starting in Guinea before spreading across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia, the other two countries affected the most. Three years have passed since the last case was recorded in Guinea, although officials have spoken of remaining threats in endemic regions. Among those killed by the disease during the 2014 outbreak were nine relatives of Hassan Kamara, a resident of Freetown. Of the 11 people he was living with at the time, only he and his baby daughter survived. 'They died in front of me,' he said. 'I feel bad sometimes speaking about this because of what I went through.' Thursday’s campaign, which launched in the capital, Freetown, was welcomed by health workers. Collins Thomas, a community health worker in Freetown, remembers losing many colleagues in 2014 as they managed patients during the outbreak in Freetown. 'It was scary, because we knew nothing about the disease and learned along the line. With this vaccine, we know we are protected,' Thomas said. Gavi chief executive Dr. Sania Nishtar said the organization is 'incredibly proud' of how its support for timely and equitable access to vaccines has helped save lives and protect communities. 'To have the first nationwide preventive vaccination campaign take place in the country most deeply impacted by the 2014 outbreak makes this historic milestone even more meaningful,' he said. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Germany hands over Australian ancestral remains held by museums for over 100 years	BERLIN (AP) — Five sets of ancestral remains from Australia that had been in German museum collections since the 19th century were handed back at a ceremony Thursday that a community representative described as a sad but 'very joyful' moment. The restitution is part of ongoing efforts by German museums and authorities to return human remains and cultural artifacts that were taken during colonial times. In this case, three sets of remains that had been in Berlin since 1880 were handed over along with two other sets of remains held in the northwestern German city of Oldenburg. They were received by four representatives of the Ugar Island community, part of the Torres Strait Islands off the northeastern tip of Australia. 'These ancestral remains were never meant to be here,' said Hermann Parzinger, the head of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which oversees Berlin's state museums. 'They're here because, during the colonial era and beyond, Europeans presumed to make other peoples and cultures the subject, or more often object, of their research — appropriating artifacts from cultures outside Europe on a scale that is almost unimaginable today and even desecrating the burial places of those communities in the process,' he said. Around the turn of the 20th century, he added, Berlin museums set up a network of scientists, travelers, traders and others who sent back cultural items from around the world, and 'in racing to compete with the other major European museums, they all too often disregarded the humanity and dignity of the peoples they encountered.' The restitution of the remains from Berlin's Ethnological Museum and the State Museum for Nature and Man in Oldenburg means that 162 sets of ancestral remains have now been returned to Australia from Germany, and about 1,700 from around the world, said Natasha Smith, Australia's ambassador to Germany. She said the returns are 'an extremely high priority' for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the government. 'It's sad, but it's a very joyful moment,' Ugar Island representative Rocky Stephen said at the ceremony honoring the ancestors. 'This is a process of healing that's going to happen when they return back to us.' 'No matter (if) it was nearly a 40-hour journey to travel here, because it's been 144 years they have been missed back at their home,' he said. Berlin's museums now aim to do 'everything we can to make the repatriation possible' of remains whose countries and communities of origin can be identified and want to bring them home, Parzinger said. More broadly, governments and museums in Europe and North America have increasingly sought to resolve ownership disputes over objects looted during colonial times. In 2022, for example, Germany and Nigeria signed an agreement paving the way for the return of hundreds of artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes taken from Africa by a British colonial expedition more than 120 years ago. ___ Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-australia-ancestral-remains-restitution-654e87306101b3c3a5e91b3dcd678d7c	2024-12-05T04:53:14-08:00	
US first lady Jill Biden in the capital of the United Arab Emirates on last solo foreign trip	ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. first lady Jill Biden toured the capital of the United Arab Emirates on Thursday as part of her final solo foreign tour. Biden, 73, arrived in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday night after stopping in Italy and visiting her ancestral home of Gesso in Sicily. The UAE, an autocratically ruled federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, has been a key U.S. ally in the region and hosts thousands of American troops. The country's Jebel Ali port in Dubai also is the U.S. Navy's busiest port of call outside of the U.S. The UAE also is a major buyer of Boeing Co. aircraft for its long-haul airlines Emirates and Etihad, and has been focused on winning American support for its push into artificial intelligence. On Thursday Biden traveled to the Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Qasr Al Hosn, a historic site. She was expected to speak at a summit later in the day. Biden has come to the country previously. In March 2016, she accompanied her husband, then the vice president in the last year of the Obama administration, on a trip to the Emirates. This trip comes after President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden over federal crimes after previously pledging that he wouldn't. The president dodged questions about the pardon while he was on a trip to Angola. For her part, Jill Biden on Monday said: 'Of course I support the pardon of my son.' Biden will travel next to nearby Qatar. After that she'll fly to Paris and join President-elect Donald Trump and other dignitaries in Paris to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral. She'll then return to Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/jill-biden-uae-trip-a5718b9c3ec4cb85136b4ff801b6da47	2024-12-05T03:35:06-08:00	
After Trump's win, Russian disinformation aims to drive a wedge between the US and Ukraine	WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Joe Biden uses his final days in office to boost Ukraine's defenses, Russia is playing a different game: spreading disinformation aimed at eroding U.S. support for Ukraine before Donald Trump's return to the White House next month. Since the U.S. election on Nov. 5, the Kremlin has used state-run media and its networks of fake news sites and social media accounts to push divisive narratives about the war and America's Republican president-elect. Analysts say the content, translated into English for American audiences, is intended to turn sentiment against Ukraine at a pivotal time, with the hope of reducing U.S. military assistance and ensuring a Russian victory. Recent examples include fake videos supposedly showing Ukrainian soldiers burning effigies of Trump or his supporters. One clip depicts soldiers saying Trump must not be allowed to take office and should 'never be president again.' Multiple researchers have debunked the video, noting telltale signs of digital manipulation. A different video claims to show Ukrainian soldiers firing at a mannequin wearing a red 'Make America Great Again' hat and a Trump campaign shirt. That video was analyzed and determined to be fake by private analysts and Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, a government agency that tracks Kremlin propaganda. Other versions — just as fake — depict Ukrainian soldiers burning Trump's books or calling him a coward. In the weeks after the election, the clips spread far beyond Ukraine and Russia, circulating among Trump supporters and believers in QAnon, the conspiracy theory that claims Trump is fighting a war against a Satanic cabal of powerful world leaders. It's part of Russia's continued push to divide Americans over the nearly 3-year war in Ukraine and paint Ukrainians as unreliable, dishonest allies, according to analysts who have tracked Russian disinformation and propaganda since the war began. By discouraging American support for Ukraine, the Kremlin is hoping to cut off the most vital source of military assistance that has kept Ukrainian hopes alive since Russia invaded in February 2022. Early in the war, Russian propagandists portrayed Ukrainian leaders as corrupt and self-serving. Russian state media claimed Ukraine’s leaders held Nazi sympathies — even though President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish — or were involved in clandestine bioweapons research that Moscow sought to tie to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each false claim was used to justify Russia’s invasion. 'It’s planted by the Russians, this idea that ‘Ukraine is so corrupt it shouldn’t even be a state, and we are the right people to be running this place,’' said Rupert Smith, a retired British general and former NATO deputy supreme commander who now leads a Brussels-based consulting firm called Solvo Partners. 'Now this is being used as an excuse for not supporting Ukraine.' The fake video claiming to show Ukrainian soldiers firing on the Trump mannequin spread on platforms such as X, Telegram and YouTube, getting an early boost from pro-Kremlin news sites before migrating to ones popular with Americans, according to an analysis by researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks disinformation. Some versions of the video were created long before the election but were passed off as more recent. Within days, the video was receiving hundreds of thousands of views and had been translated into several languages besides Russian and English, including German, Chinese and Polish, NewsGuard found. According to U.S. intelligence, Russia sought to support Trump in the presidential election, believing he would reduce American backing for Ukraine and perhaps the NATO alliance. The incoming president has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, criticized U.S. military aid to Ukraine and NATO and promised to end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory now occupied by Russia. In response to questions about Russia’s role in spreading disinformation about Ukraine, a spokesperson for the Russian Embassy in Washington referred to past statements rejecting any involvement. In the time it has left, the Biden administration has urged Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and has stepped upweapons shipments while forgiving billions in loans provided to Kyiv. So far, the White House has pushed more than $56 billion in security assistance to Ukraine and expects to send billions more before Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, 2025. It’s easy to understand Russia’s motives in trying to cut off that supply of aid, said Joshua Tucker, a New York University professor and Russia expert who studies online disinformation. What’s harder to gauge, he said, is the effectiveness of Russian disinformation, especially on social media platforms already crowded with false, bizarre and debunked claims. One reason that Russia may persist with disinformation targeting Americans is the relative ease and affordability of such operations compared with diplomatic or military alternatives. Russia likely sees disinformation as part of a long-term effort to undermine America's global leadership by dividing its people and undermining support for its institutions, Tucker said. Whether the topic is immigration, the government, the U.S. economy or the war in Ukraine, he said, the goal remains the same and goes beyond one election cycle or one candidate. 'I think what they were really hoping for is a contested result with lots of people out in the streets, arguing the election wasn’t legitimate,' Tucker said. If they couldn't have that, however, Russia's disinformation agencies will keep pushing narratives that they believe will inflame Americans and boost their chances in Ukraine, Tucker said.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-biden-disinformation-335ed5bf57996b66bc387497a7efdbb9	2024-12-05T03:33:59-08:00	
Senior UK commander warns of 'Third nuclear age'	LONDON (AP) — The head of Britain’s armed forces has warned that the world stands at the cusp of a 'third nuclear age,’’ defined by multiple simultaneous challenges and weakened safeguards that kept previous threats in check. Admiral Tony Radakin, chief of the defense staff, said Britain needs to recognize the seriousness of the threats it faces, even if there is only a remote chance of Russia launching a direct nuclear attack on the U.K. or its NATO allies. While the Cold War saw two superpowers held at bay by nuclear deterrence and the past three decades were characterized by international efforts to restrict the spread of nuclear weapons, the current era is 'altogether more complex,' Radakin said Wednesday in a speech to the Royal United Services Institute. 'We are at the dawn of a third nuclear age…’’ he said. 'It is defined by multiple and concurrent dilemmas, proliferating nuclear and disruptive technologies and the almost total absence of the security architectures that went before.' Challenges faced by the West include Russia’s threat to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, China’s drive to build up its nuclear stockpiles, Iran’s failure to cooperate with international efforts to limit its nuclear program, and 'erratic behavior' by North Korea, Radakin said. All of this comes against a backdrop of increasing cyber-attacks, sabotage and disinformation campaigns aimed at destabilizing Western countries. He described the deployment of North Korean soldiers alongside Russian forces on Ukraine’s border as the year’s 'most extraordinary development,’’ and warned that further deployments were possible. The annual lecture by the chief of Britain’s defense staff is a tradition at RUSI, one of the country’s foremost think tanks on military and strategic issues. Radakin used the lecture to make the case for continued reforms in the British military so the U.K. is prepared to respond to the changing international landscape. That includes maintaining Britain’s nuclear deterrent, which is 'the one part of our inventory of which Russia is most aware and has more impact on Putin than anything else,' he said. Britain keeps at least one submarine armed with nuclear missiles at sea at all times so that it can respond in the event of a nuclear attack. The U.K. government is currently conducting a strategic defense review to determine how its armed forces should be staffed and equipped to confront the new challenges. The results are due to be published in the first half of next year.	https://apnews.com/article/admiral-radakin-defense-nukes-76f37aa34ceafffd6a9895d23547320b	2024-12-05T03:23:33-08:00	
Indonesia arrests a Chinese man wanted by Beijing over money laundering charges	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian authorities have arrested a Chinese man sought by Beijing for allegedly helping transfer and laundering almost $18 million from a criminal online gambling group in China, officials said Thursday. Yan Zhenxing was detained Monday by immigration officers at a cross-border ferry terminal on Batam island, next to Singapore. Yuldi Yusman, the Director of Immigration Supervision and Enforcement, said Yan was arrested following an Interpol red notice for him. The notices request law enforcement agencies worldwide to detain or arrest a suspect wanted by a specific country. Yusman said Yan, a permanent resident of Singapore, was arriving in Batam for holiday with his family when he was detained. Indonesian authorities brought the suspect, wearing a detainee’s orange shirt and a facemask, to a news conference Thursday in the capital of Jakarta. The suspect did not make any statements and was not asked any questions. Yusman said that Yan was named as a suspect by police in China’s Inner Mongolia region who allege he was involved in transfering and laundering more than 130 million Chinese Yuan ($17.8 million) from a criminal online gambling group. He said Yan was handed to Indonesia's National Central Bureau Interpol in Jakarta on Thursday and a decision to deport or to extradite him to China will take some time. The arrest came just two months after immigration officers on the tourist island of Bali arrested a Chinese suspect sought by Beijing who allegedly helped to run investment scams that brought in over $14 billion from clients in China. 'We are committed to protecting Indonesia’s territory from the arrival of foreign nationals who are not useful and threaten national stability,' Yusman said. Indonesia, an archipelago nation on the crossroads between Asia and the South Pacific, is attractive to local, regional and global organized crime because of its geographical location. Last month, authorities in Bali arrested Hector Aldwin Pantollana, a Filipino fugitive accused of helping scam over $67 million out of clients in the Philippines. Another Filipino, Alice Guo, a fugitive former mayor accused of having links to Chinese criminal syndicates, was arrested near Jakarta in September. She has since been deported to the Philippines. In June, Chaowalit Thongduang, one of Thailand’s most wanted fugitives, was escorted back to Thailand on a Thai air force plane after being arrested in Bali following months on the run over allegations he was involved in several killings and drug trafficking. ___ Associated Press writers Niniek Karmini and Edna Tarigan in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-china-money-laundering-online-gambling-fugitive-a80c29c2b9d3ec5768547ebb8dc9ae42	2024-12-05T03:15:53-08:00	
France's Macron vows to stay in office till end of term, says he'll name a new prime minister soon	PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron vowed Thursday to stay in office until the end of his term, due in 2027, and announced that he will name a new prime minister within days in efforts to overcome the political deadlock following the resignation of ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier. Macron came out fighting a day after a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes at the National Assembly left France without a functioning government. He laid blame at the door of his opponents on the far right for bringing down Barnier's government. 'They chose disorder,' he said. The president said the far right and the far left had united in what he called 'an anti-Republican front' and stressed: 'I won’t shoulder other people’s irresponsibility.' He said he’d name a new prime minister within days but gave no hints as to who that might be. Earlier in the day, Macron 'took note' of Barnier’s resignation after just three months in office — the shortest tenure of any prime minister in modern French history. Macron acknowledges his own responsibility While critical of his political opponents, Macron also acknowledged what he described as his own responsibility in the chaos now shaking French politics and alarming financial markets. He revisited his decision in June to dissolve parliament. That precipitated the crisis, leading to legislative elections that produced the now hung parliament, divided between three minority blocs that do not have enough seats to govern alone. 'I do recognize that this decision wasn’t understood. Many criticized me for it,' Macron said. However, he argued, 'I believe it was necessary' to let French voters speak. The next priority is to pass a budget law Macron said the new prime minister 'will be charged with forming a government of general interest.' He confirmed that a special law will be presented by mid-December to enable the state to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year’s rules, and avoid a shutdown. 'Public services will be operational, businesses will be able to work,' he said. The new government will then prepare a budget law for 2025, which will allow France to invest as planned in its military, its justice and police — and also to support struggling farmers, Macron said. How to achieve ‘the impossible’ Along with its own domestic political and financial difficulties — not least France’s ballooning levels of debt — Macron noted that the country faces multiple international challenges, citing the wars in Ukraine and Middle East. He looked back at the Paris Olympics in July-August and ahead to the reopening this weekend of Notre Dame Cathedral, arguing that France can emerge from this latest political crisis if it sets its mind on it. 'It’s proof that we know how to do great things, that we know how to achieve the impossible,' he said. 'Twice this year, the world has admired us for this,' he said, referring to the hosting of the Olympics and the restoration of Notre Dame. 'Well, for the nation, we must do same thing.' Pressure to act swiftly Macron faces the critical task of naming a replacement for Barnier capable of leading a minority government in a parliament where no party holds a majority. Yaël Braun-Pivet, president of the National Assembly and a member of Macron’s party, urged the president to move quickly. 'I recommend he decide rapidly on a new prime minister,' Braun-Pivet said Thursday on France Inter radio. 'There must not be any political hesitation. We need a leader who can speak to everyone and work to pass a new budget bill.' The process may prove challenging. French media have reported a shortlist of centrist candidates who might appeal to both sides of the political spectrum. Calls for Macron to step down The no-confidence vote has galvanized opposition leaders, with some explicitly calling for Macron’s resignation. 'I believe that stability requires the departure of the President of the Republic,' Manuel Bompard, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, said on BFM TV Wednesday night. Far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, whose party holds the most seats in the Assembly, stopped short of calling for Macron’s resignation but warned that 'the pressure on the President of the Republic will get stronger and stronger.' The French constitution does not call for a president to resign after his government was ousted by the National Assembly. It also says that new legislative elections cannot be held until at least July, creating a potential stalemate for policymakers. Economic uncertainty looms The political instability has heightened concerns about France’s economy, particularly its debt, which could rise to 7% of GDP next year without significant reforms. Analysts say that Barnier's government downfall could push up French interest rates, digging the debt even further. Rating agency Moody’s warned late Wednesday that the government’s fall 'reduces the likelihood of consolidating public finances' and worsens the political gridlock. Teachers' protest takes a political tone A planned protest by teachers against budget cuts in education took on a new tone Thursday, as demonstrators in Paris linked their demands to the political crisis. 'Macron quit!' read a sign held by Dylan Quenon, a 28-year-old teacher at a middle school in Aubervilliers, just north of Paris. Quenon said Macron bears responsibility for what he described as the dismantling of public services such as schools. 'The only way for this to change is to have him out of office,' he said. Protesters expressed little hope that Macron’s next appointee would reverse course. 'I’m glad this government is falling, but it could possibly lead to something even worse,' said Élise De La Gorce, a 33-year-old teacher in Stains, north of Paris.	https://apnews.com/article/france-macron-government-collapse-24681982fc526ffdafd57e53773ef855	2024-12-05T02:50:03-08:00	
OPEC+ oil alliance faces stagnant prices for crude while US drivers enjoy cheaper gasoline	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Members of the OPEC + alliance of oil exporting countries will decide Thursday whether to put off plans to pump more crude amid sluggish demand and competing production from non-allied countries -- factors that could keep oil prices stagnant into next year. Key beneficiaries of that would be U.S. motorists, who have seen gasoline prices fall to their lowest in 2 1/2 years to near $3 a gallon. OPEC+, which includes Saudi Arabia as the dominant member of the OPEC producers' cartel, and Russia as the leading non-OPEC member in the 23-country alliance, is holding an online meeting over whether to put off production increases that are scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. Eight OPEC+ members planned to start increasing production from Jan. 1 by gradually restoring 2.2 million barrels per day in previous production cuts. Analysts now say the group could postpone production increases for another three months as it monitors demand. Oil prices have been slack due to weaker than expected demand from China as well as increased production from countries like Brazil and Argentina that aren't in OPEC+. Oil analysts have been busy reducing their estimates for demand for next year, meaning that OPEC+ could remain in a bind well into 2025. The Saudis need oil revenue to carry out Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s ambitious plans to diversify his country’s economy, including the development of Neom, a $500 billion futuristic city in the desert. For Russia, oil export revenues are a key pillar of state finances and funding for the war against Ukraine. Holding back production risks losing market share. Yet increasing production and sales could lower prices in a global economy that analysts say is already well supplied with oil. U.S. oil has been stuck around $70 per barrel and traded at $68.92 on Thursday ahead of the meeting, down from $80 in August. International benchmark Brent crude traded at $72.66 per barrel, down from around $80 in July. One result of those slack prices is that U.S. average pump prices for gasoline fell to $3.03 a gallon this week, the lowest since May, 2021 and well down from their record peak of $5.02 from June, 2022, according to motoring club AAA. Thirty-one U.S. states now have average gas prices below $3 a gallon. U.S. oil price levels of $70 or less 'are great for consumers,' said AAA spokesman Andrew Gross. Crude oil makes up about half the price of a gallon of gasoline, making crude the key factor on top of distribution costs and taxes. Motorists in Europe see far smaller fluctuations because taxes make up a much bigger chunk of the cost. OPEC has cut its forecast for 2025 demand growth to 1.54 million barrels per day, from 1.85 million barrels per day in July. That is at the high end of estimates compared to those from the International Energy Agency at 990,000 barrels per day, U.S. Energy Information Administration at 1.22 million and energy intelligence firm Rystad Energy at 1.1 million. Analysts at Commerzbank foresee Brent prices averaging $75 per barrel in the first quarter of next year and $80 for the remaining three quarters. In the United States, Donald Trump’s return to the White House will likely lead to more fossil fuel production. Not only has the President-elect campaigned on more drilling, but his Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent has put together an economic plan with the goal of increasing domestic oil production by the equivalent of 3 million barrels a day. Bessent has indicated that the additional oil production would reduce inflationary pressures for U.S. consumers. But the Trump team has not fully outlined why oil producers would ramp up supplies and lower prices to levels that could hurt their profits. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1960, by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. It has since expanded to 12 member countries. In 2016, largely in response to dramatically falling oil prices due to U.S. shale oil output, OPEC signed an agreement with 10 other oil-producing countries to create OPEC+. —- Josh Boak contributed from Washington DC.	https://apnews.com/article/opec-oil-gas-prices-energy-7e3a7a4b86e966ba9b609e23825e4ccc	2024-12-05T02:07:49-08:00	
Who is the South Korean leader who tried to impose martial law?	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Decades of achievement led Yoon Suk Yeol to the pinnacle of political power in South Korea, but his legacy may now boil down to a single, baffling decision to send out troops under martial law over vague claims that one of Asia's leading democracies was under threat. Was there any clue in Yoon's background that this was coming? Yoon, a staunch conservative and longtime prosecutor, went from political novice to president of South Korea in 2022, ending five years of liberal rule that saw failed efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis and a slackening economy. But his time in office has been marked by near-constant friction with an opposition-controlled parliament, threats of annihilation from North Korea and a series of scandals involving him and and his wife. Observers say he has long taken criticism personally and relies on the advice of hardcore loyalists, and that he makes impulsive decisions. As he faces impeachment by parliament, no one thing explains his attempt to shut down the mechanisms of a democratic nation over his still unexplained claim that 'anti-state forces' were acting under the influence of North Korea. But there are strands in Yoon's background, and especially in the intense acrimony with the liberal opposition and his hardline standoff with North Korea, that help illuminate what could turn out to be the defining moment of his presidency. A turbulent rise to top prosecutor Despite his 2 1/2 years as president, Yoon's career has been overwhelmingly about the law, not politics. Yoon, 63, was born in Seoul to two professors, and went to prestigious Seoul National University, where he studied law. A major moment, according to Yoon, happened in 1980 when he played the role of a judge in a mock trial of then-dictator Chun Doo-hwan, who had staged a military coup the previous year, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. In the aftermath, Yoon had to flee to the countryside as Chun’s military extended martial law and placed troops and armored vehicles at the university. Yoon returned to the capital and eventually began a career as a state prosecutor that would last nearly three decades, building an image as strong-minded and uncompromising. Prone to confrontation But he has also faced criticism that his personality was unsuited to high-level leadership. 'President Yoon isn’t well-prepared, and he does things off the cuff,' Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership, said. 'He also tends to express his emotions too directly. The things that he likes and dislikes are easy to see, and he tends to handle things with a small group of his own people, not the majority of people.' During a parliament audit in 2013, Yoon, then a senior prosecutor, said he was under pressure from his boss, who said he opposed Yoon's investigation into an allegation that the country’s spy agency had conducted an illicit online campaign to help conservative President Park Geun-hye win the previous year’s election. At the time, he famously said, 'I’m not loyal to (high-level) people.' He was demoted, but after Park’s government was toppled over a separate corruption scandal in 2017, then President Moon Jae-in made Yoon head of a Seoul prosecution office, which investigated Park and other conservative leaders. Moon later named Yoon the nation’s top prosecutor. A neophyte in politics Yoon only joined party politics about a year before he won the presidency, abandoning the liberal Moon after an impasse over a probe of Moon's allies. Moon’s supporters said he was trying to thwart Moon’s prosecution reforms and elevate his own political standing. The 2022 presidential race was Yoon’s first election campaign. Yoon beat his rival, liberal firebrand Lee Jae-myung, by less than 1 percentage point in South Korea’s most closely fought presidential election. Their campaign was one of the nastiest in recent memory. Yoon compared Lee’s party to 'Hitler' and 'Mussolini.' Lee’s allies called Yoon 'a beast' and 'dictator' and derided his wife’s alleged plastic surgery. Domestic political strife Yoon's time as president has been dominated by frustration and acrimony, much stemming from his narrow victory and his party's failure to win control of parliament. The liberal opposition's control of parliament will continue until he leaves office in 2027 after its resounding parliamentary election wins earlier this year. Gridlock in parliament has led to an increasingly tense political discourse. When Yoon declared the state of emergency, he said a goal was to eliminate 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces' that he said were plotting rebellion, in an apparent reference to the opposition Democratic Party. During Tuesday’s martial law announcement, Yoon highlighted his rivals’ repeated attempts to impeach his top officials and their bid to curtail key parts of next year’s budget bill as major reasons for his declaration. Claims of corruption have also battered his approval ratings. Last month, Yoon denied wrongdoing in an influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife. Spy camera footage in a separate scandal also purportedly shows the first lady, Kim Keon Hee, accepting a luxury bag as a gift from a pastor. Choi said he thinks Yoon likely planned the 'clumsy martial law' edict to divert public attention away from the scandals. 'Whether he will be politically dead or not, he tried to massively shake up the political world,' Choi said. 'But he failed. He likely believed there was no other option.' North Korea has lashed out at his hard line If political squabbles and scandal have set the tenor of Yoon's domestic presidency, its foreign policy has been characterized by a bitter standoff with North Korea. Yoon early on in his presidency promised 'an audacious plan' to improve the North’s economy if it abandoned its nuclear weapons. But things turned sour quickly, as North Korea ramped up its weapons tests and threats to attack the South. By last year North Korea was calling Yoon 'a guy with a trash-like brain' and 'a diplomatic idiot.' And for months now, North Korea has taken that trash theme literally, sending thousands of balloons filled with garbage over the border, including some that made it to the presidential compound in Seoul at least twice. Yoon's mention of North Korea as a domestic destabilizing force reminded some of an earlier South Korea, which until the late 1980s was ruled by a series of strongmen who repeatedly invoked the threat from the North to justify effort to suppress domestic dissidents and political opponents. ___ Klug reported from Tokyo.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-president-impeachment-53d787e9f04d32615e83aade47412174	2024-12-05T01:46:08-08:00	
Notre Dame’s resurrection: Its chief architect on rebuilding France’s 'heart' in 5 years	PARIS (AP) — The day after the inferno struck Notre Dame on April 15, 2019, Philippe Villeneuve walked despondently into the remains of his cathedral. Smoke choked the spring air, the spire lay in rubble, and charred beams littered the nave. 'We had lost the framework, the roof, the spire, and three sections of the vault,' Villeneuve, its chief architect since 2013, said. Yet just hours earlier, President Emmanuel Macron had issued an extraordinary decree: Notre Dame would rise again — in just five years. 'There was one sole (problem),' Villeneuve said in an interview with The Associated Press, 'the deadline.' It felt impossible. Yet as Villeneuve stepped through the wreckage with doubts in his mind, he was caught by surprise. Terrifying as it was to see the charred remains of the 861-year-old Gothic treasure, a beacon of hope emerged. 'All the stained-glass windows were spared, the great organ, the furniture, the paintings -— everything was intact,' he realized. 'It was doable.' A historic restoration Macron’s decree became the driving force behind the most prominent restoration in modern French history. The announcement sparked unprecedented global support, with donations quickly nearing $1 billion. Yet, other obstacles came in waves. First, the fire’s immediate aftermath brought a lead contamination crisis that halted work for a month, and woke the world up to the dangers of lead dust. Then came the pandemic, forcing workers off site. Weather, too, seemed to conspire, with heavy rains delaying the removal of the scorched scaffolding that had fused into a skeletal reminder of the disaster. But Villeneuve persisted, working with his team on what he called the 'presidential building site' to redefine what was possible under extraordinary conditions. He lobbied for the final reopening date to be delayed from April of this year to align with Dec. 8 — a Catholic holy day celebrating Mary’s conception without sin — a symbolic choice that felt both achievable and sacred. His irreverent sense of humor — delivered amid expletives, and with a childlike grin that belies his 61 years and his silver hair — seems to have carried him through the relentless five years of work. But as the reopening fast approaches, Villeneuve confessed his lingering anxiety. 'I’m not calm — not at all. I’m completely stressed out,' he said. 'This was not just about restoring a building. This was about restoring the heart of France.' More beautiful than ever There were positives. The fire badly scarred the cathedral but also revealed its hidden brilliance — with many who glimpsed the restored interiors last week saying they are more majestic than before the catastrophe. 'It’s horrible to say (of the fire), but every cloud has a silver lining,' Villeneuve said, smiling. 'The stone is luminous now. It almost glows.' The intense heat and falling debris left behind a film of toxic lead dust, requiring meticulous cleaning of every surface. Sculptures, walls and organ pipes were painstakingly stripped of grime and soot, exposing a brightness unseen for centuries. Strolling through the medieval wooden beams of the reconstructed framework, so complicated it is known as the 'forest,' or beneath the newly restored spire, Villeneuve felt the work was so seamless it seemed as if the inferno might never have happened, he said. 'That’s success,' Villeneuve said. 'If I can make (cathedral visitors) doubt there was ever a fire, then I’ve erased the horror.' Inked devotion While his restoration adhered faithfully to the historical designs of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, Villeneuve found a deeply personal way to mark his connection to Notre Dame. He knew he could not leave his name etched into the stone, so he chose to get a long, bold tattoo running down his forearm, calling himself 'Rock and Roll' for it. It depicts Viollet-le-Duc’s original spire — the one that collapsed in the fire — not the newly restored version crowned with the golden phoenix cum rooster. Complementing it is another tattoo over his chest, inspired by the cathedral’s stained glass, forming a rosary design. 'This wasn’t about me,' he said, 'but I’ve left my mark in my own way.' Viollet-le-Duc’s 19th-century spire, a meticulous recreation of a medieval aesthetic, remains at the heart of the restoration. 'He was a genius,' Villeneuve said of the architect. 'My role was to ensure that vision endured.' Lingering mystery of the fire While Notre Dame’s restoration has proceeded with remarkable precision, one question still looms over Villeneuve: the cause of the fire, a frustrating investigation into one of the biggest mysteries in France in living memory. Despite extensive efforts, money and interest, authorities have still not identified the blaze’s origin. Initial theories suggested an electrical short circuit, possibly linked to ongoing renovation work, but no definitive cause has been established. The lingering uncertainty still troubles Villeneuve as the cathedral nears its reopening. It’s personal, particularly as he was in charge when the fire broke out. 'It’s something that haunts you. Not the responsibility for the fire — I know very well that I bear no personal responsibility for it,' he said. 'At least, I think so.' 'But it annoys me not to know.' In the wake of the disaster, lessons have been learned, and steps taken to ensure Notre Dame’s protection in the future. Villeneuve and his team have installed cutting-edge fire safety systems in the cathedral to prevent a similar catastrophe. The attic, now divided into three fire compartments—choir, transept, and nave—features advanced thermal cameras, smoke detectors, and a revolutionary water-misting system. Unlike traditional sprinklers, this system releases a fine mist of water droplets designed to extinguish flames while minimizing damage to the fragile wood and stone. 'The mist saturates the air, reducing oxygen levels to smother fires without harming the wood or stone,' Villeneuve explained. 'These are the most advanced fire safety systems in any French cathedral. We had to learn from what happened. We owe it to the future.' Triumph of Notre Dame Standing on the banks of the Seine, Notre Dame’s spire once again reaching into the Parisian sky, Villeneuve allowed himself a moment of quiet pride as he took questions and compliments from passersby — enjoying his new 'celebrity' status. For Villeneuve, the journey — his life's work, shortly before he retires — has been as personal as it was monumental. 'The cathedral burned, she collapsed, and I collapsed the same day,' he said, speaking of the monument in visceral, human terms. 'I gradually got back up as she got back up. As the scars began closing, I felt better. Now I feel ready to leave the hospital.' He suggested that the nation’s wounds are also healing as the reopening approaches. With 15 million visitors expected per year — 3 million more than before the fire — Villeneuve’s work continues to resonate, both in stone and spirit. ___ For more of AP’s coverage on Notre Dame, visit https://apnews.com/hub/notre-dame-cathedral	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-architect-interview-restoration-f78fa349d4275f93a97fe1d2c5c82e29	2024-12-05T01:42:35-08:00	
European satellites launched to create artificial solar eclipses in a tech demo	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A pair of European satellites rocketed into orbit Thursday on the first mission to create artificial solar eclipses through fancy formation flying in space. Each fake eclipse should last six hours once operations begin next year. That's considerably longer than the few minutes of totality offered by a natural eclipse here on Earth, allowing for prolonged study of the sun's corona, or outer atmosphere. The launch took place from India. 'We are a very happy science team here' in India, the European Space Agency's mission scientist Joe Zender said via email. Billed as a tech demo, the two satellites will separate in a month or so and fly 492 feet (150 meters) apart once reaching their destination high above Earth, lining up with the sun so that one spacecraft casts a shadow on the other. This will require extreme precision, within just one millimeter, equivalent to a fingernail's thickness, according to the European Space Agency. To maintain their position, the satellites will rely on GPS, star trackers, lasers and radio links, flying autonomously. Each cube-shaped spacecraft is less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) across. The shadow-casting satellite holds a disk to block the sun from the telescope on the other satellite. This disk will mimic the moon in a natural total solar eclipse, with the darkened satellite posing as Earth. 'This has a huge scientific relevance' in addition to testing high-precision formation flying,' said the European Space Agency’s technology and engineering director Dietmar Pilz. Scientists need the glaring face of the sun completely blocked in order to scrutinize the wispy crown-like corona encircling it, getting an especially good look close to the solar rim on this mission. They're particularly interested to learn why the corona is hotter than the surface of the sun, and also want to better understand coronal mass ejections, eruptions of billions of tons of plasma with magnetic fields out into space. The resulting geomagnetic storms can disrupt power and communication on Earth and in orbit. Such outbursts can also produce stunning auroras in unexpected places. With a lopsided orbit stretching from 370 miles (600 kilometers) to 37,000 miles (60,000 kilometers) away, the satellites will take nearly 20 hours to circle the world. Six of those hours — at the farther end of certain orbits — will be spent generating an eclipse. Other orbits will be strictly for formation flying experiments, according to the European Space Agency. The first eclipse results should be available in March, following checkout of both craft. Zender said eclipses will be created at least twice a week, with six hours of totality each time for corona observations. The frequency will depend on solar activity, he noted, and prove a boon for scientists who now must travel across the world for a mere three to five minutes of totality during the occasional eclipse. The $210 million mission, dubbed Proba-3, is aiming for at least 1,000 hours of 'on demand' totality during its two-year operation. Once their job is done, both satellites will gradually drop lower until they burn up in the atmosphere, likely within five years. Liftoff was delayed a day by a last-minute issue with the backup propulsion system of one of the satellites, crucial for precision formation flying. The European Space Agency said engineers relied on a computer software fix. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Syrian army says it has withdrawn from the city of Hama after insurgents broke through its defenses	BEIRUT (AP) — The Syrian army says it has withdrawn from the central city of Hama after insurgents broke through its defenses, in another setback for President Bashar Assad. The announcement Thursday came hours after opposition fighters said they had entered the city and were marching toward the center. The Syrian army said it redeployed from Hama and took positions outside the city to protect the lives of civilians. The capture of Hamas, Syria’s fourth largest city, is another blow for Assad days after insurgents captured much of the northern city of Aleppo, the country’s largest city. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian insurgents said they entered parts of the central city of Hama on Thursday after three days of intense clashes with government forces on its outskirts, part of an ongoing offensive in which they also seized Syria's largest city of Aleppo. Syrian state media confirmed violent clashes between government forces and opposition gunmen on the eastern edges of Hama city but denied that the insurgents had breached it. Hama is one of the few cities that remained under full government control during Syria's conflict, which broke out in March 2011 following a popular uprising. Its capture would be a major setback for President Bashar Assad. The offensive is being led by the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham as well as an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Their sudden capture of the northern city of Aleppo, an ancient business hub, was a stunning prize for Assad's opponents and reignited the conflict which had been largely stalemated for the past few years. Aleppo's takeover marked the first opposition attack on the city since 2016, when a brutal Russian air campaign retook it for Assad after rebel forces had initially seized it. Intervention by Russia, Iran and Iranian-allied Hezbollah and other militant groups has allowed Assad to remain in power. The latest flare-up in Syria’s long civil war comes as Assad’s main regional and international backers are preoccupied with their own wars. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced by the renewed fighting, which began with the surprise opposition offensive Nov. 27. The insurgents claimed on their Military Operations Department channel on the Telegram app Thursday that they have entered Hama and are marching toward its center. 'Our forces are taking positions inside the city of Hama,' the channel quoted a local commander identified as Maj. Hassan Abdul-Ghani as saying. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said gunmen have entered parts of the city, mainly the neighborhoods of Sawaaeq and Zahiriyeh to the northwest. It added that gunmen are also on the edge of the northwestern neighborhood of Kazo. 'If Hama falls, it means that the beginning of the regime’s fall has started,' the Observatory’s chief, Rami Abdurrahman, told The Associated Press. Hama is a major intersection point in Syria that links that country’s center with the north as well the east and the west. It is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital, Damascus, Assad’s seat of power. Hama province also borders the coastal province of Latakia, a main base of popular support for Assad. The city's name is synonymous with the 1982 massacre of Hama, one of the most notorious in the modern Middle East, when security forces under Assad's late father, Hafez Assad, killed thousands to crush a Muslim Brotherhood uprising.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-aleppo-hama-hts-russia-0189297bbdc76eee67cb4fdc62136bef	2024-12-05T01:08:51-08:00	
Philippine police checking reports that a kidnapped American has died after being shot	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine police officials said Thursday they are checking reports that a kidnapped American died after being shot twice while resisting his Oct. 17 abduction by gunmen in the country’s south. Elliot Onil Eastman, 26, from Vermont, was shot twice with an M16 rifle while trying to fight off his four kidnappers, who posed as police officers, in the coastal town of Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province, police said. The kidnappers dragged him to a motorboat and sped off, according to earlier police reports. A massive search for Eastman and his abductors led to the arrest of a number of suspects, but he has not been found. Three suspects were killed in a gunbattle with police in the south last month. Regional police spokesperson Lt. Col. Ramoncelio Sawan said investigators received information from a relative of one of the suspects that Eastman died due to gunshot wounds in the thigh and abdomen while being taken away by his abductors. The kidnappers decided to throw his body into the sea after he died, the relative said. The information about Eastman’s death was later corroborated by a key suspect in the kidnapping who was arrested recently, and his sworn statement has been submitted to government prosecutors, Sawan said. Criminal complaints of kidnapping have been filed against several suspects, he said. 'We are constrained to believe that he has died. All of the information that we have points to that,' Sawan said. But he added that without the victim's body, 'we’re still leaving a little bit of hope that it may not be the case' and police would continue their investigation. Philippine police have informed Eastman’s Filipino wife and the U.S. Embassy in Manila about his reported death, Sawan said. The embassy said it's aware of the police report and is coordinating with Philippine authorities, but did not comment further due to privacy considerations. Eastman traveled out of the Philippines and returned to Sibuco to attend his wife's graduation when he was kidnapped. He had been posting Facebook videos of his life in Sibuco, a poor, remote coastal town, where the suspects spotted him, police earlier said. They said the suspects appeared to be common criminals who did not belong to any Muslim rebel groups which have been accused of ransom kidnappings in the past. Security problems have long hounded the southern Philippines, the homeland of a Muslim minority in the largely Roman Catholic nation. The southern third of the Philippines has bountiful resources but has long been hamstrung by poverty, insurgencies and outlaws. A 2014 peace agreement between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest of several Muslim separatist groups, has considerably eased widespread fighting in the south. Relentless military offensives have weakened smaller armed groups such as the Abu Sayyaf, reducing kidnappings, bombings and other violence. The Abu Sayyaf has targeted Americans and other Western tourists and missionaries, most of whom were freed after ransoms were paid. A few were killed, including American Guillermo Sobero, who was beheaded on the southern island of Basilan, and a U.S. missionary, Martin Burnham, who was killed while Philippine army forces were trying to rescue him and his wife, Gracia Burnham, in 2002 in a rainforest near Sibuco.	https://apnews.com/article/kidnapped-american-elliot-onil-eastman-sibuco-southern-philippines-d75607aa99d778f91a3a3ef85581518b	2024-12-04T23:38:37-08:00	
UK leader Starmer will outline his 'Plan for Change.' Just don't call it a relaunch	LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is trying to change the narrative on his five-month-old government after plummeting approval ratings, business anxiety over tax hikes and protesting farmers clogging London streets. Conservative opposition leader Kemi Badenoch calls it an 'emergency reset' by a floundering administration. But Starmer’s office says the 'Plan for Change' speech the prime minister will deliver on Thursday is not a relaunch or about-face, but 'the next phase' in his government plan, intended to persuade voters that the government is making their lives better. Starmer’s center-left Labour Party was elected in Jul — ending 14 years of Conservative government — on a promise to get Britain’s sluggish economy growing and restore frayed public services such as the state-funded National Health Service. But it has been criticized, including by Labour supporters, for failing to show people how their lives will improve any time soon. The speech will set out 'milestones' for measuring progress on economic growth, clean energy, reforming childcare and education, bolstering the NHS and cutting crime. It includes a pledge of 13,000 more neighborhood police officers within five years. Starmer's office said he will say that 'hard-working Brits ... reasonably want a stable economy, their country to be safe, their borders secure, more cash in their pocket, safer streets in their town, opportunities for their children, secure British energy in their home, and an NHS that is there when they need it.' The government hopes to reverse a slew of negative headlines over its economic decisions — taken, it says, because the previous Conservative government left a 22 billion pound ($28 billion) 'black hole' in the public finances. Spending cuts have included removing from millions of retirees a payment that helps cover winter heating costs – a move that sat awkwardly with revelations that Starmer had accepted clothes and other freebies at a time when millions of people are struggling with the cost of living The government’s first budget in late October included billions in new money for the health system, but also hiked a tax paid by employers, to the alarm of many businesses, and imposed inheritance tax on farmers for the first time in decades. Thousands of farmers thronged the streets around Parliament in November to protest a levy they say will ruin many family farms. The government says three-quarters of farms won’t have to pay inheritance tax under the new rules. Starmer also lost a member of his Cabinet last week, when Transport Secretary Louise Haigh resigned over an old fraud conviction involving a cell phone she’d reported stolen. The bad news has sent Starmer’s poll ratings plunging deep into negative territory – though the opposition Conservatives are no more popular. Starmer has had more success abroad, where he is trying to reset Britain’s relations with its European neighbors following years of acrimony over Brexit. But efforts to move closer to the bloc risk angering incoming President Donald Trump, who is hostile to the EU and has threatened to impose tariffs on European goods, Members of Starmer’s government have been strongly critical of Trump in the past, but the Labour government has worked to build ties with the president-elect. Before the U.S. election, Starmer flew to New York for dinner with the then-Republican presidential candidate. 'When President Trump graciously hosted me for dinner in Trump Tower, I told him that we will invest more deeply than ever in this transatlantic bond with our American friends in the years to come,' Starmer said in a foreign-policy speech on Monday. Starmer rejected the idea 'that we must choose between our allies, that somehow we’re with either America or Europe.' 'The national interest demands that we work with both,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/keir-starmer-speech-change-plan-755ebc69711bd31ac9b94293c623e14a	2024-12-04T20:19:37-08:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street quiet after hitting another record, bitcoin surges above $100,000	U.S. markets were quiet early Thursday following another record rally on Wall Street, while bitcoin surged above $100,000 for the first time. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were each down less than 0.1% before the bell. Bitcoin powered above $100,000 late Wednesday, U.S. time, after President-elect Donald Trump chose crypto advocate Paul Atkins as his nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from $69,374 on Nov. 5, Election Day. Early Thursday, it was trading at $102,826, according to CoinDesk. In equities trading early Thursday, discount retailer Five Below jumped more than 14% after the Philadelphia company trounced Wall Street's third-quarter sales and profit forecasts. It's quite the turnaround from July, when Five Below slashed guidance and announced that its CEO and President Joel Anderson had stepped down amid languishing sales. Dollar General, another discount retailer, gained close to 2% in premarket after it topped sales projections but missed on Wall Street’s per-share profit targets. Fashion retailer American Eagle fell 13.7% after it beat profit targets but disappointed investors with tepid guidance and warnings of potentially sluggish sales during non-peak periods lacking a major holiday. Elsewhere, in Europe at midday France's CAC 40 ticked up just 0.1% in early trading after the country's far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined together to vote on a no-confidence motion prompted by budget disputes that will force Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet to resign. Germany's DAX rose 0.3% while Britain's FTSE 100 was unchanged. In Asian trading, South Korea's Kospi fell 0.9% to 2,441.85, extending a 1.4% decline the day before as President Yoon Suk Yeol was facing possible impeachment after he suddenly declared martial law on Tuesday night. He revoked the martial law declaration six hours later. Yoon accepted his defense minister's resignation Thursday as opposition parties moved to impeach them both. The main opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted a joint motion to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over his martial law declaration. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.3% to finish at 39,395.60, while Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.2% to 8,474.90. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.9% to 19,560.44. The Shanghai Composite gained 0.1% to 3,368.86. Taiwan's Taiex gained nearly 0.1%, while the Sensex in India was up 0.9%. This week’s highlight for Wall Street will be Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. government, which will show how many people employers hired and fired last month. Expectations are brewing that the Fed will cut its main interest rate again when it meets in two weeks. The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September, hoping to offer more support for the job market. The central bank had appeared set to continue cutting rates into next year, but the election of Donald Trump has scrambled Wall Street’s expectations somewhat. Trump’s preference for higher tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, which could alter the Fed’s plans. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 24 cents to $68.78 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also rose 24 cents, to $72.55 a barrel. The OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries will decide Thursday whether to put off plans to pump more crude amid sluggish demand and competing production from non-allied countries -- factors that could keep oil prices stagnant into next year. Key beneficiaries of that would be U.S. motorists, who have seen gasoline prices fall to their lowest in 2 1/2 years to near $3 a gallon. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 150.43 Japanese yen from 150.62 yen. The euro cost $1.0534, inching up from $1.0510.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-fed-rates-bitcoin-88d737ab0669b10c06ab39386ed30a74	2024-12-04T19:20:33-08:00	
South Korea's Yoon replaces defense chief as parliament is poised to vote on his impeachment	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's president accepted the resignation of his defense minister Thursday as opposition parties moved to impeach both men over the stunning yet short-lived imposition of martial law that brought armed troops into Seoul streets. The main opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted a joint motion to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over his martial law declaration the previous night. Martial law lasted about six hours, as the National Assembly quickly voted to overrule the president, forcing his Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Wednesday. On Thursday, Yoon replaced Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun with Choi Byung Hyuk, a retired four-star general who is South Korea’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Yoon's office said. It didn't provide any further comments by Yoon. He hasn't made any public appearances since he announced in a televised address that his government was lifting the martial law declaration. The opposition parties earlier submitted a separate motion to impeach Kim, alleging he recommended Yoon impose martial law. On Wednesday, Kim offered to resign and apologized for causing disruption and concern to the public. Kim said 'all troops who performed duties related to martial law were acting on my instructions, and all responsibility lies with me,' according to the Defense Ministry. The impeachment motion on Yoon was introduced at a parliamentary plenary session early Thursday, meaning it can be put to a vote between Friday and Sunday. By law, the motion will be scrapped if it isn’t voted within 72 hours of its parliamentary introduction. Opposition parties can submit a new impeachment motion if the current one is scrapped or voted down, according to National Assembly officials. Prospects for Yoon’s impeachment isn’t clear as Yoon’s ruling conservative People Power Party decided Thursday to oppose the motion’s passage. Choo Kyung-ho, the floor leader of the PPP, told reporters that his party would hold another meeting to determine how to oppose the motion’s passage. Observers say PPP members could simply boycott a floor vote or cast ballots against the motion. Impeaching him would require support from two-thirds of the single-chamber National Assembly, or 200 of its 300 members. The opposition parties together have 192 seats and they need additional votes from the PPP. Some experts earlier said the motion will likely be passed through parliament as 18 PPP lawmakers, who belong to an anti-Yoon faction in the party, already voted down Yoon’s martial law decree together with opposition lawmakers. But speaking to reporters Thursday, PPP leader Han Dong-hun, head of the anti-Yoon faction, said he would work to ensure that the impeachment motion doesn't pass though he remains critical of Yoon’s action, which he described as 'unconstitutional.' Han said that there is a need to 'prevent damage to citizens and supporters caused by unprepared chaos.' Experts say rival factions in PPP could unite not to repeat their traumatic experiences following the 2016 impeachment of scandal-ridden conservative President Park Geun-hye, which happened after some lawmakers at her own party voted to impeach her. Park was eventually removed from office and arrested in 2017, and the liberals easily won the presidency in a by-election as conservatives remained in disarray. If Yoon is impeached, he will be deprived of his constitutional powers until the Constitutional Court rules. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who holds the No. 2 position in the South Korean government, would take over presidential responsibilities. The impeachment motion on Yoon accuses him of attempting a 'self-coup' by mobilizing the military. It also says Yoon's declaration failed to meet the constitutional requirements that such steps should only be considered in severe crisis situations. The motion also argues that his move to declare a suspension of political party activities and deploy troops in an attempt to seal the National Assembly amounted to rebellion. Yoon’s martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, harkened back to South Korea’s past military-backed governments when authorities occasionally proclaimed martial law and other decrees that allowed them to station soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or at public places such as schools to prevent anti-government demonstrations. Until Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, such scenes of military intervention had not been seen since South Korea achieved a democracy in the late 1980s. After Yoon’s declaration, troops carrying full battle gear, including assault rifles, tried to keep protesters away from the National Assembly as military helicopters flew overhead and landed nearby. It wasn’t clear how the 190 lawmakers were able to enter a parliamentary hall to vote down Yoon’s martial law decree. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung and National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik were seen climbing over walls. As troops and police officers blocked some from entering, they didn’t aggressively restrain or use force against others.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-impeachment-8e1ffc82990d6bdce8d80dffc3815f62	2024-12-04T16:50:27-08:00	
Rescuers search for 13 workers missing after a construction site collapsed in southern China	BEIJING (AP) — Chinese authorities on Thursday were searching for 13 workers missing after a construction site caved in in the southern business center of Shenzhen. An emergency management bureau's statement said the collapse occurred at about 11 p.m. on Wednesday at the construction site of a section of the Shenzhen-Jiangmen Railway in Bao’an district. Residents living nearby have been evacuated. An investigation into the cause was underway. State broadcaster CCTV reported some roads were closed during the operation.	https://apnews.com/article/china-construction-site-collapse-people-missing-5eb4bbf5bcb68e10a58ec27c5e6e5189	2024-12-04T16:50:22-08:00	
Weather hampers a search for 3 American and Canadian climbers missing on New Zealand's highest peak	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand authorities have 'grave concerns' for three mountain climbers from the U.S. and Canada who are missing after a planned ascent of the country’s highest peak, Aoraki, as efforts to find them stalled for a third day amid bad weather. Strong winds meant an aerial search for the men could not resume as anticipated on Thursday, Police Area Commander Inspector Vicki Walker said in a statement. The Americans — Kurt Blair, 56, from Colorado and Carlos Romero, 50, of California — are certified alpine guides, according to the website of the nonprofit American Mountain Guides Association. New Zealand authorities have not named the Canadian climber at the request of his family. The men flew to a hut partway up the mountain on Saturday to begin their ascent and were reported missing on Monday when they did not arrive to meet their prearranged transport after the climb. Searchers hours later found several climbing-related items believed to belong to the men, but no sign of them, police said. The search for the men stalled on Tuesday and Wednesday due to deteriorating weather conditions on Aoraki, also known as Mount Cook, with heavy rain and snow forecast. Walker earlier hoped efforts would resume Thursday but said conditions on the day were unsafe. Aoraki is 3,724 meters (12,218 feet) high and is part of the Southern Alps, the scenic and icy mountain range that runs the length of New Zealand’s South Island. A settlement of the same name at its base is a destination for domestic and foreign tourists. The peak is popular among experienced climbers. Its terrain is technically difficult due to crevasses, avalanche risk, changeable weather and glacier movement. More than 240 deaths have been recorded on the mountain and in the surrounding national park since the start of the 20th century.	https://apnews.com/article/climbers-zealand-aoraki-mountain-cook-blair-romero-8ba5efdf58a090a7aae9f2b877089ba6	2024-12-04T15:35:38-08:00	
Amnesty International says genocide is occurring in Gaza, an accusation Israel rejects	CAIRO (AP) — Amnesty International accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip during its war with Hamas, saying it has sought to deliberately destroy Palestinians by mounting deadly attacks, demolishing vital infrastructure and preventing the delivery of food, medicine and other aid. The human rights group released a report Thursday in the Middle East that said such actions could not be justified by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, which ignited the war, or the presence of militants in civilian areas. Amnesty said the United States and other allies of Israel could be complicit in genocide, and called on them to halt arms shipments. 'Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now,' Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said in the report. Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has adamantly rejected genocide allegations against it as an antisemitic 'blood libel.' It is challenging such allegations at the International Court of Justice, and it has rejected the International Criminal Court's accusations that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister committed war crimes in Gaza. 'The deplorable and fanatical organization Amnesty International has once again produced a fabricated report that is entirely false and based on lies,' Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Israel accused Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate Israel, of carrying out a genocidal massacre in the attack that triggered the war, and said it is defending itself in accordance with international law. Amnesty says Palestinians face a ‘slow, calculated death’ Amnesty's report adds an influential voice to a growing list of players that have accused Israel of committing genocide — which would put it in the company of some of the deadliest conflicts of the past 80 years, including Cambodia, Sudan and Rwanda. The accusations have largely come from human rights groups and allies of the Palestinians. But last month, Pope Francis called for an investigation to determine if Israeli actions amounted to genocide, and Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who has signaled readiness to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, accused it of committing genocide. Israel says it is at war with Hamas, not the people of Gaza. And key allies, including the U.S. and Germany, have also pushed back against the genocide allegations. But Amnesty accused Israel of violating the 1951 Genocide Convention through acts it says are intended to bring about the physical destruction of Gaza's Palestinian population by exposing them to 'a slow, calculated death.' Amnesty said it analyzed the overall pattern of Israel’s conduct in Gaza between Oct. 7, 2023 and early July. It noted that there is no casualty threshold in proving the international crime of genocide, which is defined by the United Nations as acts intended to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. To establish intent, Amnesty said it reviewed over 100 statements by Israeli government and military officials and others since the start of the war that 'dehumanized Palestinians, called for or justified genocidal acts or other crimes against them.' Israeli officials have previously said that such statements were taken out of context or referred to their stated goal of destroying Hamas, not Palestinian civilians. Israel says it goes to great lengths to protect civilians and comply with international law -- including ordering civilians to evacuate areas ahead of airstrikes and ground offensives. It also says it has facilitated the deliveries of large quantities of food and humanitarian supplies -- a claim that is disputed by the U.N. and aid organizations working inside Gaza. On Sunday, a former top Israeli general and defense minister accused the government of ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza, where the army has sealed off the towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and the Jabaliya refugee camp and allowed almost no humanitarian aid to enter. Amnesty said it found that Israel 'deliberately inflicted conditions of life on Palestinians in Gaza intended to lead, over time, to their destruction.' Those actions included the destruction of homes, farms, hospitals and water facilities; mass evacuation orders; and the restriction of humanitarian aid and other essential services. It also analyzed 15 airstrikes from the start of the war until April that killed at least 334 civilians, including 141 children, and wounded hundreds of other people. It said it found no evidence that any of the strikes were directed at military objectives. It said one of the strikes destroyed the Abdelal family home in the southern city of Rafah on April 20, killing three generations of Palestinians, including 16 children, while they were sleeping. An Associated Press investigation identified at least 60 families in which at least 25 members had been killed. Amnesty has previously angered Israel by joining other major rights groups in accusing it of the international crime of apartheid, saying that for decades it has systematically denied Palestinians basic rights in the territories under its control. Israel has also denied those allegations. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas, lack of aid on UN Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants fight in dense, residential areas and have built tunnels and other militant infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques. It blames the lack of humanitarian aid on United Nations agencies, accusing them of not delivering hundreds of truckloads of aid that have been allowed in. The U.N. says it is often too dangerous to retrieve and deliver the aid. It blames Israel as the occupying power for the breakdown of law and order — which has enabled armed groups to steal aid convoys — while also accusing it of heavily restricting movement within the territory. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage, including children and older adults. Some 100 captives are still held inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has killed more than 44,500 people, according to Gaza health officials, whose count doesn’t distinguish between civilians and fighters, though they say more than half the dead are women and children. The offensive is among the deadliest and most destructive since World War II, and has destroyed vast areas of the besieged coastal territory. It has displaced some 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people have crammed into squalid tent camps with little in the way of food, water or toilets. Aid groups say the population is at risk of disease and malnutrition, especially as winter sets in. Experts have warned of famine in northern Gaza, which Israel has almost completely sealed off since launching a major military operation there in early October. Hamas militants have repeatedly regrouped there and in other areas, and the group has faced no major internal challenge to its rule. Amnesty says the US needs to press for an end to the war The United States, which has provided crucial military aid to Israel and shielded it from international criticism, has repeatedly appealed to Israel to facilitate more aid, with limited results. The Biden administration said in May that Israel’s use of U.S.-provided weapons in Gaza at times likely violated international humanitarian law but that the evidence was incomplete. Callamard urged the United States, Germany and other countries supplying arms to Israel to pressure Netanyahu to end the war. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-rights-amnesty-genocide-19aa8fb76f7271942e73d5d7a42434e0	2024-12-04T15:03:00-08:00	
Japan's famous sake joins UNESCO's cultural heritage list, a boost to brewers and enthusiasts	LUQUE, Paraguay (AP) — Sake is perhaps more Japanese than the world-famous sushi. It's brewed in centuries-old mountaintop warehouses, savored in the country’s pub-like izakayas, poured during weddings and served slightly chilled for special toasts. The smooth rice wine that plays a crucial role in Japan's culinary traditions was enshrined on Wednesday by UNESCO on its list of the 'intangible cultural heritage of humanity.' At a meeting in Luque, Paraguay, members of UNESCO’s committee for safeguarding humanity's cultural heritage voted to recognize 45 cultural practices and products around the world, including Brazilian white cheese, Caribbean cassava bread and Palestinian olive oil soap. Unlike UNESCO’s World Heritage List, which includes sites considered important to humanity like the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, the Intangible Cultural Heritage designation names products and practices of different cultures that are deserving of recognition. A Japanese delegation welcomed the announcement in Luque. 'Sake is considered a divine gift and is essential for social and cultural events in Japan,' Kano Takehiro, the Japanese ambassador to UNESCO, told The Associated Press. The basic ingredients of sake are few: rice, water, yeast and koji, a rice mold, which breaks down the starches into fermentable sugars like malting does in beer production. The whole two-monthlong process of steaming, stirring, fermenting and pressing can be grueling. The rice — which wields tremendous marketing power as part of Japan's broader cultural identity — is key to the alcoholic brew. For a product to be categorized Japanese sake, the rice must be Japanese. The UNESCO recognition, the delegation said, captured more than the craft knowledge of making high-quality sake. It also honored a tradition dating back some 1,000 years — sake makes a cameo in Japan’s famous 11th century novel, 'The Tale of Genji,' as the drink of choice in the refined Heian court. Now, officials hope to restore sake's image as Japan's premier alcoholic drink even as the younger drinkers in the country switch to imported wine or domestic beer and whiskey. 'It means a lot to Japan and to the Japanese,' Takehiro said of the UNESCO designation. 'This will help to renew interest in traditional sake elaboration.' Also, Japanese breweries have expressed hope that the listing could give a little lift to the country's export economy as the popularity of sake booms around the world and in the United States amid heightened interest in Japanese cuisine. Sake exports, mostly to the U.S. and China, now rake in over $265 million a year, according to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association, a trade group. Japan's delegation appeared ready to celebrate on Wednesday — in classic Japanese style. After the announcement, Takehiro raised a cypress box full of sake to toast the alcoholic brew and cultural rite.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-sake-unesco-world-heritage-intangible-cultural-ffb84ba291342e62bf0e588729538351	2024-12-04T13:24:02-08:00	
Canadian police say stabbing suspect shot dead by police in Vancouver	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — A stabbing suspect is dead after being shot by police in a convenience store in the Canadian city of Vancouver, police said. Vancouver police said the suspect died in hospital Wednesday after being shot and two people suffered injuries that are not thought to be life threatening. Vancouver Police Constable Tania Visintin said one person was stabbed in the hand and another person has facial injuries, but she didn't how how the second person was injured. Witnesses say a man stole liquor and a knife from a restaurant then used the weapon across the street to stab people in a 7-Eleven store. 'One of the kitchen guys came out, asked if he could help him, and the guy grabbed the knife and asked him if he wanted to die,' said Kylie Noel, who was working at the Original Joe’s restaurant at Robson and Hamilton streets in downtown Vancouver on Wednesday. Her co-worker then told her to call police. Video later captured by Mainul Islam, a student and part-time food delivery worker, shows police pointing their guns over the counter of the 7-Eleven, shouting at someone to 'move over,' then firing at least 10 times. Islam said he had been picking up a food order when he saw a 'homeless guy' trying to steal cigarettes behind the counter. He said staff were trying to stop the man. 'And he just brought out his knife from his pocket, and he tried to stab … the guy, but he ran away, and then he went to stab that lady. Maybe he already stabbed that lady in the back, I saw blood, but she was OK.' He said the police were there within minutes and 'just shot this guy.' Noel said that before the shooting, a man came into Original Joe’s and stood by the restaurant’s door, opened a laptop computer and 'demanded a glass of water.' Noel said she refused, and went back to tell kitchen staff that the man was refusing to leave. She said he had left by the time other workers came out, but Noel then saw him outside with a bottle of alcohol she believed was stolen from the restaurant, which she later confirmed by watching security camera footage. When Noel returned to the restaurant’s main floor, the man was again behind the bar, and Noel ran back down to tell her colleagues in the kitchen. She said that was when the man grabbed the knife and threatened Noel’s co-worker. In Islam’s video of the shooting, a stun gun held by an officer appears to have already been fired, with the wires trailing over the counter inside the convenience store. 'Move over, right now. Move over,' one officer shouts at the unseen suspect before gunfire is heard..	https://apnews.com/article/vancouver-stabbing-suspect-shot-b6b40aac2c186e58a7ccf6197fd504b2	2024-12-04T12:06:22-08:00	
Israeli strikes on a Gaza tent camp kill at least 21 people, hospital says	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes tore through a tent camp for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza on Wednesday, sparking fires and killing at least 21 people, according to the head of a nearby hospital, in the latest assault on a sprawling tent city that Israel designated a humanitarian safe zone but has repeatedly targeted. The Israeli military said it struck senior Hamas militants 'involved in terrorist activities' in the area, without providing additional details, and said it took precautions to minimize harm to civilians. The strike on the Muwasi tent camp was one of several deadly assaults across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday. An Israeli attack in central Gaza killed at least 10 more people, including four children, according to Palestinian medics. Israel’s devastating war in Gaza, launched after Hamas’ October 2023 attack, shows no signs of ending after nearly 14 months. Hamas is still holding dozens of Israeli hostages, and most of Gaza’s population has been displaced and is reliant on international food aid to survive. Israel is also pressing a major offensive in the isolated north, where experts say Palestinians might be experiencing famine. The Biden administration has pledged to make a new push for a Gaza ceasefire now that there's a truce in Lebanon between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah, ending more than a year of cross-border fighting. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump demanded this week the release of hostages held by Hamas before he is sworn into office in January. Wednesday's strike in Muwasi — a desolate area with few public services that holds hundreds of thousands of displaced people — wounded at least 28 people, according to Atif al-Hout, the director of Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. An Associated Press journalist at the hospital counted at least 15 bodies, but said reaching a precise number was difficult because many of the dead were dismembered, some without heads or badly burned. In the morgue, an infant's blackened hand and face peeked out from beneath a heavy blanket used to transport bodies to the hospital. 'It was like doomsday,' said a wounded woman, Iman Jumaa, who held back tears as she described how the strike killed her father, her brothers and her brothers' children. Videos and photos of the strike shared widely on social media showed flames and a column of black smoke rising into the night sky, as well as twisted metal tent frames and shredded fabric. Palestinian men searched through the still-burning wreckage, shouting, 'Over here guys!' Further away, civilians stood at a distance, observing the destruction. The military said the strikes had set off secondary blasts, indicating explosives present in the area had detonated. It was not possible to independently confirm the Israeli claims, and the strikes could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp. Shortly after the strike, Al-Awda Hospital said two people had been killed and 38 wounded in an attack on a residential block in the Nuseirat refugee camp. The military had no immediate comment on the strike, but said earlier strikes in central Gaza had hit 'terrorist targets.' Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths, saying the militants often operate in residential areas and are known to position tunnels, rocket launchers and other infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques. Previous Israeli strikes on tent camps in Gaza have drawn widespread international outrage, such as when a wounded student’s last moments were caught on video as he burned to death in a tent outside a hospital. In northern Gaza, dozens of Palestinian families said Israel's expanding offensive had forcibly displaced them from schools-turned-shelters. Associated Press footage showed people on the road Wednesday leaving Beit Lahia, many crowded onto donkey carts with their belongings in their arms. Others walked on foot. 'This morning a quadcopter (drone) detonated four bombs at the school. There were people injured, human remains — we left with nothing,' said Sadeia al-Rahel. The 57-year-old said her family has been eating grass, leaves, and animal feed for two months due to the lack of food aid in the north. The amount of aid entering Gaza plunged in October, and hunger is widespread across the territory, even in central Gaza where aid groups have more access. Humanitarian organizations say Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order make it difficult to deliver assistance. Israel has said it is working to increase the flow of aid. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and around 250 people were abducted. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. On Wednesday, Israel said its forces recovered the body of a hostage who was captured alive during the Oct. 7 attack. Israel believes Itay Svirsky was killed by his captors. The families of hostages held in Gaza have grown increasingly concerned that their loved ones are at risk so long as the war continues. Israel’s military released on Wednesday the findings of a probe into the circumstances behind the deaths of six hostages whose bodies were recovered in August, determining they were probably shot by their captors after a nearby Israeli strike in February. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.

A major power plant fails in Cuba, plunging the island into darkness — again	HAVANA (AP) — A new, widespread power outage plunged Cuba into darkness on Wednesday after one of the island’s major power plants failed, leaving millions without electricity and forcing authorities to suspend classes and work activities indefinitely. The Electric Union, the state-run power company, attributed the incident to the shutdown of the Antonio Guiteras Thermoelectric Plant in Matanzas province, east of Havana. The blackout, which occurred shortly after 2 a.m., affected the entire nation, the company said on X. As of Wednesday morning, power began to be restored gradually in some parts of the country, including Havana. Cuba’s Minister of Energy and Mines Vicente de la O said later in a televised address that service would be fully restored by Thursday. On Oct. 18, the island suffered a significant blackout that, added to the passage of Hurricane Oscar two days later, left the island without electricity for several days. Weeks later, Hurricane Rafael’s strong winds triggered another system-wide blackout that left the national energy system disconnected again. Cuba’s power grid has been plagued by frequent outages in recent months, with more than half of the country experiencing power cuts during peak hours. The outages are primarily caused by fuel shortages and aging infrastructure. In many parts of the island, electricity is crucial for cooking and water pumping. The blackouts — caused in part by failures in old thermoelectric plants — are devastating, impacting families, schools and businesses. Cuba gets its power from large thermoelectric plants like Antonio Guiteras and some smaller ones, which run on crude oil. While the island produces about half of its own crude oil, it must import the remainder, which can be difficult — and costly — due to U.S. sanctions. It has historically relied on allies like Venezuela and Russia for cheaper fuel supplies. Cuba has been working on a project to upgrade the island’s electrical grid through the use of alternative power sources. The construction of 31 centers to generate solar energy is under way and expected to be completed next year. Cuba's economic crisis has worsened in recent years, leading to food and fuel shortages, mounting inflation and a loss of purchasing power —and forcing thousands to flee, mainly to the U.S. but also Spain and other Latin American countries. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-blackout-energy-power-outage-3ac7b25f25bc2dfd8cedeac7ba60e877	2024-12-04T08:17:27-08:00	
Austrian court rules that Ukrainian businessman Firtash can't be extradited to the US	VIENNA (AP) — An Austrian court has ruled that Ukrainian businessman Dymitro Firtash can't be extradited to the U.S. in a long-running legal saga that centers on a corruption case related to an alleged plan to pay bribes in India. The Vienna State Court said Tuesday evening it decided on Nov. 7 that extradition isn't permissible, the Austria Press Agency reported. Vienna prosecutors said they would appeal the decision, and have until Dec. 16 to do so. Firtash faces a U.S. indictment accusing him of a conspiracy to pay bribes in India to mine titanium, which is used in jet engines. He denies any wrongdoing. In 2019, a Chicago federal judge rejected a motion to dismiss the indictment against Firtash, who has argued that the U.S. has no jurisdiction over crimes in India. However, the judge ruled that it does, because any scheme would have impacted a Chicago-based company. American aviation company Boeing, based in Chicago, has said it considered business with Firtash but never followed through. It is not accused of any wrongdoing. He was arrested in Austria in 2014 and then freed on 125 million euros ($131 million) bail, kicking off the ongoing legal saga. A Vienna court initially ruled against extradition on the grounds that the indictment was politically motivated. A higher court in February 2017 rejected that reasoning as 'insufficiently substantiated' and ruled that Firtash could be extradited. Austria’s Supreme Court of Justice upheld that ruling in 2019. The country’s justice minister at the time approved the extradition, but a Vienna court judge ruled it could only take place after a decision on a defense call to reopen the case. The Vienna state court ruled against reopening the case in March 2022, but a higher court last year decided to allow the reopening of extradition proceedings, pointing to new evidence.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-dymitro-firtash-court-extradition-chicago-4cd7c4ef23b8ef04a85953ca47b91906	2024-12-04T08:05:01-08:00	
South Korean President Yoon's martial law declaration raises questions over his political future	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — President Yoon Suk Yeol’s stunning martial law declaration lasted just hours, but experts say it raised serious questions about his ability to govern for the remaining 2 1/2 years of his term and whether he will abide by democratic principles. The opposition-controlled parliament overturned the edict, and his rivals on Wednesday took steps to impeach him. One analyst called his action 'political suicide.' Yoon’s political fate may depend on whether a large number of people in coming days take to the streets to push for his ouster. Here's a look at the political firestorm caused by the martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years. Why did Yoon impose martial law? Yoon's declaration of emergency martial law on Tuesday night was accompanied by a pledge to eliminate 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces at a single stroke.' He vowed to protect the country from 'falling into the depths of national ruin.' Yoon, a conservative, cited repeated attempts by his liberal rivals in control of parliament to impeach his top officials and curtail key parts of his budget bill for next year. South Korea’s constitution allows a president to impose military rule during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states.' But a president can't maintain martial law if parliament opposes it with a majority vote. That's what happened Wednesday. And it's why Yoon's move has baffled many experts. Yoon’s political fighting with the main opposition Democratic Party is not seen as an emergency requiring military intervention. Experts question why Yoon pushed ahead with the declaration even though the parliament would certainly vote it down. 'Conservatives and even moderates would agree with Yoon’s criticism and his assessment of progressive lawmakers, but his choice of methods in the 21st century is being seen as the wrong move, miscalculation, and even political suicide,' said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. Yoon’s decree resulted in the military deploying troops with assault rifles and police officers to the National Assembly to block its entrance. Even so, 190 of the parliament’s 300 members managed to enter and later vote down Yoon’s martial law edict early Wednesday. Yoon then lifted martial law without any resistance. The sequence of events suggests that his declaration wasn’t carefully or thoroughly planned. 'His advisers should have tried to dissuade him not to do it, and they likely did so. But I think that didn’t work, and Yoon just pressed ahead with his plan,' said Hong Sung Gul, a public administration professor at Seoul’s Kookmin University. 'That shows he isn't capable of governing this country.' What political fate awaits Yoon? The Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, demanded Wednesday that Yoon resign. Together with small opposition parties, it submitted a joint motion on Yoon's impeachment and said they aim for a floor vote as early as Friday. Yoon didn’t comment on the impeachment bid, but he put off his official schedule Wednesday morning. He hasn’t made public appearances since earlier Wednesday, when he announced he was lifting martial law. The opposition parties together hold 192 seats, eight short of the two-thirds needed to impeach Yoon. But Yoon could face trouble from his own camp as 18 legislators from the ruling People Power Party voted to reject his martial law decree. PPP leader Han Dong-hun called his declaration 'unconstitutional.' 'Both his own ruling party and the opposition party want to hold him accountable. For the first time, in a highly polarized country, both sides of the aisle agree that Yoon’s choice in declaring martial law was the wrong move,' Duyeon Kim, the analyst, said. 'It sounds like his own party is opposed to impeachment but still deliberating whether to ask Yoon to leave the party.' South Korean conservatives harbor traumatic memories of the 2016 impeachment of then-President Park Geun-hye, followed by her ouster and arrest the following year. Yoon’s martial law declaration may have killed his chances of fully completing his term through May 2027, said Park Sung-min, head of Seoul-based MIN Consulting, a political consulting firm. His early exit would brighten the presidential prospects for Democratic Party chief Lee Jae-myung, who faces corruption and other court trials that have threatened to derail his career. Surveys show Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, is the favorite to become the next president. If Yoon is impeached, the Constitutional Court would rule on whether to remove him from office. How does the martial law decree affect foreign policy and the economy? The South Korean developments may be troubling for Washington and Tokyo as they try to expand their three-way security cooperation. 'In these crucial times, especially with Donald Trump returning to office and the variety of difficult geopolitical challenges facing the region at the moment, political instability in South Korea is something that neither the United States nor Japan would want,' said Park Won Gon, a professor at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University in Seoul. The White House said the U.S. was 'seriously concerned' by the events in Seoul. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said President Joe Biden’s administration was not notified in advance of the martial law announcement. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said that Tokyo is watching the development with 'exceptional and serious interest.' North Korea hasn't commented. Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University, said that North Korea will probably take a wait-and-see approach. The political instability unleashed by Yoon could also make it more difficult for his government to nurse a decaying economy. South Korea’s currency, the won, dipped to a two-year low against the U.S. dollar but had recovered by early Wednesday, while the benchmark Kospi stock index was trading 1.8% lower. 'There’s a growing sentiment that the president himself has become the greatest risk to the Republic of Korea and that things cannot continue as they are,' Park said. ___ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-impeachment-f9f865c60ef95e57bdd39f2a384a0dc9	2024-12-04T07:09:05-08:00	
Police in Georgia arrest an opposition leader as mass protests continue	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgian police on Wednesday raided the offices of an opposition party and arrested its leader in an apparent attempt to squelch a wave of mass protests triggered by the governing party’s decision to suspend negotiations on joining the European Union. During the past six nights, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital’s central boulevard. More than 300 protesters have been detained since Thursday and over 100 people have been treated for injuries. On Wednesday, the Coalition for Change opposition party said that police raided its offices and detained its leader, Nika Gvaramia. It shared a video showing several officers dragging Gvaramia into a car. Georgian media reported that police also raided the offices of several other opposition groups and non-government organizations. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of the Georgian Dream party said the raids targeted those who encouraged violence during protests in an attempt to topple his government. 'I wouldn’t call this repression; it is more of a preventive measure than repression,' he said. The ruling Georgian Dream retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia’s help and boycotted parliament sessions. Mass opposition protests sparked by the vote gained new momentum after the governing party’s decision on Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili refused to recognize the official election results and contested them in the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal on Tuesday. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to lead the opposition demand for a new parliamentary election. Zourabichvili urged the country's Western partners to respond to Wednesday's wave of police raids of opposition groups by putting 'strong pressure on a ruling party that is driving the country over the cliff!' 'Do not be late!' she wrote on social platform X. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc’s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. It requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The Georgian government’s announcement of the EU accession talks’ suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October’s election as neither free nor fair. On Monday, the EU reiterated its 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country.' Kobakhidze said Tuesday that his government is willing to open EU accession talks if the bloc ends its 'blackmail.'	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-protest-opposition-election-russia-eu-43081aa9c939805ccb1c346c23535157	2024-12-04T06:20:39-08:00	
Controversial presidential front-runner Calin Georgescu wants Romania to be 'self-sufficient power'	IZVORANI, Romania (AP) — Sitting at his desk in an isolated compound north of Bucharest, presidential front-runner and far-right populist Calin Georgescu says Romania’s Western alliances remain secure providing they 'serve the sovereignty of the country and nothing else.' Georgescu unexpectedly topped the polls in the first round of the Romanian presidential vote on Nov. 24, despite being a huge outsider, plunging the European Union and NATO country into unprecedented turmoil. On Sunday, he will face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a final vote. 'I am interested in us being a sovereign and self-sufficient power,' the 62-year-old independent candidate told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 'Freedom and independence come from the ability to finance yourself, not from being financed by others.' His vision for his country’s future lies in a series of Romania-first policies in a push to become self-reliant in areas such as energy, food, and water. Other key issues he wants to address if he wins the presidency, he said, span tackling high poverty rates, organized crime, and drug use in schools. 'Our children are dying from drug use,' he said. 'It’s unimaginable.' Georgescu is also a self-professed Donald Trump supporter and says the incoming U.S. president 'knows what he wants, he loves his people, he put America first, just like I put Romania first ... we have the same ideology.' His success has left Western allies on edge. In the past, Georgescu — who declared zero campaign spending — praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as 'a man who loves his country' and called Ukraine 'an invented state.' Still, he claims not to be pro-Russian. He has also courted controversy for describing Romanian fascist and nationalist leaders from the 1930s and 1940s as national heroes. He denies having any connection to extremist organizations and says the quotes were miss represented. 'I am only for God and my country,' he said. 'Period.' Once a member of Romania’s far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, Georgescu left the party in 2022 after being accused by colleagues of being Russia-friendly and critical of NATO. Romania has played a key role in the U.S.-led military alliance since Russia fully invaded neighboring Ukraine nearly three years ago. Observers wonder how a Georgescu presidency could affect NATO unity. 'NATO is a defensive organization, but as long as it remains defensive, everything is fine,' the presidential hopeful said. 'We will evaluate and see what is to Romania’s advantage … Everything, no matter what, must benefit the Romanian people,' referring to two NATO bases in Romania. On the war in Ukraine, 'it’s a very difficult and grave situation,' he said. 'And my main position is a strategy of peace. Peace with everyone, regardless of who they are.' But Lasconi, his opponent in Sunday’s runoff, has cast Georgescu as a threat to democracy and national security who is not fit for high office. 'Let us be very clear, Calin Georgescu is an open admirer of Vladimir Putin. He is openly against NATO and the European Union,' she said a day after the first vote. 'He is for Romania’s isolation, which he calls neutrality.' She also added that 'without NATO we are at the mercy of Russia.' His past controversial remarks are wide-ranging and often veer in conspiracy, like his questioning of vaccine safety or calling climate change a 'business scam,' or that 'feminism is an absolute mess.' Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania’s environment ministry in the 1990s. Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the United Nations Environment Program. But he remained a little-known entity until just weeks ago. Many observers attributed his success to his TikTok account, which now has 5.8 million likes and 531,000 followers. But some experts suspect Georgescu’s online following was artificially inflated while Romania’s top security body alleged he was given preferential treatment by TikTok over other candidates. Asked whether he believes the Chinese-owned platform TikTok can pose a threat to democracy, he said: 'The most important existing function for promoting free speech and freedom of expression is social media.' In his downtime, he says he enjoys listening to classical composers, such as 19th-century composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is a big fan of the Irish singer Enya. He holds black belts in judo and karate and said he would make sports investment a top priority 'because otherwise, you can’t have a healthy nation.' Romania’s political class, he said, has 'constantly shown an inferiority complex' toward the West and vowed to change the dynamic. 'Everything I do and will do will be from a negotiation standpoint, in the sense that Romania will stand tall and not on its knees,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/romania-georgescu-interview-presidential-election-5a6bcb9c5eb2f33a831939ab48dcbca9	2024-12-04T06:20:36-08:00	
Pakistani troops kill 5 insurgents in a raid on their hideout in restive northwest	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani security forces acting on intelligence raided a militant hideout in restive northwest Pakistan on Wednesday, resulting in a shootout in which five insurgents were killed and two others were wounded, the military said. It issued a statement stating that the raid occurred in Lakki Marwat, a district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The military gave no further details about the slain or injured insurgents. However, previously most such raids were conducted against the Pakistani Taliban, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, who often target security forces. The TTP is outlawed in Pakistan and is a close ally of the Afghan Taliban who control neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan in recent months has witnessed a surge in militant violence, mostly blamed on TTP and other militant groups.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-security-raid-militants-killed-northwest-3de03a47fb1bcfc29cf67830debd2fa0	2024-12-04T06:15:00-08:00	
The end of an Eras tour approaches, marking a bittersweet moment for Taylor Swift fans	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — After more than 150 shows across five continents over nearly two years, the global phenomenon that is Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour is coming to an end. There is no simple way to encapsulate the effects of Swift’s decision to put on a 3 ½-hour concert, showcasing 44 songs representing 10 different 'eras' of her career — a feat she kicked off in March 2023 and will end Sunday in Vancouver, Canada. The tour shattered sales and attendance records and created such an economic boom that even the Federal Reserve took note. But for many who attended the concerts, and the millions more who eagerly watched fan-broadcasted livestreams on their screens, the tour also became a beacon of joy — a chance not only to appreciate Swift's expansive music career, but also celebrate the yearslong journey fans have taken with her. Savoring the time remaining 'Right now we have this special designated time to be together, talk about the show and hang out,' said Tess Bohne, a stay-at-home mom of three turned content creator dedicated to livestreaming Swift’s concerts — by attending herself or coordinating with others to highlight their streams. 'For some, it’s their therapy.' Bohne, who has earned the title among the Swiftie community as the 'livestream queen,' says she often interacts with fans hosting parties to watch an Eras concert live at home with their closest friends. People have also made lasting friendships as they geek out together watching the show from afar. Swift has long been known for leaving Easter eggs for her fans to pinpoint and decipher, a quirk that quickly took on a life of its own during the tour as eagle-eyed devotees began analyzing the possible meaning of her outfits, surprise songs and subtle lyric swaps. The buzz has been so large that multiple mobile apps were launched so fans could guess and track all the various changes. There’s even a game that gives out prizes for correctly predicting various particulars of a show, including what color guitar Swift uses while playing 'Lover.' 'Imagine your favorite sports team,' Bohne said. 'They’re still a team, but they’re not going to play any games for the foreseeable future. That’s going to leave a hole for some folks.' Swift herself appeared to struggle that the end was near while performing at her 100th Eras show in June at Liverpool. 'This is the very first time I’ve ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is gonna end in December,' she said, stressing that 'this tour has really become my entire life.' Late last month, in Toronto, she briefly broke down at the thought of the tour's impending end. A record-breaking tour in retrospective Swift kicked off the Eras tour in Glendale, Arizona, the first of many sold-out stadiums as the tour progressed first in the U.S. and later into South America, Asia, the United Kingdom and Canada. By the end of 2023, it had become the first tour to ever gross over $1 billion and saw hundreds of millions of dollars spent on merchandise. She is likely to bring in over $2 billion by the time the tour wraps on Dec. 8, according to concert trade publication Pollstar. Throughout the tour, Swift was named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year. Apple Music named her its artist of the year and Spotify revealed she was 2023’s most streamed artist globally. She dropped a box office-topping concert film and helped send NFL viewership skyrocketing when she began dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Toward the end of the tour, she released a coffee table book. And if that wasn’t enough, she released re-recordings of her Nashville-era 2010 record, 'Speak Now ' and 2014's record '1989,' as well as released her 11th studio album, 'The Tortured Poets Department.' 'I think it’s perfect in these times to have somebody like Taylor to kind of give us distraction, give us inspiration, give us hope,' said Ralph Jaccodine, an assistant professor at Berklee College of Music and a former concert promoter who has worked with Bruce Springsteen and others. 'And this is a woman that owning it, she’s come a long way. And now she can talk about artist rights and women’s rights and equality. And really, just her work ethic is relentless.' Even the word 'era' has become ubiquitous, with fans and casual observers using the term to explain both frivolous and transformative phases — are you in your 'villain era' or a 'healing era'? 'I think this tour really solidified her position as a legend,' said Kayla Wong, an influencer who runs the popular Swift-focused Instagram account @headfirstfearless. 'Whether or not you like her music, whether or not you think she’s talented, the numbers really speak for themselves. The tour broke so many records and was such a global phenomenon for so long that I think she’s achieved a level where it’s undeniable as to how everlasting her impact is.' Yet the tour did experience its own dark moments. In Brazil last year, one concertgoer — 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides — passed out and later died of heat exhaustion. In July, British police charged a 17-year-old with murder over a stabbing attack during a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance and yoga class that left three little girls dead. News outlets reported that Swift met with some of the survivors backstage in London. And in August, all three of Swift's concerts in Vienna were called off after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the city. Tens of thousands of Swifties from around the world had traveled to Vienna for the shows. 'Having our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,' Swift later wrote in a statement. 'The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.' Swifties stronger than ever Through the hardships and celebrations, Swift's connections to her fans has only ballooned and deepened throughout the tour. After the Vienna cancellations, many fans flocked to the streets to sing Swift's songs and placed friendship bracelets — which also became an iconic feature of the shows — on a nearby tree. Over the past two years, the fandom has welcomed new audiences — both old and new. 'I feel like years ago, we were kind of all the same age and fans for the same reason,' Wong said of Swifties. 'Now the fandom has people from all kinds of backgrounds, all ages, all different reasons for following her in the first place.'	https://apnews.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-end-06a41d7c717486f2c0e99a7304789912	2024-12-04T06:01:15-08:00	
Mexico raises its still-low minimum wage by 12%, but it marks no increase in dollar terms	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico announced Wednesday that it will increase its still strikingly low daily minimum wage by 12% next year. But because the Mexican peso has dropped by 18% in value over the last year, the increase actually marks a slight drop in constant dollar terms. The three-party minimum wage commission, made up of government, labor and business representatives, announced the increase Wednesday. It will take effect starting Jan. 1 2025. The new daily minimum wage will be about 279 pesos, or about $13.75. The 2024 wage of 249 pesos per day was worth $14.25 when it was announced in December 2023, but in that time the peso has dropped in value against the U.S. dollar, from 17.20 then to around 20.30 now. Domestic inflation in Mexico is currently running around 4.75%, so Wednesday's announcement could work out to a real-term increase of about 7%, unless inflation heats up. That is still only about $1.71 per hour, compared to a U.S. federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. However, many U.S. states have minimum wage rates that range from $10 to $16 per hour. Because living costs are higher along Mexico's northern border with the United States, the official minimum wage is higher there. For 2025, it will be set at around 420 pesos, or $20.70 per day.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-minimum-wage-increase-economy-devaluation-56ec73f2f9e20005e27f584d14fc9e37	2024-12-04T05:34:39-08:00	
NATO chief urges European allies to ramp up defense spending as Trump returns to White House	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte led a fresh push Wednesday for European countries to ramp up defense spending, a budget shortfall that President-elect Donald Trump used to berate U.S. allies during his first term in office, severely damaging trust. After Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula a decade ago, NATO leaders agreed to halt the defense cuts that began when the Cold War ended and move toward spending 2% of GDP on their military budgets. Since Russia launched its full-fledged invasion almost three years ago, the leaders have agreed that the 2% target should be the floor rather than the ceiling for defense spending. On average, U.S. allies combined meet that figure, but around a third of the members still do not individually. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, threatened not to defend 'delinquent' countries. NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any member must be considered an attack on them all. Trump’s remarks undermined confidence that the U.S. could be counted on in a crisis. 'If you want to keep the deterrence at the present level, 2% is not enough,' Rutte told reporters after chairing a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. 'We can now defend ourselves and nobody should try to attack us. But I want that to stay the same in 4 or 5 years.' In July, U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts endorsed the biggest shakeup of the way the military alliance would respond to any attack on its territory by Russia since the Cold War. It was meant to deter Moscow from targeting any of the 32 allies. Under highly secret new plans, NATO intends to have up to 300,000 troops ready to move to its eastern flank within 30 days. The plans lay out which allies would respond to an attack anywhere from the Arctic and Baltic Sea region through the Atlantic and east to the Black Sea. But senior NATO officials concede that countries might have to spend up to 3% of GDP to execute the security blueprint successfully. A new spending target is likely to be announced next year. Rutte also said NATO might set specific targets for member countries to fill military equipment gaps. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy insisted that 'the time to act is now.' 'We’re living in very dangerous times,' he said, singling out Russia and its role in conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, on top of its war on Ukraine. 'We urge all allies across the NATO family to get serious about defense spending.' On his last visit to Brussels for a NATO meeting, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that 'this is a time for every ally to lean in, not lean back.' The United States is by far the organization's most powerful member country. 'A stronger NATO means more capabilities to deter aggression, more effective allies to meet more complex challenges, and the peace and stability that allows our people to pursue fuller lives,' Blinken said. Rutte also underlined the importance of expanding Europe’s defense industry, with incentives to drive companies to set up more production lines and hire more workers to staff them, as Western support for Ukraine drains armament stocks. 'We are producing not enough at too high prices, and the delivery is too slow,' he said. 'We cannot have a situation where we just pay more for the same, and we see large kickbacks to the shareholders.' Rutte urged the allies 'to work closely together to make sure that we produce at a much higher rate and acceptable prices.' He noted 'a number of countries who are now buying South Korean (equipment) because our own defense companies are not producing at a rate we need.'	https://apnews.com/article/nato-defense-spending-trump-military-budgets-3cf6e8da6da08cbf84686d0b5f518f5a	2024-12-04T05:05:50-08:00	
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi gets 3-week reprieve from prison in Iran after surgery	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi was released temporarily from prison Wednesday after undergoing a complex surgery in Iran that saw part of a bone in her right leg removed over cancer fears, her supporters said. Video footage from Iran's capital, Tehran, showed Mohammadi taken out of the back of an ambulance, her black hair fanned out without the required hijab, or headscarf, covering it as she called out into the street. Her right leg was covered in a fabric cast. 'Hello freedom!' she shouted. 'Women, life, freedom! Freedom is our right! Long live freedom!' A campaign on Mohammadi's behalf said she would be free for 21 days, but would have to serve the remaining prison time later. The Iranian government did not acknowledge the medical furlough for Mohammadi, 52, which her supporters demanded should involve her being permanently freed. 'A 21-day suspension of Narges Mohammadi’s sentence is inadequate,' the campaign said. 'After over a decade of imprisonment, Narges requires specialized medical care in a safe, sanitary environment — a basic human right. As doctors have emphasized, a minimum of three months’ recovery is crucial for her healing.' It added: 'Narges should never have been imprisoned in the first place for her peaceful advocacy for human and women’s rights — the very work that earned her the Nobel Peace Prize.' Mohammadi is serving prison sentences totaling 13 years and nine months on charges of collusion against state security and propaganda against Iran’s government. She has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and spending years behind bars. That includes backing the nationwide, women-led protests sparked by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, which have seen women openly defy the government by not wearing the hijab. Mohammadi suffered multiple heart attacks while imprisoned before undergoing emergency surgery in 2022, her supporters say. In November of this year, her lawyer announced that doctors found a bone lesion that they feared could be cancerous, leading to her surgery. 'We are hugely relieved by Narges Mohammadi’s temporary release today from Evin prison, which is an important step in the right direction,' said Rebecca Vincent of Reporters Sans Frontières. 'We remain deeply concerned by her worrying health situation and urge the Iranian authorities to grant her sufficient time at home to allow for her full recovery.' Her release comes as Iran’s economy has been in tatters for years because of sanctions imposed by the West, in part over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. Its people are angry over the devaluation of their currency and government corruption. That’s fueled protests, as well as a government crackdown on dissent. The return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House in January has stoked concerns for some that he may resume his 'maximum pressure' campaign on the Islamic Republic.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-nobel-prize-narges-mohammadi-57297ee4f015ee0a25e064641246afd2	2024-12-04T05:00:48-08:00	
Relic of the Buddha loaned by China gets a warm welcome in Thailand	BANGKOK (AP) — More than 2,000 people took part Wednesday in a procession to escort a relic of the Buddha lent by China to a shrine in the Thai capital Bangkok to honor the birthday of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and to celebrate half a century of diplomatic relations between Thailand and China. The tooth relic, considered sacred by Buddhists, was flown in earlier in the day from the Lingguang Temple in Beijing, which normally houses it. Loans of the tooth as a show of friendship have been an effective form of soft diplomacy by China, even though competing claims from various countries on possessing the Buddha’s tooth raise questions about its provenance. The tooth was put in an ornate, golden container and placed on a flower-bedecked float as it was paraded through one of the oldest neighborhoods of the city. Attendants flanked the vehicle as it travelled about 2 1/2 kilometers (1 1/2 miles) to the relic’s temporary home, a soaring pavilion on Sanam Luang, a large field outside Bangkok’s famous Grand Palace. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and members of her cabinet received the relic amid the sounds of chanting monks. Representatives of China, including Beijing’s ambassador to Thailand, were also present, according to local media. The loan is the latest in a series of events to mark the 72nd birthday of the Thai king. It also commemorates the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Thailand and China, which occurs next year. It was previously displayed in Thailand in 2002 to mark the 75th birthday of Vajiralongkorn's father, King Bhumibol, who died in 2016. The relic will be on public display at the pavilion until mid-February.	https://apnews.com/article/buddha-relic-soft-diplomacy-religion-fbacb6fed0141e0560c02b2cc110dd5e	2024-12-04T04:13:44-08:00	
Spotify Wrapped 2024 is here, and Taylor Swift is once again the platform's most-streamed artist	NEW YORK (AP) — 'Tis the season to unpack Spotify Wrapped. And it should come as no surprise that for a second year in a row, Taylor Swift has been named its most-played artist. On Wednesday, the streaming giant unveiled its annual overview of individual listening trends as well as trends from around the world. Users can now access their top artists, songs, genres, albums and podcasts, as well as uncover which artists had the biggest year on the platform. Swift was 2024’s most-streamed artist globally, ranking in more than 26.6 billion streams. She's followed by The Weekend, Bad Bunny, Drake and Billie Eilish, in that order. In the U.S., the list looks similar: It's Swift in the top spot, followed by Drake, Zach Bryan, Morgan Wallen and Kanye West. Last year, Swift dethroned Puerto Rican reggaetón star Bad Bunny for the top spot, globally. He held the coveted title for three years in a row beginning in 2020. Swift also earned the title of most-streamed album in 2024, with 'The Tortured Poets Department.' She's followed by Eilish's 'Hit Me Hard and Soft,' Sabrina Carpenter's 'Short n' Sweet,' Karol G's 'Mañana Será Bonito' and Ariana Grande's 'eternal sunshine.' All of those titles are new to 2024 with the exception of Karol G's album, which released early last year. In the U.S., there are only slight differences: Swift's album still leads, followed by Wallen's 'One Thing At A Time' — released last year. Then it's Carpenter, Noah Kahan's 'Stick Season,' and Chappell Roan's 'The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,' also released in 2023. Carpenter leads the most-streamed songs both in the U.S. and globally this year, with her summertime smash 'Espresso.' It earned over 1.6 billion streams. Globally, she's followed by Benson Boone's 'Beautiful Things,' Eilish's 'Birds of a Feather,' FloyyMenor and Cris MJ's 'Gata Only' and Teddy Swims' 'Lose Control.' And in the U.S., she's trailed by Kendrick Lamar's 'Not Like Us,' Shaboozey's 'A Bar Song (Tipsy)', Post Malone and Morgan Wallen's 'I Had Some Help' and Tommy Richman's 'Million Dollar Baby.' This year, there are a few new features on Spotify Wrapped. Those include a new data story called 'Your Music Evolution,' documenting three distinct musical phases for each user, and a personalized playlist. The individualized 'Your Top Artist' feature has changed slightly, too, and now includes 'Longest Listening Streak' as well as the familiar 'Top Listeners.' That the biggest artists, globally, earned top spots on Spotify Wrapped should come as no surprise — they’re featured prominently across the streaming service, including on its highly influential playlists, in addition to boasting loyal, dedicated fanbases. For independent artists who may appear on an individual listener’s Wrapped, accessing a top spot on the global list would require billions of streams. Streaming now accounts for most of the money generated by the music industry — a whopping 84% in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, and 67.3% worldwide, according to a 2024 report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which tracks global sales. Spotify is the largest platform of all — making up roughly 31% of the total market share — with a reported 626 million users and 246 million subscribers in over 180 markets.	https://apnews.com/article/spotify-wrapped-2024-taylor-swift-306707264ea42c6e65ee82d79b4f833e	2024-12-04T04:01:16-08:00	
EU condemns reported Taliban move to suspend medical education for women and girls	The European Union on Wednesday condemned the Taliban for violating human rights and women's access to education after media reports that the Taliban's leader has ordered private and public institutions to stop providing medical courses for women and girls in Afghanistan. The Taliban have neither confirmed the order nor responded to the reports. The Public Health Ministry spokesman was unavailable for comment. In September 2021, a month after they returned to power, the Taliban stopped schooling for girls after grade six. They banned women from university in December 2022. Medical education, like nursing and midwifery, was one of the few ways they could continue their learning in classrooms. The BBC and others reported that five institutions across Afghanistan said the Taliban had instructed them to close until further notice, and women training as midwives and nurses were ordered not to return to classes Wednesday. The EU said the Taliban’s latest reported decision represented another appalling violation of fundamental human rights and an unjustifiable attack on women’s access to education in Afghanistan. 'The European Union expresses its strong concerns over this decision and its far-reaching implication, including the deepening of the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the exacerbation of the suffering of its people,' the statement said. It urged the Taliban to reverse the policy. A spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the U.N. in Afghanistan was working to verify the claims with relevant officials. 'This development raises serious concerns about the sustainability and appeal of formal education for female health workers,' said WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris. 'Such measures could have far-reaching implications for the future availability of qualified female health professionals and the continuity of health service delivery in the country.' A starker warning came from a senior health official in Afghanistan. He did not give his name for fear of reprisals from the Taliban. He said that Afghanistan would face major challenges beyond the control of the government if the suspension became permanent. 'If women are not trained as staff, the mortality rate of mothers and children will increase in remote areas,' he said. 'There will not be enough staff to provide services to female patients. Those NGOs that provide services in distant provinces and districts are still facing a shortage of doctors, midwives, nurses and other female staff.' A 22-year-old midwifery student learned Wednesday that the institute was stopping classes for her and her friends. She had already switched from a law degree after the Taliban stopped university for women and expressed her shock and disbelief at the latest decision. 'After an hour, when I calmed down a little, I cried a lot because we had this one way (to study) and it is also closed,' she said. 'It’s a difficult situation to have so many dreams in the field of education. But, in a second, all the dreams are crushed. This is the second time I have faced such a situation.' Another young woman said she had set out to be a pilot in the armed forces, an ambition that ended after the Taliban's return to power. So she started studying midwifery because of women's health issues, especially Afghanistan's high maternal mortality rates. She wanted to work in a hospital. On Wednesday, before the first exam of the semester, the institute told female students they could not return. 'It was the most difficult moment of my life when I heard this. It still is. They killed my hopes.' Both women spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal. Public dissent against Taliban rule is rare.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-medical-education-women-girls-c55047b95870386c86811bcedf7191ea	2024-12-04T02:32:26-08:00	
Syrian forces battling insurgents north of strategic city of Hama	BEIRUT (AP) — Syria said Wednesday its counteroffensive has pushed back insurgents attempting to advance to the strategic central city of Hama, while the insurgency says it captured more Syrian troops and Iran-backed militants in fierce battles. The latest flareup in Syria's long civil war comes after forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad over the past days captured large parts of the northern city of Aleppo, the country's largest, as well as towns and villages in southern parts of the northwestern Idlib province. The offensive is being led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadi group, as well as an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. For years, both have entrenched themselves in northwest Idlib province and parts of northern Aleppo, as the battered country reeled from years of political and military stalemates. The war between Assad and his foreign backers and the array of armed opposition forces seeking his overthrow has killed an estimated half-million people over the past 13 years. Syrian state media SANA on Wednesday said insurgents retreated some 20 kilometers (12 miles) from government-held Hama, Syria's fourth largest city, as government troops backed by Russian airpower entrenched themselves in the outskirts. Fierce fighting has raged for days as Damascus fears that the insurgents will make their way into the city like they did over the weekend into Aleppo. A Syrian photographer working for the German news agency dpa was killed in an airstrike near the city of Hama, the agency said Wednesday. Anas Alkharboutli, 32, has long documented Syria’s civil war, which started after a brutal crackdown on a popular uprising against Assad in 2011. He has worked for dpa since 2017. The insurgency through its Military Operations Department channel on the Telegram app said they captured five Iran-backed militants, of whom two were from Afghanistan, as well as three Syrian troops from its 25th Special Mission Forces Division in eastern Hama. The claims could not be independently confirmed. If the insurgents seize Hama city and control the province, it could leave the coastal cities of Tartous and Lattakia isolated from the rest of the country. Lattakia is a key political stronghold for Assad and Syria's Alawite community and a strategic Russian naval base. Tens of thousands have been displaced by the fighting, which started last week, Geir Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said Tuesday. 'If we do not see deescalation and a rapid move to a serious political process, involving the Syrian parties and the key international players, then I fear we will see a deepening of the crisis,' Pedersen said in an address the U.N. Security Council. 'Syria will be in grave danger of further division, deterioration, and destruction.' Turkey, which backs Syria's opposition, has called on Assad to reconcile with opposition forces and include them in any political solution to end the conflict. Ankara has been seeking to normalize ties with Syria to address security threats from groups affiliated with Kurdish militants along its southern border and to help ensure the safe return of more than 3 million Syrian refugees. Assad has insisted that Turkey’s withdrawal of its military forces from northern Syria be a condition for any normalization between the two countries. Damascus views the insurgents as terrorists, and Assad has vowed to respond to the insurgency with an iron fist. Turkish and Iranian officials have met earlier this week, in a bid to reach a solution to deescalate the flareup. Arab countries bordering Syria and once backed groups that tried to overthrow Assad, have expressed their concern of the conflict's regional impacts, and have backed the president.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-insurgency-aleppo-hama-turkey-assad-956c940cf0abe9159187d9e0498fdbee	2024-12-04T01:48:36-08:00	
French lawmakers vote to oust prime minister in the first successful no-confidence vote since 1962	PARIS (AP) — France’s far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined together Wednesday in a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes that forces Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet members to resign, a first since 1962. The National Assembly approved the motion by 331 votes. A minimum of 288 were needed. President Emmanuel Macron insisted he will serve the rest of his term until 2027. However, he will need to appoint a new prime minister for the second time after July’s legislative elections led to a deeply divided parliament. Macron will address the French on Thursday evening, his office said, without providing details. Barnier is expected to formally resign by then. A conservative appointed in September, Barnier becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in France’s modern Republic. 'I can tell you that it will remain an honor for me to have served France and the French with dignity,' Barnier said in his final speech before the vote. 'This no-confidence motion… will make everything more serious and more difficult. That’s what I’m sure of,' he said. Opposition to Barnier's proposed budget Wednesday's crucial vote rose from fierce opposition to Barnier's proposed budget. The National Assembly, France’s lower house of parliament, is deeply fractured, with no single party holding a majority. It comprises three major blocs: Macron’s centrist allies, the left-wing coalition New Popular Front, and the far-right National Rally. Both opposition blocs, typically at odds, are uniting against Barnier, accusing him of imposing austerity measures and failing to address citizens’ needs. Speaking on TF1 television after the vote, National Rally leader Marine Le Pen said 'we had a choice to make, and our choice is to protect the French' from a 'toxic' budget. Le Pen also accused Macron of being 'largely responsible for the current situation,' adding that 'the pressure on the President of the Republic will get stronger and stronger.' Speaking at the National Assembly ahead of the vote, hard-left lawmaker Eric Coquerel had called on the government to 'stop pretending the lights will go out,' noting the possibility of an emergency law to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year’s rules. 'The special law will prevent a shutdown. It will allow us to get through the end of the year by delaying the budget by a few weeks,' Coquerel said. Macron to pick a new prime minister Macron must appoint a new prime minister, but the fragmented parliament remains unchanged. No new legislative elections can be held until at least July, creating a potential stalemate for policymakers. Macron said discussions about him potentially resigning were 'make-believe politics' during a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this week, according to French media reports. 'I’m here because I’ve been elected twice by the French people,' Macron said. He was also reported as saying: 'We must not scare people with such things. We have a strong economy.' Impact on financial markets While France is not at risk of a U.S.-style government shutdown, political instability could spook financial markets. France is under pressure from the European Union to reduce its colossal debt. The country’s deficit is estimated to reach 6% of gross domestic product this year and analysts say it could rise to 7% next year without drastic adjustments. The political instability could push up French interest rates, digging the debt even further. Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING Bank, said uncertainty over France’s future government and finances is deterring investment and growth. 'The impact of France not having a government would clearly be negative for the growth of France and hence the Eurozone,' Brzeski said. France has seen bond market borrowing costs rise, bringing back ugly memories of the Greek debt crisis and default in 2010-2012. Analysts say France is far from a similar crisis because much of its outstanding debt does not come due for years, and because its bonds remain in demand due to a shortage of German government bonds. Additionally, the European Central Bank could intervene to lower French borrowing costs in case of extreme market turmoil, though the bar for that remains high. —- AP Journalist David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, contributed to the story.	https://apnews.com/article/france-government-collapse-no-confidence-barnier-3b408ee1ac4c502541a56fbe3a230479	2024-12-04T01:47:52-08:00	
Pope Francis discusses Ukraine with Hungary's nationalist leader Viktor Orban	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis met Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the Vatican on Wednesday and discussed with him the war in Ukraine, focusing on the humanitarian situation and efforts to promote peace in the region. Francis also discussed other themes with Orban, including the Hungarian presidency of the Council of the European Union as well as the 'central role of the family and the protection of the young generations,' the Vatican said in a statement. During his visit in Hungary last year, Francis met with some 35,000 Ukrainian refugees who remained in Hungary. Nearly 2.5 million refugees entered the eastern European country early on in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Orban has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in the war. But he has refused to supply Kyiv with weapons, and he has threatened to veto EU sanctions against Moscow while maintaining Hungary’s strong dependence on Russian energy. The Hungarian leader also met with Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin and Miroslaw Wachowski, the Vatican undersecretary for relations with states.	https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-viktor-orban-vatican-ukraine-war-refugees-4009d2bdd22312432487c071c018bc2a	2024-12-04T01:44:47-08:00	
Middle East latest: An Israeli strike on a Gaza tent camp kills at least 21 people	An Israeli strike on a tent camp housing displaced people in southern Gaza killed at least 21 people and wounded 28 on Wednesday, said the director of Nasser Hospital, Atif al-Hout, in the nearby city of Khan Younis. The Israeli military said its aircraft struck senior Hamas militants 'involved in terrorist activities' in the area. At least 15 bodies arrived at the hospital, but reaching a precise number of dead was difficult because many were dismembered, some without heads or badly burned. The strike hit in the Muwasi area, a sprawling coastal camp housing hundreds of thousands of displaced people. Earlier strikes elsewhere in Gaza killed eight people, including four children, health officials said. Israel's war against Hamas has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Israel’s blistering retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the Latest: Amnesty International accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip CAIRO - Amnesty International accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip during its war with Hamas, saying it has sought to deliberately destroy Palestinians by mounting deadly attacks, demolishing vital infrastructure and preventing the delivery of food, medicine and other aid. The human rights group released a report Thursday in the Middle East that said such actions could not be justified by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, which ignited the war, or the presence of militants in civilian areas. Amnesty said the United States and other allies of Israel could be complicit in genocide, and called on them to halt arms shipments. 'Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now,' Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said in the report. Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has adamantly rejected genocide allegations against it as an antisemitic 'blood libel.' It is challenging such allegations at the International Court of Justice, and it has rejected the International Criminal Court’s accusations that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister committed war crimes in Gaza. 'The deplorable and fanatical organization Amnesty International has once again produced a fabricated report that is entirely false and based on lies,' Israel’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Israel accused Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate Israel, of carrying out a genocidal massacre in the attack that triggered the war, and said it is defending itself in accordance with international law. Israeli military bombs southern Lebanon as ceasefire with Hezbollah holds JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Wednesday it struck a launcher in southern Lebanon, which it said was in violation of the ceasefire it agreed to with the militant group Hezbollah. Israel has struck Lebanon repeatedly in the week since the ceasefire began, saying it reserves the right under the U.S.- and France-brokered deal to strike what it views as violations by Hezbollah. Hezbollah struck a disputed border territory held by Israel earlier this week, in what it said was a warning over the Israeli strikes. U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel, speaking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday about the Lebanon ceasefire, said it was 'largely holding in place.' He would not speak to individual allegations of violations. The ceasefire is meant to end nearly 14 months of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that began when the militant group began firing at Israel in solidarity with Hamas and the war in Gaza. Israeli strike on a Gaza tent camp kills at least 21 people, hospital says DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — A Palestinian health official said Wednesday that at least 21 people were killed by an Israeli strike on a camp housing displaced people in Gaza. Atif Al-Hout, the director of Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, said at least 28 people were wounded in the strike. The Israeli military said its aircraft struck senior Hamas militants 'involved in terrorist activities' in the area. The military said that the strike had set off secondary explosions, indicating explosives present in the area were set off. It was not possible to independently confirm the Israeli claims, and the strike could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp. At least 15 bodies arrived at the hospital, but reaching a precise number was difficult because many of the dead were dismembered, some without heads or badly burned. The strike hit in the Muwasi area, a sprawling coastal camp housing hundreds of thousands of displaced people near the southern city of Khan Younis. It came after Israeli forces struck targets in other areas of the Palestinian enclave. Earlier strikes on central Gaza killed eight people, including four children. Israel’s war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths because the militants often operate in residential areas and are known to position tunnels, rocket launchers and other infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques. Body of an Israeli hostage is recovered from Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel’s Shin Bet domestic security agency said Wednesday that Israeli forces recovered the body of a hostage held in Gaza. Itay Svirsky was captured alive from southern Israel during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack. Israel believes that he was killed while in captivity by his captors who held on to his body. The Shin Bet did not disclose details of the mission to recover Svirsky’s body. During its attack, Hamas killed 1,200 people and kidnapped 250. Israel believes roughly 100 remain in Gaza, about a third of whom are dead. Israeli military admits soldiers entered a West Bank hospital during a raid, after initially denying the claim JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Wednesday that soldiers had entered a West Bank hospital the previous day during a raid in search of militants, after initially denying the claim. The military said several soldiers entered the hospital’s entrance hall, suspecting that an armed militant was inside. On Tuesday, a Palestinian doctor working at the hospital in the town of Tubas said Israeli soldiers opened fire inside, a claim the military did not address in its statement Wednesday. The military had said its troops were operating around the hospital searching for alleged militants struck in an earlier airstrike but had denied the troops had entered. The doctor, Mahmoud Ghanam, said the troops had left after learning that a wounded man had been transferred to another hospital. Israeli raids on hospitals in the occupied West Bank are rare but have grown more common since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Violence in the occupied West Bank has surged since the war in Gaza began. The Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed about 800 people in the West Bank during that time. Israel says many of the Palestinians killed have been militants. But stone-throwing youths protesting Israeli raids and others not involved in confrontations have also been killed. Palestinian families describe being forcibly displaced from northern Gaza by Israeli military offensive BEIR LAHIYA, Gaza Strip — Dozens of Palestinian families in northern Gaza said Wednesday they were forcibly displaced when Israel's military expelled them from schools they were using as makeshift shelters. The fleeing civilians said Israel was expanding its major offensive in the north, the most heavily destroyed and isolated part of the Gaza Strip, which Israeli forces have almost completely besieged since early October. Experts say famine may be underway there. Associated Press footage showed dozens of displaced families on the road leaving Beit Lahia — some on foot while others used motorized rickshaws, bicycles or donkey carts to carry kids, older adults and their remaining belongings. Sadeia al-Rahel said Wednesday she was staying in a school in the town of Beit Lahiya when Israel's military dropped leaflets ordering everyone to evacuate. 'This morning a quadcopter (drone) detonated four bombs at the school. There were people injured, human remains, we left with nothing,' she said. 'They forcibly displaced us.' The 57-year-old said her family has been eating grass, leaves, and animal feed for two months due to the lack of food aid in the north. 'But no one cares' she added. Al-Rahel said her family didn’t even take blankets with them as they left. Meanwhile, 20-year-old Hafez Warshal stayed in Beit Lahia with his family for 13 months before evacuating the school where he was sheltering. He said he had no idea where he would go next. 'We’ll stay wherever we find a place,' he said. Israel’s war against Hamas has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The International Criminal Court is seeking to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister over accusations of using 'starvation as a method of warfare' by restricting humanitarian aid into Gaza. Israel rejects the allegations and says it has been working hard to improve the entry of aid. Israel says six hostages in Gaza were likely shot by captors after an airstrike nearby JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Wednesday that an investigation into the deaths of six hostages whose bodies were recovered from Gaza earlier this year determined that they were likely shot and killed by their captors in an underground tunnel after an Israeli strike hit nearby. The military recovered the bodies of the six hostages – all men, including three in their 70s and one in his 80s — from the southern city of Khan Younis in August. The investigation said the strike in question was one targeting Hamas commanders in February. 'Due to the extended time that had passed, it was not possible to determine with complete certainty the precise cause of death of the hostages or the exact timing of the gunfire,' the military statement said. An Israeli military official said the results were based on a 'forensic examination' carried out after the bodies were recovered. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the findings with the media, and did not not provide details on the examination. The military said it had no intelligence indicating that hostages were held in the area and would not have struck had it known. The military said that while troops followed all the necessary approvals for conducting the strike, it has added additional approvals to its protocols for certain strikes in response to the hostages’ deaths. The war in Gaza was sparked when Hamas launched its Oct. 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel, where militants killed 1,200 people and kidnapped 250. About 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with roughly a third said to be dead, according to Israeli authorities. Israel has made destroying Hamas’ military and governing capabilities, as well as freeing the hostages, the goals for its war in Gaza. But critics say those goals are in conflict, with the lives of hostages in danger the longer Israeli fights in Gaza. — By Tia Goldenberg Photographer for German news agency killed in an attack in Syria BERLIN — A Syrian photographer working for the German news agency dpa was killed by a fighter jet attack near the Syrian city of Hama, dpa reported on Wednesday. The news agency couldn’t immediately give more details about when 32-year-old Anas Alkharboutli was killed. But the agency’s editor-in-chief, Sven Gösmann, said 'all of us at dpa are in shock and infinitely saddened by the death of Anas Alkharboutli.' 'With his pictures he not only documented the horrors of war, he always worked for the truth,' Gösmann said. 'In recent days in particular, his photos were seen around the world as he reported on the civil war that flared up again.' Alkharboutli joined dpa as a photographer in the Middle East in 2017. He mainly reported from the Syrian civil war zone. Alkharboutli’s photography was recognized internationally. In 2020, he received the Young Reporter Trophy of the French Prix Bayeux for war reporting. At the 2021 Sony World Photography Awards, he won the Sports category with a series of images of children training in karate, the news agency said. Settlers attack Palestinian towns, burning homes and clashing with Israeli troops BEIT FURIK, West Bank — Jewish settlers mounted a string of attacks on Palestinian towns in the occupied West Bank overnight, burning homes and clashing with Israeli troops. There were no immediate reports of any Palestinian casualties. The Israeli military said Jewish settlers attacked the village of Beit Furik after troops arrived in the area to dismantle an unauthorized farming outpost they had built nearby on land privately owned by Palestinians. It said the settlers hurled stones, wounding two members of the paramilitary Border Police. Adel Hanni, a resident of the village, told the AP that a group of roughly 70 settlers gathered on the village lands early morning as the troops took down the outpost. The settlers burned Hanni’s son’s home, a car, a village shop and smashed the windows of several more homes. An Associated Press reporter saw a blackened home and a destroyed car on Wednesday morning. 'Some settlers started to break into the house, while others carried incendiary materials,' said Hanni, 57. Settlers also attacked the village of Huwara, which has been the target of several previous attacks — even before the outbreak of the war in Gaza — and clashed with troops near Rujeib, another Palestinian village, the military said. Israeli police and the Shin Bet security agency said in a statement that they were investigating the settler attacks. They said they arrested eight Israelis for suspected property damage and assaulting security forces. The West Bank has seen a surge in settler violence since the start of the war, which was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. Settlers have also raced to establish new farming outposts that rights groups say are among the biggest drivers of the violence. The U.N.’s humanitarian office said settler attacks on Palestinian farmers during the recent olive harvest season 'at least tripled' in 2024 compared to the last three years. Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for an independent state. The West Bank is home to some 3 million Palestinians who live under Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy in cities and towns. Some 500,000 Jewish settlers with Israeli citizenship live in more than 100 settlements across the West Bank, many of which resemble suburbs or small towns. Most of the international community considers the settlements to be illegal and an obstacle to peace. 4 children killed in Gaza strike DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medics said Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Wednesday killed eight people, including four children. The Awda Hospital, which received the bodies from one strike, said five were killed as they gathered outside of shelters in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The hospital said another 15 people, mostly children, were wounded in the strike. Also in central Gaza, the Al-Aqsa Hospital in the city of Deir al-Balah said it received the bodies of three people who were killed in what it says were two separate Israeli strikes early Wednesday. The three dead include a man and a woman who were killed in a strike in Deir al-Balah, and another man killed in the urban refugee camp of Bureij, the hospital said. The Israeli military said it struck a 'terrorist target' in Nuseirat, without elaborating. It had no immediate comment on the other strikes. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israel returns bodies of militants who crossed border from Jordan JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said Wednesday it had returned the bodies of two militants who crossed into Israel from Jordan in October and shot two soldiers. The militants entered Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea on Oct. 18, shooting and wounding two soldiers before being shot dead by Israeli troops. Hamas praised the incursion but not claim responsibility for it. The Israeli military did not release the names of the militants who carried out the attack.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-latest-4-december-2024-1369e179a32e5272ac99f6818f69cb8e	2024-12-04T00:26:43-08:00	
Japanese court convicts Australian who says she was tricked into smuggling drugs	CHIBA, Japan (AP) — A Japanese court on Wednesday sentenced an Australian woman to six years in prison for smuggling amphetamines into the country, despite accepting her testimony that she was tricked as part of an online romance scam. The Chiba District Court said it found Donna Nelson, 58, from Perth, Australia, guilty of violating the stimulants control and customs laws. It ordered her to pay a fine of 1 million yen ($6,671) in addition to serving a prison term. Nelson was arrested at Japan’s Narita International Airport, near Tokyo, on Jan. 3, 2023, after customs officials found about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of phenylaminopropane, a stimulant, hidden under a false bottom in a suitcase she was carrying as checked luggage. Nelson told the court that she did not know that drugs were hidden in the suitcase and that she was carrying them for a man she hoped to marry. The man, whom she met online in 2020, told her he was the Nigerian owner of a fashion business. In 2023, he paid to travel to Japan via Laos, and asked her to collect dress samples from an acquaintance in Laos, the court said in the ruling. She was supposed to meet him in Japan but he never showed up, according to prosecutors. Nelson has already been in custody for nearly two years. The court said 430 days of that will be counted toward her sentence. Presiding Judge Masakazu Kamakura said that although Nelson was deceived, she had a sense that something was wrong with the arrangement and that something illegal could be hidden in the suitcase, and she could have stopped. Kamakura said Nelson was taken advantage of her desire to marry the man and that there is room for 'sympathy' for what she did. He imposed a shorter sentence than would be typical for the amount of drugs she was carrying, after prosecutors had demanded 10 years in prison and a fine of 3 million yen (about $20,000). Nelson’s lawyer Rie Nishida said the ruling was unjust and that she planned to appeal. 'We will fight until the end,' she said. On Wednesday, Nelson sobbed as the verdict was read out. One of her daughters, Kristal Hilaire, wiped away tears as she looked on from her seat in the audience. 'We are disappointed and devastated by the court’s verdict in our mum’s case,' Hilaire told reporters outside the court. 'We maintain that our mum was the victim of a romance scam. She is the victim of a crime and not a criminal. She has always been against drugs.' Hilaire said the past few weeks had been a difficult time for the family but that they have come together to support each other and Nelson during the trial, and that they will keep fighting 'until we can bring her home.' But Hillaire said she is worried about her mother, devastated and much thinner. 'I worry about how she would handle another six years.' Several other family members who attended earlier sessions, seeing Nelson for the first time since her arrest nearly two years ago, returned home ahead of the verdict. ___ Associated Press video journalists Mayuko Ono in Chiba and Ayaka McGill in Tokyo contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-australia-drug-smuggling-verdict-nelson-a9f2f9a01f2f11dc9fad100dd6137e40	2024-12-04T00:02:15-08:00	
Relatives hunt for the missing after Guinea stadium crush amid fears official death toll is too low	CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) — A distraught Kambaly Kouroumah is searching for his teenage brother, Adama, at a local morgue in southern Guinea’s Nzerekore city, where dozens of people died at a crowded stadium after chaos erupted during a soccer game. Kouroumah is one of many bereaved people searching hospitals and mortuaries for missing relatives following Sunday's tragic events during the final of a national tournament honoring military leader Mamadi Doumbouya. Official estimates say 56 people died in the crush, but the unofficial death toll is at least 135, according to the Collective of Human Rights Organizations of the Nzerekore region. More than 50 people remain missing, including Adama, 15, who was 'everything' to his devastated brother. 'I want to see him now, dead or alive,' a heartbroken Kouroumah said. The world’s latest sports crowd disaster happened during the final of the tournament at the Third of April stadium in honor of Doumbouya, who overran the country's elected president three years ago and added it to the list of several West African countries hit by military coups in recent years. But for a football-loving nation hungry for its first World Cup qualification and an Africa Cup of Nations triumph, the two-week tournament in Nzerekore, almost 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the capital of Conakry, had attracted not just adults and youths, but also children. Chaos had erupted at the crowded and open stadium after fans protested a referee’s penalty call and were throwing stones towards the field, according to witnesses and local media. Security forces reacted to the disturbance with tear gas as fans poured onto the pitch, survivors said. While some fans managed to jump over the high fence to escape, videos from the scene showed many struggling to squeeze themselves through the main stadium entrance, ending up being crushed by the crowd. Desperate fans were seen shouting and crying for help, many of them being trampled as they struggled to avoid the crush. Among the dead was Jaquerine Keba Koévogui, 15, whose father said she rarely visited the stadium and, although she loved soccer, would always prefer to watch it on television. 'My daughter was with other members of the family, mostly boys who were able to jump over the stadium walls while she tried to get out through the entrance,' said Jules Koevogui, 42. Mamadou Sanoh’s painful search for his 10-year-son ended with heartbreak. 'I went to the morgue and saw his body,' said Sanoh. 'I cannot tell you the shock I am feeling.' The National Alliance for Alternation and Democracy opposition coalition said the tournament was organized to drum up support for the 'illegal and inappropriate' political ambitions of the junta leader. While videos showed the stadium was filled at full capacity, Cissé Lancine, a local sports journalist, estimated there were between 20,000 and 30,000 spectators. The coalition has criticised the use of tear gas and has accused the security forces of using their vehicles to obstruct the stadium entrances. In Conakry and other parts of the country, flags are at half-mast as the country observes three days of mourning. Nzerekore's human rights organizations have called for the arrest of the organizers of the tournament. Authorities have said they were investigating the incident which adds growing pressure on Doumbouya who, since forcefully taking over power in 2021, has failed to solve the economic and political challenges he chastised the previous government for. The United Nations in Guinea has promised a quick response involving humanitarian, medical and psychological support to the victims of the disaster. 'This tragedy is a painful reminder of the crucial importance of ensuring safety in public places,' it said in a statement released on the X platform. Struggling to process the grief, families are asking questions and finding ways to prevent a reoccurrence. 'We must now keep our children away from large demonstrations of mobilization,' said Joel Gbamou, a civil society activist who lost his two sons in the tragedy. —- AP journalist Mark Banchereau in Dakar, Senegal, contributed. ____ Follow AP’s Africa coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/guinea-stampede-soccer-stadium-nzerekore-2bb8164bbfe1d5adbca1011c2535b4b9	2024-12-03T23:38:38-08:00	
Activists file second impeachment complaint against embattled Philippine Vice President Duterte	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A group led by left-wing activists filed a second impeachment complaint against the Philippine vice president on Wednesday over her alleged misuse of government funds and demanded that she be permanently barred from holding public office. The impeachment complaint filed by at least 74 activists, including human rights, labor and student leaders, before the House of Representatives reflects the extent of the political hostilities faced by Vice President Sara Duterte. She did not immediately comment on the new impeachment complaint or an earlier one filed Monday. Duterte, a 46-year-old lawyer, is the daughter of also-controversial former President Rodrigo Duterte, who oversaw a bloody anti-drug crackdown while in office. The killing of thousands of suspects during the crackdown is being investigated by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity. Her No. 1 political adversary has been President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., whom she publicly threatened with death in a Nov. 23 online news conference. Government investigators have launched a criminal investigation into her threat against the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives, a cousin and ally of Marcos. Duterte has tried to walk back her comments by saying they were not a direct death threat but rather an expression of concern for her own safety. The complaint filed Wednesday accused the vice president of 'betrayal of public trust over the illegal use and mishandling of 612.5 million pesos ($10.3 million) in confidential funds,' according to a statement by the complainants. The impeachment complaint said that in addition to the alleged misuse of the confidential and intelligence funds, the vice president and her staff allegedly tried to cover up the irregularities by submitting fabricated reports, receipts and documents to the Commission on Audit and deliberately obstructing a congressional investigation. It said that in December 2022, the vice president’s office spent 125 million pesos ($2 million) in 11 days during the Christmas holidays for suspicious expenditures, including renting 'safe houses,' paying for unspecified confidential information and financing rewards, which it said were not clearly explained by Duterte. 'Wasting the confidential funds is a big betrayal of the people,' said Liza Maza, a leading complainant from the Makabayan political coalition. 'This is not just a simple technical violation but a systematic misuse and robbery of public funds.' 'The impeachment is the antidote to impunity,' said Renato Reyes of Bayan, another left-wing political coalition. 'Citizens and taxpayers need to hold public officials accountable.' On Monday, a group of civil society activists, including Roman Catholic priests and pro-democracy activists, filed an initial impeachment case that contained about 24 alleged crimes and irregularities, including her death threats against Marcos and her alleged role in the extra-judicial killings of drug suspects under her father's crackdown. She was also accused of failing to stand up to Chinese aggression in the disputed South China Sea. The impeachment complaints will be examined by the House of Representatives, which is dominated by allies of Marcos and his cousin and key backer, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, who also has been politically at odds with the vice president. The process could take weeks or months. Congress is to start its Christmas recess on Dec. 20 and resume on Jan. 13. Many legislators will then start campaigning for reelection ahead of the May 12 midterm elections. The House has been investigating the alleged misuse of confidential and intelligence funds received by Duterte’s offices as vice president and education secretary. She has since left the education post. She has refused to respond to questions in detail in tense televised hearings. Philippine police have filed criminal complaints against Duterte and her security staff for allegedly assaulting authorities and disobeying orders in an altercation in Congress over the brief detention of her chief of staff, who was accused of hampering the congressional inquiry into the alleged misuse of funds. The National Bureau of Investigation subpoenaed Duterte to face investigators on Dec. 11 about her threats against the president. Marcos and Duterte won landslide victories as running mates in the 2022 election but have since fallen out over key differences. The two offices are elected separately in the Philippines, which has resulted in rivals occupying the country’s top political posts. ___ Associated Press journalists Aaron Favila and Joeal Calupitan contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-vice-president-duterte-impeachment-complaint-1edd5c533ae2f82d0cdad12bd5fd0c92	2024-12-03T23:17:30-08:00	
A history of martial law in South Korea in Associated Press photographs	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — When South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law this week it was the first time a South Korean government took such a drastic measure since it became a fully functioning democracy more than 35 years ago. But in the decades of largely autocratic governments and military rule from the end of World War II until the establishment of the Sixth Republic in 1988, martial law was not uncommon as the country faced political turmoil, uprisings, frequent protests and all-out war with North Korea. It was last imposed in 1979 by Prime Minister Choi Kyu-hah after the assassination of President Park Chung-hee, a military dictator who had seized power in a 1961 coup. It was then extended in 1980 by Gen. Chun Doo-hwan, who also took the presidency in a military coup. He used military force to put down student-led demonstrations in Gwangju, some 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Seoul, killing hundreds of protesters. In Seoul, thousands of university students took to the streets to demand an end to martial law, and were confronted by riot police using tear gas. Martial law was eventually lifted in 1981. Martial law was first used in 1948 by South Korea's first president Syngman Rhee as he cracked down on communist uprisings, killing thousands. It was also invoked during the 1950-53 Korean War to allow South Korea to use its military to stifle anti-government protests. As Rhee struggled to hold onto power in the face of growing opposition, he imposed martial law again in 1960. Hundreds were killed in clashes between protesters and police. After Rhee was forced to resign in the face of nationwide demonstrations, jubilant South Koreans climbed aboard a tank outside Seoul's City Hall to celebrate. While still president in 1972, Park Chung-hee initiated another coup to give himself dictatorial powers and declared martial law, again sending tanks into the streets of Seoul. It was lifted later the same year. Through the years until his assassination in 1979, protests against Park's rule grew, and he used emergency measures to justify the jailing of hundreds of dissidents.	https://apnews.com/article/korea-martial-law-yoon-president-9adbff7c7df6a2fa22b1fbf955a495fa	2024-12-03T23:08:47-08:00	
Shock martial law edict in South Korea follows chaotic recent history: A look at the crucial context	TOKYO (AP) — It may seem that the wild predawn scenes in Seoul, with hundreds of armed troops and frantic lawmakers storming South Korea's parliament building after the president suddenly declared martial law, came out of nowhere. But the chaotic events, which were still playing out Wednesday as opposition leaders introduced an impeachment motion and called for President Yoon Suk Yeol's immediate resignation, should be seen in the context of South Korea's recent tumultuous political and social history. These moments resonate with South Koreans in their daily lives, and as they look to explain Yoon's short-lived declaration of emergency martial law, even if there's still widespread confusion and anger over his decision. From a nationwide doctors' strike, to an opposition leader narrowly avoiding prison amid a raft of court cases, to millions of people filling the streets in protest to drive out an elected leader, here is a look at some of those recent crucial developments. A nationwide doctors' strike For months, it has been health, not politics, that has been a major focus of many South Koreans. An extended strike by thousands of junior doctors who have refused to see patients or attend surgeries has disrupted operations at hospitals across the country. The strife is especially acute in a nation facing a major demographic crisis. South Korea has one of the fastest aging, fastest shrinking populations in the developed world. There is hardly a family that has not struggled with medical care for loved ones. The strike, which is ongoing, began Feb. 20 in response to a government push to recruit more medical students. Yoon’s government has taken a hard line, warning that doctors must return to work or face license suspensions and prosecutions. He has said the strike poses 'a grave threat to our society.' At issue is the government plan to raise South Korea’s annual medical school admission cap by 2,000 from the current 3,058. The enrollment plan is meant to add up to 10,000 doctors by 2035 to cope with the country’s fast-aging population. Officials say South Korea has 2.1 physicians per 1,000 people — far below the average of 3.7 in the developed world. The striking doctors-in-training predict that doctors in greater competition would overtreat patients, increasing public medical expenses. Some critics say the striking junior doctors simply oppose the government plan because they believe adding more doctors would result in lower incomes. A powerful opposition in turmoil Investigations and legal proceedings against major political figures are common in South Korea. Almost all former presidents, or their family members and key associates, have been mired in scandals near the end of their terms or after they left office. The current opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, a firebrand liberal who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, has also been dogged by corruption claims. Lee, who was stabbed in an attack and underwent surgery earlier this year, says Yoon's promotion of divisive politics has worsened an already toxic national discourse. Last month Lee was convicted of violating election law and sentenced to a suspended prison term for making false statements during a presidential campaign. He faces three other trials over corruption and other criminal charges. It remains unclear whether the Supreme Court will decide on any of the cases before the next presidential vote in March 2027. Lee has steadfastly denied wrongdoing. It’s unclear, of course, how events in coming days will play out, but the martial law declaration could be a boon to Lee, especially if it results in an early exit for Yoon and a presidential by-election. On Wednesday, he livestreamed himself climbing over a wall near parliament, one of a wave of lawmakers who dodged troops and police to get into the National Assembly. Massive protests drive an elected president out of office Perhaps the most epochal event in recent South Korean political history — and the one many people will be thinking of as Yoon faces the consequences of his declaration — was the downfall of conservative former President Park Geun-hye. After near-daily protests in 2016 that saw millions take to the streets around the country, Park was the first democratically elected leader to be forced from office since democracy came to South Korea in the late 1980s. Park, who was pardoned in late 2021 by her liberal rival and successor, former President Moon Jae-in, was serving a lengthy prison term for bribery and other crimes. Park, the daughter of assassinated dictator Park Chung-hee, won election as South Korea’s first female president in late 2012 by beating Moon by a million votes. Conservatives celebrated her father as a hero who pulled the country up from postwar poverty despite his suppression of human rights. She was impeached by lawmakers in late 2016 and was formally removed from office and arrested the following year. Among the main charges she faced was collusion with her longtime confidante, Choi Soon-sil, to take millions of dollars in bribes and extortion from some of the country’s largest business groups, including Samsung, while she was in office. Park has described herself as a victim of political revenge.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-context-eb59571aa1ff36ca22f8427b39bb7133	2024-12-03T22:26:42-08:00	
New UN aid chief vows 'ruthlessness' to prioritize spending as funding for world's crises shrinks	GENEVA (AP) — The new head of the U.N. humanitarian aid agency says it will be 'ruthless' when prioritizing how to spend money, a nod to challenges in fundraising for civilians in war zones like Gaza, Sudan, Syria and Ukraine. Tom Fletcher, a longtime British diplomat who took up the U.N. post last month, said his agency is asking for less money in 2025 than this year. He said it wants to show 'we will focus and target the resources we have,' even as crises grow more numerous, intense and long-lasting. His agency, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, on Wednesday issued its global appeal for 2025, seeking $47 billion to help 190 million people in 32 countries — though it estimates 305 million worldwide need help. 'The world is on fire, and this is how we put it out,' he told reporters on Tuesday. The office and many other aid groups, including the international Red Cross, have seen donations shrink in recent years for longtime trouble spots like Syria, South Sudan, the Middle East and Congo and newer ones like Ukraine and Sudan. Aid access has been difficult in some places, especially Sudan and Gaza. The office's appeal for $50 billion for this year was only 43% fulfilled as of last month. One consequence of that shortfall was a 80% reduction in food aid for Syria, which has seen a sudden escalation in fighting in recent days. Such funds go to U.N. agencies and more than 1,500 partner organizations. The biggest asks for 2025 are for Syria — a total of $8.7 billion for needs both within the country and for neighbors that have taken in Syrian refugees — as well as Sudan at a total of $6 billion, the 'Occupied Palestinian Territory' at $4 billion, Ukraine at about $3.3 billion and Congo at nearly $3.2 billion. Fletcher said his office needs to be 'ruthless' in choosing to reach people most in need. 'I choose that word carefully, because it's a judgement call — that ruthlessness — about prioritizing where the funding goes and where we can have the greatest impact,' he said. 'It's a recognition that we have struggled in previous years to raise the money we need.' In response to questions about how much President-elect Donald Trump of the United States — the U.N.'s biggest single donor — will spend on humanitarian aid, Fletcher said he expects to spend 'a lot of time' in Washington over the next few months to talk with the new administration. 'America is very much on our minds at the moment,' he said, acknowledging some governments 'will be more questioning of what the United Nations does and less ideologically supportive of this humanitarian effort' laid out in the new report. This year has been the deadliest on record for humanitarians and U.N. staff, largely due to the Middle East conflict triggered by Palestinian militants' deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack in Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-humanitarian-aid-syria-trump-d61485754e1c03039332a30119dab403	2024-12-03T20:18:34-08:00	
Who is Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of Syria's shock insurgency?	BEIRUT (AP) — Over the past dozen years, Syrian militant leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has worked to remake his public image and the insurgency he commands, renouncing longtime ties to al-Qaida and consolidating power before emerging from the shadows. Now al-Golani, 42, seeks to seize the moment yet again, leading his fighters in a stunning offensive that has put them in control of Syria’s largest city, reigniting the country's long civil war and raising new questions about President Bashar Assad’s hold on power. The surge and al-Golani's place at the head of it are evidence of a remarkable transformation. Al-Golani's success on the battlefield follows years of maneuvering among extremist organizations while eliminating competitors and former allies. Along the way he moved to distance himself from al-Qaida, polishing his image and his extremist group's de-facto 'salvation government' in an attempt to win over international governments and the country’s religious and ethnic minorities. Putting himself forward as a champion of pluralism and tolerance, al-Golani's rebranding efforts sought to broaden his group's public support and legitimacy. Still, it had been years since Syria’s opposition forces, based in the country's northwest, made any substantial military progress against Assad. The Syrian president's government, with backing from Iran and Russia, has maintained its control of about 70 percent of the country in a stalemate that had left al-Golani and his jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, out of the spotlight. But the rebels' descent on Aleppo and nearby towns, alongside a coalition of Turkish-backed armed groups dubbed the Syrian National Army, has shaken up Syria’s tense detente and left the war-torn country’s neighbors in Jordan, Iraq, and Lebanon worried about this flareup spilling over. Al-Golani's beginnings in Iraq Al-Golani’s ties to al-Qaida stretch back to 2003 when he joined extremists battling U.S. troops in Iraq. The native of Syria was detained several times by the U.S. military, but remained in Iraq. During that time, al-Qaida usurped likeminded groups and formed the extremist Islamic State of Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In 2011, a popular uprising against Syria's Assad triggered a brutal government crackdown and led to all-out war. Al-Golani's prominence grew when al-Baghdadi sent him to Syria to establish a branch of al-Qaida called the Nusra Front. The United States labeled the new group as a terrorist organization. That designation still remains in place and the U.S. government has put a $10 million bounty on him. The Nusra Front and the Syrian conflict As Syria's civil war intensified in 2013, so did al-Golani’s ambitions. He defied al-Baghdadi’s calls to dissolve the Nusra Front and merge it with al-Qaida's operation in Iraq, to form the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Al-Golani nonetheless pledged his allegiance to al-Qaida, which later disassociated itself from ISIS. The Nusra Front battled ISIS and eliminated much of its competition among the Syrian armed opposition to Assad. In his first interview in 2014, al-Golani kept his face covered, telling a reporter for Qatari network Al-Jazeera that he rejected political talks in Geneva to end the conflict. He said his goal was to see Syria ruled under Islamic law and made clear that there was no room for the country's Alawite, Shiite, Druze, and Christian minorities. Consolidating power and rebranding In 2016, al-Golani revealed his face to the public for the first time in a video message that announced his group was renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and cutting its ties to al-Qaida. 'This new organization has no affiliation to any external entity,' he said in the video, filmed wearing military garb and a turban. The move paved the way for al-Golani to assert full control over fracturing militant groups. A year later, his alliance rebranded again as HTS as the groups merged, consolidating al-Golani’s power in northwest Syria’s Idlib province. Afterward HTS clashed with independent Islamist militants who opposed the merger, further emboldening al-Golani and and his group as the leading power in northwestern Syria, able to rule with an iron fist. With his power consolidated, al-Golani set in motion a transformation that few could have imagined. Replacing his military garb with shirt and trousers, he began calling for religious tolerance and pluralism. He appealed to the Druze community in Idlib, which the Nusra Front had previously targeted, and visited the families of Kurds who were killed by Turkish-backed militias. In 2021, al-Golani had his first interview with an American journalist on PBS. Wearing a blazer, with his short hair gelled back, the now more soft-spoken HTS leader said that his group posed no threat to the West and that sanctions imposed against it were unjust. 'Yes, we have criticized Western policies,' he said. 'But to wage a war against the United States or Europe from Syria, that’s not true. We didn’t say we wanted to fight.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-insurgency-alqaida-algolani-0c11961094ca4fb7fe1bccce1c4b3302	2024-12-03T20:12:21-08:00	
Power shortages in Ecuador are melting away the future of a small town’s ice-cream industry	SALCEDO, Ecuador (AP) — Ice-cream production in Salcedo, a quaint town in Ecuador's central highlands, began in the mid-20th century, born from the ingenuity of Franciscan nuns. Locals say the sisters would drink fruit shakes made with milk from the region’s dairy farms until one of them began collecting the leftovers, turning them into creamy popsicles that became an overnight sensation. The nuns sold the popsicles in town to gather funds for the poor. But the people of Salcedo saw a business opportunity and began experimenting with new flavors and techniques, establishing a thriving popsicle industry that has made their small town famous among ice-cream lovers. However, a recent wave of power outages, triggered by a prolonged dry spell, is threatening the future of Salcedo’s ice-cream industry and melting away its dreams of a more prosperous future. The daily power outages that began earlier this year and intensified in September can last up to 14 hours. They have come about due to drier than usual weather in Ecuador, which relies heavily on hydroelectric plants. During most months of the year, hydroelectric plants produce between 70% to 90% Ecuador’s electricity. The nation of 17 million people invested heavily in dams over the past two decades, but it is now struggling to come up with alternatives. 'We are living through the worst third-world conditions,' said Gabriel Pumasunta, owner of the Polar Bear ice-cream factory. 'We're plunged into darkness.' Pumasunta, who runs the small company with his two brothers, said that if the power outages continue this month, they will have no choice but to shut down the plant. 'We will have to work elsewhere,' he said. Pumasunta said that power outages have halted production and storage, causing much of his product to melt. Before outages intensified in September, Polar Bear was producing 60,000 popsicles per month, Salcedo said. Now, the small company makes 10,000 popsicles per month, and it has been forced to let go of eight of its 10 employees. To stay afloat, Pumasunta has dipped into the company’s savings and those of his family. He now works on the plant’s machines himself, taking care of deliveries to bring down costs, while his parents have also stepped up to help. President Daniel Noboa, who was elected last year in a special election that followed the resignation of Ecuador’s previous president, has not been able to solve the electricity crisis. The chamber of commerce in Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, estimates that power outages are generating weekly losses of $700 million for Ecuadorian businesses. Germán Soria, president of the association of artisanal ice-cream makers, said that before the power crisis, Salcedo had 80 small- and medium-sized ice-cream plants and three large factories. Now, 30 of these smaller plants have been forced to close. Soria’s own ice-cream plant, housed in a shed behind his house, now sits empty. He said he stopped production three weeks ago and has been forced to sell some equipment, as well as a plot of land to cover his debts. He said that the outages, which occur at unexpected times, make it hard to plan production. 'Our clients are also less keen to buy ice-cream, because they’re not sure if they can keep the popsicles from melting.' According to local officials, the power crisis has cost 300 jobs in Salcedo, a town renowned for its fruit-flavored ice-cream, including flavors such as blackberries, and taxo, an aromatic and somewhat acidic fruit that resembles passion fruit. President Noboa has promised that power shortages in Ecuador will end this month, but analysts doubt his claim, saying the country lacks the capacity to make up for a 1,900-megawatt deficit. The Ecuadorian government has bought and rented dozens of large electric generators that run on fossil fuels and are expected to arrive in the following weeks. But as Marco Acuña, the president of Ecuador's national guild of engineers, notes: 'They do not have the capacity to make up for the current deficit.' Meanwhile in Salcedo, the collapse of the local ice-cream industry has rippled through the local economy, impacting dairy farms, fruit growers, transporters and mom-and-pop stores that specialized in selling the famous popsicles. 'Before (the power cuts) we would buy up to 150 popsicles a day,' said Maria Juliette López, who owns a small shop on the Panamerican highway where tourists and truck drivers stop to buy snacks. 'Now we can only take up to 40 popsicles a day, because any product that is left over will melt' when her freezer stops working, she said. While the power outages appear to be hitting small- and medium-sized producers and vendors the most, Salcedo’s three largest ice-cream factories say they have also been impacted. One of those is Corp Ice-Cream, whose factory used to buzz with activity at noon, with its 35 employees working hard to produce up to 20,000 popsicles per day. But during a recent visit to the plant, there was only one employee sweeping in the dark, due to the lack of power. Paco Hinojosa, the company's manager, said Corp Ice Cream managed to stay afloat thanks to its customers in the United States, which order 120,000 popsicles per month during the summer. But the winter months bring a halt to U.S. exports, which won't resume until around March. Corp Ice Cream’s sales in Ecuador have gone down by 40% since the power outages began in mid September and that is taking a toll on its suppliers. 'We used to buy 2,500 liters of milk and 160 liters of cream each day,' Hinojosa said. 'Now we have cut down our orders by half — and the same goes for fruit.' Next to his desk, Hinojosa has a small altar to St. Michael the Archangel, the city’s patron saint, whom he has been asking for health — and more rain. 'It brings tears to your eyes to see this factory paralyzed due to the lack of electricity,' he said. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-power-cuts-salcedo-ice-cream-4329552f2dd686464dfa9c77f0977039	2024-12-03T20:11:37-08:00	
Amtrak Joe' Biden uses his visit to Angola to promote a major African rail project	LUANDA, Angola (AP) — Even in the waning days of his presidency and thousands of miles from home, U.S. President Joe Biden is finding ways to celebrate trains. Biden is using his third and final day in Angola to showcase the Lobito Corridor railway, where the U.S. and key allies are investing heavily to refurbish 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) of train lines in Zambia, Congo and Angola. The project aims to advance the U.S. presence in a region rich in cobalt, copper and other critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies. By the end of the decade, the rail line could even go a long way toward linking southern Africa's western coast with the continent's eastern edge. 'I’m probably the most pro-rail guy in America,' Biden, the first U.S. president to visit Angola, said during a speech Tuesday evening. Biden has long had the nickname Amtrak Joe for the 36 years he spent commuting by U.S. train from his home in Delaware to Washington while in the Senate. He said the Lobito Corridor constituted the largest U.S. investment in a train project outside the country. On Wednesday, Biden will fly from the capital of Luanda to Lobito on Africa's western coast to tour port facilities with Angolan President João Lourenço, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Tanzanian Vice President Philip Mpango. The leaders also plan to meet with representatives from companies that stand to benefit from the corridor project, including a telecommunication firm expanding cell service in the region, a food-production firm and Acrow Bridge, a Pennsylvania company that makes prefabricated steel bridges and has a contract to deliver nearly 200 to Angola. The Biden administration says the corridor will help business interests and counter China's growing influence in Africa — in addition to satisfying a president obsessed with riding the rails. In Lobito, Biden will announce $600 million in new U.S. investment for projects associated with the corridor, which has also drawn financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks. The administration says it currently can take cargo loads of materials about 45 days to get from eastern Congo or Zambia to the market, and usually involves going by truck to South Africa. Test loads run using the new rail corridor made the same journey in around 40 to 50 hours. China, meanwhile, already has heavy investments in mining and processing African minerals, and has used its Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure strategy to promote its economic and political influence around the world. In September, China said it had signed a deal with Tanzania and Zambia to revamp a separate railway line going east from Zambia to Tanzania’s Dar es Salaam on the east coast of Africa. The countries had previously worked together to build the railway line in the 1970s, but it fell into disrepair. China’s move to renovate it — announced on the sidelines of this year’s China-Africa forum — is seen by some analysts as the Chinese response to the Lobito Corridor. A senior U.S. administration official called the Lobito Corridor the heart of competing with China, not as a political adversary but from a business standpoint. The idea is, rather than pumping in simple aid, Washington will attempt to grow U.S. influence by promoting projects that can spark investment and therefore help communities and countries over the long haul. The Lobito Corridor has become a model approach that the U.S. is looking to replicate in other parts of the world, said the official, who briefed reporters during Biden's Angola visit on condition of anonymity to offer project details that haven't yet been made public. The corridor won't be completed for years, meaning much of the continued work would come during the administration of Republican Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20. The Biden White House says that Republicans in Congress and elsewhere have supported past efforts to promote African business interests through targeted investments and that such initiatives have appealed to Trump and his key advisers in the past. ___ Associated Press writer Gerald Imray in Cape Town, South Africa, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-lobito-corridor-us-china-investment-f5dd55e80331f2416136ff34bab60d4d	2024-12-03T20:08:40-08:00	
Australia is banning social media for people under 16. Could this work elsewhere — or even there?	It is an ambitious social experiment of our moment in history — one that experts say could accomplish something that parents, schools and other governments have attempted with varying degrees of success: keeping kids off social media until they turn 16. Australia's new law, approved by its Parliament last week, is an attempt to swim against many tides of modern life — formidable forces like technology, marketing, globalization and, of course, the iron will of a teenager. And like efforts of the past to protect kids from things that parents believe they're not ready for, the nation's move is both ambitious and not exactly simple, particularly in a world where young people are often shaped, defined and judged by the online company they keep. The ban won't go into effect for another year. But how will Australia be able to enforce it? That's not clear, nor will it be easy. TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram have become so ingrained in young people's lives that going cold turkey will be difficult. Other questions loom. Does the ban limit kids' free expression and — especially for those in vulnerable groups — isolate them and curtail their opportunity to connect with members of their community? And how will social sites verify people's ages, anyway? Can't kids just get around such technicalities, as they so often do? This is, after all, the 21st century — an era when social media is the primary communications tool for most of those born in the past 25 years who, in a fragmented world, seek the common cultures of trends, music and memes. What happens when big swaths of that fall away? Is Australia's initiative a good, long-time-coming development that will protect the vulnerable, or could it become a well-meaning experiment with unintended consequences? Platforms will be held liable The law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts. 'It’s clear that social media companies have to be held accountable, which is what Australia is trying to do,' said Jim Steyer, president and CEO of the nonprofit Common Sense Media. Leaders and parents in countries around the world are watching Australia’s policy closely as many seek to protect young kids from the internet's dangerous corners — and, not incidentally, from each other. Most nations have taken different routes, from parental consent requirements to minimum age limits. Many child safety experts, parents and even teens who have waited to get on social media consider Australia's move a positive step. They say there’s ample reason to ensure that children wait. 'What’s most important for kids, just like adults, is real human connection. Less time alone on the screen means more time to connect, not less,' said Julie Scelfo, the founder of Mothers Against Media Addiction, or MAMA, a grassroots group of parents aimed at combatting the harms of social media to children. 'I’m confident we can support our kids in interacting in any number of ways aside from sharing the latest meme.' The harms to children from social media have been well documented in the two decades since Facebook’s launch ushered in a new era in how the world communicates. Kids who spend more time on social media, especially when they are tweens or young teenagers, are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, according to multiple studies — though it is not yet clear if there is a causal relationship. What's more, many are exposed to content that is not appropriate for their age, including pornography and violence, as well as social pressures about body image and makeup. They also face bullying, sexual harassment and unwanted advances from their peers as well as adult strangers. Because their brains are not fully developed, teenagers, especially younger ones the law is focused on, are also more affected by social comparisons than adults, so even happy posts from friends can send them into a negative spiral. What unintended harms could be caused? Many major initiatives, particularly those aimed at social engineering, can produce side effects — often unintended. Could that happen here? What, if anything, do kids stand to lose by separating kids and the networks in which they participate? Paul Taske, associate director of litigation at the tech lobbying group NetChoice, says he considers the ban 'one of the most extreme violations of free speech on the world stage today' even as he expressed relief that the First Amendment prevents such law in the United States 'These restrictions would create a massive cultural shift,' Taske said. 'Not only is the Australian government preventing young people from engaging with issues they’re passionate about, but they’re also doing so even if their parents are ok with them using digital services,' he said. 'Parents know their children and their needs the best, and they should be making these decisions for their families — not big government. That kind of forcible control over families inevitably will have downstream cultural impacts.' David Inserra, a fellow for Free Expression and Technology, Cato Institute, called the bill 'about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike' in a recent blog post. While Australia's law doesn't require 'hard verification' such as an uploaded ID, he said, it calls for effective 'age-assurance' that includes an array of ways companies can estimate someone's age. He said no verification system can ensure accuracy while also protecting privacy and not impacting adults in the process. Privacy advocates have also raised concerns about the law's effect on online anonymity, a cornerstone of online communications — and something that can protect teens on social platforms. 'Whether it be religious minorities and dissidents, LGBTQ youth, those in abusive situations, whistleblowers, or countless other speakers in tricky situations, anonymous speech is a critical tool to safely challenge authority and express controversial opinions,' Inserra said. 'But if every user of online platforms must first identify themselves, then their anonymity is at risk.' Other countries are trying to figure it out, too Parents in Britain and across Europe earlier this year organized on platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram to promise not to buy smartphones for children younger than 12 or 13. This approach costs almost no money and requires no government enforcement. In the United States, some parents are keeping kids off social media either informally or as part of an organized campaign such as Wait Until 8th, a group that helps parents delay kids' access to social media and phones. This fall, Norway announced plans to ban kids under 15 from using social media, while France is testing a smartphone ban for kids under 15 in a limited number of schools — a policy that could be rolled out nationwide if successful. U.S. lawmakers have held multiple congressional hearings — most recently in January — on child online safety. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook’s founding. In July, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation designed to protect children from dangerous online content, pushing forward with what would be the first major effort by Congress in decades to hold tech companies more accountable. But the Kids Online Safety Act has since stalled in the House. While several states have passed laws requiring age verification, those are stuck in court. Utah became the first state to pass laws regulating children’s social media use in 2023. In September, a judge issued the preliminary injunction against the law, which would have required social media companies to verify the ages of users, apply privacy settings and limit some features. NetChoice has also obtained injunctions temporarily halting similar laws in several other states. And last May, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said there is insufficient evidence to show social media is safe for kids. He urged policymakers to address the harms of social media the same way they regulate things like car seats, baby formula, medication and other products children use. Said Scelfo: 'Why should social media products be any different? Kids may try to get around the restrictions — just like they do for alcohol, tobacco or drugs — but nobody is saying that because they try, we should give them unfettered access to them. Parents cannot possibly bear the entire responsibility of keeping children safe online, because the problems are baked into the design of the products. And so we need policies that hold Big Tech accountable for ensuring their products are safe.' ___ Associated Press Writer Laurie Kellman contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/social-media-ban-australia-kids-4dda8d92bd4b896ff502482b6736ab24	2024-12-03T20:07:17-08:00	
Philippines says China's coast guard blasts water cannon and sideswipes patrol vessel	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Chinese coast guard vessels, backed by navy ships, fired powerful water cannons and blocked and sideswiped a Philippine patrol vessel Wednesday in renewed aggression in a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, Philippine officials said. Three Philippine coast guard and bureau of fisheries vessels were on routine patrol to protect Filipino fishermen at the Scarborough Shoal when several Chinese coast guard and navy ships approached and staged 'aggressive actions' after dawn, the Philippine coast guard said. There was no immediate comment from Chinese officials. In the past, they have repeatedly cited China’s sovereignty in the contested offshore region and their determination to defend what they say is their territory despite a 2016 international arbitration decision that invalidated Beijing’s historical claims. China’s reported actions in the disputed waters came after a respite of more than a month while back-to-back major storms prevented many Philippine fishing and commercial vessels from venturing into the dangerously rough seas. Despite the Chinese ships’ 'reckless' maneuvers, the Philippines coast guard and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resource renewed their 'commitment to protecting the rights and safety of our fishermen within our maritime jurisdiction.' 'We will continue to be vigilant in safeguarding our national interests in the West Philippine Sea, the two Philippine law enforcement agencies said, using the Philippine name for the seas off the archipelago's western coast. China’s sweeping claims virtually cover the entire waterway and overlap with the territorial waters, exclusive economic zones and high seas claims of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Indonesia has also had confrontations with the Chinese coast guard, which backs Beijing’s fishing fleets. One of the Philippine vessels, BRP Datu Pagbuaya, was hit Wednesday by high-pressure water fired from a Chinese coast guard ship with bow number 3302 which targeted its navigational antennas about 16 nautical miles (30 kilometers) south of Scarborough, Manila’s coast guard said. Shortly after, the Chinese coast guard ship 'intentionally sideswiped the BRP Datu Pagbuaya on its starboard side' then 'launched a second water cannon attack on the same vessel,' the Philippine coast guard said. Philippine coast guard ship BRP Teresa Magbanua 'faced blocking, shadowing and dangerous maneuvers' by two Chinese navy and coast guard ships. Another Philippine coast guard ship, the BRP Cabra, 'was subjected to reckless maneuvers' by a Chinese coast guard ship at a distance of about 300 yards (274 meters), according to Philippine coast guard officials.

Stock market today: Asian stocks slide after South Korea's political drama, but Kospi falls only 2%	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian markets retreated Wednesday after overnight political drama in South Korea added to regional uncertainties, though the Kospi in Seoul fell less than 2%. U.S. futures rose while oil prices were little changed. South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol suddenly declared martial law on Tuesday night local time, prompting troops to surround the parliament. He accused pro-North Korean forces of plotting to overthrow one of the world’s most vibrant democracies. The martial law was revoked about six hours later. On Wednesday, South Korea’s main opposition party called for President Yoon to resign immediately or face impeachment. Yoon's move initially caused the won to plummet to a two-year low against the U.S. dollar, with losses of up to 2%, the sharpest one-day drop since the market’s seismic reaction to Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory. The won recovered some of those losses on Wednesday. The dollar was trading at 1,414.43 won, down from Tuesday's peak at 1,443.40. South Korea’s Kospi lost 1.9% to 2,451.64. Shares of Samsung Electronics, the country's biggest company, fell 1.1%. Meanwhile, the country’s financial regulator said they were prepared to deploy 10 trillion won ($7.07 billion) into a stock market stabilization fund at any time, the Yonhap news agency reported. Elsewhere in the region, China announced Tuesday it was banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony, and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications. Beijing took the measure after the U.S. expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software, and high-bandwidth memory chips. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added less than 0.1% to 19,752.59, while the Shanghai Composite edged down 0.1% to 3,375.20. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 0.4% to 39,077.04. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 0.5% to 8,454.10. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks tiptoed to more records, tacking a touch more onto what’s already been a stellar year. The S&amp;P 500 edged up less than 0.1% to 6,049.88, setting an all-time high for the 55th time this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2% to 44,705.53, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.4% to 19,480.91, hitting its own record set a day earlier. Treasury yields held relatively steady after a report showed U.S. employers were advertising slightly more job openings at the end of October than a month earlier. Continued strength there would raise optimism that the economy could remain out of a recession that many investors had earlier worried was inevitable. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.23% from 4.20% from late Monday. Yields have seesawed since Election Day on worries that Trump’s preferences for lower tax rates and bigger tariffs could spur higher inflation. But traders are still confident the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate again at its next meeting in two weeks. They’re betting on a nearly three-in-four chance of that, according to data from CME Group. Lower rates can give the economy a lift but also tend to fuel inflation. A report this week that could guide the Fed’s next move will be Friday's jobs report, which will show how many workers U.S. employers hired and fired during November. It could be difficult to parse given how much storms and strikes distorted figures in October. Based on trading in the options market, Friday’s jobs report appears to be the biggest potential market mover until the Fed announces its next decision on interest rates Dec. 18, according to strategists at Barclays Capital. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude lost 5 cents to $69.99 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 7 cents to $73.69 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 149.75 Japanese yen from 149.59 yen. The euro cost $1.0495, down from $1.0510. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-korea-inflation-rates-d8b662da846c8ae5b32ab3a91e3529f9	2024-12-03T18:58:41-08:00	
South Korean President Yoon is urged to resign or face impeachment over martial law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s main opposition party on Wednesday urged President Yoon Suk Yeol to resign immediately or face impeachment, hours after Yoon ended short-lived martial law that prompted troops to encircle parliament before lawmakers voted to lift it. Yoon has publicly responded to the opposition’s demand. But his office said senior presidential advisers and secretaries for Yoon offered to resign collectively and the president also put off his official Wednesday morning schedule. In the capital, tourists and residents walked around, traffic and construction were heard, and other than crowds of police holding shields, it seemed like a normal sunny, cold December morning. On Tuesday night, Yoon abruptly imposed the emergency martial law, vowing to eliminate 'anti-state' forces after he struggled to push forward his agenda in the opposition-dominated parliament. But his martial law was effective for only about six hours, as the National Assembly voted to overrule the president. The declaration was formally lifted around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting. The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the 300-seat parliament, said Wednesday that its lawmakers decided to call on Yoon to quit immediately or they would take steps to impeach him. 'President Yoon Suk Yeol’s martial law declaration was a clear violation of the constitution. It didn’t abide by any requirements to declare it,' the Democratic Party said in a statement. 'His martial law declaration was originally invalid and a grave violation of the constitution. It was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment.' Impeaching him would require support from two-thirds of the parliament, or 200 of its 300 members. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together have 192 seats. But when the parliament rejected Yoon’s martial law declaration in a 190-0 vote, 18 lawmakers from Yoon’s ruling People Power Party cast ballots supporting the rejection, according to National Assembly officials. The leader of the People Power Party, Han Dong-hun, who has long ties with Yoon dating to their days as prosecutors, criticized Yoon’s martial law declaration as 'unconstitutional.' If Yoon is impeached, he’ll be stripped of his constitutional powers until the Constitutional Court can rule on his fate. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the No. 2 position in the South Korean government, would take over his presidential responsibilities. Yoon’s martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, harkened to South Korea’s past military-backed governments when authorities occasionally proclaimed martial law and other decrees that allowed them to station combat soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or at public places like schools to prevent anti-government demonstrations. Such scenes of military intervention had not been seen since South Korea achieved a genuine democracy in the late 1980s until Tuesday night. After Yoon’s declaration, troops carrying full battle gear, including assault rifles, tried to keep protesters away from the National Assembly as military helicopters flew overhead and landed nearby. One soldier pointed his assault rifle at a woman who was among protesters outside the building demanding that the martial law be lifted. It wasn’t clear how the 190 lawmakers were able to enter a parliamentary hall to vote down Yoon’s martial law decree. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung livestreamed himself climbing over the wall, and while troops and police officers blocked some from entering they didn’t aggressively restrain or use force against others. No major violence has been reported. The troops and police personnel were later seen leaving the grounds of the National Assembly after the parliamentary vote to lift the martial law. National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said: 'Even with our unfortunate memories of military coups, our citizens have surely observed the events of today and saw the maturity of our military.' Han, the People Power Party leader, demanded that Yoon explain his decision and fire Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who he said recommended the martial law decree to Yoon. The Defense Ministry has not commented. Under South Korea’s constitution, the president can declare martial law during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' that require the use of military force to restrict the freedom of press, assembly and other rights to maintain order. Many observers question whether South Korea is currently in such a state. The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote. Some experts say Yoon clearly violated the constitution in how he imposed martial law. While martial law allows 'special measures' to restrict individual freedoms and the authority of agencies and courts, the constitution does not permit the functions of parliament to be restricted. But in following Yoon’s declaration on Tuesday, South Korea’s military proclaimed parliamentary activities were suspended and deployed troops to try to block lawmakers from entering the National Assembly. Park Chan-dae, the Democratic Party’s floor leader, called for Yoon to be immediately investigated on charges of rebellion over the way he deployed troops to the parliament. While the president mostly enjoys immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to alleged rebellion or treason. In Washington, the White House said the U.S. was 'seriously concerned' by the events in Seoul. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said President Joe Biden’s administration was not notified in advance of the martial law announcement and was in contact with the South Korean government. Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said there was no effect on the more than 27,000 U.S. service members based in South Korea. In Seoul, the streets seemed busy like a normal day Wednesday. Tourist Stephen Rowan, from Brisbane, Australia, who was touring Gyeongbokgung Palace, said he was not concerned at all. 'But then again, I don’t understand too much about the political status in Korea,' he said. 'But I hear they are now calling for the current president’s resignation, so ... apparently there’s going to be a lot of demonstrations. ... I would have been concerned if martial law had stayed enforced.' Yoon’s government and ruling party have been embroiled in an impasse with the Democratic Party over next year’s budget bill and a Democratic Party-led attempt to to impeach three top prosecutors. During his televised announcement, Yoon also described the opposition as 'shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces who are plundering the freedom and happiness of our citizens.' He did not elaborate. North Korea had no immediate comments. Natalia Slavney, research analyst at the Stimson Center’s 38 North website that focuses on Korean affairs, said Yoon’s imposition of martial law was 'a serious backslide of democracy' that followed a 'worrying trend of abuse' since he took office in 2022. South Korea 'has a robust history of political pluralism and is no stranger to mass protests and swift impeachments,' Slavney said, citing the example of former President Park Geun-hye, who was ousted from office and imprisoned for bribery and other crimes in 2017. She was later pardoned. ___ Associated Press writer Jennifer McDermott contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-25a2a7c957e77a19f771b6b7c56a2173	2024-12-03T16:14:46-08:00	
Artist Jasleen Kaur wins Turner Prize for work exploring her Scottish Sikh identity	LONDON (AP) — An artist whose work exploring her Scottish Sikh identity includes a vintage Ford car draped in a crocheted doily won the U.K.’s prestigious Turner Prize on Tuesday, during a ceremony picketed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators. Jasleen Kaur was awarded the 25,000-pound ($32,000) prize by actor James Norton at the Tate Britain gallery in London. Kaur used her acceptance speech to express support for scores of demonstrators outside. She is among signatories to a letter demanding Tate, which runs several major British art museums, cut ties with donors who are linked to Israel over its war in Gaza. 'This is not a radical demand,' Kaur said. 'This should not risk an artist’s career or safety. 'We need a proper ceasefire now,' she said. The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to Hamas health officials in Gaza. Israel launched the war in response to the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023 cross-border attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 hostage. A jury led by Tate Britain director Alex Farquhar praised the way 38-year-old Kaur 'weaves together the personal, political and spiritual' through 'unexpected and playful combinations of material.' Her winning exhibition mixes sculpture, print, everyday items — including family photos, a Ford Escort car and the popular Scottish soda Irn Bru — and immersive music to reflect on her upbringing in Glasgow’s Sikh community. Three other finalists – Pio Abad, Claudette Johnson and Delaine Le Bas – received 10,000 pounds ($12,670) each. Named for 19th-century landscape painter J.M.W. Turner and founded in 1984 to reward young artists, the prize helped make stars of shark-pickling artist Damien Hirst, potter Grayson Perry, sculptor Anish Kapoor and filmmaker Steve McQueen. But it has also been criticized for rewarding impenetrable conceptual work and often sparks debate about the value of modern art, with winners such as Hirst’s 'Mother and Child Divided,' which consists of two cows, bisected and preserved in formaldehyde, and Martin Creed’s 'Lights On and Off' -- a room with a light blinking on and off – drawing scorn from sections of the media. In 2019, all four finalists were declared winners after they refused to compete against one another, 'to make a collective statement in the name of commonality, multiplicity and solidarity.' In 2021, all five finalists were collectives rather than individual artists. The award was initially open to artists under 50 but now has no upper age limit. Works by the four finalists are on display until Feb. 16.	https://apnews.com/article/turner-prize-art-winner-jasleen-kaur-9c71eaf1a1b54077ec7abf25015aa603	2024-12-03T11:01:17-08:00	
Namibia will have its first female leader after VP wins presidential election for the ruling party	WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) — Namibia elected its first female leader as Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah was declared the winner Tuesday of a presidential election last week that was tarnished by technical glitches that caused a three-day extension to allow votes to be cast, and rejected as illegal by opposition parties. The 72-year-old Nandi-Ndaitwah won with 57% of the vote, defying predictions that she might be forced into a runoff. Her ruling SWAPO party also retained its parliamentary majority, although by a very thin margin, and extended its 34-year hold on power since the southern African country gained independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990. Namibia, a sparsely populated country of around 3 million on the southwestern coast of Africa, has a reputation for being one of the continent's more stable democracies and the problems around the election have caused consternation. Last Wednesday's vote was marred by shortages of ballot papers and other problems that led election officials to extend voting until Saturday. Opposition parties have said the extension is unconstitutional, and some have pledged to join together in a legal appeal to have the election invalidated. The Electoral Commission of Namibia, which ran the election, rejected opposition calls for a redo of the vote. It has undermined Nandi-Ndaitwah's place in history. She is set to become her country's fifth president since independence and a rare female leader in Africa. She was a member of Namibia's underground independence movement in the 1970s and received part of her higher education in the then-Soviet Union. She was promoted to vice president in February after President Hage Geingob died while in office. Nangolo Mbumba, who became president after Geingob's death, didn't run in the election. The ruling SWAPO party won 51 seats in the parliamentary vote, only just passing the 49 it needed to keep its majority and narrowly avoiding becoming another long-ruling party to be rejected in southern Africa this year. It was SWAPO's worst parliamentary election result. A mood of change has swept across the region, with parties that led their countries out of white minority or colonial rule in neighboring South Africa and Botswana both losing their long-held political dominance. South Africa's African National Congress, which freed the country from the racist system of apartheid, lost its 30-year majority in an election in May and had to form a coalition. Botswana's ruling party was stunningly removed in a landslide in October after governing for 58 years since independence from Britain. Mozambique's long-ruling Frelimo has been accused of rigging an October election and has faced weeks of violent protests against its rule. SWAPO faced similar challenges as those countries, with frustration at high unemployment and economic hardship, especially among young people, driving a desire for era-ending change. In a brief speech after the results were announced late Tuesday night, Nandi-Ndaitwah said Namibians had voted for peace, stability and youth empowerment. 'We are going to do what we promised you during the campaigns. Thank you for your confidence and trust in us,' she said. Nandi-Ndaitwah was also due to address the nation on Wednesday morning. 'SWAPO Wins. Netumbo Wins. Namibia Wins. Now Hard Work,' the ruling party posted on its official account on social media site X. Some opposition parties boycotted the announcement by the Electoral Commission of Namibia at its results center in the capital, Windhoek. The commission has been roundly criticized for its running of the vote, with many angry Namibians complaining they had to wait hours and sometimes over multiple days for the chance to vote. Just over 1 million votes were cast out of 1.4 million registered voters, according to the electoral commission. Panduleni Itula, the leading opposition candidate from the Independent Patriots for Change party, was second in the presidential election with 25% of the vote. His party won the second-largest number of seats in Parliament behind SWAPO. Itula and his party have led the criticism of the vote and said they will lodge their appeal against the election this week. Other opposition parties said they will join that legal challenge. Itula has said that thousands of voters may have been prevented from voting as only some polling stations allowed an extension. 'This election has violated the very tenets of our Electoral Act. Namibians deserve the right to choose their leaders freely and fairly, not through a rigged process,' he said. Namibia is a former German colony that came under South African control after World War I and its Black majority was later subjected to some of South Africa’s apartheid policies. SWAPO was at the forefront of the battle for independence from South Africa. While the country has swaths of desert running through it, it has diamond and uranium resources and untapped oil and gas off its coast that is being explored by international companies and could make it a major producer of both. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/namibia-election-female-leader-president-8ea8783e1aa56ea20d65970e87adc313	2024-12-03T10:36:20-08:00	
South Korea's leader prompts dismay by briefly declaring martial law. Here's what to know	TOKYO (AP) — Troops surround South Korea's parliament overnight when the president declares martial law. He accuses pro-North Korean forces of plotting to overthrow one of the world’s most vibrant democracies. Lawmakers voice outrage and vote to end the declaration, and the president lifts the decree before daybreak. President Yoon Suk Yeol spread fear and confusion through South Korea overnight by issuing his sudden edict late Tuesday, the first martial law declaration since more than four decades ago when the country was controlled by a dictatorship. The declaration, the rushed vote by lawmakers to overturn it and the president's lifting of martial law soon afterward were moments of high drama for an unpopular leader who has struggled with political deadlock in an opposition-dominated parliament and scandals involving him and his wife. While there was no direct evidence presented, Yoon raised the specter of North Korea as a destabilizing force. Yoon has long maintained that a hard line against the North is the only way to stop Pyongyang from following through on its nuclear threats against Seoul. Amid the surreal scenes of troops massing around parliament, here are some things to know as this story unfolds: Details on an 'anti-state' plot are vague Immediately after Yoon's declaration the military chief called in key commanders for talks. South Korean troops set up barricades and then made their way into parliament. The leader of the main opposition, which controls parliament, ordered lawmakers to return to the building, where they eventually voted to lift the declaration of martial law. Yoon lifted the martial law decree around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting. Yoon's declaration had been accompanied by an accusation that the opposition was engaged in 'anti-state activities plotting rebellion.' But he did not explain what that means, and provided no specific evidence. The vague statement is reminiscent of the heavy-handed tactics of the South Korean dictatorships that ended in the late 1980s. A series of strongmen repeatedly invoked North Korea when struggling to control domestic dissidents and political opponents. Lawmakers from both sides voice opposition The opposition lambasted Yoon's move as un-democratic. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon’s announcement 'illegal and unconstitutional.' But the sudden declaration was also opposed by the leader of Yoon's own conservative party, Han Dong-hoon, who called the decision 'wrong' and vowed to 'stop it with the people.' 'The people will block the president’s anti-constitutional step. The military must be on the side of the public in any case. Let’s resolutely oppose it,' Kim Dong Yeon, the opposition party governor of Gyeonggi province, which surrounds Seoul, wrote on X. Average South Koreans were in shock. Social media was flooded with messages expressing surprise and worry over Yoon’s announcement. 'Martial law? I thought it was deepfake content, but is it really a martial law decree?,' one X user wrote. 'I first thought about a war with North Korea when he said he would impose a martial law,' another X user wrote. Yoon is struggling politically There were quick claims that the emergency declaration was linked to Yoon’s political struggles. His approval rating has dropped, and he has had little success in getting his policies adopted by a parliament that has been controlled by the opposition since he took over in 2022. Conservatives have said the opposition moves are political revenge for investigations into the opposition leader, who is seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027. Just this month, Yoon denied wrongdoing in an influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife. The claims have battered his approval ratings and fueled attacks by his rivals. The scandal centers on claims that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee exerted inappropriate influence on the conservative ruling People Power Party to pick a certain candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of Myung Tae-kyun, an election broker and founder of a polling agency who conducted free opinion surveys for Yoon before he became president. Yoon has said he did nothing inappropriate. Martial law is extremely sensitive in South Korea South Korea became a democracy only in the late 1980s, and military intervention in civilian affairs is still a touchy subject. During the dictatorships that emerged as the country rebuilt from the destruction of the 1950-53 Korean War, leaders occasionally proclaimed martial law that allowed them to station combat soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or in public places to prevent anti-government demonstrations. Such scenes are unimaginable for many today. The dictator Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea for nearly 20 years before he was assassinated by his spy chief in 1979, led several thousand troops into Seoul in the early hours of May 16, 1961, in the country’s first successful coup. During his rule, he occasionally proclaimed martial law to crack down on protests and jail critics. Less than two months after Park Chung-hee’s death, Maj. Gen. Chun Doo-hwan led tanks and troops into Seoul in December 1979 in the country’s second successful coup. The next year, he orchestrated a brutal military crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising in the southern city of Gwangju, killing at least 200 people. In the summer of 1987, massive street protests forced Chun’s government to accept direct presidential elections. His army buddy Roh Tae-woo, who had joined Chun’s 1979 coup, won the election held later in 1987 thanks largely to divided votes among liberal opposition candidates. ___ AP writers Kim Tong-hyung and Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-north-korea-emergency-b310df4fece42c27051f58b8951f346f	2024-12-03T09:23:06-08:00	
Demonstrators in Georgia again converge on parliament after the country's EU bid was suspended	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Thousands of demonstrators in the Georgian capital converged on parliament again on Tuesday, venting outrage against the governing party's decision to suspend negotiations on joining the European Union. Like on five previous nights, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to push back the protesters, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital's central boulevard. Nearly 300 protesters have been detained, and 26 people, including three police officers, have been hospitalized with injuries. 'The more force they use, the angrier people become, because everyone they arrest has relatives, and everyone understands that this is injustice,' said Tamar Kordzaia, a member of Unity National Movement opposition group. Kordzaia voiced confidence that the protesters will achieve their goal of calling new elections and joining the EU, noting that police on Monday 'looked very tired. I am sure we need to withstand a little longer.' The ruling Georgian Dream party retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 parliamentary election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia's help and boycotted parliament sessions. Mass opposition protests sparked by the vote gained new momentum after the governing party's decision on Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. 'We are fighting for our democracy, to protect human rights, human dignity,' said Rusudan Chanturia, who attended Tuesday's protest. Another demonstrator, David Jandieri, said the daily protests must continue until the demonstrators achieve their goal. 'In fact, we do not have another choice,' he said. Georgia’s Interior Ministry said Tuesday that 293 protesters were detained on administrative charges and five arrested on criminal charges. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has refused to recognize the official election results and contested them in the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal on Tuesday. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to lead the opposition demand for a new parliamentary election. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc’s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. It requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The Georgian government’s announcement of the EU accession talks’ suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October’s election as neither free nor fair. On Monday, the EU reiterated its 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of Georgian Dream declared Tuesday that the government is willing to open EU accession talks if the bloc ends its 'blackmail.' 'I want to remind European bureaucrats and politicians, including those who are artificially hindering our country’s European integration, to bring negotiations to the table, and we will sign immediately, on the same day, at that very moment,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-protest-opposition-election-russia-european-union-16efe0ee5041dfd6847d22c64f084674	2024-12-03T08:59:09-08:00	
An Israeli strike kills a shepherd in Lebanon, further shaking the tenuous ceasefire	NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli forces carried out several new drone and artillery strikes in Lebanon on Tuesday, including a deadly strike that the Health Ministry and state media said killed a shepherd, further shaking a tenuous ceasefire meant to end more than a year of fighting with Hezbollah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed keep striking 'with an iron fist' against perceived Hezbollah violations of the truce. His defense minister warned that if the ceasefire collapses, Israel will target not just Hezbollah but the Lebanese state — an expansion of Israel’s campaign. Israel also carried out an airstrike in Syria, saying it killed a senior member of Hezbollah responsible for coordinating with Syria’s army on rearming and resupplying the Lebanese militant group. Israel has repeatedly hit Hezbollah targets in Syria, but Tuesday's attack was a rare public acknowledgement. Syrian state media reported that an Israeli drone strike hit a car in a suburb of the capital Damascus, killing one person. Since the two-month ceasefire in Lebanon began last Wednesday, the U.S.- and French-brokered deal has been rattled by near daily Israeli attacks, although Israel has been vague about the purported Hezbollah violations that prompted them. On Monday, it was shaken by its biggest test yet. Hezbollah fired two projectiles toward an Israeli-held disputed border zone, its first volley since the ceasefire began, saying it was a 'warning' in response to Israel’s strikes. Israel responded with its heaviest barrage of the past week, killing 10 people. On Tuesday, drone strikes hit four places in southern Lebanon, one of them killing the shepherd in the town of Shebaa, the state-run National News Agency said. The Health Ministry confirmed the death. Asked about the strike, the Israeli military said its aircraft struck a Hezbollah militant who posed a threat to troops. Shebaa is situated within a region of border villages where the Israeli military has warned Lebanese civilians not to return, with Israeli troops still present. Israeli forces fired an artillery shell at one location and opened fire with small arms toward a town, the news agency reported. With Tuesday’s death, Israeli strikes since the ceasefire began have killed at least 15 people. Under the terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its fighters, weapons and infrastructure from a broad swath of the south by the end of the initial 60-day phase, pulling them north of the Litani River. Israeli troops are also to pull back to their side of the border. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said any violations of the agreement would be met with 'a maximum response and zero tolerance.' Speaking to troops on Israel’s northern border Tuesday, he said if the war resumes, Israel will widen its strikes beyond the areas where Hezbollah’s activities are concentrated, and 'there will no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon.' The ceasefire ended 14 months of war between Israel and Hezbollah, capped by an intensified Israeli bombardment since late September and ground invasion that killed hundreds of Hezbollah members and civilians in Lebanon and sent more than 1.4 million fleeing their homes. Throughout that fighting, Israel largely refrained from striking critical infrastructure or the Lebanese armed forces, who kept to the sidelines. Israel has said its aim is to push Hezbollah away from the border to allow the return home of tens of thousands of Israelis forced to evacuate from the north since Hezbollah began firing into Israel in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. 'At the moment we are in a ceasefire, I note — a ceasefire, not the end of the war. We have a clear goal to return the residents, to rehabilitate the north,' Netanyahu said at the start of the government meeting Tuesday. 'We are enforcing this ceasefire with an iron fist, acting against any violation, minor or major,' he said. Lebanese officials have accused Israel of violating the ceasefire dozens of times with strikes, overflights of drones and demolitions of homes. When Israel has issued statements about its strikes, it says they were done because of 'hostile' actions by Hezbollah that posed a 'threat to Israeli civilians,' without specifying their nature. Tens of thousands of Lebanese who fled Israel's bombardment in the past months quickly returned to parts of the south after the ceasefire went into effect. In the southern city of Nabatiyeh, bulldozers cleared streets strewn with rubble and debris from destroyed buildings, and electricians worked on fixing power cables in an effort to restore electricity. Imad Yassin returned to find his clothing store destroyed. He hopes the state will provide compensation so he can rebuild. 'Netanyahu is trying to displace us as southern Lebanon citizens,' he said. But like many others, he had little faith Israel would abide by the ceasefire. Hussein Badreddin, a vegetable seller who also returned, said Israel was not committed to the truce. 'The Israelis are breaching the ceasefire whenever they can,' he said. Israel says that under the truce deal, it has the right to retaliate for Hezbollah violations. Speaking to reporters in Washington, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel would not discuss individual allegations of violations. 'We believe the ceasefire continues to be largely holding in place,' he said. The U.S. military announced last week that Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers alongside senior U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein will co-chair a U.S.-led committee that is supposed to monitor the ceasefire and ensure adherence to it. The committee also includes France, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL, Lebanon, and Israel. Hochstein led over a year of shuttle diplomacy to broker the ceasefire deal, and his role will be temporary until a permanent civilian co-chair is appointed. Under the deal, the Lebanese army and UNIFIL are to increase their presence in south Lebanon to ensure Hezbollah does not return. The Lebanese army, which is supported by the U.S. but has suffered severe financial strains in recent years, launched a recruitment drive Tuesday. The military currently has about 80,000 troops, with around 5,000 of them deployed in the south. ___ Abou AlJoud reported from Beirut.

Jill Biden's final foreign trip as first lady will close with her and Trump at Notre Dame cathedral	WASHINGTON (AP) — Jill Biden was departing Tuesday on her final solo foreign trip as first lady, a six-day, four-country jaunt through Italy, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar that wraps with her and President-elect Donald Trump joining other dignitaries in Paris to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame cathedral. Biden will focus throughout the trip on the issues she has championed as first lady, including support for military families, education, and research into cancer and women's health, and will also highlight U.S. partnerships in these areas with the countries hosting her, according to her office. She is the first Italian American to become first lady and has planned a side trip to her ancestral hometown of Gesso, the tiny Sicilian village where her father's family hailed from. Paris is the final stop to help celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame. The cathedral was painstakingly reconstructed after fire nearly destroyed it five years ago. Trump, who was U.S. president at the time of the fire, announced on Monday that he also will travel to the French capital to join other VIPs attending the high-security event. Jill Biden has become somewhat of a world traveler as first lady. Tuesday's trip will be her 10th solo excursion outside of the U.S.. She also has accompanied her husband, President Joe Biden, on several of his foreign trips. On her own, she has led the U.S. delegations to both the pandemic delayed Tokyo Olympics in 2021 as well as this year's Games in Paris, traveled to Ukraine shortly after the invasion by Russia, and has visited Latin America and Africa. In October, she attended the inauguration of Mexico's first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum. Biden was scheduled to depart Tuesday evening after teaching her English and writing classes at Northern Virginia Community College. She arrives Wednesday at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Catania, Italy, to meet with personnel and deliver remarks as part of Joining Forces, her White House initiative to support military families. Her father, Donald Jacobs, was a Navy signalman during World War II. The first lady then stops in Gesso, Italy, before continuing on to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, for a day's worth of events on Thursday. The schedule includes a tour of Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi as part of the Biden Cancer Moonshot program, and participation in a conversation about the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research at the Milken Institute Middle East and Africa Summit. Biden will also visit with Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, chairwoman of the General Women’s Union and the Family Development Foundation, and president of the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood, in Abu Dhabi. On Friday in Doha, Qatar, the first lady will highlight the two countries' interests in education and health with separate visits to the Qatar Foundation and Weill Cornell Medicine - Qatar, respectively. She'll also be a guest at a dinner banquet hosted by Sheikha Moza bint Nasser to celebrate the royal family wedding of Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and Sheikha Fatima bin Nasser bin Hassan Al Thani at the Al-Wajba Palace in Doha. Biden is the keynote speaker Saturday at the Doha Forum, where policy leaders discuss global challenges, before she travels to Paris for the Notre Dame reopening. She is scheduled to return to Washington on Sunday.	https://apnews.com/article/jill-biden-trump-middle-east-italy-paris-ab8715f71995812b34a25d757603ecf2	2024-12-03T07:00:35-08:00	
Trudeau to meet with Canadian opposition leaders to discuss US relations after Trump tariff threat	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will have a meeting with all opposition leaders to discuss U.S.-Canada relations after President-elect Donald Trump threatened sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products. A source familiar with the matter said the meeting will happen early Wednesday afternoon. The person spoke on condition of anonymity they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Trudeau successfully employed a 'Team Canada' approach during Trump's first term in office when the free trade deal between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico was renegotiated. But Trudeau's minority government is in a much weaker position politically now and faces an election within a year. 'I would appeal to the opposition leaders, if you look at the history of Canada, we have always stood together when it comes to talking with one voice to the world,' Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said. 'The current leader of the opposition should learn from history. The best way to promote Canada’s interest, our workers and our industry, is to speak with one voice.' Trudeau returned home after a dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Friday without assurances the president-elect would back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner. The Republican president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. Trump called Friday's talks 'productive' but signaled no retreat from his pledge to enact the tariffs as one of his first executive orders when he takes office in January. Canada, which says Trump is unfairly lumping it in with Mexico, is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. During Trump’s first term, his move to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA, and reports that he was considering a 25% tariff on the auto sector were considered an existential threat in Canada. Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to Washington, told The Associated Press on Sunday that Trudeau was successful in getting Trump and key Cabinet nominees to understand that there is no comparison between the Canada-U.S. border and Mexico-U.S. border. Hillman, who sat at an adjacent table to Trudeau and Trump, said Canada is ready to make new investments in border security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers. The flows of migrants and seizures of drugs are vastly different. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with irregular migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing for national security.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-tariffs-trudeau-trade-opposition-border-5d3dbbb4a701bb1676ee588bfbf2396a	2024-12-03T06:26:35-08:00	
France’s government looks on the brink of collapse. What’s next?	PARIS (AP) — France’s minority government looks in its final hours as opposition lawmakers from the left and the far right vowed to topple Prime Minister Michel Barnier’s Cabinet. A no-confidence vote is scheduled Wednesday at parliament in the wake of a divisive budget debate, with a great chance of being successful. If the motion passes, Barnier's Cabinet would be the shortest-lived government in France's modern history, marking an unprecedented period of political instability. President Emmanuel Macron would be in charge of appointing a new prime minister. Why is the situation so volatile? Following the June-July parliamentary elections, the National Assembly, France’s powerful lower house of parliament, is divided into three major blocs: a left-wing coalition known as the New Popular Front, Macron’s centrist allies and the far-right National Rally party. None of them won an outright majority. In September, Macron asked Barnier, a conservative, to form a government dominated by Republicans and centrists — implicitly relying on the far right's goodwill to be able to stay in power. However, far-right leader Marine Le Pen now says her party will vote for bringing the government down, accusing Barnier of ignoring her demands. Meanwhile, the leftwing coalition denounces an 'austerity budget' and criticizes 'the absence of dialogue and disregard for parliamentary work.' A no-confidence motion requires at least half the votes at the National Assembly, that is 289 out of 577, to pass. Altogether, the left and the far right count over 330 lawmakers — yet some of them may abstain from voting. What if the government falls? Wednesday could see the first no-confidence motion succeed in over six decades. If the government falls, Macron could ask outgoing ministers to handle current affairs pending the appointment of a new prime minister. The parliament's fractured composition would remain the same. No new legislative elections can be held before July, because under the French Constitution, the National Assembly must remain in place for a minimum of one year. No favorite figure to replace Barnier has emerged yet. Macron could pick a politician from his centrist alliance, French media report. The New Popular Front asks for a left-wing Cabinet to be appointed instead. Some opposition lawmakers are calling for Macron to resign, but the French president has previously ruled out that option. How about the budget? France is at no risk of a government shutdown that in the United States would disrupt many services and squeeze federal employees. An outgoing government could present a special law to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year's rules. It would also be able to decide on renewing spending by decree in order to pay civil servants, pensions and other key government expenses. However, this would suspend any potential tax hike — like one initially expected on big companies — and freeze any new spending. In particular, an additional 3.3 billion euro ($3.5 billion) package for the French military was planned as the country supports Ukraine in its war against Russia. Later on, a new government could present its own budget proposals at parliament. Why are markets spooked? In a last-ditch effort to save his government, Barnier warned of ' a big storm and very serious turbulence on the financial markets.' France is under pressure from the European Union’s executive body to reduce its colossal debt. The country’s deficit is estimated to reach 6% of Gross Domestic Product this year and analysts say it could rise to 7% next year without drastic adjustments. The political instability could push up French interest rates, digging the debt even further. In addition, without a clear parliamentary majority, no major reform appears within the reach of a new government.	https://apnews.com/article/france-government-crisis-no-confidence-26555d5c435340bd97f422942f258a0e	2024-12-03T05:55:52-08:00	
Joe Biden's pardon of his son Hunter spurs broader discussion on who else should be granted clemency	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden's decision to break his word and pardon his son Hunter has spurred a broader discussion about what else he should be doing with the broad clemency powers of the presidency before he leaves office in January, including whether he should be pardoning Donald Trump. Biden on Tuesday ducked questions about his son, ignoring calls for him to explain his reversal as he was making his first presidential trip to Angola. He dismissed shouted questions about the matter with a laugh during a meeting with Angolan President João Lourenço at the presidential palace, telling the Angolan delegation: 'Welcome to America.' Biden was not scheduled to take questions from the press during his trip to Africa, and he has largely avoided interactions with reporters since President-elect Trump’s victory last month. Biden’s decision to offer his son a blanket pardon for actions over the past 11 years has sparked a political uproar in Washington, after the president repeatedly had said he would not use his extraordinary powers for the benefit of his family. Biden claimed that the Justice Department had presided over a 'miscarriage of justice' in prosecuting his son, using some of the same language that Trump uses to describe his own legal predicaments. Biden's reversal drew criticism from many Democrats, who are working to calibrate their approach to Trump as he prepares to take over the Oval Office in seven weeks. There is concern the pardon — and Biden's claims that his son was prosecuted for political reasons — will erode their ability to push back on the incoming president’s legal moves. And it has threatened to cloud Biden's legacy as he prepares to leave office on Jan. 20. Hunter Biden is the closest presidential relative ever to be granted clemency, but other leaders have pardoned family members and close friends. Bill Clinton pardoned his brother Roger for drug charges after Roger Clinton had served his sentence. By the time Trump left office after his first term, he had issued 144 pardons, which included Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in law, Jared Kushner. He also pardoned fervent supporters Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn and other people convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. In the months after the 2020 election, Trump and his allies were trying to overturn his loss, a failed effort that culminated in the violent riot by his supporters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. There were discussions at the time over whether Trump would preemptively pardon some of those involved in the effort — and maybe even himself — before he left office. But that never happened. Now, Democrats are having similar discussions about preemptive pardons on their side because of Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail. He's made no secret of his desire to seek revenge on those who prosecuted him or crossed him. He talks about 'enemies from within.' He's circulated social media posts that call for the jailing of Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, former Vice President Mike Pence and Sens. Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. He's also taken aim at Liz Cheney, a conservative Republican who campaigned for Harris, promoting a social media post that suggested he wanted military tribunals to punish her because she was guilty of treason. Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said last week on Boston Public Radio that Biden might consider broad pardons to protect people against whatever wrath Trump may seek, but also as a way to move the country past this acrimonious and divided time. 'I think that without question, Trump is going to try to act in a dictatorial way, in a fascistic way, in a revengeful first year at least of his administration toward individuals who he believes harmed him,' Markey said. Presidents enjoy expansive pardon powers when it comes to federal crimes. That includes granting clemency to people who have not yet been charged, as President Gerald Ford did in 1974 when he pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, over the Watergate scandal. The decision at the time caused an uproar but has been seen in the ensuing decades as a move that helped restore order. Markey cited Ford's pardon as a way for the country 'just to close that chapter and move on to a new era.' Biden could do the same, Markey said, to help the country move on 'to an agenda that deals with the ordinary families.' Sen. Joe Manchin, the Democrat-turned-independent from West Virginia, took it a step further and suggested Biden should even pardon Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, federal charges that are now evaporating with Trump's upcoming return to the White House. 'Why don't you go ahead and pardon Donald Trump for all his charges?' he said in an interview with CNN. 'It would have gone down a lot more balanced. I'm just saying, wipe them out.' At the same time, Democratic lawmakers and criminal justice reformers are pushing Biden to grant pardons to broad groups of Americans. Democrats Ayanna Pressley, Jim Clyburn and Mary Gay Scanlon wrote to Biden on Nov. 20, asking him to use his clemency powers to 'address longstanding injustices in our legal system, and set our nation on the path toward ending mass incarceration.' The letter, also signed by 61 others, suggested Biden could use his powers to send a powerful message of criminal justice reform and 'rectify unjust and unnecessary criminal laws passed by Congress and draconian sentences given by judges.' 'We encourage you to use your clemency powers to help broad classes of people and cases, including the elderly and chronically ill, those on death row, people with unjustified sentencing disparities, and women who were punished for defending themselves against their abusers,' they wrote. So far, Biden has pardoned 25 people. Most presidents tend to grant a flurry of clemency requests at the end of their terms, and it's likely Biden will do the same. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has said Biden is 'thinking through that process very thoroughly.' ___ Weissert reported from Luanda, Angola.	https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-hunter-pardon-president-trump-e2d0ce366c6980cd31c6717edbc9938a	2024-12-03T05:33:56-08:00	
South Korean president declares martial law, accusing opposition of anti-state activity	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law Tuesday vowing to eliminate 'anti-state' forces as he struggles against an opposition that controls the country’s parliament and which he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea. The surprising move harkens back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s, and was immediately denounced by the opposition and by the leader of Yoon’s own conservative party. Following Yoon's announcement, South Korea's military proclaimed that parliament and other political gatherings that could cause 'social confusion' would be suspended, according to the government-funded Yonhap news agency. The military also said that the country's striking doctors should return to work within 48 hours, Yonhap said. Thousands of doctors have been striking for months over government plans to expand the number of students at medical schools. It wasn’t immediately clear how long Yoon's martial law declaration could stand. Under South Korean law, martial law can be lifted with a majority vote in the parliament, where the opposition Democratic Party holds a majority. TV footage showed police officers blocking the entrance of the National Assembly. The leader of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, Han Dong-hoon, called the decision to impose martial law 'wrong' and vowed to 'stop it with the people.' Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon’s announcement 'illegal and unconstitutional.' Yoon said during a televised speech that martial law would help 'rebuild and protect' the country from 'falling into the depths of national ruin.' He said he would 'eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.' 'I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,' he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate 'some inconveniences.' Yoon — whose approval rating has dipped in recent months — has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022. Yoon’s party has been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition over next year’s budget bill. The opposition has also been attempting to pass motions to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations of Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls. Yoon has also been dismissing calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals. The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon’s announcement. Yoon's move is the first declaration of martial law since the country's democratization in 1987. The country's last previous martial law was in October 1979.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-997c22ac93f6a9bece68454597e577c1	2024-12-03T04:40:05-08:00	
The G20 has 'shock absorbers' to deal with Trump's return as US president, South Africa says	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — The Group of 20 has sufficient 'shock absorbers' to function effectively if the incoming Donald Trump administration promotes an America First policy at the expense of international cooperation, South Africa's leader said Tuesday as his country took over the bloc's presidency. South Africa assumed the rotational leadership of the group of the world's leading economies on Sunday from Brazil and will hand it over to the United States at the end of 2025. Those three countries will work together over the next 12 months as per the G20 protocol. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said he would elevate the impact of climate change on developing countries during South Africa's G20 presidency — the first by an African nation. U.S. President-elect Trump has shown his disdain for international cooperation on climate issues. 'We will seek to get sufficient consensus on decisions that need to be taken by the G20,' Ramaphosa said when asked if the G20 was prepared for a likely Trump America First approach in his second administration, which starts on Jan. 20. 'I think there will be sufficient shock absorbers that will be put in place that will enable the G20 to continue to function. ... We are advancing the interests of the people of the world.' Trump has given an indication that his foreign policy will be combative. He has pledged to impose new tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, while he also threatened this weekend 100% tariffs against nations in the BRICS bloc of developing nations, which include Brazil, Russia, China, India, South Africa and others. Trump wrote on social media site X that those countries should expect to 'wave goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy' if they pursue a policy of looking to move away from the U.S. dollar for international trade. BRICS countries have said they want to be less dependent on the dollar, but the group has taken little concrete action and analysts say it's unfeasible given the dollar's dominance. Ramaphosa said Tuesday he had reached out to the U.S. president-elect to congratulate him on his election victory and to tempt golf-loving Trump to make a state visit to South Africa to see its 'beautiful golf courses.' He said he also hoped Trump would travel for the G20 summit in South Africa in late 2025. 'If he has time, and he is very busy ... President Trump and possibly myself can go and play golf and talk about global matters,' Ramaphosa said. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-ramaphosa-trump-g20-e207bdef469c8bc0df5b2123fb4f7638	2024-12-03T04:17:02-08:00	
Middle East Latest: Israeli minister warns of wider strikes on Lebanon if ceasefire collapses	Israel’s defense minister warned that if the shaky ceasefire with Hezbollah collapses, Israel will widen its strikes and target the Lebanese state itself. He spoke the day after Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes that killed nearly a dozen people in Lebanon. Those strikes came after the Lebanese militant group fired a volley of projectiles as a warning over what it said were previous Israeli ceasefire violations. Speaking to troops on the northern border Tuesday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said any violations of the agreement would be met with 'a maximum response and zero tolerance.' He said if the war resumes, Israel will widen its strikes beyond the areas where Hezbollah’s activities are concentrated, and 'there will no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon.' Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel last year in solidarity with Hamas militants who are fighting in the Gaza Strip. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Israel’s blistering retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,502 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war in Gaza has destroyed vast areas of the coastal enclave and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. ——— Here's the Latest: Germany arrests a Lebanese man accused of being a member of Hezbollah BERLIN — German authorities have arrested a Lebanese man accused of being a member of Hezbollah and working for groups controlled by the militant organization in Germany. Federal prosecutors said the suspect, identified only as Fadel R. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested in the Hannover region on Tuesday. The man is suspected of membership in a foreign terrorist organization and is not accused of direct involvement in any violence. Prosecutors said he joined Hezbollah in the summer of 2008 or earlier and took part in leadership training courses in Lebanon. From 2009, he allegedly had leadership duties in two groups controlled by Hezbollah in the Hannover area, organizing appearances by preachers close to the militants. According to prosecutors, he was briefly a correspondent for a Hezbollah media outlet in 2017 and was tasked with coordinating building work at a mosque. Germany is a staunch ally of Israel. It is also home to a Lebanese immigrant community of more than 100,000. Lebanese army launches recruitment drive to bolster presence in the south BEIRUT - The Lebanese army is looking for more recruits as it beefs up its presence in southern Lebanon after the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire. Lebanon’s army is a respected national institution that kept to the sidelines during the nearly 14-month conflict. During an initial 60-day truce, thousands of Lebanese troops are supposed to deploy in southern Lebanon, where U.N. peacekeepers also have a presence. Hezbollah militants are to pull back from areas near the border as Israel withdraws its ground forces. The army said those interested in joining up have a one-month period to apply, starting Tuesday. The Lebanese army has about 80,000 troops, with around 5,000 of them deployed in the south. Drone strike hits car in Damascus, Syrian news agency says DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s state news agency says a drone strike hit a car in a suburb of the capital, Damascus, killing one person. The agency did not give further details or say who was killed. It said the attack occurred Tuesday on the road leading to the Damascus International Airport south of the city. The area is known to be home to members of Iran-backed militant groups. Israel is believed to have carried out a number of strikes in the area in recent months as it has battled Iran-backed Hezbollah in neighboring Lebanon. Israeli officials rarely acknowledge such strikes. Israel warns the Lebanese state over ceasefire JERUSALEM — Israel’s defense minister warned that if the shaky ceasefire with Hezbollah collapses, Israel will widen its strikes and target the Lebanese state itself. He spoke the day after Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes that killed nearly a dozen people. Those strikes came after the Lebanese militant group fired a volley of projectiles as a warning over what it said were previous Israeli violations. Speaking to troops on the northern border Tuesday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said any violations of the agreement would be met with 'a maximum response and zero tolerance.' He said if the war resumes, Israel will widen its strikes beyond the areas where Hezbollah’s activities are concentrated, and 'there will no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon.' During the 14-month conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which came to an end last week with a ceasefire brokered by the United States and France, Israel largely refrained from striking critical infrastructure or the Lebanese armed forces, who kept to the sidelines. When Israeli strikes killed or wounded Lebanese soldiers, the Israeli military said it was accidental. The ceasefire agreement that took effect last week gives 60 days for Israel to withdraw its forces from Lebanon and for Hezbollah militants to relocate north of the Litani River. The buffer zone is to be patrolled by Lebanese armed forces and U.N. peacekeepers. Israel has carried out multiple strikes in recent days in response to what it says are violations by Hezbollah. Lebanon’s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, accused Israel of violating the truce more than 50 times in recent days by launching airstrikes, demolishing homes near the border and violating Lebanon’s airspace. Berri, a Hezbollah ally, had helped mediate the ceasefire. Israeli airstrike in northern West Bank kills two Palestinians JERUSALEM — Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike in the northern West Bank has killed two Palestinians. Israel’s military said it struck a militant cell near the town of Al-Aqaba, in the Jordan Valley. It did not immediately give more details. The Palestinian Health Ministry confirmed the two deaths and said a third person was moderately wounded. About 800 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. Israel has carried out near-daily military raids in the West Bank that it says are aimed at preventing attacks on Israelis, which have also been on the rise. Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for an independent state. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon reappears after pager attack BEIRUT — Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon made his first public appearance in Beirut since he was wounded in an attack involving exploding pagers in mid-September. Mojtaba Amani, who returned to Lebanon over the weekend after undergoing treatment in Iran, visited on Tuesday the scene south of Beirut where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sept. 27. Speaking about the airstrike that destroyed six buildings and killed Nasrallah and others, Amani said Israel should get for its act 'the highest medal for sabotage, terrorism, blood and killing civilians.' Amani suffered serious injuries in his face and hands when a pager he was holding exploded in mid-September. The device was one of about 3,000 pagers that exploded simultaneously, killing and wounding many Hezbollah members. A day after the pager attack, a similar attack struck walkie-talkies. In total, the explosions killed at least 37 people and wounded more than 3,000, many of them civilians. Last month, a spokesperson for the office of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the pager attack was approved by Netanyahu.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-latest-3-december-2024-38090332748a5a5bb3648a728cb6b4ae	2024-12-03T02:26:00-08:00	
Syrian insurgents capture four central towns as government forces reclaim some territory	BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian insurgents captured four new towns early Tuesday, bringing them closer to the central city of Hama, opposition activists said, while government forces retook some territory they lost last week. The capture of the towns is the latest in the push by insurgents led by the salafi jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, as well as Turkey-backed opposition fighters. Insurgents now are about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Hama, the country’s fourth largest city. The latest push is part of a wide offensive by forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad that over the past days has captured large parts of the northern city of Aleppo, Syria’s largest, as well as towns and villages in southern parts of the northwestern Idlib province. The insurgents’ military operations administration said gunmen killed 50 government forces as they captured the central towns of Halfaya, Taybat al-Imam, Maardis and Soran. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, confirmed that the towns were taken. The pro-government Dama Post media outlet reported intense clashes in an around the towns, adding that Syrian troops are firing artillery shells at insurgents in the area. State media reported intense airstrikes by Syrian and Russian air forces in the area. Both the Observatory and pro-government media outlets reported that Syrian government forces on Tuesday captured the village of Khanaser, days after losing it. Khanaser sits on one of the roads that lead to Aleppo. The long war between Assad and his foreign backers and the array of armed opposition forces seeking his overthrow has killed an estimated half-million people over the past 13 years. To the east, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement that they captured seven villages from pro-government fighters. Syrian state media, however, denied that the villages were captured by the U.S.-backed SDF saying that the attack was repelled. The villages are close to a base housing U.S. troops in the area that is close to Iraq. Also Tuesday, Hakan Fidan, the foreign minister of Turkey, which is a main backer of groups opposed to Assad, said the recent rapid advance by insurgents in Syria shows that the Syrian president must reconcile with his own people and hold talks with the opposition. Assad and officials in his government say all armed groups in opposition-held parts of Syria are terrorists and has rejected any political solution with them. Turkey has been seeking to normalize ties with Syria to address security threats from groups affiliated with Kurdish militants along its southern border and to help ensure the safe return of more than 3 million Syrian refugees. Assad has insisted that Turkey's withdrawal of its military forces from northern Syria be a condition for any normalization between the two countries.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-hama-aleppo-idlib-sdf-assad-hts-f30e9aa6025fd81bc9aeb771ab39c625	2024-12-03T01:40:08-08:00	
China bans exports to US of gallium, germanium, antimony in response to chip sanctions	BANGKOK (AP) — China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports. The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after the Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications. The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology. China's Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof. 'China has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese companies, and malicious suppression of China’s technological progress,' Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine briefing Tuesday. 'I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction against Chinese companies,' Lin said. The minerals sourced in China are used in computer chips, cars and other products China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite. Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report. The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials. China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology. China says it's protecting itself from US trade restrictions After the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a so-called 'entity list' subject to strict export controls, China’s Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China’s 'rights and interests.' Nearly all of the companies affected by Washington's latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security. China's government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China’s fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology. Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, 'abuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.' 'Such behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,' it said in a statement. The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies. 'U.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China’s related industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,' it said. The U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year. The U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources. The export restrictions have had a mixed impact on prices for those critical minerals, with the price of antimony more than doubling this year to over $25,000 per ton. Prices for gallium, germanium and graphite also have mostly risen. ___ AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tech-semiconductor-chip-gallium-6b4216551e200fb719caa6a6cc67e2a4	2024-12-03T01:23:48-08:00	
Hamas and Fatah are near an agreement on who will oversee postwar Gaza	CAIRO (AP) — Palestinian officials say Fatah and Hamas are closing in on an agreement to appoint a committee of politically independent technocrats to administer the Gaza Strip after the war. It would effectively end Hamas' rule and could help advance ceasefire talks with Israel. The rival factions have made several failed attempts to reconcile since Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007. Israel has meanwhile ruled out any postwar role in Gaza for either Hamas or Fatah, which dominates the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. A Palestinian Authority official on Tuesday confirmed that a preliminary agreement had been reached following weeks of negotiations in Cairo. The official said the committee would have 12-15 members, most of them from Gaza. It would report to the Palestinian Authority, which is headquartered in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and work with local and international parties to facilitate humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. A Hamas official said that Hamas and Fatah had agreed on the general terms but were still negotiating over some details and the individuals who would serve on the committee. The official said an agreement would be announced after a meeting of all Palestinian factions in Cairo, without providing a timeline. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the talks. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas is dismantled and scores of hostages are returned. He says Israel will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza, with civilian affairs administered by local Palestinians unaffiliated with the Palestinian Authority or Hamas. No Palestinians have publicly volunteered for such a role, and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with the Israeli military. The United States has called for a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern both the West Bank and Gaza ahead of eventual statehood. The Israeli government, which is opposed to Palestinian statehood, is reportedly discussing a postwar plan with the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 and backs a rival Fatah faction. The Hamas official said the emerging Palestinian agreement would fulfill one of Israel’s war goals by ending Hamas’ rule in Gaza. It’s unclear if Israeli officials would see it that way. The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied West Bank, recognizes Israel and cooperates with it on security matters, a policy that is deeply unpopular among Palestinians, many of whom view it as a subcontractor of the occupation. Israel says the authority has not done enough to combat militancy or curb incitement. The committee would assume its responsibilities after a ceasefire agreement with Israel, the Hamas official said. American and Arab mediators have spent nearly a year trying to broker such an agreement, but the negotiations have repeatedly stalled. Hamas ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages remain inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of the dead were combatants. The offensive has leveled much of the coastal territory and displaced the vast majority of its 2.3 million residents. ___ Federman reported from Jerusalem. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-fatah-hamas-postwar-gaza-acc4da6042ed030f65d0cd0745b82217	2024-12-03T00:08:42-08:00	
Five things you probably didn't know about Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris	PARIS (AP) — Notre Dame Cathedral, which is set to reopen to the public on Sunday after a five-year restoration following a devastating fire, stands as a jewel of Gothic architecture, a symbol of Paris and a tourist mecca. But behind the grandeur of the cathedral, which took 182 years to build between the 12th and 14th centuries, lie some surprising stories. From medieval myths to modern-day mysteries, here are five special things to know about this Paris landmark: The heart of France, literally Notre Dame’s importance goes beyond its architecture and history — it’s literally the point from which all roads in France begin. In front of the cathedral, embedded in the cobblestones, lies a modest bronze-and-stone slab with the inscription 'point zéro des routes de France,' meaning 'starting point of the roads of France.'' This plaque marks the starting point for measuring distances between Paris and other cities across the country. While the plaque was installed in 1924, the idea of a national 'ground zero' dates to 1769. King Louis XV envisioned a central reference for France’s growing network of roads, a concept that tied the nation’s geography to its heart in Paris. The great gargoyle myth Those scary stone creatures on Notre Dame might seem ancient, but not all of them are what they appear. The actual gargoyles, which are monster-shaped gutters used to drain rainwater, have been around since the time of the cathedral’s construction. But the dramatic, monster-like figures often depicted on postcards and movies are chimera, and they’re much newer. In the 19th century, the architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, who was in charge of renovating the then-decaying building, added these creatures to add to the mystique of the cathedral. Viollet-le-Duc drew inspiration from Victor Hugo’s famous book ‘’The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' to create these demonic animal figures with personified expressions. How to tell them apart? Gargoyles resemble horizontal spikes coming out of the facade and have holes in their spouts to allow water to drain. A revolutionary makeover During the French Revolution, which saw waves of protest against the Church, Notre Dame wasn’t exactly treated like a revered cathedral. In 1793, revolutionaries stripped it of its religious symbols and renamed it 'Notre-Dame de la Raison' (Our Lady of Reason). Instead, the cathedral hosted festivals celebrating science and Enlightenment ideas, and for a short time, it was even used as a wine warehouse. Religious services resumed in 1795, and Notre Dame regained its sacred status on the impulse of French emperor Napoleon I, who held his coronation there in 1804, immortalized in a famous painting by Jacques-Louis David. The beheaded kings who returned centuries later In 1792, revolutionaries also decapitated 28 statues from Notre Dame’s facade, mistaking them for French monarchs. They were actually ancient kings of Judah, biblical ancestors of Jesus. The heads were thought lost forever, possibly destroyed or sold as building materials. But in 1977, workers renovating a courtyard in Paris’ 9th arrondissement uncovered hundreds of fragments of stone sculptures. Experts confirmed they were the missing heads of Notre Dame’s kings. How they ended up buried there remains a mystery. Today, 22 of the heads have been restored and are displayed at the Cluny Museum in Paris. Their discovery is considered one of the most remarkable archaeological finds in the city’s modern history. A fiery wake-up call on lead dust The 2019 fire that almost destroyed Notre Dame revealed a serious health risk. When the flames melted the roof, tons of toxic lead dust were released into the air and settled across Paris. The problem? Authorities discovered there were no rules to measure the danger of outdoor lead dust. This wasn’t just a Paris issue — major cities like London and Rome, and even the World Health Organization, don’t have guidelines for outdoor lead pollution. The Notre Dame fire highlighted a hidden problem, forcing officials to take a closer look at their safety standards. It took four months for the city to complete a deep-clean operation of the sidewalks even as tourists, residents and merchants walked streets around the cathedral daily. ___ For more of AP’s coverage on Notre Dame, visit https://apnews.com/hub/notre-dame-cathedral	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-cathedral-reopens-paris-192a2c5f4a8ded6e29ac2ff8660e04f4	2024-12-02T21:32:39-08:00	
Death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan upheld in Vietnam's largest fraud case	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — The death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan was upheld Tuesday in Vietnam's largest fraud case, the scale of which had raised concerns about the country's economy. She had been convicted in April of embezzlement and bribery over the fraud amounting to $12.5 billion, nearly 3% of Vietnam’s 2022 GDP. As chairperson of the Van Thinh Phat real estate firm, Lan illegally controlled Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank between 2012 and 2022 and allowed 2,500 loans that cost the bank $27 billion in losses. The court in Ho Chi Minh rejected her appeal against the conviction while adding that her death sentence could be commuted to life if she reimburses three-fourth of the losses, VN Express reported. The court said her violations had negatively impacted banking, caused public disorder and eroded people’s trust, the state media outlet said. Her arrest was among the most high-profile in an anti-corruption drive in Vietnam that intensified after 2022. The Blazing Furnace campaign touched the highest echelons of Vietnamese politics. But the scale of her fraud shocked the nation with analysts raising questions about whether other banks or businesses had similarly erred. This dampened Vietnam’s economic outlook and made foreign investors jittery at a time when Vietnam has been trying to position itself as a home for businesses pivoting their supply chains away from China. Lan, 67, and her family had set up the Van Thing Phat company in 1992 after Vietnam shed its state-run economy in favor of a more market-oriented approach open to foreigners. The company grew into one of Vietnam’s richest real estate firms, with luxury residential buildings, offices, hotels and shopping centers. This made her a key player in the country’s financial industry. She orchestrated the 2011 merger of the beleaguered SCB bank with two other lenders in coordination with Vietnam’s central bank. The court said that she used this to tap SCB for cash and, according to government documents, owned more than 90% of the bank while approving thousands of loans to 'ghost companies.' These loans, according to state media, found their way to her and she bribed officials to cover her tracks. The scale of the crime meant the case was split into two trials, and Lan was sentenced to another life sentence in October. At that trial, she was accused of raising $1.2 billion from nearly 36,000 investors by issuing bonds illegally through four companies, state media reported. She was also found guilty of siphoning off $18 billion obtained through fraud and for using companies controlled by her to illegally transfer more than $4.5 billion in and out of Vietnam between 2012 and 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-truong-my-lan-death-sentence-a51f557f092de27163b7c2baf1f803b4	2024-12-02T21:09:36-08:00	
US expands list of Chinese technology companies under export controls	BANGKOK (AP) — The U.S. Commerce Department has expanded the list of Chinese technology companies subject to export controls to include many that make equipment used to make computer chips, chipmaking tools and software. The 140 companies newly included in the so-called 'entity list' are nearly all based in China. But some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore. The revised rules were posted Monday on the website of the U.S. Federal Register for publication later this week. They also limit exports of high-bandwidth memory chips to China. Such chips are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence. China’s Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect its 'rights and interests,' without giving any details. 'This is a typical act of economic coercion and non-market practice,' the ministry said in a statement. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the move was intended to impair China's ability to use advanced technologies that 'pose a risk to our national security.' The addition of the companies to the 'entity list' means that export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with them. Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls, as the administration of President Joe Biden has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. 'The purpose of these Entity List actions is to stop PRC (Chinese) companies from leveraging U.S. technology to indigenously produce advanced semiconductors,' Matthew S. Axelrod, the assistant secretary for export enforcement, said in a statement. 'By adding key semiconductor fabrication facilities, equipment manufacturers, and investment companies to the Entity List, we are directly impeding the PRC’s military modernization, WMD (weapons of mass destruction) programs, and ability to repress human rights.' China has accused the U.S. of pursuing 'technology hegemony,' as Washington steps up pressure on Chinese tech giant Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers of advanced technology by blocking access to American suppliers. It particularly objects to what it calls 'long-arm jurisdiction' moves such as the U.S. decision to extend export controls to companies to apply to chip-making equipment makers in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore if they use any U.S. technology that might be sold to China. Pressure from Washington has spurred China to step up its efforts to develop its own advanced computer chips and other technologies, providing billions in subsidies and investments for the industry. Chinese manufacturers have made quick progress even though they remain years behind in some areas. Shares in Japanese computer chip makers and makers of related equipment surged Tuesday, with testing equipment maker Advantest surging 4.6%, Tokyo Electron gaining 4.6% and Applied Materials up 4.9%. Disco Corp., another chipmaker, jumped 6.9%, while the Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index gained 2.3%. Meanwhile, China's Naura Technology Group, whose companies were included in the new list, fell 3% and Piotech Inc., another chipmaker, lost 5.3%.	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-technology-chips-sanctions-bis-8f8ab1ab49b5bb57e5a290a3937fa939	2024-12-02T20:57:21-08:00	
Thanks to peace, two unexpected words are echoing across Afghanistan's capital: Luxury housing	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — In a town that has been through it all and is clawing its way back, a man named Omidullah is looking to hit paydirt. The Kabul real estate agent is selling a nine-bedroom, nine-bath, white-and-gold villa in the Afghan capital. On the roof's gable, glittering Arabic script tempts buyers and brokers with the word 'mashallah' — 'God has willed it.' The villa is listed at $450,000, a startling number in a country where more than half of the population relies on humanitarian aid to survive, most Afghans don’t have bank accounts, and mortgages are rare. Yet the offers are coming in. 'It’s a myth that Afghans don’t have money,' Omidullah said. 'We have very big businessmen who have big businesses abroad. There are houses here worth millions of dollars.' In Kabul, a curious thing is happening to fuel the high-end real estate market. Peace, it seems, is driving up property prices. Many are coming home People who spent years living and working abroad are returning home, keen to take advantage of the country’s much-improved security and stability after decades of war, destruction and infrastructure decay. They include Afghans escaping deportation campaigns in Iran and Pakistan who are taking their cash with them. Mortgages are rare because banks don’t have the deposits to facilitate lending. Afghans buy in cash or use the 'geerawi option' — when someone provides a fixed sum to a landlord in return for living on his property and staying there until the landlord returns the money. People were afraid to invest in Kabul before the Taliban takeover, according to another real estate agent, Ghulam Mohammed Haqdoost. But the country’s rulers have created better conditions for the property market in more ways than one. The city is less violent since the Taliban transitioned from insurgency to authority and foreign forces withdrew, although armored vehicles, checkpoints and militarized compounds remain common sights. The Taliban, sticklers for an intricate bureaucracy, have pledged to stamp out corruption and regulate legal and commercial matters. That means no more dealing with warlords or bribing local officials for land purchases or construction projects. Haqdoost is happy with how easily and quickly things are getting done under the new administration. 'House prices have risen by almost 40%,' he said. 'In the last three years, we have sold almost 400 properties. It wasn’t like that before.' For builders, times are good Business is good for Haqdoost, who employs 200 people in administration, including women who deal exclusively with female customers, and then some 1,000 in the construction arm of his company. He said most customers bring their wives along to viewings. That's because it’s women who call the shots when it comes to real estate purchases — even in a nation that critics say oppresses and disempowers women. 'The power and authority of the house is in the hands of the women,' Haqdoost said. 'They decide whether to buy the house or not.' Omidullah and Haqdoost said their clients want a garden, gym, sauna, swimming pool, guest quarters and at least one kitchen. Hospitality is a major part of Afghan culture and this tradition is built into housing. Afghans typically accommodate and host visiting friends or family in their homes, rather than in hotels or restaurants. Haqdoost’s client base is mostly overseas, and their international tastes are influencing interiors. They want novelties like dining tables and beds. In Afghanistan, it’s the norm for people to sleep and eat on the floor. It’s also the diaspora seeking out purpose-built apartment blocks offering amenities like central heating, double-pane windows and elevators. To make the city more attractive and livable, the municipal authority is busy building and repairing roads, installing streetlights, planting trees and removing trash. It’s also developing plans to promote affordable housing and encourage home ownership. It needs to. Kabul’s population was around 500,000 at the start of the millennium. Now it is more than 5 million. Some neighborhoods remain congested and noisy as a result, despite the municipality’s best beautification efforts. An oasis outside the Afghan capital? Those who can afford it head just outside the city. There, on the edge of Qargha Reservoir, sit some of Kabul’s most elaborate and expensive homes. One resembles an ornate mosque. Another evokes a Bond villain’s lair with its stark design and protrusion from the hills. Locals say it belongs to a wealthy Turkish magnate who comes and goes. They don’t give his name. This cluster of landscaped gardens and decorative terraces looks out onto the lake, one of the capital’s best-loved beauty spots. Since the Taliban came to power, it’s mostly a men-only area. Women stop for breaks with their families, but they tend not to linger because Vice and Virtue Ministry officials staff one of the checkpoints that encircle the body of water. Arash Asad is trying to sell his uncle’s property, which sits on around 4,000 square meters (43,000 square feet) of land. It has unobstructed views across the reservoir and to the Paghman Mountains at the foot of the Hindu Kush Himalaya. The asking price: $800,000. There are outbuildings to one side and a living area in the center of the plot topped off with a bright blue roof. The property is mostly rows of flowers and cherry trees. There are some cranes. The birds are included. 'Gardens are very important to Afghans,' Asad said. 'Many of them come from villages. When they move to cities, they want to have that reminder of their past because it stays with them.' Inside the glass-walled living area sits his uncle, gazing out at the water. Asad's family would prefer to have the property turned into a business rather than sell it. But the real estate broker fields numerous calls and messages during the 30-minute drive from central Kabul. Pictures of the property on social media have sparked a lot of interest. 'People think this country has no jobs and no economy,' Asad said. Outside the car, the sun dips over the reservoir and cars full of men head to the lakeside. 'But Afghans have made their money, illegally or legally, over the years. You wouldn’t believe it.'	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-real-estate-taliban-luxury-market-06cb2e2386a8fe1b24c416b0bd2bad92	2024-12-02T20:13:40-08:00	
In Angola, Biden plans to tout US investments and visit a slavery museum	LUANDA, Angola (AP) — Joe Biden is using the first visit to Angola by a U.S. president to promote Washington's hefty modern investments in the sub-Saharan Africa nation and to see a slavery museum where he'll acknowledge how the trafficking of human beings once linked the two nations' economies. A centerpiece of his trip is showcasing the U.S. commitment of $3 billion to the Lobito Corridor, a railway redevelopment linking Zambia, Congo and Angola that is meant to make it far easier to move raw materials around the continent and for export. The project also has drawn financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks. The project aims to advance the U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies and to counter China's heavy investments in mining and processing African minerals. The U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer) railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China’s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy in Africa and other parts of the world. Biden is set to fly to the Angolan port city of Lobito on Wednesday for a firsthand look at the corridor. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the Biden administration 'has absolutely transformed' U.S.-Africa relations and that the corridor's full completion is 'going to take years but there’s already been a lot of work put in.' That means much of it may fall to Biden's successor, Republican Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. Asked whether the project could proceed without future support from Trump, Kirby said it was 'our fervent hope that as the new team comes in and takes a look at this that they see the value too, that they see how it will help drive a more secure, more prosperous, more economically stable continent.' Kirby, speaking aboard Air Force One as Biden flew to Angola, said that the corridor was about more than simply Washington trying to outpace Beijing geopolitically. 'I would say there is no cold war on the continent. We’re not asking countries to choose between us and Russia and China. We’re simply looking for reliable, sustainable, verifiable investment opportunities that the people of Angola and the people of the continent can rely on,' he said. 'Too many countries have relied on spotty investment opportunities and are now wracked by debt.' The last U.S. president to visit sub-Saharan Africa was Barack Obama in 2015. Biden attended a United Nations climate summit in Egypt in North Africa in 2022. Biden had promised to visit Africa last year, after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit in December 2022. But the trip was delayed until this year and then pushed back again this October because of Hurricane Milton — reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still low priority for Washington. On Tuesday, Biden is to attend an official arrival ceremony and hold a bilateral meeting with Angolan President Joao Lourenco. Biden welcomed Lourenco to the Oval Office in November of last year. Biden is also set to meet with leaders from African business engagement groups he helped found before visiting Angola’s National Slavery Museum. The site was once the headquarters of the Capela da Casa Grande, a 17th century temple where slaves were baptized before boarding the ships that took them to America. Kirby said Biden will give a speech there acknowledging 'both the horrific history of slavery that has connected our two nations, but also looks forward to a future predicated on a shared vision that benefits both our people.'	https://apnews.com/article/biden-africa-angola-slave-museum-92b92fec66169e1f347142beb3735f52	2024-12-02T20:09:45-08:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street inches higher to set more records	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks tiptoed to more records amid a mixed Tuesday of trading, tacking a touch more onto what’s already been a stellar year so far. The S&amp;P 500 edged up by 2 points, or less than 0.1%, to set an all-time high for the 55th time this year. It’s climbed in 10 of the last 11 days and is on track for one of its best years since the turn of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 76 points, or 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.4% to its own record set a day earlier. AT&amp;T rose 4.6% after it boosted its profit forecast for the year. It also announced a $10 billion plan to send cash to its investors by buying back its own stock, while saying it expects to authorize another $10 billion of repurchases in 2027. On the losing end of Wall Street was U.S. Steel, which fell 8%. President-elect Donald Trump reiterated on social media that he would not let Japan’s Nippon Steel take over the iconic Pennsylvania steelmaker. Nippon Steel announced plans last December to buy the Pittsburgh-based steel producer for $14.1 billion in cash, raising concerns about what the transaction could mean for unionized workers, supply chains and U.S. national security. Earlier this year, President Joe Biden also came out against the acquisition. Tesla sank 1.6% after a judge in Delaware reaffirmed a previous ruling that the electric car maker must revoke Elon Musk’s multibillion-dollar pay package. The judge denied a request by attorneys for Musk and Tesla’s corporate directors to vacate her ruling earlier this year requiring the company to rescind the unprecedented pay package. All told, the S&amp;P 500 rose 2.73 points to 6,049.88. The Dow fell 76.47 to 44,705.53, and the Nasdaq composite gained 76.96 to 19,480.91. In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady after a report showed U.S. employers were advertising slightly more job openings at the end of October than a month earlier. Continued strength there would raise optimism that the economy could remain out of a recession that many investors had earlier worried was inevitable. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.23% from 4.20% from late Monday. Yields have seesawed since Election Day amid worries that Trump’s preferences for lower tax rates and bigger tariffs could spur higher inflation along with economic growth. But traders are still confident the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate again at its next meeting in two weeks. They’re betting on a nearly three-in-four chance of that, according to data from CME Group. Lower rates can give the economy more juice, but they can also give inflation more fuel. The key report this week that could guide the Fed’s next move will arrive on Friday. It’s the monthly jobs report, which will show how many workers U.S. employers hired and fired during November. It could be difficult to parse given how much storms and strikes distorted figures in October. Based on trading in the options market, Friday’s jobs report appears to be the biggest potential market mover until the Fed announces its next decision on interest rates Dec. 18, according to strategists at Barclays Capital. In financial markets abroad, the value of South Korea’s currency fell 1.1% against the U.S. dollar following a frenetic night where President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law and then later said he’d lift it after lawmakers voted to reject military rule. Stocks of Korean companies that trade in the United States also fell, including a 1.6% drop for SK Telecom. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.9% to help lead global markets. Some analysts think Japanese stocks could end up benefiting from Trump’s threats to raise tariffs, including for goods coming from China. Trade relations between the U.S. and China took another step backward after China said it is banning exports to the U.S. of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications. The counterpunch came swiftly after the U.S. Commerce Department expanded the list of Chinese technology companies subject to export controls to include many that make equipment used to make computer chips, chipmaking tools and software. The 140 companies newly included in the so-called 'entity list' are nearly all based in China. In China, stock indexes rose 1% in Hong Kong and 0.4% in Shanghai amid unconfirmed reports that Chinese leaders would meet next week to discuss planning for the coming year. Investors are hoping it may bring fresh stimulus to help spur growth in the world’s second-largest economy. In France, the CAC 40 rose 0.3% amid continued worries about politics in Paris, where the government is battling over the budget. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-trump-trade-inflation-fed-170ad728bd136fbcf5dc1511bac24bbf	2024-12-02T19:13:30-08:00	
Australian actor Ian Smith, who played Harold Bishop in 'Neighbours,' retires due to cancer	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Actor Ian Smith, who has played the character Harold Bishop in the iconic Australian soap opera 'Neighbours' since 1987, has announced his retirement after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. The 86-year-old actor revealed the diagnosis in an interview with 10 News First on Network 10, which broadcasts the series in Australia. The interview was broadcast on Monday. Smith has already filmed his last episode and said farewell to the other cast members on his final day of shooting. 'It isn’t just my last day in ‘Neighbours,’ it’s my last day of work,' Smith told 10. Smith said he was being treated for a rare form of lung cancer known as pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma. 'I found out a few months back that I have cancer, that I have a very aggressive, non-fixable cancer and ... they expect me to die,' Smith said. The producers of ' Neighbours,' which is set on fictional Ramsay Street in suburban Melbourne, used social media to confirm Smith’s departure. 'Harold waves goodbye to Ramsay Street. We’re sharing the sad news that Ian Smith will soon be stepping away from the beloved role of Harold Bishop,' the program posted on Monday. Network 10 described Smith as the 'heart and soul of the show.' 'Ian has brought joy, laughter and inspiration to audiences all around the world for decades,' the network said in a statement. 'Along with the cast and crew and all his fans from around the world, we will support Ian in any way we can during this difficult time,' it said. 'Neighbours' first screened in 1985 and has become Australia’s longest-running drama series. It has been sold to more than 60 countries and was most popular in Britain.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-ian-smith-neighours-harold-bishop-cancer-f3818bf45a7243ebc580d75c7899d30d	2024-12-02T18:00:06-08:00

Trudeau told Trump Americans would also suffer if tariffs are imposed, a Canadian minister says	TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Donald Trump that Americans would also suffer if the president-elect follows through on a plan to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, a Canadian minister who attended their recent dinner said Monday. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if they don’t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the United States. He said on social media last week that he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders. Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose responsibilities include border security, attended a dinner with Trump and Trudeau at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club on Friday. Trudeau requested the meeting in a bid to avoid the tariffs by convincing Trump that the northern border is nothing like the U.S. southern border with Mexico. 'The prime minister of course spoke about the importance of protecting the Canadian economy and Canadian workers from tariffs, but we also discussed with our American friends the negative impact that those tariffs could have on their economy, on affordability in the United States as well,' LeBlanc said in Parliament. If Trump makes good on his threat to slap 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, the price increases that could follow will collide with his campaign promise to give American families a break from inflation. Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods. The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington trade group, said last week that tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate. Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the U.S. should Trump follow through on the threat. After his dinner with Trump, Trudeau returned home without assurances the president-elect will back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner. Trump called the talks 'productive' but signaled no retreat from a pledge that Canada says unfairly lumps it in with Mexico over the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States. 'The idea that we came back empty handed is completely false,' LeBlanc said. 'We had a very productive discussion with Mr. Trump and his future Cabinet secretaries. ... The commitment from Mr. Trump to continue to work with us was far from empty handed.' Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump’s pick to lead the Interior Department, and Mike Waltz, Trump’s choice to be his national security adviser. Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, told The Associated Press on Sunday that 'the message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood.' Hillman, who sat at an adjacent table to Trudeau and Trump, said Canada is not the problem when it comes to drugs and migrants. On Monday, Mexico’s president rejected those comments. 'Mexico must be respected, especially by its trading partners,' President Claudia Sheinbaum said. She said Canada had its own problems with fentanyl consumption and 'could only wish they had the cultural riches Mexico has.' Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs at the two countries’ border are vastly different. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing for national security.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trudeau-trump-tarrifs-bdf1b2ae23167fcd9654ea4a45d43404	2024-12-02T13:02:35-08:00

Key players in Syria's long-running civil war, reignited by a shock rebel offensive	BEIRUT (AP) — Syria’s long civil war has reclaimed global attention after insurgents seized most of its largest city and dozens of nearby towns and villages. The stunning advance on Aleppo by rebel forces came as several key players in the conflict have been distracted or weakened, triggering the heaviest clashes since a 2020 ceasefire brought relative calm to the country’s north. Russian and Syrian forces have carried out dozens of airstrikes to try to limit the insurgents' advances, inflicting heavy casualties. Syria's civil war started in 2011 after an uprising against President Bashar Assad's rule. Five foreign powers have a military presence in the country including the U.S., Russia and Iran. Forces opposed to Assad, along with U.S.-backed fighters, control more than a third of the country. Israel holds the Golan Heights, which it seized in its 1967 war with its Arab neighbors. Here’s a look at the key players: Syrian pro-government forces, backed by Russia and Iran Syrian government troops have long controlled a large part of the country, thanks to allied forces dispatched by Russia and Iran. Assad's forces control most of the major population centers, including the capital Damascus and cities in Syria's center, south and east. The Syrian government's capture of Aleppo in late 2016 was a turning point in the conflict and their loss of the city in recent days is a major setback. Iran's military advisors and proxy fighters have played a critical role in shoring up Assad's forces throughout the war. But Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, which is backed by Iran, has been greatly weakened in its recent war with Israel and Iran has been distracted by the conflict. On Monday, Iranian-backed Iraqi militias deployed to Syria to back the government’s counteroffensive. Russia's military has supported Assad from the Mediterranean coast, where it maintains its only naval base outside the former Soviet Union, and at the Hemeimeem air base in Latakia province, which is home to hundreds of Russian troops. But much of its attention and resources have been focused on its war in Ukraine. Insurgent groups, backed mainly by Turkey Anti-government forces are led by the insurgent Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which long served as al-Qaida's branch in Syria and was considered a terrorist group by the U.N. as well as countries including the U.S. HTS controls much of northwest Syria and in 2017 set up a 'salvation government' to run day-to-day affairs in the region. In recent years, its leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the group's image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance. Other insurgent groups include Noureddine el-Zinki, which was formerly backed by the U.S., before it joined the HTS-led alliance. A Turkish-backed coalition of groups known as the Syrian National Army has attacked areas including the northern town of Tel Rifaat, controlled by the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Chinese fighters from the Turkistan Islamic Party and Chechen fighters from the former Soviet Union have taken part in the battles in the country's northwest, according to Syrian opposition activists. Turkey, which controls parts of northern Syria, will not say how many troops it has in the country. Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by the US The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed coalition of groups, controls large parts of eastern Syria. The SDF has battled the Islamic State group, capturing the last sliver of land held by the extremists in eastern Syria. About 900 American troops are stationed in Syria’s east to guard against a resurgence by the extremist group. SDF forces still controls several neighborhoods of Aleppo encircled by insurgents. Opposition activists have said that insurgents are willing to let those fighters cross to northeast Syria but it was not immediately clear if the Kurdish-led forces will do so. Turkey considers the principal Kurdish faction of the SDF to be linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which it and allies regard as a terrorist group.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-turkey-idlib-aleppo-hama-hts-sdf-65b2c2c864736327da1b7662a716768f	2024-12-02T12:27:59-08:00

Trump demands immediate release of Oct. 7 hostages, says otherwise there will be 'HELL TO PAY'	NEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is demanding the immediate release of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza, saying that if they are not freed before he is sworn into office for a second term there will be 'HELL TO PAY.' 'Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity,' Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social site. He added that, 'Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!' It was not immediately clear whether Trump was threatening to directly involve the U.S. military in Israel’s ongoing campaign against Hamas in Gaza. Trump allies have said he hopes there will be a ceasefire and hostage release deal before he returns to office early next year. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office declined comment. But the country's president, Isaac Herzog, welcomed Trump's comments in a social media post. 'Thank you and bless you Mr. President-elect @realDonaldTrump,' he wrote on X. 'We all pray for the moment we see our sisters and brothers back home!' The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 100 are still held inside Gaza, around two-thirds believed to be alive. Trump’s threat came hours after the Israeli government confirmed the death of Omer Neutra, a dual US--Israeli citizen, whose body is still believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza, according to the Israeli government. Days earlier, Hamas released a hostage video of Edan Alexander, who was serving in the Israeli military when he was taken by Hamas to Gaza. Filmed under apparent duress, Alexander calls on Trump to work to negotiate for his freedom and that of the remaining Hamas hostages. The Biden administration is mounting a last-ditch effort to try to restart talks between Israel and Hamas now that it has brokered a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. But the administration has said that Hamas has yet to show a willingness to reengage in negotiations and that the group isn’t concerned for its own lives or the lives of Gaza civilians. Israel’s retaliatory offensive for the attack has left at least 44,429 Palestinians dead, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The war has destroyed vast areas of the coastal enclave and displaced 90% of its population of 2.3 million people — often multiple times. ___ Associated Press writers Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-threat-hostages-israel-gaza-1aa9af22c070ab8ee0d8baf97bb05df8	2024-12-02T10:25:42-08:00	
Trump's tariff threats create division between Canada and Mexico over security at borders	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Threats by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to impose tariffs have created a split between Canada and Mexico, after Canadian officials said problems with the two countries’ borders shouldn’t be compared. On Monday, Mexico’s president rejected those comments, which were made following a meeting between Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 'Mexico must be respected, especially by its trading partners,' President Claudia Sheinbaum said, after Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, told The Associated Press on Sunday that 'the message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood.' Sheinbaum said Canada had its own problems with fentanyl consumption and 'could only wish they had the cultural riches Mexico has.' Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs at the two countries' border are vastly different. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Mexico's efforts to seize fentanyl before it reaches the U.S. have been lackluster. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone, while there were only 23,721 arrests at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024. During the same period, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border withe Mexico. Mexico feels especially hurt by the Canadian comments, because Mexican officials claim their government went to bat for Canada in the past. They claim that Trump, during his first term, initially wanted to leave Canada out of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement in 2018, and Mexico demanded it be included. It is unclear if that was actually the case. Trudeau also got ahead of Sheinbaum by meeting with the U.S. president-elect first. Both leaders are scrambling to get some assurances before Trump takes office. Hillman said Canada is ready to make new investments in border security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers. She also noted an agreement between Canada and the U.S. that allows for migrants caught crossing illegally to be sent back to Canada. She said Mexico and the U.S. do not have a similar agreement. On Monday, Sheinbaum revealed more about her own conversation last week with Trump, saying he 'had agreed' that Mexico wanted to focus on intelligence sharing in anti-drug efforts, noting 'he said that in his opinion that was good.' But she said Mexico would reject any direct U.S. intervention in Mexico and continue to enforce the tight restrictions on U.S. law enforcement agencies in Mexico imposed by her predecessor. 'That is going to maintained,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-canada-us-trump-tariffs-668a06c2beba2fca1967ab628db68418	2024-12-02T10:23:31-08:00	
A small migrant caravan sets out from southern Mexico but it's unlikely to reach the US border	TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) — A small migrant caravan has set out from southern Mexico, heading north, but is unlikely to reach the U.S. border after authorities broke up two other small caravans headed to the United States over the weekend. About 1,500 migrants — mostly from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, Colombia, Guatemala and Honduras — set out walking on Sunday from Tapachula, a city near Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala. They set out at night, to avoid the scorching daytime heat in the region. The two other small caravans had set out in November, after Donald Trump's election, but both were broken up weeks later by Mexican authorities. Some migrants were bused to cities in southern Mexico, and others were offered transit papers. Some in the caravan that set out Sunday said they would be willing to stay and find work in the industrial cities of northern Mexico. Most migrants cannot work, or cannot find work, in Tapachula, a city flooded with migrants. Santos Modesto, a migrant from Honduras, said most of those in the caravan would say they want to get to the U.S. so they could 'achieve a better life for their families.' 'But I think a lot of people here, if there were opportunities in Monterrey and surrounding areas, they would stay there,' Modesto said, 'because there are a lot of Cubans and Venezuelans who would rather stay here than return to their country.' The migrants said they were also concerned that Trump may eliminate the cellphone app CBP One that makes asylum claims more orderly after his Jan. 20 inauguration. About 1,450 appointments are made available daily, encouraging migrants to get an appointment before they show up at the border. 'There are a lot of reports that he has said he is going to do away with CBP One, that there are going to be deportations, the biggest deportation, but you have to have faith in God,' said Venezuelan migrant Francisco Unda, 38. Trump has threatened to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican products unless the country does more to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. Last week, Trump said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the U.S. Sheinbaum wrote on her social media accounts the same day that 'migrants and caravans are taken care of before they reach the border.' Sheinbaum has said she is confident that a tariff war with the U.S. can be averted but her statement — the day after she had a phone call with Trump — did not make clear who had offered what. Apart from the much larger first caravans in 2018 and 2019 — which were provided buses to ride part of the way north — no caravan has ever reached the U.S. border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way, though some individual members have made it. For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and immigration agents. They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the Guatemalan border. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-migrant-caravans-trump-tariffs-063d0707be67fdb171111faae25f562c	2024-12-02T09:04:57-08:00	
Georgia's protests lay bare a clash of values and interests as it navigates a Russia-West standoff	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgia is convulsed by political upheaval again after its pro-Moscow government, fresh off parliamentary elections denounced as rigged by its critics, decided to suspend negotiations for the small former Soviet republic to join the European Union. The small but ancient Caucasus country, which inhabits a crossroads between Slavic, Turkish and Persian cultures, has recently found itself navigating the geopolitical standoff between Russia under strongman President Vladimir Putin and the democratic, wealthy West. Here's a look at why the future of Georgia matters, both domestically and internationally. What's happening in Georgia? Official results from parliamentary elections on Oct. 26 gave victory to the ruling Georgian Dream party, which was created by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia. At the same time, opinion polls have repeatedly shown most Georgians want their country to join the European Union — and supporters of accession to the 27-member bloc have turned out in force to protest the government's move to suspend the process. Over 200 people have been detained after four nights of protests in the capital, Tbilisi, where tens of thousands of people have rallied outside parliament — a sizable turnout for a country of 3.7 million people. While parliament is controlled by Georgian Dream, President Salome Zourabichvili, who has a largely ceremonial role, has spoken out against what she calls the ruling party’s crackdown on free speech. She says many arrested protesters had injuries to their heads and faces. Navigating the standoff between Russia and the West Some see parallels between the recent protests in Georgia and those in Ukraine, another former Soviet republic, earlier this century as Kyiv sought to move closer to the West. The Georgian government’s move to suspend the EU membership process came after the European Parliament passed a resolution criticizing the Oct. 26 election as neither free nor fair. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow views the recent events in Georgia as similar to upheaval that rocked Ukraine in 2013 and 2014, when a pro-Russia president decided not to sign an association agreement with the EU — and eventually fled amid ensuing political unrest. Georgia, like Ukraine, has sought to join the NATO military alliance, which Putin's Russia considers a step too far for Western expansion into the former Soviet — and Russian — sphere of influence. Russia has a long border with Georgia, which is not contiguous with any EU country — though it does share a border with NATO member Turkey. In August 2008, Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which had made a botched attempt to regain control over its breakaway province of South Ossetia. Moscow recognized the independence of South Ossetia and another breakaway province, Abkhazia, and set up military bases there. US and EU try to exert more pressure on Georgian government On Saturday, the U.S. State Department announced the suspension of its strategic relationship with Georgia and condemned the decision to halt its efforts toward EU accession. The EU granted Georgia candidate status last December on condition that it meet the bloc’s stringent entry requirements. But in the spring, the EU put Georgia's accession on hold and cut financial support after the Georgian parliament passed a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-georgia-nato-european-union-protest-caucasus-66274e28828418301a44d80bad6c9ccd	2024-12-02T08:15:25-08:00	
French government faces no-confidence vote over Barnier's austerity budget	PARIS (AP) — French Prime Minister Michel Barnier is bracing for a no-confidence vote this week, a political reckoning almost certain to topple his fragile government and send shockwaves across the eurozone. Barnier on Monday invoked a rarely used constitutional mechanism to push through the contentious 2025 budget without parliamentary approval, arguing it was essential to maintain 'stability' amid deep political divisions. The move immediately drew sharp backlash, with Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally and the leftist New Popular Front both filing no-confidence motions in response, setting the stage for a vote as early as Wednesday that could see Barnier’s ouster. The looming showdown unfolds against the backdrop of a fractured National Assembly, left in disarray after June’s snap elections delivered no clear majority. President Emmanuel Macron had turned to Barnier in September to navigate the impasse and address France’s soaring deficit. Yet Barnier’s proposed austerity budget — slashing 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raising taxes by 20 billion euros — has only deepened divisions, inflaming tensions in the lower house and triggering this dramatic political confrontation. The use of the constitutional tool, called Article 49.3, allows the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote but leaves it exposed to no-confidence motions. Opposition leaders argue that Barnier’s concessions, including scrapping an electricity tax hike, do not go far enough to address their concerns. Le Pen accused Barnier of ignoring her party’s demands. 'Everyone must shoulder their responsibilities,' she said. The political standoff has unsettled financial markets, with borrowing costs rising sharply amid fears of prolonged instability. Barnier warned of 'serious turbulence' if the budget isn’t passed, but critics dismissed his remarks as fear-mongering. If the no-confidence motion succeeds, Macron will remain president but will need to appoint a new prime minister to steer legislation through the fractured assembly. The uncertainty threatens to deepen France’s economic troubles and reverberate across the eurozone.	https://apnews.com/article/france-budget-politics-crisis-macron-09bf6ec0fa3ed44bc3ffc6c17a792b25	2024-12-02T08:03:15-08:00	
PHOTOS OF THE YEAR: Through photographers' lenses, an epic catalog of humanity in 2024 emerges	In nearly 100 countries and all 50 U.S. states, visual journalists with The Associated Press are eyewitnesses to the world’s news, and have won 36 of AP's 59 Pulitzer Prizes since the award was established in 1917. AP photographers assembled a visual catalog of our civilization as life in 2024 hurtled directly at us at every speed and in every imaginable color and flavor — dizzying, unremitting, challenging the human race to make sense of it. And behind it all, the unspoken questions: How do you stop time? How do you preserve moments? Amid all the quick cuts that cut to the quick, how do you absorb what needs to be seen and remembered? The answer is encapsulated — as it has been for nearly two centuries now — in one word that contains multitudes and possibilities: photography. This year, AP photographers across the world captured 2024’s vast catalogue of events, from breaking news (wars, natural disasters, an assassination attempt) to intimate moments both quiet and exuberant. Thanks to photographers and their cameras, we were able to look down from the air. We crawled on the ground and looked up at events unfolding. We swam in the ocean. We gazed from a distance and got in front of fascinating faces. We looked straight on. We stared at the news from oblique angles. We saw landscapes of violence and of inspiration, and we saw intimate detail that only a modern digital camera with a talented human being behind it can deliver. We saw how people across the planet elected each other, loved each other, broke bread with each other, competed against each other in the most prestigious of forums. We saw them pray for — and with — each other, kill each other, mourn each other. Through photographers’ lenses, from the widest of wide angles to the most formidable of zooms, we saw: A pope alone in his chair, contemplating. Lava flowing across a burning landscape in Iceland. A former president of the United States — now its next president, too — thrusting his fist skyward in defiance after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt outside a small western Pennsylvania city. How do we stop time in 2024? A photographer reaches the scene, presses a button. A sophisticated contraption reacts to light. Pixels are preserved, edited and transmitted across the world. Through the lens, time stopped for a fraction of a second on Feb. 11 when Taylor Swift kissed Travis Kelce after his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, won the Super Bowl. In these images, people fight heat, battle cold, grapple with drought, take to the sea, pass the baton, cast the fishing line, beat each other with sticks. Anxiously and expectantly, they look for better lives; sometimes, they find them. The child was born on the water — on a boat along the River Bhramaputra in northeastern India on July 3, one of more than 100 million babies to arrive during a convulsive year. Her first tears in this world were frozen in time, made available to faraway eyes for one simple reason: a photographer was there to bear witness. In photography, vantage point is everything. Where the camera goes is what we see. The choices that AP photographers make in mere seconds can shape how we see our world for years. Flip through these photos in that light, and they become more impactful than they already are. Consider the case of Christophe Chavilinga, a 90-year-old man from a camp for displaced people called Munigi in eastern Congo. This year, he fell sick with mpox. By Aug. 16, blistering lesions covered great parts of his face. That was the day that, while he waited to be treated at a clinic, he stared straight into a camera. His eyes were weary. His mouth drooped. His dignity came through in every pixel. That moment, frozen, was beamed around the world. We saw prisoners reaching out from their cells for bread at a Paraguayan prison in July — their outstretched hands grasping, hoping for something to come their way. Each image manages to stop the world just a little. It gives us snippets of time to think about those around us and those far from us — and how they, like so many, are muddling their way through the 21st century, trying to survive and prosper. Some succeed, some do not. ___ Ted Anthony, director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation for The Associated Press, writes frequently about photography.

US will send Ukraine $725 million more in counter-drone systems, anti-personnel land mines	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is preparing to send Ukraine an additional $725 million in military assistance, including counter-drone systems and munitions for its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, which could indicate more of the longer-range missiles are headed to the battlefield. Two U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the package before it was announced, did not confirm whether the munitions for the HIMARS are the coveted ATACMS — the Army Tactical Missile System. But Ukraine has been pressing for more of the longer-range missiles to strike additional targets inside Russia. The package also includes more of the anti-personnel land mines that Ukraine is counting on to slow Russian and North Korean ground forces in Russia's Kursk region. President Joe Biden has pledged to spend all of the military assistance funds Congress approved earlier this year for Ukraine before the end of his administration on Jan. 20, which before Monday's news included about $7.1 billion in weapons that would be drawn from the Pentagon’s stockpiles. There is widespread speculation about what the new Trump administration will mean for Ukraine as the incoming president has promised to end the conflict. In a major shift, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signaled on Friday that an an offer of NATO membership to territory under Kyiv’s control could end 'the hot stage of the war.'	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-725-million-weapons-us-biden-38eaf70cad013d25cc7c505f7a3b6bcf	2024-12-02T06:52:43-08:00	
Hezbollah fires into Israel-held area after multiple Israeli strikes in Lebanon since truce began	JERUSALEM (AP) — Hezbollah fired into a disputed border zone held by Israel on Monday after multiple Israeli strikes inside Lebanon since a ceasefire took hold last week. The militant group said the volley, its first during the truce, was a warning shot in response to what it called repeated Israeli violations. Israeli leaders threatened to retaliate, further straining the fragile U.S.- and French-brokered ceasefire. The truce called for a 60-day halt in fighting, which aims to end more than a year of war between Hezbollah and Israel that's part of a wider regional conflict sparked by the devastating Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Israeli strikes in Lebanon in recent days have killed at least four people and wounded others. Lebanon’s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, accused Israel of violating the truce more than 50 times in recent days, with strikes, demolition of homes near the border and overflight of drones. Israel has said its strikes were in response to unspecified Hezbollah violations and that under the ceasefire deal it reserves the right to retaliate. The Israeli military said Hezbollah launched two projectiles on Monday toward Mount Dov, a disputed Israeli-held territory known as Shebaa Farms in Lebanon, where the borders of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel meet. Israel said the projectiles fell in open areas and no injuries were reported. Hezbollah said in a statement that it fired on an Israeli military position in the area as a 'defensive and warning response' after what it called 'repeated violations' of the ceasefire deal by Israel. It said complaints to mediators tasked with monitoring the ceasefire 'were futile in stopping these violations.' Officials in the United States — which along with France heads a commission meant to monitor adherence to the deal — played down the significance of Israeli strikes. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said, 'Largely speaking, the ceasefire is holding.' 'We’ve gone from dozens of strikes down to one a day maybe two a day,' Kirby said, referring to Israeli strikes. 'We’re going to keep trying and see what we can do to get it down to zero,' he told reporters aboard Air Force One as President Joe Biden made his way for a visit to Angola. Israel threatens retaliation Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Hezbollah fire was 'a serious violation' and vowed, 'Israel will respond forcefully.' Defense Minister Israel Katz said the volley 'will be met with a harsh response.' Under the ceasefire deal, Iran-backed Hezbollah has 60 days to withdraw its fighters and infrastructure from southern Lebanon, pulling back north of the Litani River, which is about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the Israeli-Lebanese border. During that time, Israeli troops are also to withdraw to their side of the border. On Monday before the Hezbollah fire, Israeli carried out at least four airstrikes and an artillery barrage on different parts of southern Lebanon, including a drone strike that killed a person on a motorcycle, according to Lebanese state media. Another strike killed a corporal in the Lebanese security services, state media said. The Israeli military said it carried out operations in the south against Hezbollah militants, 'thwarting threats to Israeli civilians,' without elaborating. Another drone strike Monday hit a Lebanese army bulldozer, wounding a soldier, in the northeastern town of Hermel – far north of the Litani River. The Israeli military said it hit military vehicles operating 'in the area of a Hezbollah missile manufacturing site.' The Lebanese army, which stayed on the sidelines of the Israel-Hezbollah fighting, is supposed to deploy additional troops in the south alongside U.N. peacekeepers to ensure Hezbollah’s withdrawal from the area. An Israeli strike on Saturday in the southern Marjayoun area killed two people, according to state media. In a video statement, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel was striking Hezbollah fighters in the south when they are identified or seen attempting to move weapons. 'Their presence south of the Litani River is the most basic violation of the understandings … They must move north immediately,' he said, despite the 60-day period the deal gives for a pullback. Fears of hunger mount in Gaza In Gaza, meanwhile, alarm over increasing hunger was growing — with the amount of food allowed in by Israel plunging over the past two months, compounded by a decision Sunday by the U.N. to halt aid deliveries from the main crossing into the territory because of the threat of armed gangs looting convoys. Experts already warned of famine in the northernmost part of Gaza, which Israeli forces have almost completely isolated since early October. Muhannad Hadi, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian Territories, warned on Monday of 'severe hunger surging' in central and southern Gaza as well. Speaking at a conference in Cairo aimed at increasing aid, he said more than 1 million people have not received their monthly food rations since July. Israel’s campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas’ Oct 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, has driven almost the entire population of the territory from their homes. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians now live in squalid tent camps and reliant on international aid. In a tent camp in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, Palestinians lined up at makeshift mud ovens trying to buy a few loaves of flatbread for their families. With the price of flour mounting because of scarcity, the bakers — women displaced from further north — said they could bake less bread, and families could afford far less. 'They divide them to their children, one loaf every day,' said Wafaa al-Attar, who was selling bread she made in a clay oven. A distant relative also selling bread, Enayat al-Attar, said some people cut up a single piece of flatbread among themselves. 'Flour is running out for everyone,' she said. The Israeli military said it allowed 40 trucks carrying 600 tons of flour for the World Food Program to enter the southern Gaza Strip on Sunday night, as well as 16 other food trucks. Israel has said it is working to increase the flow of aid. November saw an increase in the average number of humanitarian trucks it let into Gaza, up to 77 daily from 57 the month before, according to official Israeli figures. But the levels are still nearly the lowest of the entire 15-month war. And the U.N. says less than half of that actually reaches Palestinians because Israeli military restrictions, fighting and robberies make it too dangerous to deliver the aid. On Sunday, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said it is halting aid deliveries through Kerem Shalom, the main artery for aid, because of repeated robberies. It blamed the breakdown of law and order in large part on Israeli policies. ___ Abou AlJoud reported from Beirut.

Stars, heads of state, solemn rituals and high-security celebrations for Notre Dame's reopening	PARIS (AP) — The reopening of Notre Dame this coming weekend is going to be a high-security affair, with a repeat of some measures used during the Paris Olympics and the sealing-off to tourists of the cathedral's island location in the heart of the French capital. After more than five years of reconstruction following the fire that devastated Notre Dame in 2019, invite-only ceremonies Saturday and Sunday will usher in its rebirth. Police chief Laurent Nuñez said only people with invitations and the island's residents will have access to the Ile de la Cité in the middle of the River Seine, which includes Notre Dame and habitually hums with tourists. He said about 50 heads of state and government are expected and that security arrangements are drawing on the police measures that sealed off large sections of central Paris for the Paris Games' flamboyant opening ceremony. 'A very high level of security will be applied,' Nuñez said in an interview published Monday in Le Parisien. Archbishop to bang on the doors The first celebrations starting Saturday afternoon will blend religious ritual and showbiz. Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will preside at a reopening service, banging on Notre Dame's shuttered doors with his staff to reopen them, the cathedral website says. The archbishop will also symbolically reawaken Notre Dame's thunderous grand organ. The fire that melted the cathedral's lead roofing coated the huge instrument in toxic dust. Its 8,000 pipes, ranging in size from that of a pen to over 10 meters (33 feet) tall, have been painstakingly disassembled, cleaned, and retuned. There will also be psalms, prayers and singing. French President Emmanuel Macron will attend and address the VIP guests. A musical show After the service, opera singers Pretty Yende, from South Africa, and Julie Fuchs, from France; Chinese pianist Lang Lang; cellist Yo-Yo Ma; Benin-born singer Angelique Kidjo; Lebanese singer Hiba Tawaji and others will perform at a concert Saturday evening for the cathedral and those who took part in the reconstruction, says the show's broadcaster, France Télévisions. The security cordon sealing off the whole of the Ile de La Cité, plus a stretch of the Seine's southern bank and nine of its bridges, will be in place from early Saturday evening to Sunday night, the police chief said. Only those involved in the ceremonies and residents will be granted access, he said. All shops on the island — many are geared to the tourist trade — as well as boat tours that start and stop there will be closed for the weekend, he added. Sunday Mass and buffet The Paris archbishop will also lead an inaugural Mass and consecration of the new altar on Sunday morning. Nearly 170 bishops from France and other countries will join the celebration, as well as priests from all 106 parishes in the Paris diocese, the cathedral website says. It says Mass will be followed by a 'fraternal buffet' for the needy. Public viewing areas capable of holding 40,000 people will be set up on the Seine’s southern bank, so spectators can follow the two days of events on screens, the police chief said. ___ For more of AP’s coverage on Notre Dame, visit https://apnews.com/hub/notre-dame-cathedral	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-cathedral-reopens-ceremony-security-fire-efc740d20cf91f5ba1eabf45eecfe8ad	2024-12-02T03:44:07-08:00	
Philippine navy shadows Russian submarine spotted in the South China Sea	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine military deployed a navy ship and air force planes to shadow a Russian submarine, which passed through the South China Sea off the country’s western coast last week, a security official said Monday. The Russian submarine identified itself in response to a Philippine navy two-way radio inquiry, saying it was en route home to Russia’s eastern city of Vladivostok after joining an exercise with the Malaysian navy, Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the National Security Council, said. The submarine, like other foreign ships, has the right of 'innocent passage' in the country’s exclusive economic zone but it still sparked concern when it was spotted on Thursday about 80 nautical miles (148 kilometers) off the Philippine province of Mindoro, Malaya said. The submarine was sighted after it surfaced due to weather-related conditions, Malaya said. 'All of that is very concerning,' President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told reporters when asked about the submarine. 'Any intrusion into the West Philippine Sea, of our EEZ, of our baselines is very worrisome. So, yes, it’s just another one.' Marcos used the Philippine name for the South China Sea, where his country plus Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and other coastal states have faced an increasingly aggressive China, which claims the busy waterway virtually in its entirety. An alarming spike in territorial confrontations, particularly between Chinese and Philippine coast guard and naval forces, starting last year has prompted closer surveillance by the United States and other Western governments of the key global trade route.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-russian-submarine-south-china-sea-88d9ec7d91fc1f5294cfa8ad31e635eb	2024-12-02T01:30:21-08:00	
Volkswagen workers hold 2-hour strikes to push back against proposed pay cuts and plant closures	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Volkswagen workers launched rolling two-hour strikes Monday at nine plants across Germany to underscore their resistance to pay cuts and factory closures the company says are necessary to cope with a slack European auto market. The work stoppages included the company's base plant at Wolfsburg, where workers rallied against a cost-cutting drive by the automaker’s management in which they face the threat of the company’s first plant closures in its home country. Volkswagen argues that it must lower costs in Germany to levels achieved by competitors and by Volkswagen plants in eastern Europe and South America. Chief employee representative Daniela Cavallo has said employees should not shoulder the burden of management failures to develop attractive products and come up with a cheaper, entry-level electric vehicle. 'We demand that all make their contribution – management and the shareholder side as well,' Cavallo said at the rally in Wolfsburg as employees drummed, whistled and clapped. She said the next round of talks in a week’s time 'is likely to set the course – rapprochement or escalation. We are ready for both.' The so-called warning strikes, a common tactic in German wage negotiations, are taking place as part of talks for a new labor agreement after a mandatory peace period that bars strikes expired on Sunday. The IG Metall industrial union said any job actions beyond those occurring on Monday would be announced later. The company is demanding a 10% pay cut for 120,000 German workers and has said it can't avoid shedding factory capacity that is no longer needed. Employee representatives say the company has proposed closing three of its German plants. Thorsten Gröger, the regional leader of the IG Metall industrial union in Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is headquartered, said that the company won’t be able to 'overlook' the walkouts. 'If necessary, this will be one of the toughest conflicts Volkswagen has ever seen.' The company hasn't publicly detailed its plans but is facing a drop in demand in Europe, higher costs and increasing competition from Chinese automakers. Volkswagen built factories to supply a European car market of 16 million in annual vehicle sales, but now faces demand for around 14 million, Volkswagen brand head Thomas Schaefer was quoted as saying in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. Since Volkswagen has a quarter of the market, that represents a loss of 500,000 cars a year. For years, strong profits in China helped cover higher costs but the changing environment now means that 'it's high time to address this,' Schaefer said. The walkouts began at a plant in Zwickau in eastern Germany and were to continue at plants in Braunschweig, Chemnitz, Dresden, Emden, Hanover, Kassel, and Salzgitter. The next negotiations are slated for Dec. 9.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-volkswagen-strikes-d43f84ca4c633b8231fb45cf62887d01	2024-12-02T00:55:16-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israel says soldier thought to have been taken hostage is now presumed dead	The Israeli military said Monday an Israeli American soldier who was believed to have been captured alive by Hamas in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack was killed that day and his body taken into the Gaza Strip. Hamas is still holding around 100 hostages inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. The Biden administration says it is making another push for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining hostages, after nearly a year of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas repeatedly stalled. Diplomats see a potential opening after last week’s ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group, an ally of Hamas that began launching rocket attacks and trading fire with Israel the day after the October 2023 attack. The fragile ceasefire has held despite repeated Israeli strikes that have angered Lebanese officials but not yet triggered a response from Hezbollah. Israel says it has acted to thwart potential attacks. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. More than 100 hostages were released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israel’s ongoing retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,429 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has destroyed vast areas of the coastal enclave and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Here’s the Latest: Israeli American soldier thought to have been taken hostage is now presumed dead TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said Monday an Israeli American soldier who was believed to have been taken hostage alive on Oct. 7, 2023, is now presumed to have been killed during Hamas’ attack and his body taken into Gaza. Neutra, 21, was a New York native who enlisted in the Israeli military and was captured when Hamas attacked southern Israel. Neutra’s parents, Ronen and Orna, led a public campaign while he was thought to be alive for their son’s freedom. They spoke at protests in the U.S. and Israel, addressed the Republican National Convention this year and kept up ties with the Biden administration in their crusade to secure their son’s release. In a statement announcing the death, the military did not say how it came to the conclusion over Neutra’s fate. He was one of seven American Israelis still held in Gaza, four of whom are now said to be dead. Hamas released a video of one, Edan Alexander, over the weekend, indicating he was still alive. In late summer, Hamas killed Hersh Goldberg-Polin, another prominent Israeli American hostage, along with five other captives, whose bodies the Israeli military recovered. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Some 100 captives are still held inside Gaza, around two-thirds believed to be alive. Iranian-supported Iraqi militias back Syrian government's counteroffensive against insurgents Iraqi militias supported by Iran deployed in Syria on Monday to back the government’s counteroffensive against a surprise advance by insurgents who seized the largest city of Aleppo, a militia official and a war monitor said. Insurgents led by jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham launched a two-pronged attack on Aleppo last week and the countryside around Idlib before moving toward neighboring Hama province. Government troops built a fortified defensive line in northern Hama in an attempt to stall the insurgents’ momentum while jets on Sunday pounded rebel-held lines. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with Syrian President Bashar Assad in Damascus Sunday and announced Tehran’s full support for his government. He later arrived for talks in Ankara, Turkey, one of the rebels' main backers. Iran has been of Assad’s principal political and military supporters and deployed military advisers and forces after 2011 protests against Assad’s rule turned into an all-out war. Tehran-backed Iraqi militias already in Syria mobilized and additional forces crossed the border to support them, said the Iraqi militia official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. According to Britain-based opposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, some 200 Iraqi militiamen on pickups crossed into Syria overnight through the strategic Bou Kamal. They were expected to deploy in Aleppo to support the Syrian army’s pushback against the insurgents, the monitor said. US Navy destroys Houthi missiles and drones targeting American ships in Gulf of Aden DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — U.S. Navy destroyers shot down seven missiles and drones fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels at the warships and three American merchant vessels they were escorting through the Gulf of Aden. No damage or injuries were reported. U.S. Central Command said late Sunday that the destroyers USS Stockdale and USS O’Kane shot down and destroyed three anti-ship ballistic missiles, three drones and one anti-ship cruise missile. The merchant ships were not identified. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement and said they had targeted the U.S. destroyers and 'three supply ships belonging to the American army in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden.' Houthi attacks for months have targeted shipping through a waterway where $1 trillion in goods pass annually over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Israel’s ground offensive in Lebanon. A ceasefire was announced in Lebanon last week. The USS Stockdale was involved in a similar attack on Nov. 12. ___ Read more of the AP's coverage of the Middle East wars: https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-war-latest-2-december-2024-8ae460d7a2796c0bf93a2293d26d0fdf	2024-12-02T00:48:38-08:00	
Police in Georgia move again to disperse protests over the suspension of EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Police in Georgia's capital again moved to disperse thousands of demonstrators on Monday after over 200 people were detained during four previous nights of protests against the government’s decision to suspend negotiations to join the European Union. Police used water cannons and tear gas to drive protesters away from the parliament building where they have gathered each night since Thursday when the ruling Georgian Dream party declared its decision to put EU accession talks on hold. Georgian Dream's disputed victory in the country’s Oct. 26 parliamentary election, widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s aspirations to join the EU, has sparked mass demonstrations and the opposition boycott of the parliament. The opposition and the country's pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with Moscow's help. Georgia’s Interior Ministry said Monday that 224 protesters were detained on administrative charges and three arrested on criminal charges. So far, 113 police officers needed medical treatment while three others were hospitalized after clashes with protesters, who hurled fireworks at police. Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili said many of the arrested protesters had injuries to their heads and faces, including broken bones and eye sockets. Writing on X and citing lawyers who represent the detained, she said some people were subject to systematic beatings between arrest and transportation to detention facilities. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has rejected official election results and refused to recognize the parliament's legitimacy. She has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to spearhead the demands for a new parliamentary election. The president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, and foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas spoke to Zourabichvili on Sunday to condemn the violence against protesters and to note that 'the actions of the government run counter to the will of the people,' Costa wrote on X. Kallas and EU enlargement commissioner Marta Kos also released a joint statement that reiterated the EU’s 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country' and urged Georgian authorities to 'respect the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, and refrain from using force against peaceful protesters, politicians and media representatives.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of Georgian Dream has warned the opposition that 'any violation of the law will be met with the full rigor of the law.' 'Neither will those politicians who hide in their offices and sacrifice members of their violent groups to severe punishment escape responsibility,' he said. Kobakhidze argued that the government remains committed to the goal of European integration, claiming that 'the only thing we have rejected is the shameful and offensive blackmail.' The government’s announcement of the EU accession talks’ suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October’s election in Georgia as neither free nor fair. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc’s recommendations but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. Georgian Dream has increasingly adopted repressive laws mirroring those in Russia which crack down on freedom of speech and curtail LGBTQ+ rights. A law banning same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relations and people in the media came into force Monday. Speaking to The Associated Press on Saturday, Zourabichvili said that her country was becoming a 'quasi-Russian' state and that Georgian Dream controlled the major institutions. 'We are not demanding a revolution. We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again,' Zourabichvili said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov alleged parallels between protests in Georgia and massive demonstrations in Ukraine that led to the ouster of a Moscow friendly leader in 2014. Speaking to reporters on Monday, he accused outside forces of trying to 'destabilize the situation' and insisted that Russia is not interfering in Georgia.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-protest-election-russia-eu-c953b95d04ae2f4de3d272e3c4bb1039	2024-12-02T00:31:14-08:00	
Elton John says he has lost his eyesight and struggles to see his new stage musical	LONDON (AP) — Elton John says he struggled to watch his new musical because he has lost his eyesight after contracting an infection. The singer-songwriter attended the opening night of 'The Devil Wears Prada' in London on Sunday and told the audience that 'I haven’t been able to come to many of the previews because, as you know, I have lost my eyesight.' 'So it’s hard for me to see it, but I love to hear it and, boy, it sounded good tonight,' he said. John, 77, disclosed in September that an infection had left him 'with only limited vision in one eye.' He wrote on Instagram that 'I am healing, but it’s an extremely slow process and it will take some time before sight returns to the impacted eye.' John wrote the score for 'The Devil Wears Prada,' a stage musical based on the 2006 movie about a young journalist navigating the glamour and egos of a glossy fashion magazine. The production at London’s Dominion Theatre stars Vanessa Williams as the fearsome editor Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep in the film. Sunday’s gala, a fundraiser for the Elton John AIDS Foundation, was attended by celebrities and fashion-industry figures including designer Donatella Versace and former Vogue editor Anna Wintour, the rumored inspiration for the Priestly character. Wintour described the musical as 'entertaining.'	https://apnews.com/article/elton-john-eyesight-devil-wears-prada-70a8bd755142c438ab1e9ddeb3c3db83	2024-12-02T00:20:19-08:00

He did not further elaborate but Iran has been of Assad's principal political and military supporters and has deployed military advisers and forces after 2011 protests against Assad’s rule turned into an all-out war. Tehran-backed Iraqi militias already in Syria mobilized and additional forces crossed the border to support Assad's government and army, said the Iraqi militia official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

Syrian and Russian airstrikes on rebel positions continued mostly in Hama and Idlib provinces. At least 10 civilians were killed in Idlib city and province, according to the Syrian Civil Defense in opposition-held areas. Syrian Kurds were fleeing the fighting in large numbers after Turkish-backed rebels seized Tel Rifaat from rival U.S.-backed Kurdish authorities. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces largely withdrew and called for a humanitarian corridor to allow people to leave safely in convoys toward Aleppo and later to Kurdish-led northeast regions. ___ Associated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-insurgents-aleppo-iran-iraq-militia-12341a6c15a772e207a1b5513c11f8fd	2024-12-02T00:18:53-08:00	
Impeachment complaint filed against Philippine Vice President Duterte after she threatened president	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — An impeachment complaint was filed Monday against Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing a legal storm over a death threat she made against the president and her alleged role in extra-judicial killings of drug suspects, corruption and failure to stand up to Chinese aggression in the disputed South China Sea. The impeachment bid filed by several prominent civil society activists in the House of Representatives accuses Duterte of violating the country’s Constitution, betrayal of public trust and other 'high crimes,' including the death threats she made against the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives. Duterte did not immediately issue any response to the impeachment bid, which accused her of about two dozen alleged crimes. 'We're hoping that with this complaint, we can end the nightmare that our vice president has brought to the people,' said Rep. Percival Cendana, who gave the required endorsement of the complaint. The vice president’s threats showed the 'extent of respondent’s mental incapacity, her depravity and lack of mental fitness to continue holding the high office of vice president of the Philippines,' said a copy of the complaint seen by The Associated Press. 'The same constitute not only betrayal of public trust but also a high crime which would warrant her immediate impeachment from office.' Duterte, a 46-year-old lawyer, was also accused in the complaint of having unexplained wealth and of allowing a continuation of the extra-judicial killings of drug suspects begun by her father, a former mayor of southern Davao City, when she held that position in the past. The vice president’s legal troubles have unfolded with the backdrop of her increasingly bitter political feud with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his allies. She said in online news conference on Nov. 23 that she has contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Speaker Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned was not a joke. She later said she was not threatening him but was expressing concern for her own safety. The impeachment complaint will be scrutinized by the Philippine Congress, which is dominated by allies of Marcos and his cousin and key backer, Romualdez, who also has been politically at odds with the vice president. The process could take weeks or months. Congress is to start its Christmas recess on Dec. 20 and resume on Jan. 13. Many legislators will then start campaigning for reelection before May 12 midterm elections. The House has been investigating the alleged misuse of 612.5 million pesos ($10.3 million) of confidential and intelligence funds received by Duterte’s offices as vice president and education secretary. She has since left the education post. She has refused to respond to questions in detail in tense televised hearings. Duterte also vehemently protested when her chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, was ordered temporarily detained for allegedly hampering the inquiry. Lopez has been released from hospital detention. Philippine police have filed criminal complaints against Duterte and her security staff for allegedly assaulting authorities and disobeying orders in an altercation in Congress over Lopez’s detention. Duterte has accused Marcos, his wife and Romualdez of corruption, weak leadership and attempting to muzzle her because of speculation she may seek the presidency in 2028. The National Bureau of Investigation subpoenaed Duterte to face investigators about her threats against them. The police, military and the national security adviser immediately boosted the security of the Marcoses after the threats. The president has said an impeachment of Duterte would waste time while the country faces other challenges, but her opponents have said they will proceed to foster accountability and the rule of law. Marcos and Duterte won landslide victories as running mates in the 2022 election but have since fallen out over key differences. The two offices are elected separately in the Philippines, which has resulted in rivals occupying the country’s top political posts. Marcos and Duterte differ on their approaches to China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea and their views on the deadly anti-drug crackdown conducted by Duterte’s father, Rodrigo Duterte, who was the previous president in addition to ex-mayor of Davao. The complainants in the impeachment, including former military officers from a group called Magdalo, accused her of refusing to condemn Chinese aggressive actions against Philippine forces in the South China Sea. The complainants did not cite China by name. The brutal drug crackdown left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead in killings mostly by police that are being investigated by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity. The impeachment complaint cited a key witness to the killings, former police officer Arturo Lascanas, as saying that Sara Duterte allowed the extra-judicial killings of drug suspects to continue in Davao city when she served as its mayor. The drug crackdown was launched by her father when he was mayor. ___ Associated Press journalists Aaron Favila and Joeal Calupitan contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-duterte-impeachment-complaint-marcos-073f5ae8bf4bec1af48bdd24dec70635	2024-12-01T23:54:49-08:00	
Hong Kong launches panda sculpture tour as the city hopes the bear craze boosts tourism	HONG KONG (AP) — Thousands of giant panda sculptures will greet residents and tourists starting Saturday in Hong Kong, where enthusiasm for the bears has grown since two cubs were born in a local theme park. The 2,500 exhibits were showcased in a launch ceremony of PANDA GO! FEST HK, the city's largest panda-themed exhibition, at Hong Kong's airport on Monday. They will be publicly displayed at the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui, a popular shopping district, this weekend before setting their footprint at three other locations this month. One designated spot is Ocean Park, home to the twin cubs, their parents and two other pandas gifted by Beijing this year. The design of six of the sculptures, made of recycled rubber barrels and resins among other materials, was inspired by these bears. The cubs — whose birth in August made their mother Ying Ying the world’s oldest first-time panda mom — may meet visitors as early as February. In a separate media preview event on Monday, the new pair of Beijing-gifted pandas, An An and Ke Ke, who arrived in September, appeared relaxed in their new home at Ocean Park. An An enjoyed eating bamboo in front of the cameras and Ke Ke climbed on an installation. They are set to meet the public on Sunday. The displays reflect Hong Kong’s use of pandas to boost its economy as the Chinese financial hub works to regain its position as one of Asia’s top tourism destinations. Pandas are considered China’s unofficial national mascot. The country’s giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing’s soft-power diplomacy. Hong Kong's tourism industry representatives are upbeat about the potential impact of housing six pandas, hoping to boost visitor numbers even though caring for pandas in captivity is expensive. Officials have encouraged businesses to capitalize on the popularity of the bears to seize opportunities in what some lawmakers have dubbed the 'panda economy.' The organizer of the exhibitions also invited some renowned figures, including musician Pharrell Williams, to create special-edition panda designs. Most of these special sculptures will be auctioned online for charity and the proceeds will be donated to Ocean Park to support giant panda conversation efforts. Ying Ying and the twin cubs' father, Le Le, are the second pair of pandas gifted by Beijing to Hong Kong since the former British colony returned to China’s rule in 1997. The first pair were An An and Jia Jia who arrived in 1999. Jia Jia, who died at 38 in 2016, is the world’s oldest-ever panda to have lived in captivity. The average lifespan for a panda in the wild is 14 to 20 years, while in captivity it’s up to 30 years, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-panda-2500-sculptures-exhibitions-e03631be33fe7a5b367bcde89f7d399c	2024-12-01T23:17:46-08:00	
Scientists gather to decode puzzle of the world's rarest whale in 'extraordinary' New Zealand study	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — It is the world’s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery. 'I can’t tell you how extraordinary it is,' said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand’s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. 'For me personally, it’s unbelievable.' Van Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature -- which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July — is the first ever to take place. None has ever been seen alive at sea. The list of what scientists don’t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don’t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they’ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don’t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don’t know how this one died. Over the next week, researchers studying the 5-meter (16-foot) -long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin hope to find out. 'There may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,' said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. 'Who knows what we’ll discover?' Only six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification. New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand’s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile’s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986. DNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species — and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn’t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before. On Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks — normal, they said, and not the cause. The dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with Māori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. To Māori, whales are a taonga -– a precious treasure -– and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor. Members of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -– a prayer -– over the creature before the study begins. 'According to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,' said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te Rūnanga Ōtākou. 'It’s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.' The iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale’s head this week. 'It all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,' Cassidy said. It’s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world’s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean's deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery. The assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery. 'What we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,' said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. 'In discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.'	https://apnews.com/article/rarest-whale-zealand-spade-toothed-dissection-d71aad4ce6e47f4e1056a10cf5b8610e	2024-12-01T23:03:00-08:00	
Landmark climate change case opens at the top UN court as island nations fear rising seas	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The top United Nations court took up the largest case in its history on Monday, hearing the plight of several small island nations helpless in combating the devastating impact of climate change that they feel endangers their survival. They demand that major polluting nations be held to account. After years of lobbying by island nations who fear they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice last year for an opinion on 'the obligations of States in respect of climate change.' 'The stakes could not be higher. The survival of my people and so many others is on the line,' said Arnold Kiel Loughman, attorney-general of the Vanuatu archipelago nation. 'As the principal legal officer of my country, I have come before this court because domestic legal remedies are unable to address a crisis of the scope and magnitude,' he said during the opening session of two weeks of hearings. 'States have obligations, obligation to act with due diligence, to prevent significant harm to the environment, to prevent, to reduce the emissions and provide support to countries like mine to protect the human rights of present and future generations,' he said. Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and couldn't directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could be the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis. 'The conduct on trial here is that of states which have failed for over a century despite increasingly dire warnings to rein in the emissions from their territories. I must emphasize that since 1990, emissions have increased by over 50%, reaching an all time high in 2023,' Vanuatu’s climate change envoy Ralph Regenvanu told the court. He added that 'a handful of readily identifiable states have produced the vast majority of historic and current greenhouse gas emissions. Yet other countries, including my own, are suffering the brunt of the consequences.' The Hague-based court will hear from 99 countries and more than a dozen intergovernmental organizations over two weeks. It’s the largest lineup in the institution’s nearly 80-year history. Last month at the United Nations’ annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the $1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed. 'For our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the world’s biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines,' said Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change. Fifteen judges from around the world will seek to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? The second question makes particular reference to 'small island developing States' likely to be hardest hit by climate change and to 'members of 'the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change.' The judges were even briefed on the science behind rising global temperatures by the U.N.’s climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ahead of the hearings.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-world-court-icj-climate-global-warming-e954301f0258509f67e66ae2762da6f6	2024-12-01T22:54:37-08:00	
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is in Ukraine for his first visit in 2 1/2 years	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Ukraine for the first time in more than 2 1/2 years Monday, just weeks after he was criticized by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for having a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. That call came at a time of widespread speculation about what the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump will mean for Ukraine as the incoming president has promised to end the conflict. In a major shift, Zelenskyy signalled Friday that an an offer of NATO membership to territory under Kyiv’s control could end 'the hot stage of the war' in Ukraine. Scholz's visit comes ahead of an early German election expected in February. As the campaign gets under way, Scholz has pointed to Germany’s status as Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier while also highlighting his 'prudence' in working to prevent the war escalating and refusing to deliver Taurus long-range cruise missiles. Scholz has been cautious about talk of fast-tracking NATO membership for Ukraine. In recent months, he has emphasized the importance of finding a path to peace, while stressing that it must not be chosen over Ukraine’s head. Scholz said that in his meeting with Zelenskyy he will announce further military deliveries this month totaling 650 million euros. 'I would like to make clear here on the ground that Germany will remain Ukraine’s strongest supporter in Europe,' he said. Despite that, Scholz was criticized by Zelenskyy in November for speaking to Putin in what appeared to be the first conversation with the sitting leader of a major Western power in nearly two years. In that call, Scholz urged Putin to be open to negotiations with Ukraine but the Russian leader said any peace deal should acknowledge Russia’s territorial gains and security demands, including that Kyiv renounce joining NATO. Zelenskyy suggested the call to Putin risked opening 'a Pandora’s box' and would only serve to make Russia less isolated. He traveled to Berlin in October to meet Scholz to drum up support for his 'victory plan' to end the war in Ukraine on a tour of European capitals. The plan included a suggestion that Ukraine receive a formal invitation to join NATO and a request that Kyiv be given permission to use long-range Western missiles to strike at military targets inside Russia. Some Western nations granted permission for Kyiv to carry out long-range strikes with their weapons in November. Following the decision, Putin said Russia launched a strike on Ukraine with an unstoppable intermediate range ballistic missile dubbed the Oreshnik. It marked the first time that such a missile was used in the war or in any other conflict. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-germany-scholz-6b937199e732653dab0e1c4ed400b69c	2024-12-01T22:16:11-08:00	
56 people killed in stampede following clashes at a Guinea soccer match, authorities say	CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) — Fifty-six people were killed and several injured in a stampede at a soccer stadium in southern Guinea, following clashes between fans, Guinea’s government said Monday. Authorities are conducting an investigation to establish those responsible for the stampede on Sunday, Communications Minister Fana Soumah said in a statement read on national television. Among the victims are several children according to local media and a coalition of political parties. The stampede broke out on Sunday afternoon at the stadium in the city of Nzerekore during the final of a local tournament between the Labe and Nzerekore teams in honor of Guinea’s military leader, Mamadi Doumbouya, Guinea’s Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah said on the X platform. 'During the stampede, victims were recorded,' Bah said, without giving details. The regional authorities are working to restore calm in the area, he added. Local media reported that security forces tried to use tear gas (two words) to restore calm after the chaos that followed a disputed penalty. 'This (the disputed penalty) angered supporters who threw stones. This is how the security services used tear gas,' Media Guinea, a local news website, reported. It said several of those killed were children while some of the injured being treated at a regional hospital are in critical condition. Videos that appeared to be from the scene showed fans in a section of the stadium shouting and protesting the refereeing before clashes broke out as people poured onto the field. People were running as they tried to escape from the stadium, many of them jumping the high fence. Videos also showed many people lying on the floor in what looked like a hospital as a crowd gathered nearby, some assisting the wounded. The National Alliance for Alternation and Democracy opposition coalition called for an investigation. It said the tournament was organized to drum up support for the 'illegal and inappropriate' political ambitions of the military leader. Guinea has been led by the military since soldiers ousted President Alpha Conde in 2021. It is one of a growing number of West African countries, including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where the military has taken power and delayed a return to civilian rule. Doumbouya, who ousted the president three years ago, said he was preventing the country from slipping into chaos and chastised the previous government for broken promises. He has, however, been criticized for not meeting the expectations that he raised.	https://apnews.com/article/guinea-soccer-stampede-8663cce728047148546ad4030b1cedf8	2024-12-01T21:07:18-08:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mixed as Chinese stocks get a boost from strong factory orders	BANGKOK (AP) — World shares were mixed on Monday, with China leading gains as monthly surveys showed improving conditions for manufacturing, partly driven by a surge in orders ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next month. Oil prices rose and U.S. futures edged lower. Both official and private sector surveys of factory managers showed strong new orders and export orders, possibly partly linked to efforts by importers in the U.S. to beat potential tariff hikes by Trump once he takes office. On Saturday, Trump threatened 100% tariffs against the so-called BRIC bloc of nine nations if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar. The BRICs include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he wants the bloc to promise it won't create a new currency or otherwise try to undercut the U.S. dollar. 'Asia’s markets are riding a wave of optimism, catching a significant tailwind from Wall Street’s record-setting day on Friday and buoyed further by emerging signs that China’s economic funk might be easing,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. In early European trading, Germany's DAX was little changed at 19,626.00 and the CAC 40 in Paris sank 0.8% to 7,177.27. Britain's FTSE 100 edged 0.1% lower, to 8,279.24. The futures for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.2%. Innes noted that investors are also anticipating further moves by authorities in China to boost the economy ahead of Trump's inauguration next month. China's leaders usually convene an economic planning meeting in December, setting policy for the coming year. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.7% to 19,550.29, while the Shanghai Composite index jumped 1.1% to 3,363.98. Taiwan’s Taiex surged 2.1%. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.8% to 38,513.02, as the U.S. dollar regained some strength against the Japanese yen, boosting exporters. Toyota Motor Corp. gained 2.3%. Automaker Nissan Motor Co.'s shares initially fell, but they recovered those gains to close 0.4% higher as the company did not confirm reports saying its CFO, Stephen Ma, plans to step down as the company slashes jobs and production due to weakening sales in China and other markets. In South Korea, the Kospi slipped less than 0.1% to 2,454.48, while Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% higher to 8,447.90. In Bangkok, the SET jumped 0.7%. Friday's half-day post-Thanksgiving session ended with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.6% at 6,032.38, while the Dow gained 0.4% to 44,910.65. The Nasdaq added 0.8% to 19,218.17. Some retailers advanced as Black Friday unofficially kicked off the holiday shopping season, although retailers had been offering early deals for weeks. Macy’s and Best Buy each gained around 2%. Tesla shares rose 3.7% Friday and posted a monthly increase of more than 38%. The electric vehicle maker is expected to benefit from CEO Elon Musk’s support of Trump. Musk also gave a boost to Hasbro shares after he triggered takeover speculation when he asked in a post on X how much the toy and game company was worth. Hasbro, which owns the role-playing game Dungeon &amp; Dragons, rose 2%. Apple rose 1.1%. The technology giant is hoping recently added artificial intelligence features are enough to entice consumers to treat themselves or their relatives to a new iPhone for the holidays. Bitcoin, which has been nudging toward $100,000, was trading at 95,508.48 early Monday, according to Coin Desk. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 66 cents to $68.66 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 70 cents to $72.54 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 150.35 Japanese yen from 149.70 yen. The euro slipped to $1.0514 from $1.0589.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-bitcoin-tariffs-trump-39d3a25c25aa988e0501fe149b156920	2024-12-01T20:39:38-08:00	
Climate solution: Sails make a comeback in shipping, to dent its huge carbon footprint	SAINT-MALO, France (AP) — Had he continued working aboard fuel-powered cargo ships, Yann Jourdan reckons he'd be earning perhaps four times what he now gets as captain of a sailboat that instead uses the wind's clean energy to transport goods across the Atlantic. But the hit to Jourdan's pay is buying him peace of mind. When his 3-year-old son, Marcel, grows up, the burly French mariner wants to be able to explain what he did to make a dent in the the shipping industry's huge carbon footprint. The international merchant fleet of more than 100,000 ships transports more than 80% of global trade. But it's also responsible for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Without a quick switch from dirty fuels to cleaner energies, its pollution is forecast to soar. Mariners pushing for wind power say investors used to view them as something of a joke. But as they pioneer a comeback for sail-powered cargo ships, they're having the last laugh. 'It’s our job to prove that it’s possible,' Jourdan said aboard the new Grain de Sail II cargo carrier as it sailed off the French port of Saint-Malo one recent autumn day. 'For me, it’s just logical, you know?' he said. 'Like the petrol is limited quantity and the wind is not.' Modern tech is supercharging sailboats The cleanest of the new vessels spearheading wind's embryonic revival are almost pure-sail vessels like Grain de Sail II. Half the length of a soccer field and able to carry 350 tons of goods in its holds, it uses its diesel engine only to maneuver in and out of port. 'We want to not only reduce the carbon footprint, we want to kill it,' said Jacques Barreau, co-founder of the Grain de Sail firm with his twin brother, Olivier. They used profits from their chocolate-making and coffee-roasting business in western France to finance their first sail-powered cargo ship, Grain de Sail I. With its aluminum hull, two giant carbon-fibre masts, mechanized systems for hauling and adjusting the billowing sails, and its bridge bristling with high-tech navigation gear, Grain de Sail II is a supercharged modern successor to sailing clippers of yore. The speediest of its four crossings so far to New York took 17 days, and just 15 days on the return trip to Saint-Malo. 'It’s a totally different way of sailing,' Barreau said. He foresees a future with 'thousands of sailing cargo (vessels) like this one and even bigger versions.' Wind power even for giant carriers Wind-assisted systems to save fuel are also being fitted to engine-powered cargo ships, all the way up to the massive 340-meter (1,115-foot) Sea Zhoushan. It transports iron ore and was built in China with five large spinning rotors on its deck that harness wind energy. When the ship entered service in 2021, Brazilian mining giant Vale said it expects fuel savings of up to 8% on its 40-day voyages between Brazil and China. Finland's Norsepower, the rotor manufacturer, says it has installed them on 16 ships since fitting its first in 2014 and has installations for 13 more vessels on order. Although wind-assisted vessels are just a tiny fraction of the global fleet, their numbers are growing at unprecedented rates, says Clarksons Research, which tracks shipping data. By its count, 165 cargo ships are already using wind to some degree or are due to have wind-assisted systems installed. In the European Union, larger cargo ships have to start paying for some of their emissions from 2025 and adhere to new EU regulations that aim to promote low-carbon fuels. Such pressure could strengthen wind's appeal. 'Ultimately, wind-assisted propulsion is going to help with the global transition for even the largest segments of the cargo shipping sector,' said Bryan Comer, who heads up efforts to decarbonize shipping at the non-profit International Council on Clean Transportation. 'We know that it works, right? Shipping originally was completely wind-powered.' What happens when the wind doesn't blow? But wind — unlike engines — can't be switched on at the touch of a button. French shipper Neoline is open about the fact that when its new 136-meter (446-foot) carrier begins sailing in 2025, it will use its diesel engine when winds alone can't meet its target of 13-day crossings between the French port of Saint-Nazaire and Baltimore on the U.S. eastern seaboard. 'We're aiming for punctuality,' says Neoline’s president, Jean Zanuttini. 'It wasn't speed that killed working sailing at the start of the 20th century, it was lack of punctuality.' 'We accept and recognize the fact that about 30% of our energy will come from a diesel system,' he said. Still, the other 70% from the Neoliner's new type of giant sails — made with fiberglass panels, not canvas — is expected to slash its fuel-use and be another step forward for wind. 'We are going to learn and we are going to improve,' Zanuttini said. 'And tomorrow we'll build ships that are bigger, that are more specialized for certain goods, and more efficient at every level.' Grain de Sail III already on the drawing board After the commercial launch of Grain de Sail I in 2020 and of Grain de Sail II this March, the Barreau twins are working to finance a third boat, Grain de Sail III. It will double the length of its predecessor and carry eight times more cargo, driving down costs. Grain de Sail hopes to have it in service by 2027. But it says its core philosophy will remain unchanged: The bigger ship will also use only wind power, except to maneuver in ports. That rigor shrinks its vessels' carbon footprint to just a small fraction of the emissions from fuel-powered vessels, the firm says. With a large golden ring in his left ear and bushy beard, Jourdan has the look of a pirate as he scrutinizes Grain de Sail II's rigging and tugs on its ropes to check their tautness in the wind. He swears there'll be no going back to fuel-powered carriers for him. 'For me now, it’s a dirty business,' he said. 'I just want to do something that I’m proud of.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Chief of International Criminal Court lashes out at US and Russia over threats and accusations	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The president of the International Criminal Court lashed out at the United States and Russia for interfering with its investigations, calling threats and attacks on the court 'appalling.' 'The court is being threatened with draconian economic sanctions by another permanent member of the Security Council as if it was a terrorist organization,' Judge Tomoko Akane, in her address to the institution’s annual meeting, which opened on Monday. Akane was referring to remarks made by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, whose Republican party will control both branches of Congress in January, and who called the court a 'dangerous joke' and urged Congress to sanction its prosecutor. 'To any ally, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, if you try to help the ICC, we’re going to sanction you,' Graham said on Fox News. This marks the first time the global court of justice calls out a sitting leader of a major Western all. Graham was angered by an announcement last month that judges had granted a request from the court’s chief prosecutor Karim Khan to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief for crimes against humanity in connection with the nearly 14-month war in Gaza. The decision has been denounced by critics of the court and given only milquetoast approval by many of its supporters, a stark contrast to the robust backing of an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin last year over war crimes in Ukraine. Graham’s threat isn’t seen as just empty words. President-elect Donald Trump sanctioned the court’s previous prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, with a travel ban and asset freeze for investigating American troops and intelligence officials in Afghanistan. Akane on Monday also had harsh words for Russia. 'Several elected officials are being subjected to arrest warrants from a permanent member of the Security Council,' she said. Moscow issued warrants for Khan and others in response to the investigation into Putin. The Assembly of States Parties, which represents the ICC’s 124 member countries, will convene its 23rd conference to elect committee members and approve the court’s budget against a backdrop of unfavorable headlines. The ICC was established in 2002 as the world’s permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the most heinous atrocities — war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. The court only becomes involved when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute those crimes on their territory. To date, 124 countries have signed on to the Rome Statute, which created the institution. Those who have not include Israel, Russia and China. The ICC has no police force and relies on member states to execute arrest warrants. U.S. President Joe Biden called the warrants for Netanyahu and the former defense minister 'outrageous' and vowed to stand with Israel. A year ago, Biden called the warrant for Putin 'justified' and said the Russian president had committed war crimes. The U.S. is not an ICC member country. France said it would 'respect its obligations' but would need to consider Netanyahu’s possible immunities. When the warrant for Putin was announced, France said it would 'lend its support to the essential work' of the court. Another member country, Austria, begrudgingly acknowledged it would arrest Netanyahu but called the warrants 'utterly incomprehensible.' Italy called them 'wrong' but said it would be obliged to arrest him. Germany said it would study the decision. Member Hungary has said it would stand with Israel instead of the court. Global security expert Janina Dill worried that such responses could undermine global justice efforts. 'It really has the potential to damage not just the court, but international law,' she told The Associated Press. Milena Sterio, an expert in international law at Cleveland State University, told the AP that sanctions against the court could affect a number of people who contribute to the court’s work, such as international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Clooney advised the current prosecutor on his request for the warrants for Netanyahu and others. 'Sanctions are a huge burden,' Sterio said. Also hanging heavy over the meeting in the Hague, are the internal pressures that Khan faces. In October, the AP reported the 54-year-old British lawyer is facing allegations he tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her. Two co-workers in whom the woman confided reported the alleged misconduct in May to the court’s independent watchdog, which says it interviewed the woman and ended its inquiry after five days when she opted against filing a formal complaint. Khan was never questioned. He has denied the claims. The Assembly of States Parties has announced it will launch an external probe into the allegations. It’s not clear if the investigation will be addressed during the meeting. The court, which has long faced accusations of ineffectiveness, will have no trials pending after two conclude in December. While it has issued a number of arrest warrants in recent months, many high-profile suspects remain at large. Member states don't always act. Mongolia refused to arrest Putin when he visited in September. Sudan’s former President Omar al-Bashir is wanted by the ICC over accusations related to the conflict in Darfur, but his country has refused to hand him over. Last week, Khan requested a warrant for the head of Myanmar’s military regime, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, for attacks against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority. Judges have yet to decide on that request. 'It becomes very difficult to justify the court’s existence,' Sterio said.	https://apnews.com/article/icc-israel-gaza-arrest-court-meeting-d2b42db2919a4be879bd3df771a4113f	2024-12-01T20:09:04-08:00	
Before exiting, Biden heads to Africa to highlight his own counter to China. Will Trump take it up?	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — President Joe Biden is finally making his long-promised visit to Africa this week, attempting to showcase a U.S.-backed railway project in three countries that he has pushed as a new approach in countering some of China's global influence. Biden's first visit to the continent as president — which he left to the very end — will highlight the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies. That's a key field for U.S.-China competition and China has a stranglehold on Africa's critical minerals. A new strategy The U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer), $2.5 billion railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China’s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy that has surged ahead. The Biden administration has called the corridor one of the president’s signature initiatives. Biden starts a three-day trip to Angola on Monday, yet Lobito’s future and any change in the way the United States engages with a continent of 1.4 billion leaning heavily toward China depends on the incoming administration of Donald Trump. 'President Biden is no longer the story,' said Mvemba Dizolele, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. 'Even African leaders are focused on Donald Trump.' A fit for Trump's vision? The U.S. has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to the Lobito Corridor alongside financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks. 'A lot is riding on this in terms of its success and its replicability,' said Tom Sheehy, a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan federal research institution. He called it one of the flagships for the G7's new Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which was driven by Biden and aims to reach other developing nations as a response to China's Belt and Road. Biden promised to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit for the first time in nearly a decade in December 2022. The trip was kicked back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still low priority. The last U.S. president to visit was Barack Obama in 2015. 'Africa never gets top attention,' said Witney Schniedman, an expert on African economic growth at the nonprofit Brookings Institution. But many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which isn't due for completion until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration and be given a chance. It goes some way to blunting China, which has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump's to-do list. 'As long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it's going to keep being funded,' said Christian-Géraud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations. Some success in Africa The Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola's Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito, a route west for Africa's critical minerals. It's little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, because China is dominant in the mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world's cobalt, most of which is heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe have to rely on. Lobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola's long and strong ties with Beijing. China financed a previous redevelopment of the railway. The Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola's civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year, while the U.S. has a stronger stake in regional security through a strategic presence on the Atlantic Ocean, and Angolan President João Lourenço's role mediating in a conflict in eastern Congo. In Angola, Biden will announce new developments on health, agribusiness, security cooperation as well as the Lobito Corridor, White House officials said on a preview call with reporters. The visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president to Angola, will 'highlight that remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angola relationship,' Frances Brown, a special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said on a separate call. It will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America's value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden's trip to criticize the Lourenço government's authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while security and other laws have been passed in Angola that severely restrict freedoms, throwing some scrutiny on Washington's new African partnership. Will the U.S. really show up? Those calling for more U.S. presence in Africa say Angola and the Lobito spinoff show what might be achieved, even with China-facing countries, if the U.S. is willing to consistently engage. But they see signs for Africa when China has held a summit with African leaders every three years since 2000, while the US has had just two summits, in 2014 and 2022, and there are no plans for the next one. Michelle Gavin, a former U.S. ambassador to Botswana and adviser on Africa to Obama, said that the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend. She doesn't see Biden's visit and Lobito being a major 'inflection point' that will drive a new U.S. focus across Africa. 'It is not just about trying to blunt China, but trying to imagine, OK, what does it look like if we actually were to show up in a more serious way?' she said. 'It’s one project. It’s one good idea. And I’m very glad we’re doing it. It’s not enough.' ___ AP writers Will Weissert in Washington and Fatima Hussein in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-africa-angola-trump-china-cd30e0123d91bf520846b28ffeacef80	2024-12-01T20:05:09-08:00	
A bus crashed near a ski resort in southern France killing 2 people and injuring at least 33	MADRID (AP) — A bus crashed Sunday evening near a ski resort in the Pyrenees mountains in southern France, killing at least two people and injuring 33 others, local authorities said. A total of 47 people including the driver were on the bus when it crashed near the ski resort of Porte-Puymorens, the regional administration said. Seven people were in critical condition. Local authorities said a preliminary investigation showed the bus ran into a cliff, but the exact circumstances were not immediately clear. Images released by the local firefighter service showed the bus pressed against the side of a cliff, its right side partially crushed and windshield apparently knocked out. More than 120 individuals were involved in the rescue effort, including from neighboring Catalonia in Spain and Andorra. Helicopters were also deployed. France's Transport Minister François Durovray expressed his condolences in a post on X to the victims and their families. The injured were evacuated to French hospitals in Toulouse, Perpignan and Foix and Puigcerda in Catalonia, local authorities said. Catalonia's emergency services said on X that the bus originated from L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, outside Barcelona, Spain.	https://apnews.com/article/bus-crash-pyrenees-france-catalonia-893bdc4513d9f8b45484f6cf0e3814b5	2024-12-01T12:18:27-08:00	
Biden displays AIDS Memorial Quilt at White House to observe World AIDS Day	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Sunday displayed the AIDS Memorial Quilt on the White House South Lawn for the first time in observance of World AIDS Day. Gathered with the president and his wife, Jill, were survivors, family members and advocates to memorialize the lives lost to the epidemic. The president emphasized the federal government's support for the 1.2 million people in the United States living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which can lead to AIDS. 'This movement is fully woven into the fabric and history of America,' Biden said. 'For all the lives lost, for all those that are still alive, look at what you’ve already done to change the hearts and minds, to save lives across the country and around the world. That's the power of this movement.' There were 124 sections of the quilt on the lawn to commemorate people who died due to AIDS-related illnesses. Conceived in 1985, the quilt made its public first appearance in 1987. There was also a red ribbon, a symbol of support and awareness for those with HIV and AIDS, draped across the South Portico of the White House. There are 40 million people around the world with HIV, according to the White House. Introducing Biden was Jeanne White-Ginder, whose son, Ryan White, contracted AIDS through a tainted blood transfusion at the age of 13 and died in 1990 at the age of 18. She said her son's experience taught America that 'we needed to fight AIDS and not the people who have it.' The Ryan White CARE Act became law in 1990 and White-Grinder recalled being at the U.S. Capitol to speak for the measure and met Biden when he was a senator from Delaware. The president also saluted Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert until leaving the government in 2022. Fauci was in attendance at the event because of his work on HIV/AIDS, though he's known by much of the country for his efforts to address the coronavirus pandemic that made him a target of criticism by many Republican lawmakers. The Biden administration has sought to make investments to stop the epidemic and the stigmas attached to people with HIV. Among other steps, it has worked to expand access to PrEP, or the pre-exposure prophylaxis, which at-risk populations use to prevent HIV infections.	https://apnews.com/article/bide-aids-quilt-memorial-white-house-5781fad01eb3f4f32baa8da4d9e94208	2024-12-01T12:09:27-08:00	
Taiwan's president visits East-West think tank as China criticizes his 2-day visit to Hawaii	HONOLULU (AP) — Taiwan's president visited a U.S. State Department-funded think tank and educational institution Sunday on the second day of a two-day visit to Hawaii that's part of a Pacific island tour that has already triggered criticism from Beijing. Lai Ching-te met and exchanged gifts with the president of the East-West Center, which is on the University of Hawaii's flagship Manoa campus. He spoke to an audience at the center but journalists were escorted out of a conference hall before he began speaking. China’s Foreign Ministry said it 'strongly condemned' U.S. support for Lai’s visit and had lodged a complaint with the U.S. It also denounced a newly announced U.S. weapons sale to Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as its own territory. 'China will closely monitor the situation’s development, and take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,' said the statement. Hawaii was Lai's first stop on a weeklong voyage that will later take him to the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau. They account for three of the 12 countries that Taipei has formal diplomatic relations with. Suzanne Puanani Vares-Lum, president of the East-West Center, said her institution is the perfect place for Lai to visit because it promotes relations among the United States, Asia and the Pacific. She said it's not unusual for leaders from around the world to come to Hawaii given the state's location and what makes it special. 'There is something about Hawaii that allows us to really just see where we connect on a human to human level,' Vares-Lum said in an interview. Lai's predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, visited the East-West Center in 2019 and 2017. On Saturday, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green hosted Lai at the state's emergency management agency where they discussed disaster preparedness. Green, who was an emergency room physician before becoming governor, posted on social media that he and Lai discussed how their experiences in health care informed their governance. Lai is also a physician by training and obtained a Master of Public Health degree from Harvard University. 'Together, we extended a warm aloha to Lai and his delegation, highlighting Hawai'i’s shared values of resilience and collaboration with Taiwan,' Green said in an Instagram post. Lai also posed for photos with Hawaii congressional representatives and state lawmakers at a dinner banquet with the Taiwanese American community. U.S. Rep. Ed Case, a Democrat who represents Honolulu in Congress, said on social media that he told the audience that 'our ties endured on shared values and interests to advance mutual goals and meet shared challenges.' It is unclear whether Lai with meet with any senior officials from the Biden administration or anyone from the incoming Trump administration during his Hawaii stay. President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg in July that Taiwan should pay for its defense. The island has purchased billions of dollars of defense weaponry from the U.S. Trump evaded answering whether he would defend the island from Chinese military action. The new arms announced by the U.S. State Department Friday include $385 million in spare parts and equipment for a fleet of F-16s, as well as support for tactical communication system to Taiwan. The U.S. is obligated to help the island defend itself under the Taiwan Relations Act but maintains a position of strategic ambiguity over whether it would ever get involved if Taiwan were to be invaded by China. Tsai drew vocal opposition from China when she stopped in New York last year on her way to Latin America. She met with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the time. The Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as a 'stern warning' over what it called collusion between 'separatists and foreign forces' days after Lai, then Taiwan’s vice president, stopped over in the U.S. China also strongly objects to leading American politicians visiting the island as it views any official contact with foreign governments and Taiwan as an infringement on its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-us-china-lai-ching-te-hawaii-guam-7abcd0e5803fdb7f20615fd394aca91b	2024-12-01T11:51:25-08:00	
Canada's ambassador says Trudeau told Trump the Canadian border can't be compared to Mexico's	TORONTO (AP) — Canada's ambassador to the United States said Sunday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was successful in getting President-elect Donald Trump and key Cabinet nominees to understand that lumping Canada in with Mexico over the flow of drugs and migrants into the U.S. is unfair. Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador in Washington, told The Associated Press in an interview that Trudeau's dinner with Trump on Friday was a very important step in trying to get Trump to back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner. Hillman was at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and sat at an adjacent table to Trudeau and Trump. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if they don’t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders. He said in a social media post last Monday he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders. Hillman said Trudeau asked to see Trump in person in a phone call Monday and Trump invited him to dinner on Friday. At the dinner, Hillman said the case was made to Trump that there is no comparison between the Canada-U.S. border and Mexico-U.S. border. 'The message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood,' Hillman said. Hillman said the bulk of Friday night's dinner centered around Trump's border concerns. The ambassador said a priority of Trudeau's was to point out the degree of difference. Hillman said there really is no comparison, noting there is essentially zero trafficking of fentanyl from Canada to the United States. She said there are seizures but authorities say those are personal use seizures and not criminal trafficking. She said that 99.8% of the fentanyl seized by U.S. authorities in the U.S. comes from Mexico. 'Also with respect to individuals, illegal individuals crossing illegally, Canada last year was less than one percent, 0.6 percent were of total interceptions from Canada,' Hillman said. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024 — and Hillman said the migrant numbers are coming down since the summer. 'The facts are hard to deny,' Hillman said. But Hillman said Canada is ready to make new investments in border security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers. She also noted an agreement between Canada and the United States that allows for migrants caught crossing illegally into the United States to be sent back to Canada. She said that was talked about. She said Mexico and the U.S. do not have a similar agreement. At the dinner that lasted three hours, Hillman said America's trade deficit with Canada was also raised. Hillman said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and prices have been high. 'Trade balances are something that he focuses so it’s important to engage in that conversation but to put it into context,' Hillman said. 'We are one tenth the size of the United States so a balanced trade deal would mean per capita we are buying 10 times more from the U.S. than they are buying from us. If that’s his metric we will certainly engage on that.' Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump’s pick to lead the Interior Department, Mike Waltz, Trump’s choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men’s wives. Also at the dinner were David McCormick, just elected U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, and his wife, Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump, as well as Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose responsibilities include border security, and Katie Telford, Trudeau’s chief of staff. Hillman said Canadian and incoming Trump administration officials will work on Trump's concerns in the coming weeks. Trump called the talks 'productive' on Sunday in a social media post but signaled no retreat from his tariff pledge. Hillman said Trump and Trudeau 'get along well' and the dinner was also a chance to socialize. She said Trump used his iPad to play music and she said Trump told Trudeau he's a big fan of Canadian singer Celine Dion. 'I don’t think it could have been better to be frank. Okay, I’ll take that back, I’ll change that. If he obviously said there would be no tariffs that would have been better but there was no realistic expectation of that,' Hillman said. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trudeau-united-states-trump-tariffs-42878c1cac442fc7a51c36fbc5fc78a3	2024-12-01T11:17:18-08:00

Negotiators fail to reach an agreement on a plastic pollution treaty. Talks to resume next year	BUSAN, South Korea (AP) — Negotiators working on a treaty to address the global crisis of plastic pollution won’t reach an agreement in South Korea and are making plans to resume the talks next year. They are at an impasse over whether the treaty should reduce the total plastic on Earth and put global, legally binding controls on toxic chemicals used to make plastics. The negotiations in Busan, South Korea, were supposed to be the last round and produce the first legally binding treaty on plastics pollution, including in the oceans, by the end of 2024. But with time running out early Monday, negotiators are making plans to resume the talks next year. More than 100 countries want the treaty to limit production as well as tackle cleanup and recycling, and many have said that is essential to address chemicals of concern. But for some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, that crosses a red line. For any proposal to make it into the treaty, every nation must agree to it. Some countries sought to change the process so decisions could be made with a vote if consensus couldn’t be reached, but India, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and others opposed changing it. On Sunday, the last scheduled day of talks, the treaty draft still had multiple options for several key sections. Some delegates and environmental organizations said it had become too watered down, including negotiators from Africa who said they would rather leave Busan without a treaty than with a weak one. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Serie A title race loses significance after Fiorentina player collapses on field	MILAN (AP) — The Italian league title race didn’t seem so important on Sunday after a player collapsed on the field during a Serie A match. League leader Napoli had won 1-0 at Torino earlier in the day and was waiting to see how its rivals would fare, especially Fiorentina and Inter Milan, which were playing each other later Sunday and were just four points behind. However, Fiorentina midfielder Edoardo Bove fell to the ground in the 16th minute of the match, which was abandoned shortly afterward with the scoreline at 0-0. The 22-year-old Bove was swiftly stretchered off to an ambulance and taken to hospital. There has been no update so far from his club on the player's condition. Fiorentina players were distraught on the field and were comforted by staff members as well as Inter players. Several were openly sobbing before both teams filed off the field. Napoli on top Napoli will end the weekend still top of a tight Serie A table, while at least one of its opponents dropped points. Scott McTominay scored the only goal of the match in the first half as Napoli pulled away from one of its closest rivals as Lazio lost 3-1 at relegation-threatened Parma. Lazio stayed on 28 points along with Atalanta, Inter and Fiorentina, while Napoli moved onto 32. Atalanta visits Roma on Monday. It was an entertaining match at Torino where Napoli broke the deadlock in the 31st minute. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia kept possession as he made his way into the area from the left before laying the ball off to McTominay for the Scotland midfielder to drive into the near bottom corner. Torino should have leveled almost immediately when Saul Coco just had to bundle the ball into an empty net from close range but somehow fell over it instead. Napoli had numerous chances to extend its advantage but Vanja Milinkovic-Savic was in impressive form in the Torino goal. Surprise loss Lazio’s run of seven straight wins had been brought to an end by a draw against Ludogorets in the Europa League midweek and it was worse on Sunday as it fell to its first loss since October. Lazio had two goals disallowed and a penalty revoked after a VAR check in a frustrating first half for the visitors. Parma inched four points clear of the drop zone with the win. First win for Vieira Patrick Vieira recorded his first win as Genoa coach with a 2-0 victory at Udinese, which played almost the entire match with 10 men. Udinese defender Isaak Touré’s match lasted just 120 second before he was sent off for elbowing Genoa’s Alessandro Zanoli in the face. Andrea Pinamonti fired Genoa in front in the 13th minute and an own goal from Udinese defender Lautaro Giannetti in the second half all but sealed the result. Vieira was hired during the international break to replace the fired Alberto Gilardino and his debut last week ended in a 2-2 draw against Cagliari. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/napoli-fiorentina-inter-lazio-serie-a-49b5971acb7c97b3fe5e9c71b169fd88	2024-12-01T07:28:29-08:00	
Israeli strikes hit southern Lebanon, but tense ceasefire holds	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli jets Sunday launched an airstrike over a southern Lebanese border village, while troops shelled other border towns and villages still under Israeli control, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported. The attacks come days after a US-brokered ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike in the village of Yaroun, nor did the Hezbollah militant group. Israel continues to call on displaced Lebanese not to return to dozens of southern villages in this current stage of the ceasefire. It also continues to impose a daily curfew for people moving across the Litani River between 5 pm and 7 am. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and the Lebanese military have been critical of Israeli strikes and overflights since the ceasefire went into effect, accusing Israel of violating the agreement. The military said it had filed complaints, but no clear military action has been taken by Hezbollah in response, meaning that the tense cessation of hostilities has not yet broken down. When Israel has issued statements about these strikes, it says they were done to thwart possible Hezbollah attacks. The United States military announced Friday that Major General Jasper Jeffers alongside senior U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein will co-chair a new U.S.-led monitoring committee that includes France, the UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL, Lebanon, and Israel. Hochstein led over a year of shuttle diplomacy to broker the ceasefire deal, and his role will be temporary until a permanent civilian co-chair is appointed. Lebanon meanwhile is trying to pick up the pieces and return to some level of normal life after the war that decimated large swaths of its south and east, displacing an estimated 1.2 million people. The Lebanese military said it detonated unexploded munitions left over from Israeli strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon. Elsewhere, the Lebanese Civil Defense said it removed five bodies from under the rubble in two southern Lebanese towns over the past 24 hours. The first phase of the ceasefire is a 60-day cessation of hostilities where Hezbollah militants are supposed to withdraw from southern Lebanon north of the Litani River and Israeli troops withdraw from southern Lebanon into northern Israel. Lebanese troops are to deploy in large numbers in the south, effectively being the only armed force in control of the south alongside UNIFIL peacekeepers. But challenges still remain at this current stage. Many families who want to bury their dead deep in southern Lebanon are unable to do so at this point. The Lebanese Health Ministry and military allocated a plot of land in the coastal city of Tyre for those people to be temporarily laid to rest. Dr. Wissam Ghazal of the Health Ministry in Tyre said almost 200 bodies have been temporarily buried in that plot of land, until the situation near the border calms down. 'Until now, we haven’t been able to go to our village, and our hearts are burning because our martyrs are buried in this manner,' said Om Ali, who asked to be called by a nickname that means 'Ali’s mother' in Arabic. Her husband was a combatant killed in the war from the border town of Aita el-Shaab, just a stone’s throw from the tense border. 'We hope the crisis ends soon so we can go and bury them properly as soon as possible, because truly, leaving the entrusted ones buried in a non-permanent place like this is very difficult,' she said. In the meantime, cash-strapped Lebanon is trying to fundraise as much money as it can to help rebuild the country the war cost some $8.5 billion in damages and losses according to the World Bank, and to help recruit and train troops to deploy 10,000 personnel into southern Lebanon. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri also called for parliament to convene to elect a president next month to break a gridlock of over two years and reactivate the country's crippled state institutions. — Chehayeb reported from Beirut.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-war-ceasefire-tyre-ae002af23c7ec9e19a0cea08fecc9f62	2024-12-01T06:41:45-08:00	
A new Belgium law gives sex workers contracts, benefits and safety protection	PARIS (AP) — Starting Sunday, sex workers in Belgium will be able to sign formal employment contracts and gain labor rights on par with those in other professions in a legal breakthrough some call a 'revolution.' The new law also establishes fundamental rights for sex workers including the right to refuse clients, choose their practices and stop an act at any moment. The move follows the country’s 2022 decision to decriminalize sex work. Under the new regulations, sex workers will have access to health insurance, paid leave, maternity benefits, unemployment support and pensions. The legislation also establishes rules on working hours, pay and safety measures, addressing a long-standing gap in legal protections for those in the industry. 'This is an incredible step forward,' said Isabelle Jaramillo, coordinator of Espace P, an advocacy group involved in drafting the legislation. 'It means their profession can finally be recognized as legitimate by the Belgian state.' 'From the employer’s perspective, this will also be a revolution. They’ll have to apply for a state authorization to hire sex workers,' Jaramillo said. 'Under the previous legislation, hiring someone for sex work automatically made you a pimp, even if the arrangement was consensual,' said Jaramillo. 'Now, They’ll have to apply for state authorization to hire employees.' Employers must now obtain authorization, adhere to strict safety protocols, and meet background requirements, including no prior convictions for sexual assault or human trafficking. They must provide clean linens, condoms, and hygiene products, and install emergency buttons in workspaces. Independent sex work remains permitted, but unregulated third-party hiring or violations of the legal framework will be prosecuted. Critics argue the law cannot fully address the stigma and risks tied to the trade, especially for undocumented sex workers. 'There’s still a lot of work to be done,' said Jaramillo, emphasizing the need for better police and judicial training to protect marginalized workers. While countries such as Germany and the Netherlands have legalized sex work, none have implemented labor protections as comprehensive as Belgium’s.	https://apnews.com/article/belgium-sex-workers-social-protection-health-2f935f414572517d74a46c682419f20b	2024-12-01T05:03:36-08:00	
Sectarian violence has killed at least 130 people in Pakistan’s northwest in the last 10 days	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Sectarian violence has killed at least 130 people and wounded 200 others in Pakistan’s northwest in the last 10 days, officials said Sunday. Violence flared in Kurram district on Nov. 21 when gunmen ambushed a vehicle convoy and killed 52 people, mostly Shiite Muslims. Nobody claimed responsibility for the assault, which triggered retaliatory firing and arson by rival groups in several areas. Over the past 24 hours alone, 14 people have died and 27 have been injured in fighting. Government officials brokered a seven-day ceasefire on Nov. 24 but it didn’t hold. Shiite Muslims dominate parts of the district, although they are a minority in the rest of the country. They generally live peacefully alongside Sunni Muslims, who are the majority in Pakistan. But dozens from both sides have been killed in Kurram since July, when a land dispute turned into general sectarian violence. The deputy commissioner of Kurram, Javed Ullah Mehsud, said talks were underway with tribal elders to negotiate a ceasefire and that security personnel had been deployed to enforce the peace. Mehsud also said that authorities have restored internet and mobile services in the area. But the main highway linking the city of Parachinar with the provincial capital Peshawar remains closed to all traffic, leading to shortages of food, fuel and medicine. Trade and movement at the Kharlachi border with Afghanistan has stopped. Kurram elder Mir Afzal Khan said the violence had affected all aspects of life. People were unable to travel and the scarcity of food and medicine was causing significant hardship, he added. Kurram is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where armed groups like the Pakistani Taliban operate. The Pakistani army said Sunday that eight militants had died in separate operations in the province.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-sectarian-clashes-kurram-death-toll-25716632b51657063cc4203739de7f72	2024-12-01T04:25:09-08:00	
Bangladesh court acquits key political figure in 2004 deadly grenade attack	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh’s High Court on Sunday acquitted former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia’s son, Tarique Rahman, and overturned a verdict against him over a deadly 2004 grenade attack on a political rally. The ruling comes at a critical time as the South Asian country suffers political tension after long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country to India in August following a mass uprising that left hundreds dead. Rahman serves as the acting chairperson of Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party while in self-exile in London, and he could become Bangladesh's next leader if his party is voted into power. Rahman and 48 others were found guilty in 2018 in the attack targeting a rally held by supporters of Sheikh Hasina, who led the opposition at the time, leaving two dozen people dead and wounding about 300 others. A court sentenced 19 of them to death while Rahman got life in prison, with Zia's party accusing the ruling of being politically motivated. A two-member judge panel scrapped Sunday the entire 2018 ruling for all 49 men, following an appeal lodged by the defendants. Shishir Monir, a defense lawyer, told reporters the court declared the trial and verdict 'illegal'. 'As a result, all defendants have been acquitted,' he said. Zia, who ruled the country as prime minister between 2001-2006, and Hasina are the country's most powerful politicians and long-time rivals. Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has been chosen as the country’s interim leader since Hasina's escape, but authorities have been struggling to enforce order amid mob justice, chaos and claims of systematic targeting of minority groups, particularly Hindus, which Yunus said are 'exaggerated.' Hasina’s Awami League party blasted the court ruling in a Facebook post on Sunday, saying it wasn't 'Yunus’ Kangaroo court' and that the people of Bangladesh would be the ones trying those responsible for the attacks. Zia's party welcomed Sunday's ruling. The attorney general’s office can appeal the ruling in the country's Supreme Court. The Yunus-led government has not declared any timeframe for the next election, but Rahman and his party want the new election sometime soon. Meanwhile, Jamaat-e-Islami party, which shared power with Zia’s party in 2001-2006 with important portfolios in the Cabinet, said it wants to allow the Yunus-led government to stay in power to bring in reforms in various sectors before a new election. Hasina faces charges of crimes against humanity for deaths during the summer's student-led uprising. The interim government has sought help from Interpol to arrest Hasina. It is not clear if India will respond to any request from Bangladesh for Hasina’s extradition under a mutual treaty.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-grenade-attack-hasina-khaleda-zia-tarique-1a7e519a9bc3358d528e8e377561906a	2024-12-01T04:12:39-08:00	
Over 40 people hospitalized in Georgia during protests over the suspension of EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — A third night of protests in the Georgian capital against the government’s decision to suspend negotiations to join the European Union left 44 people hospitalized, officials said Sunday. Tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the parliament Saturday night, throwing stones and setting off fireworks, while police deployed water cannons and tear gas. An effigy of the founder of the governing Georgian Dream party, Bidzina Ivanishvili — a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — was burned in front of the legislature. Georgia’s Interior Ministry said Sunday that 27 protesters, 16 police and one media worker were hospitalized. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze warned that 'any violation of the law will be met with the full rigor of the law.' 'Neither will those politicians who hide in their offices and sacrifice members of their violent groups to severe punishment escape responsibility,' he said at a briefing Sunday. He insisted it wasn't true that Georgia’s European integration had been halted. 'The only thing we have rejected is the shameful and offensive blackmail, which was, in fact, a significant obstacle to our country’s European integration.' The government’s announcement came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing last month’s general election in Georgia as neither free nor fair. Kobakhidze also dismissed the U.S. State Department’s statement Saturday that it was suspending its strategic partnership with Georgia. The statement condemned Georgia’s decision to halt its efforts toward EU accession. 'You can see that the outgoing administration is trying to leave the new administration with as difficult a legacy as possible. They are doing this regarding Ukraine, and now also concerning Georgia,' Kobakhidze said. 'This will not have any fundamental significance. We will wait for the new administration and discuss everything with them.' Kobakhidze also confirmed that Georgia’s ambassador to the U.S., David Zalkaliani, had become the latest of a number of diplomats to stand down since the protests started. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and enlargement commissioner Marta Kos released a joint statement Sunday on the Georgian government’s decision to suspend negotiations. 'We note that this announcement marks a shift from the policies of all previous Georgian governments and the European aspirations of the vast majority of the Georgian people, as enshrined in the Constitution of Georgia,' the statement said. It reiterated the EU's 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country' and urged Georgian authorities to 'respect the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, and refrain from using force against peaceful protesters, politicians and media representatives.' The ruling Georgian Dream party’s disputed victory in the Oct. 26 parliamentary election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s aspirations to join the EU, has sparked major demonstrations and led to an opposition boycott of parliament. The opposition has said that the vote was rigged with the help of Russia, Georgia’s former imperial master, with Moscow hoping to keep Tbilisi in its orbit. Speaking to The Associated Press on Saturday, Georgia's pro-Western President Salome Zourabichvili said that her country was becoming a 'quasi-Russian' state and that Georgian Dream controlled the major institutions. 'We are not demanding a revolution. We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again,' Zourabichvili said. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc’s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-protest-election-russia-eu-38130a4f4e67f494c1d7e9f312866f7c	2024-12-01T03:36:05-08:00	
Ireland's incumbent parties look likely to hang on to power after a fractured election	DUBLIN (AP) — Ireland’s two long-dominant center-right parties looked likely to form a new government as results came in Sunday from a fractured national election, though with a reduced vote share and complex coalition negotiations ahead. In an exception to the global anti-incumbent mood, outgoing governing parties Fianna Fail and Fine Gael were on course to be the two biggest parties in the 174-seat Dáil, the lower house of parliament, with left-of-center opposition Sinn Fein running third. No party will have enough seats to govern on its own, and the most likely outcome is a coalition between Fianna Fail, led by Micheál Martin, and Fine Gael under outgoing Prime Minister Simon Harris. In that case either Harris or Martin — or possibly both, if they strike a job-sharing deal — will become Ireland's next premier, known as the taoiseach. Sinn Fein, which aims to reunify the Republic of Ireland with the U.K. territory of Northern Ireland, lacks a clear path to power because the other two parties say they won’t work with it, partly because of its historic ties with the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Ireland uses a complex system of proportional representation in which each of the country’s 43 constituencies elects several lawmakers and voters rank candidates in order of preference. As a result, it can take days for full results to be known. 'The people of Ireland have now spoken,' Harris said. 'We now have to work out exactly what they have said, and that is going to take a little bit of time.' The cost of living — especially Ireland’s acute housing crisis — was a dominant topic in the three-week campaign, alongside immigration, which has become an emotive and challenging issue in a country of 5.4 million people long defined by emigration. The results of Friday's election mean Ireland has partly bucked the global trend of incumbents being rejected by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures. The next government, like the last, will likely be led by two parties that have dominated Irish politics for the past century. Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have similar policies, but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland’s 1920s civil war. After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat, they formed a coalition, propped up by the Green Party. The Greens had a disappointing election and looked set to lose many of their 12 seats. This time, the winning parties may turn to left-leaning Labour or the Social Democrats, or to independent lawmakers, for support. For all the focus on migration, anti-immigration independents made few breakthroughs. Ireland does not have a significant far-right party to capitalize on the issue. Reelected Fine Gael lawmaker Paschal Donohoe said the main theme of the election was 'one of the center holding.' Nonetheless, the new government will face huge pressure to ease rising homelessness, driven by soaring rents and property prices, and to better absorb a growing number of asylum-seekers. The big parties' share of the vote continues to decline, and voter disaffection expressed itself in support for small parties and independent candidates. One of the more unorthodox independents was reputed organized crime boss Gerry 'the Monk' Hutch, who saw a groundswell of support after he was bailed on money-laundering charges in Spain in November in order to run for election. Hutch, who last year was acquitted of killing a gangland rival, came within a whisker of winning a seat in Dublin. ___ Lawless reported from London.	https://apnews.com/article/ireland-election-fine-gael-fianna-fail-sinn-fein-b7b632a04e7eb5df9a54b9766ed7b7b3	2024-12-01T03:02:31-08:00	
Syrian military launches counterattacks in an attempt to halt insurgents' surprise advance	BEIRUT (AP) — The Syrian military rushed reinforcements to the country's northwest and launched airstrikes on a major city Sunday in an attempt to push back insurgents who seized the country's largest city of Aleppo in a surprise offensive in recent days. The insurgency, led by jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, launched their campaign on Wednesday with a two-pronged attack on Aleppo and the countryside around Idlib, before moving toward neighboring Hama province. On Sunday, government troops created a 'strong defensive line' in northern Hama, according to Britain-based opposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, as they attempted to stall the insurgents' momentum. Meanwhile, jets pounded the cities of Idlib and Aleppo, killing at least 15 people, according to a group that operates in opposition-held areas. The surge in fighting has raised the prospect of another violent, destabilizing front reopening in the Middle East at a time when Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, conflicts that have repeatedly threatened to ignite an even wider regional war. It also risks drawing Russia and Turkey — each with its own interests to protect in Syria — into direct heavy fighting against each other. The insurgents announced their offensive Wednesday, just as a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel began, raising some hope that tensions in the region might be calming. The surprise offensive is a huge embarrassment for Syrian President Bashar Assad — whose forces have been fighting insurgents in a civil war since 2011. It comes at a time when his allies — Iran and groups it backs and Russia — are preoccupied with their own conflicts. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is expected in the Syrian capital of Damascus later Sunday. He told reporters that Tehran will back the Syrian government and army. Arab leaders, including Jordan’s King Abdullah II and United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, also called Assad to express their solidarity. Opposition troops advance The insurgents took over most of Aleppo on Saturday and made gains in the surrounding province, including capturing a military academy and a strategic town that lies on the highway linking the city with Damascus and the coast. Elsewhere, rebel commander Col. Hassan Abdulghani said the insurgents advanced in the countryside around Idlib, putting all of the province of the same name under their control. They also claimed to have entered the city of Hama, but there was no independent confirmation of that. Abdulghani said 65 Syrian troops were taken prisoner in eastern Aleppo. The insurgents vowed to push all the way into Damascus, but life in the Syrian capital remained normal with no signs of panic. In southeastern Aleppo, however, the main road out of the city was gridlocked as people fled the fighting, and gas stations in the area were short on fuel. Turkey, a main backer of Syrian opposition groups, said its diplomatic efforts had failed to stop Syrian government attacks on opposition-held areas in recent weeks. Turkish security officials said a limited offensive by the rebels was planned to stop government attacks and allow civilians to return, but the offensive expanded as Syrian government forces began to retreat from their positions. The United Nations special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said the push by the rebels poses a risk to regional security and called on resuming diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN’s 'State of the Union' that the U.S., which has about 900 troops in Syria, is watching the situation carefully. The American forces, which are in the northeast and far from Aleppo, are guarding against a resurgence by the extremist Islamic State group. The group leading the rebel advance is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., and Sullivan said Washington has 'real concerns about the designs and objectives of that organization.' 'At the same time, of course, we don’t cry over the fact that the Assad government, backed by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, are facing certain kinds of pressure,' he added. Syrian troops fortify northern Hama as jets pound Idlib According to Syrian state news agency SANA and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the army overnight pushed back insurgents in the northern countryside of Hama province. Syrian state media said government resupply included heavy equipment and rocket launchers while Syrian and Russian airstrikes targeted weapon depots and insurgent strongholds. Pro-government radio station Sham FM said the Syrian army shot down drones belonging to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in northern Hama. Syrian state television claimed government forces had killed nearly 1,000 insurgents over the past three days, without providing evidence or details. Government airstrikes in Idlib killed at least three civilians, including two children, and wounded 11 others, said the Syrian Civil Defense, known as the White Helmets, which operates in opposition-held areas. Airstrikes also struck in and around Aleppo, including near a hospital in the city center, killing 12 people, including at least eight civilians, according to the White Helmets and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In a call with foreign officials, Assad vowed to defeat the insurgency. 'Terrorism only understands the language of force, which is the language we will break and eliminate it with, regardless of its supporters and sponsors,' he said. The 2016 battle for Aleppo was a turning point in the war between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters after 2011 protests against Assad’s rule turned into an all-out war. After appearing to be losing control of the country to the rebels, the Aleppo battle secured Assad’s hold on strategic areas of Syria, with opposition factions and their foreign backers controlling areas on the periphery.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-aleppo-hama-assad-hts-iran-a8d7ddd45d3cb6b7aa943957b2ac6d9a	2024-12-01T01:20:09-08:00	
Putin signs off record Russian defense spending as top EU officials visit Kyiv	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin approved budget plans, raising 2025 military spending to record levels as Moscow seeks to prevail in the war in Ukraine. Around 32.5% of the budget posted on a government website Sunday has been allocated for national defense, amounting to 13.5 trillion rubles (over $145 billion), up from a reported 28.3% this year. Lawmakers in both houses of the Russian parliament, the State Duma and Federation Council, had already approved the plans in the past 10 days. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine since February 2022 is Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II and has drained the resources of both sides. Kyiv has been getting billions of dollars in help from its Western allies, but Russia's forces are bigger and better equipped, and in recent months the Russian army has gradually been pushing Ukrainian troops backward in eastern areas. New EU leaders in Kyiv pledge continued support for Ukraine New European Council President Antonio Costa and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas arrived in Kyiv on Sunday, marking their first day in office with a strong message of support for Ukraine. Their visit comes as doubts are deepening over what Kyiv can expect from a new U.S. administration led by Donald Trump. 'From day one of the war, the EU has stood by the side of Ukraine,' Costa posted on X, together with a photo of himself, Kallas and EU enlargement chief Marta Kos. 'From day one of our mandate, we are reaffirming our unwavering support to the Ukrainian people.' Speaking at a news conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Costa reiterated the EU's recent commitment to help Ukraine continue through the war, including €4.2 billion ($4.4 billion) to support Ukraine’s budget and €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) of assistance every month from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets. Asked whether the EU would step up funding if Trump withdrew support, Costa said the block would 'stand for Ukraine as long as necessary.' Zelenskyy said that any future ceasefire negotiations with Russia would need to include representatives from the EU and NATO, because Ukraine seem its future security in both alliances. However, he said he failed to see what any such negotiations would focus on, adding that Ukraine would 'never legally recognize any occupation of our lands by the Russian Federation.' He urged the outgoing Biden administration to use the remaining two months in office to exert influence 'over those few European skeptics about our future. I see nothing, I personally see no risks, and most NATO countries see no risks from the recommendation regarding the positive future of Ukraine’s membership in NATO.' Zelenskyy said Friday that an offer of NATO membership to territory under Kyiv’s control would end 'the hot stage of the war.' 3 killed in Ukraine and a child dies in a drone attack in Russia On the ground in Ukraine, three people died in the southern city of Kherson when a Russian drone struck a minibus on Sunday morning, regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin said. Seven others were wounded in the attack. Meanwhile, the number of wounded in Saturday's missile strike in Dnipro in central Ukraine rose to 24, with seven in serious condition, Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Serhiy Lysak said. Four people were killed in the attack. Moscow sent 78 drones into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine’s air force, 32 drones were destroyed and a further 45 drones were lost, likely having been electronically jammed. In Russia, a child was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack in the Bryansk region bordering Ukraine, according to regional Gov. Alexander Bogomaz. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that 29 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight into Sunday in four regions of western Russia: 20 over the Bryansk region, seven over the Kaluga region, and one each over the Smolensk and Kursk regions. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-budget-defense-spending-putin-drone-3a1a73c559b250ec26190edd9332100c	2024-12-01T00:53:00-08:00	
Social democrats gain and incumbents are punished in Iceland's election	REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) — Voters in Iceland joined a global trend of punishing incumbents in a parliamentary election, with a center-left party winning the largest share of votes in the North Atlantic island nation. With all the votes tallied on Sunday, the Social Democratic Alliance had won 15 seats in the 63-seat parliament, the Althingi — more than doubling its total — and secured almost 21% of votes, according to national broadcaster RUV. The conservative Independence Party, which led the outgoing government, had 14 seats and a 19.4% vote share, and the centrist Liberal Reform Party 11 seats and about 16% of votes. Three other parties also won seats. Social Democrat leader Kristrún Mjöll Frostadóttir, 36, will likely try to seek coalition partners to command a parliamentary majority. Icelanders voted Saturday after disagreements over immigration, energy policy and the economy forced Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson to pull the plug on his coalition government and call an early election. Counting was delayed in some areas by snowstorms that blocked roads and slowed delivery of ballot boxes to count centers. Since the 2008 financial crisis devastated the economy and ushered in a new era of political instability, Iceland has been governed by multi-party coalitions of various hues. Like many Western countries, Iceland has been buffeted by the rising cost of living and immigration pressures, and voters are taking it out on incumbent governments. Benediktsson’s Independence Party and its coalition partners in the outgoing government, the Progressive Party and the Left Greens, all saw their vote share and seat count decline, with the Left Greens losing all eight of its parliamentary seats. Iceland, a volcanic island nation tucked below the Arctic Circle with a population of less than 400,000, is proud of its democratic traditions. The Althingi, founded in 930 by Viking settlers, is arguably the world's oldest legislature. Election turnout was high by international standards, with 80% of registered voters casting ballots.	https://apnews.com/article/iceland-election-results-social-democrats-989773ec8a24cddef7ba78d5aa933df2	2024-12-01T00:31:20-08:00	
India's Adani says his group is committed to compliance after US bribery and fraud charges	NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian tycoon Gautam Adani said his conglomerate is committed to 'world-class regulatory compliance' after being indicted in the U.S. on fraud charges and an alleged bribery scheme worth millions of dollars, his first remarks since the accusations surfaced. Adani, 62, is one of Asia’s richest men and perceived as close to Prime Minister Narendra Mo di. He was thrust into the spotlight on Nov. 20 when U.S. prosecutors in New York charged him and seven of his associates with securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and wire fraud, as well as duping investors by concealing that his company’s huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by bribes. They were accused of allegedly paying or planning to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials to help secure contracts and financing amounting to billions of dollars. 'This is not the first time we have faced such challenges. What I can tell you is that every attack makes us stronger. And every obstacle becomes a stepping stone for a more resilient Adani Group,' Adani said late Saturday at an awards ceremony in the northern Indian city of Jaipur. The businessman said roadblocks his group faces are 'the price of pioneering.' 'The more bold your dreams, the more the world will scrutinize you,' he said. 'In today’s world negativity spreads faster than facts. And as we work through the legal process, I want to reconfirm our absolute commitment to world-class regulatory compliance.' The Adani Group, in a statement last week, said the allegations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against directors of Adani Green were baseless. Adani’s imprint across India’s economy runs deep. His group is the country’s largest operator of coal mines and largest infrastructure developer, operating several ports and airports, and employing tens of thousands of people. Despite his fossil fuel roots, Adani has ambitions to become the world’s largest player in renewable energy by 2030. Analysts say a key factor in his meteoric rise over the years has been his knack for aligning his group’s priorities with those of the Modi government. His critics accuse him of crony capitalism and gaining preferential treatment from the state which has facilitated him winning governmental contracts. The group has repeatedly denied the accusation. The controversy has already affected Adani’s interests overseas. Kenya’s president on Nov. 21 canceled multimillion-dollar deals with the Adani Group for airport modernization and energy projects. A Sri Lankan government spokesperson said earlier this week that it is reviewing projects to be implemented by the Adani Group in Sri Lanka. The group was set to invest over $440 million under a 20-year agreement to develop 484 megawatts of wind power in the northeastern regions of Sri Lanka and develop a terminal in the Colombo port. Bangladesh’s interim government is also reviewing an agreement under which the Adani Group supplies electricity to Bangladesh from a power project in India.	https://apnews.com/article/india-adani-us-charges-fraud-bribe-c273ba4d7bec43e61b2c5e52c7553a7d	2024-11-30T22:57:01-08:00	
Israeli strikes on Gaza kill 6, including 2 children	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip killed at least six people overnight, including two young children who died in the tent where their family was sheltering, medical officials said Sunday. The strike in the Muwasi area, a sprawling tent camp housing hundreds of thousands of displaced people, also wounded the children's mother and their sibling, according to the nearby Nasser Hospital. An Associated Press reporter at the hospital saw the bodies. A separate strike in the southern city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt, killed four men, according to hospital records. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its daily strikes across Gaza often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around people 250 hostage. Some 100 captives are still being held inside Gaza, around two-thirds of whom are believed to be alive. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has destroyed vast areas of the coastal enclave and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands have crammed into squalid tent camps, where conditions have worsened as the cold, wet winter sets in. Israel reached a ceasefire with Lebanon's Hezbollah militants last week that has largely held, but that agreement, brokered by the United States and France, did not address the ongoing war in Gaza. The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent much of the past year trying to broker a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages, but those efforts stalled as Israel rejected Hamas' demand for a complete withdrawal from the territory. The Biden administration has said it will make another push for a deal in its final weeks in office. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East, without saying how. He was a staunch defender of Israel and its policies toward the Palestinians during his previous term. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-12-01-2024-6118019c9bc11204026b686206be8f6a	2024-11-30T22:41:27-08:00	
A twice-yearly shot could help end AIDS. But will it get to everyone who needs it?	MEXICO CITY (AP) — It’s been called the closest the world has ever come to a vaccine against the AIDS virus. The twice-yearly shot was 100% effective in preventing HIV infections in a study of women, and results published Wednesday show it worked nearly as well in men. Drugmaker Gilead said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates — mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. But it has excluded nearly all of Latin America, where rates are far lower but increasing, sparking concern the world is missing a critical opportunity to stop the disease. 'This is so far superior to any other prevention method we have, that it’s unprecedented,' said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS. She credited Gilead for developing the drug, but said the world’s ability to stop AIDS hinges on its use in at-risk countries. In a report issued to mark World AIDS Day on Sunday, UNAIDS said that the number of AIDS death last year — an estimated 630,000 — was at its lowest since peaking in 2004, suggesting the world is now at 'a historic crossroads' and has a chance to end the epidemic. The drug called lenacapavir is already sold under the brand name Sunlenca to treat HIV infections in the U.S., Canada, Europe and elsewhere. The company plans to seek authorization soon for Sunlenca to be used for HIV prevention. While there are other ways to guard against infection, like condoms, daily pills, vaginal rings and bi-monthly shots, experts say the Gilead twice-yearly shots would be particularly useful for marginalized people often fearful of seeking care, including gay men, sex workers and young women. 'It would be a miracle for these groups because it means they just have to show up twice a year at a clinic and then they’re protected,' said UNAIDS’ Byanyima. Such was the case for Luis Ruvalcaba, a 32-year-old man in Guadalajara, Mexico, who participated in the latest published study. He said he was afraid to ask for the daily prevention pills provided by the government, fearing he would be discriminated against as a gay man. Because he took part in the study, he'll continue to receive the shots for at least another year. 'In Latin American countries, there is still a lot of stigma, patients are ashamed to ask for the pills,' said Dr. Alma Minerva Pérez, who recruited and enrolled a dozen study volunteers at a private research center in Guadalajara. How widely available the shots will be in Mexico through the country's health care system isn't yet known. Health officials declined to comment on any plans to buy Sunlenca for its citizens; daily pills to prevent HIV were made freely available via the country’s public health system in 2021. 'If the possibility of using generics has opened, I have faith that Mexico can join,' said Pérez. Byanyima said other countries besides Mexico that took part in the research were also excluded from the generics deal, including Brazil, Peru and Argentina. 'To now deny them that drug is unconscionable.' she said. In a statement, Gilead said it has 'an ongoing commitment to helping enable access to HIV prevention and treatment options where the need is the greatest.' Among the 120 countries eligible for generic version are 18 mostly African countries that comprise 70% of the world’s HIV burden. The drugmaker said it is also working on establishing 'fast, efficient pathways to reach all people who need or want lenacapavir for HIV prevention.' On Thursday, 15 advocacy groups in Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, Chile, Guatemala and Colombia wrote to Gilead, asking for generic Sunlenca to be made available in Latin America, citing the 'alarming' inequity in access to new HIV prevention tools while infection rates were rising. While countries including Norway, France, Spain and the U.S. have paid more than $40,000 per year for Sunlenca, experts have calculated it could be produced for as little as $40 per treatment once generic production expands to cover 10 million people. Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University, said it will be enormously useful to have Sunlenca available in the hardest-hit countries in Africa and Asia. But he said the rising HIV rates among groups including gay men and transgender populations constituted 'a public health emergency' in Latin America. Hannya Danielle Torres, a 30-year-old trans woman and artist who was in the Sunlenca study in Mexico, said she hoped the government would find a way to provide the shots. 'Mexico may have some of the richest people in the world but it also has some of the most vulnerable people living in extreme poverty and violence,' Torres said. Another drugmaker, Viiv Healthcare, also left out most of Latin America when it allowed generics of its HIV prevention shot in about 90 countries. Sold as Apretude, the bi-monthly shots are about 80% to 90% effective in preventing HIV. They cost about $1,500 a year in middle-income countries, beyond what most can afford to pay. Asia Russell, executive director of the advocacy group Health Gap, said that with more than 1 million new HIV infections globally every year, established prevention methods are not enough. She urged countries like Brazil and Mexico to issue 'compulsory licenses,' a mechanism where countries suspend patents in a health crisis. It’s a strategy some countries embraced for previous HIV treatments, including in the late 1990s and 2000s when AIDS drugs were first discovered. More recently, Colombia issued its first-ever compulsory license for the key HIV treatment Tivicay in April, without permission from its drugmaker, Viiv. Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an AIDS expert at South Africa's University of KwaZulu-Natal, said he had never seen a drug that appeared to be as effective as Sunlenca in preventing HIV. 'The missing piece in the puzzle now is how we get it to everyone who needs it,' he said. ___ Cheng reported from London. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Romanians cast ballots in parliamentary election as turmoil in presidential race grips the nation	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romanians are casting ballots in a parliamentary election on Sunday sandwiched between a two-round presidential race, the first round of which has plunged the European Union and NATO member country into unprecedented turmoil following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference. Sunday’s vote will elect a new government and prime minister and determine the formation of the country’s 466-seat legislature. Romanians who are abroad have been able to vote since Saturday. The legislative vote comes a week after the first round of a presidential race that saw a controversial far-right populist who was polling in single digits win the most votes. Calin Georgescu, 62, is due to face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party, or USR, in a Dec. 8 runoff. Georgescu’s success, which many have attributed to his rapid rise in popularity on the social media platform TikTok, has triggered nightly protests throughout Romania by those who oppose his past remarks praising Romanian fascist leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin and view him as a threat to democracy. Many observers believe the presidential outcome indicates a sharp shift from Romania’s mainstream parties to more populist anti-establishment parties, whose voices have found fertile ground amid high inflation, high cost of living and a sluggish economy. Alexandru Rizescu, a 24-year-old medical student, says he was surprised by the result in the first-round presidential ballot and that it’s an 'obvious sign' Europe at large is shifting towards far-right populism. 'Most of us are sick of these big parties, but now we have to think about the … lesser evil,' he said. 'If Georgescu becomes president, with a favorable parliament, it’s going to be wild.' According to a report by Expert Forum, a Bucharest-based think tank, Georgescu’s TikTok account before last week's vote saw an explosion of engagement, which it said appeared 'sudden and artificial, similar to his polling results.' Without naming Georgescu, who declared zero campaign spending, Romania’s top defense body said Thursday that 'a presidential candidate benefited from massive exposure due to preferential treatment' granted by TikTok. Romania has become a 'priority target for hostile actions' by Russia, it added. The Kremlin denies it is meddling. The same day, the Constitutional Court requested a recount of all 9.4 million votes after a presidential candidate who obtained 1%, filed a complaint alleging the USR had violated electoral laws against campaign activities on polling day. The Central Election Bureau approved the request and said scanned reports were due to be sent in by Sunday night. On Friday, the court postponed a decision until Monday on whether to annul the vote. Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, says Sunday’s ballot compared to what many surveys had predicted could be reshaped by Georgescu's success, with far-right parties possibly obtaining record highs. 'The impact of the surprise in last Sunday’s presidential election will be significant, and we are going to wake up in a new political reality,' he told The Associated Press. 'Georgescu voters will speak again and will reshape how we look at the political Romanian spectrum from now on and probably forever.' 'We are going to wake up on Monday in a new political reality in Romania,' he added. 'The most probable scenario will be a difficult-to-build majority in the parliament to support and endorse a new government.' Despite the two main opposition parties — which have dominated post-communist politics in Romania — the Social Democratic Party, PSD, and the National Liberal Party, PNL, formed an unlikely coalition in 2021 which has become increasingly strained. A small ethnic Hungarian party exited the Cabinet last year after a power-sharing dispute. While the presidential role in Romania has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security and foreign policy, the prime minister is the head of the nation’s government. Recent surveys have suggested the top three parties in Sunday’s race will be the PSD, the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians and the PNL. After rising to the political scene eight years ago on an anti-corruption ticket, the USR’s popularity has diminished in recent years, but could garner the next most votes. More minor parties that may not pass the 5% threshold to enter parliament include the pro-EU reformist REPER party and the liberal-conservative Force of the Right. Some have predicted that the far-right nationalist S.O.S Romania party, and the recently formed and little-known Party of Young People, which has backed Georgescu, could pass the threshold. Silviu Safta, a 30-year-old retail manager in Bucharest, said that Georgescu topping the polls was 'a surprise for everyone, except for the 2 million people that voted for him,' and that he's skeptical whether Sunday's parliamentary vote will follow the same populist tilt. 'I think Romanians will be more informed about their elections and ... their candidates,' he said. 'I’m a little bit skeptical about the results, but I hope that democracy will win.'	https://apnews.com/article/romania-election-europe-far-right-da223dff415a0fa333bea0b1ccdb0adb	2024-11-30T20:01:58-08:00	
Left behind in Kenya, children of British soldiers struggle to find their identity	NANYUKI, Kenya (AP) — Margaret Wandia became pregnant after a week-long relationship with a British soldier training near her community in Kenya. They met while she worked at a bar in her early 20s. She knew little about him. He left her with a biracial child. Now that son is 26, and he is part of an effort by a Kenyan lawyer to take a number of such children to Britain. The goal is to confront authorities over hundreds of such cases reported over the years, and to find the fathers and seek their support. It is a long shot after years of attempts by human rights groups to hold the British military and its personnel accountable for their actions during weeks of training in Kenya — including alleged rapes — and the children they leave behind. The countries’ $44 million defense cooperation agreement was renewed in 2021. It allows up to 10,000 British forces to train for eight weeks in Kenya every year. Kenya’s biracial children are part of broader concerns about the British mission, notably the persistent allegations of rape of local girls and women. Like many biracial children in largely conservative Kenya, Wandia's son, Louise Gitonga, said he has felt excluded by society and left out of education and employment opportunities for being 'too white.' 'I have an identity crisis that has driven me to alcoholism,' the unemployed Gitonga told The Associated Press at his home in the central town of Nanyuki. 'Everywhere I pass, people call me a white man. Others call me an albino. These names cause me a great deal of pain and hurt.' His mother recalled taking him to boarding school and being asked to pay higher fees for her white child. She later married a local farmer, Paul Wachira, who acknowledged the challenges of raising a biracial child. 'At times, I had to hide him from the rest of the family during gatherings to avoid many questions, as he looked very different from his siblings,' Wachira said. Kenyan lawyer Kelvin Kubai represents 10 such children of visiting British forces. He asserted that not all of their parents' relationships were consensual. In collaboration with a British law firm he declined to name, he hopes to take some of the children to Britain next year and go to court. 'You know, such children do not know the circumstances under which they were born,' Kubai said. He hopes they'll obtain citizenship. According to British law, children born to British citizens are eligible for British citizenship and care of both parents if they are below 18. Seven of the children Kubai represents are under 18. For those older than 18, the trip is a quest for identity and support. Kubai is also raising money — $4,600 so far — to conduct DNA testing to help find the children’s fathers. The identity crisis affects children born to white fathers. Kubai said he has yet to come across children of Black British fathers. 'They would not be easy to spot and not face discrimination,' he said. A British High Commission spokesperson in a statement to the AP said it and the British military training mission in Kenya 'cooperate fully with local child support authorities where there are claims relating to paternity.' Those authorities didn't respond to questions. But Kenyan mothers and civil society groups have long said British authorities have been little or no help. Jenerica Namoru, 29, has a 5-year-old after dating a British man with the training mission. The man’s name appears on the birth certificate as the father after he consented and shared his documentation for the process. Namoru said the man initially accepted the child and communicated with her but refused to send financial support. She sought help at the British Army Training Unit Kenya offices. She said they wouldn’t listen. 'At times, they even blocked me from entering the gate,' she said. She's now being represented by Kubai. Biracial children in the area around the British training site date back to the 1960s when Kenya was under British rule. Those born decades ago are also part of current efforts to seek justice and support. David Mwangi Macharia, 68, bears the nickname 'British' due to his light skin color. He said his mother had a relationship with a British soldier. He works as a night guard and part-time mason after dropping out of primary school due to being ridiculed and discriminated against. '(Kenyans) always think that I cannot do menial jobs despite the fact that I am not educated,' Macharia said. He has even found it difficult to get along with his darker-skinned siblings. Attempts to hold visiting British forces accountable have long gained little traction, Kenyans say. Marion Mutugi, a commissioner with the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, said the relationships between British soldiers and local women range from consensual to transactional to forced. The commission says it has documented over 200 rape cases involving British troops between 1983 and 2003, and it continues to collect data. Britain's defense ministry dismissed the rape cases as 'not genuine,' and an investigation by the Royal Military Police in 2007 did not lead to compensation or justice for the victims, the KNCHR said in a report to Kenya's parliament protesting a past renewal of the countries' defense agreement. '(Authorities) also interfere with investigations by compromising the local community. The human rights defenders on the ground are threatened and intimidated by both the BATUK and the Kenyan forces and Kenyan officials to ensure that justice is not reached,' Mutugi said. 'Our take at the commission was that they wanted to put a Band-Aid on a wound instead of lacerating, dealing with it and operating on it,' the commissioner added. The British High Commission has said it was looking into the allegations. Kenyan authorities have never responded to the allegations. The most well-known case is that of Agnes Wanjiru, was killed in 2012 after an evening in the company of British soldiers. An inquest in 2019 concluded that Wanjiru was murdered by British soldiers but no suspect has been charged. A public hearing by the Kenyan parliament's defense committee, which started in May, has revived investigations. Kubai said he hopes to provide Kenyan children of British soldiers a much-needed sense of identity. 'What we are bringing in the UK court is not just the issue of rape, it is the issue of these children who happen to be prisoners of an identity they did not chose for themselves,' he said. ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

AP PHOTOS: A Japanese artist finds solace and global fans with intricate leaf-cutting	TOKYO (AP) — A frog holding a taro-leaf umbrella. A parade of frolicking animals. An Ukiyo-e style Mount Fuji. Giant waves. A Japanese artist who goes by the name Lito carves these delicate designs on fallen leaves, giving life back to them. The world of Lito’s delicate art, which he began in 2020 and posts on social media almost daily, has won fans from around the world. The leaf art has also given him solace after earlier struggles with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a purpose in life — the joy of making people happy with his art. He enjoys working at night. From a pile of leaves treated with a wrinkle-free chemical, he picks one and places it on a cutting board. First, he outlines the design on the leaf with a pen in his right hand. Then he takes a design knife in his left hand and starts cutting the leaf carefully. Slowly, the leaf begins to take the shape of a frog carrying an umbrella — a simple design he demonstrated in a recent interview with The Associated Press. More complex, highly intensive work on a single leaf can take more than eight hours to complete. His leaf-cutting works include titles such as 'Scrolls of Frolicking Animals,' 'Leaf Aquarium,' and 'Thirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji: The Great Wave off Kanagawa.' Each piece includes his own twists, and often uses animals. 'I would rather finish it in one go when I am focused,' Lito, 38, said. He didn't want to disclose his real name for personal reasons. Since his childhood, Lito says he has had high levels of concentration and patience. But he had trouble fitting into what was considered the norm at school or at work, despite all his efforts. He struggled to interpret others' feelings and to avoid confrontations. After years of difficulty, he went to a hospital at age 30 and was told he has ADHD, a diagnosis that he felt explained why he has always done things differently. He saw no point in forcing himself to do things the same way as other people, and began to adjust his life. In early 2020, Lito came across the art of leaf cutting. He saw it as the perfect use of his patience and concentration. Word of his skills has spread across social media, and he has published books on his leaf-cutting work.

Japan's popular Princess Aiko turns 23 with her future as a royal in doubt	TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s popular Princess Aiko turned 23 on Sunday, as she takes on more official duties even while her future in the imperial family remains in doubt. Aiko, the only child of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, graduated from university earlier this year and has since been participating in official duties and palace rituals while working at the Red Cross Society, according to the Imperial Household Agency. But Japanese law requires her to renounce her royal status and leave the family if she marries outside the imperial family. The vast majority of Japan’s public supports changing the law to allow her to remain a royal and become emperor, but conservatives in the governing party insist on keeping male-only succession. Japan’s rapidly dwindling imperial family has only 16 members, including four men. Aiko was to mark her birthday with her parents at the imperial palace in Tokyo. The IHA also released several photos of Aiko, including one of her standing by a persimmon tree at a palace garden. Another showed her holding pieces of traditional hand-crafted washi paper that she made at a workshop during her first solo official trip in October to the National Sports Festival in Japan’s southwestern prefecture of Saga. The 1947 Imperial House Law, which largely preserves conservative prewar family values, allows only males to take the throne and forces female royals who marry outside the family to give up their status. With only one young male member, that puts the survival of the 2,000-year-old monarchy in jeopardy. The youngest male member of the imperial family, Prince Hisahito — Aiko's 18-year-old cousin — is currently the last heir apparent, posing a major problem for the system. The government is looking for a way to keep the succession stable without relying on women, such as allowing the family to adopt new male members from former noble families that lost their status after World War II. Aiko's own views on the topic are unknown. She's only had one full news conference, when she reached adulthood. Last month, the United Nations women’s rights committee in Geneva issued a report that called for the Japanese government to allow a female emperor, among other issues hindering gender equality in the country. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi dismissed the report 'regrettable' and 'inappropriate.' He said the imperial succession is a matter of fundamental national identity and that it is not covered by constitutional basic rights. Crown Prince Akishino, Aiko's uncle, was asked about the succession debate at a news conference marking his 59th birthday Saturday, and replied that members of the royal family are 'living humans' and that the palace officials who support their daily lives should know how it affects them. At her work at the Japanese Red Cross Society, Aiko is assigned to volunteer training program, the IHA said. On weekends, it said, the princess enjoys taking walks with her parents and playing volleyball, tennis and badminton with palace officials.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-princess-aiko-birthday-succession-emperor-5efd5d1f56ab436e30d44856bc713fdb	2024-11-30T19:36:19-08:00	
Senegal demands answers as the West African country commemorates a French colonial massacre	THIAROYE-SUR-MER, Senegal (AP) — Biram Senghor regularly goes to pay his respects at a military cemetery in Thiaroye, a fishing village near Senegal’s capital Dakar, bowing in front of a different grave each time. The 86-year-old has no way of knowing which grave belongs to his father, M’Bap Senghor, one of likely hundreds of West African riflemen who fought for France during World War II but were killed on Dec. 1, 1944 by the French army after demanding unpaid wages. In this cemetery where they are supposedly buried, all the graves are anonymous and the exact location of the remains is unknown, as is the number of victims. The true scale and circumstances of the killings remain unclear as Senegal commemorates the 80th anniversary of the massacre on Sunday, threatening to reignite smoldering tensions between France and the former colony. 'I have been fighting to get answers for over 80 years,' said Biram Senghor. '(French President Emmanuel) Macron cannot do what the other French presidents before him did; France has to repent.' The West Africans were members of the unit called 'Tirailleurs Sénégalais,' a corps of colonial infantry in the French Army that fought in both World Wars. According to historians, there were disputes over unpaid wages in the days before the massacre and on Dec. 1, French troops turned on the unarmed African soldiers and shot them dead. For decades, French authorities tried to minimize what had happened in Thiaroye. Reports by the French military shortly after the massacre determined that 35 West African soldiers were killed in response to a 'mutiny.' Other reports by the French army mention 70 deaths. But today, many French and Senegalese historians agree the true death toll is likely in the hundreds, with some speaking of almost 400 soldiers killed, based on estimates of the number of riflemen present at the camp on the day of the massacre. On Thursday, Macron officially recognized the events of Thiaroye as a massacre for the first time in a letter to Senegal’s President Diomaye Faye, which was seen by The Associated Press. 'France must recognize that on that day, the confrontation between soldiers and riflemen who demanded their full legitimate wages be paid, triggered a chain of events that resulted in a massacre,' read Macron’s letter. But many historians dispute the idea of a confrontation between the French soldiers and the riflemen. 'What happened on December 1st was the execution of unarmed soldiers,' said Martin Mourre, a French historian and author of Thiaroye 1944, History and Memory of a Colonial Massacre. He points to the fact that no weapons were mentioned during the trial of the African riflemen accused of mutiny and the absence of any injuries among the French soldiers as evidence that no confrontation took place. In his letter to the Senegalese president, Macron did not mention the number of soldiers killed. The controversies and unknowns about the massacre are in part due to a lack of transparency by French authorities regarding the military reports and testimonies. In 2014, French President Francois Hollande handed over the European nation’s archives on Thiaroye to Macky Sall, then-president of Senegal. But historians say that key documents, including ones indicating the site of the mass graves and the number of West African soldiers present at the camp on the day of the massacre, are still missing. It is unclear if France holds such archives or if they even exist. Macron’s office and the French foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Additionally, very little was done by the Senegalese authorities under former president Sall to allow historians to delve into the historical documents. 'The archives remained inaccessible until this year, for obscure reasons,' says Mourre. Mamadou Diouf, a Senegalese historian who heads the commemoration committee for the Thiaroye massacre this year, says Sall did not show much interest in the subject in order to avoid diplomatic tensions with France. But Senegal’s President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who was elected in March in part on a promise of redefining Senegal’s relationship with the former colonizer, has vowed to regain control of the historical narrative on Thiaroye. His administration has organized major commemorations of the massacre from Dec. 1 to April 2025 across the country. 'The authorities' goal behind the major commemorations is to make Thiaroye part of Senegal’s national story,' said Babacar Ndiaye, political analyst at the Wathi think tank, which focuses on political and economic issues in West Africa. 'It will be talked about a lot on television, in the press and most importantly on social media,' he adds. 'This will reach a younger audience who might know little about the events of Thiaroye.' The 80th anniversary of the massacre comes as France’s influence is declining in the region, with Paris losing its sway in its former West African colonies. French troops have been ousted in recent years from Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso after years of fighting Islamic extremists alongside regional troops. Earlier this week, Chad, one of the last countries in the region in which France had maintained a large military presence, ended a military cooperation agreement with Paris. France still has around 350 troops in Senegal, mainly in a supportive role. Asked about their continued presence, Faye suggested it is not be something the Senegalese would want. 'Historically, France enslaved, colonized and stayed here,' he said. 'Obviously, I think that when you reverse the roles a little, you will have a hard time conceiving that another army — of China, Russia, Senegal, or any other country — could have a military base in France.' ___ Associated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris, France, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/senegal-france-thiaroye-colonial-massacre-tirailleurs-76db7190dcbc12349ff0d6ade82309b3	2024-11-30T19:24:03-08:00	
A landmark climate change case will open at the top UN court as island nations fear rising seas	THE HAGUE (AP) — The top United Nations court will take up the largest case in its history on Monday, when it opens two weeks of hearings into what countries worldwide are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact. After years of lobbying by island nations who fear they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice last year for an opinion on 'the obligations of States in respect of climate change.' 'We want the court to confirm that the conduct that has wrecked the climate is unlawful,' Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, who is leading the legal team for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Associated Press. In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis. 'We live on the front lines of climate change impact. We are witnesses to the destruction of our lands, our livelihoods, our culture and our human rights,' Vanuatu’s climate change envoy Ralph Regenvanu told reporters ahead of the hearing. Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. On Sunday, ahead of the hearing, advocacy groups will bring together environmental organizations from around the world. Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change — who first developed the idea of requesting an advisory opinion — together with World Youth for Climate Justice plan an afternoon of speeches, music and discussions. From Monday, the Hague-based court will hear from 99 countries and more than a dozen intergovernmental organizations over two weeks. It’s the largest lineup in the institution’s nearly 80-year history. Last month at the United Nations’ annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the $1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed. 'For our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the world’s biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines,' Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, told reporters in a briefing. Fifteen judges from around the world will seek to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? The second question makes particular reference to 'small island developing States' likely to be hardest hit by climate change and to 'members of 'the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change.' The judges were even briefed on the science behind rising global temperatures by the U.N.’s climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ahead of the hearings. The case at the ICJ follows a number of rulings around the world ordering governments to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In May, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution and countries must take steps to adapt to and mitigate their adverse effects. That ruling came a month after Europe’s highest human rights court said that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change, in a landmark judgment that could have implications across the continent. The ICJ’s host country of The Netherlands made history when a court ruled in 2015 that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change is a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens. The judgment was upheld in 2019 by the Dutch Supreme Court.	https://apnews.com/article/un-court-climate-global-warming-island-nations-35d35cb3c8a49b980ce458d27cb24844	2024-11-30T19:10:00-08:00

Limit on plastic production still under debate as treaty talks come to a close	BUSAN, South Korea (AP) — Negotiations on a plastic pollution accord are drawing to a close Sunday, as nations continue debating whether to tackle the exponential growth of plastic production. A battle over whether to limit the amount of plastic that companies are allowed to produce is the most contentious. The latest draft of the treaty, released Sunday afternoon after negotiators spent all of Saturday trying to reach agreement behind closed doors, leaves the question to be settled in open session. It includes multiple options for several key sections. For the proposal to limit production, that includes a compromise that would set a target at a later conference and an option to drop the idea altogether. The draft's options also include possible language to ban some plastic products that are single use or contain toxic chemicals, as well as less stringent options. It would also require parties to the treaty to improve the design of plastic products, so they don't release microplastics and can be recycled. Countries could adopt these provisions or make changes when they meet later Sunday. Delegates from Senegal and Ghana said the new draft is too weak. At a press conference earlier in the day, Panama and Fiji said that if other nations won't join them in standing up for the ambition this treaty requires, they should 'get out' of their way. They were joined by representatives from Mexico, France, Rwanda and the European Union, who together said they would do everything possible in the final hours to push a treaty forward that will solve the crisis. 'We are already doing waste management efforts back home,' said Sivendra Michael, Fiji's secretary for the environment and climate change. 'This treaty has to be bigger than all of us. It’s about saving this planet. It’s about saving humanity. And so that’s why we are here, still having hope, pushing. And we will push right until the end, until the time we’re supposed to leave Busan.' Their meeting concludes Sunday or early Monday in Busan, South Korea. A growing number of countries said in Busan that they want to address the total amount of plastic produced on Earth. A senior member of the U.S. delegation told The Associated Press on Saturday that the country supports having an article in the treaty that limits the world's supply of plastic. But for some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, that crosses a red line. They want a treaty that focuses on better management of plastic waste and recycling. Currently for any proposal to make it into the treaty, every nation must agree to it. India, Saudi Arabia and others have insisted it remain that way. Olga Givernet, France's minister delegate for energy, said she's worried about a small group of countries continuing to obstruct progress. 'It may be a minority, but still, still we have to be all together,' she said. Rwanda's lead negotiator, Juliet Kabera, said there is still time to find common ground, but her country will only accept a treaty that has the strength, ambition and accountability to solve the crisis. Ed Shepherd, representing the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, attended the press conference in support. The coalition includes about 270 businesses and financial institutions. He said businesses want global rules, and it's 'clear we need to use less plastic.' Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. Plastic production could climb about 70% by 2040 without policy changes. Canada called for 'bold, decisive action' Sunday morning. The statement was on behalf of the countries that have hosted negotiating meetings, which are the governments of Uruguay, France, Kenya, Canada and South Korea. 'The time for incremental progress is over,' it says. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Greek city of Thessaloniki gets new metro system with driverless trains after years of delays	THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) — The metro system in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki opened Saturday featuring driverless trains, and tens of thousands of people braved blustery, rainy weather to wait outside the stations to try them out. The single 13-station subway line was jammed with passengers eager to get a taste of the city’s new transport system. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, flanked by President Katerina Sadkellaropoulou and Transport Minister Christos Staikouras, pressed a blue button to begin the operation of a system that was a long time coming. Mitsotakis said the first appropriations for exploratory digging were part of the 1976 budget. In 1999, a banner on the entrance of the city’s international trade fair proclaimed that 'the metro is soon coming near you.' Years of court battles that saw contracts canceled, real estate disputes and a fight over the placement of a station near important archaeological discoveries, derailed the project. When the first carriages arrived in 2019 the previous government staged an 'inauguration' with the carriages sitting on cement stands. The delays pushed the cost of the project to over 3 billion euros, Staikouras said. Passengers entering the Eleftherios Venizelos station in the city center can take a look at some of the more than 300,000 artifacts dug up by archaeologists. Deep underground, remains of the city’s busiest street in the 6th century were found. This was a busy thoroughfare with many shops, archaeologists say. Many objected to, and loudly protested, the temporary removal of many of the findings in order to complete the tunneling and build the station. Antiquities are also displayed outside a nearby station, under protective glass. Officials said the operation of the line will mean 57,000 fewer cars per day in this traffic-choked city, with an expected 254,000 passengers using the system daily in the city of more than 300,000 and more than a million when including the suburbs. It's the second largest metropolitan area in Greece. An eastward extension of the line with five additional stations is scheduled to open in 2025. A westward extension is planned. But it will likely take several more years for the metro to reach the city’s busy Macedonia Airport. ___ Nellas reported from Athens, Greece	https://apnews.com/article/thessaloniki-metro-antiquities-delays-4c1fc3bb705f9b7bc118aa64e2bd758b	2024-11-30T12:04:43-08:00	
Regional Spanish leader who botched flood response faces another big march demanding his resignation	VALENCIA, Spain (AP) — Tens of thousands of Spaniards marched on Saturday in the streets of Valencia a month after devastating floods to demand the resignation of the regional officials who bungled the emergency response. The protest was the second major march of its kind asking for Valencia regional president Carlos Mazón to step down. He has refused to do so while making changes to his Cabinet and appointing a retired general to lead the cleanup effort. Many citizens and flood survivors are angry for what they consider the negligent or inept handling of the flash floods that created major flooding on Oct. 29-30. At least 230 people died, while thousands of homes and vehicles were destroyed or ruined. Mazón’s administration didn't issue flood alerts to people’s cellphones until flooding had already started in some areas. Saturday’s march culminated with people playing the shrill alert they received on their phones in unison. Authorities were then overwhelmed with the scope of the damage and took days to scale up rescue and recovery efforts. The cleanup of the layers of mud left by the rushing waters continues.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-march-demand-resignation-valencia-leader-37355642412ca7d7b980eed91629b5c3	2024-11-30T11:59:31-08:00	
Trump wants pardoned real estate developer Charles Kushner to be ambassador to France	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he wants real estate developer Charles Kushner, father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France. Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, calling Charles Kushner 'a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, &amp; dealmaker.' Kushner is the founder of Kushner Companies, a real estate firm. Jared Kushner is a former White House senior adviser to Trump who is married to Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka. The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after pleading guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations. Prosecutors alleged that after Charles Kushner discovered his brother-in-law was cooperating with federal authorities in an investigation, he hatched a scheme for revenge and intimidation. Kushner hired a prostitute to lure his brother-in-law, then arranged to have the encounter in a New Jersey motel room recorded with a hidden camera and the recording sent to his own sister, the man’s wife, prosecutors said. Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to 18 counts including tax evasion and witness tampering. He was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison — the most he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought. Christie has blamed Jared Kushner for his firing from Trump’s transition team in 2016, and has called Charles Kushner’s offenses 'one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I prosecuted when I was U.S. attorney.' Trump and the elder Kushner knew each other from real estate circles and their children were married in 2009. ___ Tucker reported from Newtown, Pennsylvania.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-france-ambassador-charles-kushner-pardon-c3835be92b1fbd1dffcd05707cba9f52	2024-11-30T10:42:54-08:00	
Trump threatens 100% tariff on the BRIC bloc of nations if they act to undermine US dollar	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday threatened 100% tariffs against a bloc of nine nations if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar. His threat was directed at countries in the so-called BRIC alliance, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have applied to become members and several other countries have expressed interest in joining. While the U.S. dollar is by far the most-used currency in global business and has survived past challenges to its preeminence, members of the alliance and other developing nations say they are fed up with America’s dominance of the global financial system. The dollar represents roughly 58% of the world’s foreign exchange reserves, according to the IMF and major commodities like oil are still primarily bought and sold using dollars. The dollar's dominance is threatened, however, with BRICS' growing share of GDP and the alliance's intent to trade in non-dollar currencies — a process known as de-dollarization. Trump, in a Truth Social post, said: 'We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy.' At a summit of BRIC nations in October, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the U.S. of 'weaponizing' the dollar and described it as a 'big mistake.' 'It’s not us who refuse to use the dollar,' Putin said at the time. 'But if they don’t let us work, what can we do? We are forced to search for alternatives.' Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network, SWIFT, and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. Trump said there is 'no chance' BRIC will replace the U.S. dollar in global trade and any country that tries to make that happen 'should wave goodbye to America.' Research shows that the U.S. dollar's role as the primary global reserve currency is not threatened in the near future. An Atlantic Council model that assesses the dollar’s place as the primary global reserve currency states the dollar is 'secure in the near and medium term' and continues to dominate other currencies. Trump's latest tariff threat comes after he threatened to slap 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tax on goods from China, as a way to force the countries to do more to halt the flow of illegal immigration and drugs into the U.S. He has since held a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said Thursday she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau returned home Saturday after meeting Trump, without assurances the president-elect will back away from threatened tariffs on Canada.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-dollar-dominance-brics-treasury-8572985f41754fe008b98f38180945c3	2024-11-30T10:08:33-08:00	
East African summit urges peace in eastern Congo but its leader skips talks	ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) — East African heads of state made another push for peace in eastern Congo on Saturday but its prospects remained bleak following a regional summit that was marked by the Congolese president's absence and an early departure of his Rwandan counterpart. A communique read at the end of the closed-door meeting of the East African Community in Arusha, Tanzania, only stated the need to combine regional and broader peace initiatives for sustainable peace in eastern Congo. Violence has reemerged in one of the world's most protracted conflicts in eastern Congo, where Congo’s government accused the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group of 'ethnic cleansing' in mineral-rich areas close to Rwanda's border. Rwandan President Paul Kagame left shortly after the closed-door meeting in Arusha. There was no official explanation for Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi's absence at the summit. Congo alleges that Rwanda has been involved in war crimes in the east, and U.S. and U.N. experts accuse it of giving military backing to M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. A July truce brokered by the United States and Angola has reduced the fighting between Rwandan and Congolese forces, but fighting between M23 and other militias continues. Other leaders at the summit were Presidents Salva Kiir of South Sudan, Samia Suluhu Hassan of Tanzania, William Ruto of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia. Burundi was represented by its vice president. Ruto was elected as the new chairperson of the EAC Summit, succeeding Kiir. 'Our focus must be on increasing competitiveness, promoting value-added production and boosting intra-regional trade to create jobs and transform our economies,' Ruto said. He also urged member states to remain committed to the timely disbursement of statutory contributions to sustain the bloc’s operations.	https://apnews.com/article/tanzania-eac-congo-summit-rwanda-b7224598fceee271424b154361a4367a	2024-11-30T08:07:40-08:00

Zelenskyy says NATO offer for Ukraine-controlled territory could end 'hot stage' of war	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — An offer of NATO membership to territory under Kyiv’s control would end 'the hot stage of the war' in Ukraine, but any proposal to join the military alliance should be extended to all parts of the country that fall under internationally recognized borders, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a broadcast interview. Zelenskyy’s remarks on Friday signaled a possible way forward to the difficult path Ukraine faces to future NATO membership. At their summit in Washington in July, the 32 members declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership. However, one obstacle to moving forward has been the view that Ukraine’s borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the alliance’s pact of mutual defense would come into effect. 'You can’t give an invitation to just one part of a country,' Zelenskyy said in an excerpt of the interview with Sky News. 'Why? Because thus you would recognize that Ukraine is only that territory of Ukraine and the other one is Russia.' Under the Ukrainian Constitution, Ukraine can't recognize territory occupied by Russia as Russian. 'So legally, by law, we have no right to recognize the occupied territory as territory of Russia,' he said. Since the start of the war in 2022, Russia has been expending huge amounts of weaponry and human life to make small-but-steady territorial gains to the nearly one-fifth of Ukraine it already controls in east and southern Ukraine. 'If we want to stop the hot stage of the war, we should take under the NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control. That’s what we need to do, fast. And then Ukraine can get back the other part of its territory diplomatically,' he said. An invitation for Ukraine to join NATO is one key point of Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan,' which he presented to Western allies and the Ukrainian people in October. The plan is seen as a way for Ukraine to strengthen its hand in any negotiations with Moscow. Earlier this week, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that the alliance 'needs to go further' to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. Military aid to Kyiv and steps toward ending the war are expected to be high on the agenda when NATO members' foreign ministers meet in Brussels for a two-day gathering starting on Dec. 3. However, any decision for Ukraine to join the military alliance would require a lengthier process and the agreement of all member states. There is also uncertainty as to the foreign policy stance of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. While Trump vowed on the campaign trail to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine in a single day, he hasn't publicly discussed how this could happen. Trump also announced Wednesday that Keith Kellogg, an 80-year-old, highly decorated retired three-star general, would serve as his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. In April, Kellog wrote that 'bringing the Russia-Ukraine war to a close will require strong, America First leadership to deliver a peace deal and immediately end the hostilities between the two warring parties.' Meanwhile, during his only campaign debate with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump twice refused to directly answer a question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war — raising concerns that Kyiv could be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations. Zelenskyy’s statement comes as Ukraine faces increasing pressure along the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line. In its latest report, Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War said Saturday that Russian forces had recently advanced near Kupiansk, in Toretsk, and near Pokrovsk and Velyka Novosilka, a key logistics route for the Ukrainian military. At least four people were killed Saturday when a Russian missile hit Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Serhiy Lysak said that the strike also wounded at least 21 people, of which eight were in a serious condition. Ukraine’s air force announced Saturday that the country had come under attack from 10 Russian drones, of which eight were shot down over the Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson regions. One drone returned to Russian-occupied territory, while the final drone disappeared from radar, often a sign of the use of electronic defenses. Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said that 11 Ukrainian drones had been shot down by the country’s air defense systems. Both the mayor of Sochi, Andrey Proshunin, and the head of Russia’s Dagestan region, Sergey Melikov, both in Russia’s southwest, said that drones had been destroyed in their regions overnight. No casualties were reported. On Friday, the Ukrainian president announced a number of changes to military leadership, saying that changes in personnel management were needed to improve the situation on the battlefield. Gen. Mykhailo Drapatyi, who led the defense of Kharkiv during Russia’s new offensive on Ukraine’s second-largest city this year, was appointed the new head of Ukraine’s Ground Forces. Oleh Apostol was named as the new deputy commander-in-chief responsible for improving military training. Ukraine's top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, also announced Friday that he would bolster units in Donetsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove with additional reserves, ammunition, weapons and military equipment. ___ Katie Marie Davies contributed to this report from Manchester, England. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-nato-92069fae6a05fc03d6fb2643ecbb4b2a	2024-11-30T02:50:15-08:00	
Israel says it struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites in Syria, testing a fragile ceasefire	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that halted months of fighting between the sides but has seen continued sporadic fire. The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria to Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or activists monitoring the conflict in that country. Hezbollah also did not immediately comment. Israeli aircraft have struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, citing ceasefire violations, several times since the truce began on Wednesday. The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah does not address the war in Gaza, where fighting rages on. On Saturday, an Israeli strike on a car killed five people, according to Muneer Alboursh, a senior Palestinian health official, who said the toll included three employees of the food charity World Central Kitchen. The charity could not immediately be reached for comment and made no mention of the incident on its social media. The Israeli military said it struck a vehicle carrying a militant involved in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. It said it was looking into the reported ties to WCK, but said the car was unmarked and had not coordinated aid delivery with the military as charities have done during the war. At Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, a woman held up an employee badge bearing the WCK logo, the word 'contractor' and the name of one of the men said to have been killed in the strike. A heap of belongings — burned phones, a watch and stickers with the WCK logo — lay splayed on the hospital floor. An Israeli strike in April on a WCK convoy killed seven of its workers, most of them foreigners. The Israeli military said it was a mistake. The Israeli strike in Syria came as insurgents there breached the country's largest city, Aleppo, in a shock offensive that added fresh uncertainty to a region reeling from multiple wars. The truce between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah, brokered by the United States and France, calls for an initial two-month ceasefire in which the militants are to withdraw north of Lebanon's Litani River and Israeli forces are to return to their side of the border. The repeated bursts of violence — with no reports of serious casualties — reflected the uneasy nature of the ceasefire that otherwise appeared to hold. While Israel has accused Hezbollah of violating the ceasefire, Lebanon has also accused Israel of the same in the days since it took effect. Many Lebanese, some of the 1.2 million displaced in the conflict, were streaming south to their homes, despite warnings by the Israeli and Lebanese militaries to stay away from certain areas. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli drone attacked a car in the southern village of Majdal Zoun. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said three people were wounded, including a 7-year-old child. Majdal Zoun, near the Mediterranean Sea, is close to where Israeli troops still have a presence. The military said earlier Saturday that its forces, who remain in southern Lebanon until they withdraw gradually over the 60-day period, had been operating to distance 'suspects' in the region, without elaborating, and said troops had located and seized weapons found hidden in a mosque. Israel says it reserves the right under the ceasefire to strike against any perceived violations. Israel has made returning the tens of thousands of displaced Israelis home the goal of the war with Hezbollah but Israelis, concerned Hezbollah was not deterred and could still attack northern communities, have been apprehensive about returning home. Hezbollah began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas and its assault on southern Israel the day before. Israel and Hezbollah kept up a low-level conflict of cross-border fire for nearly a year, until Israel escalated its fight with a sophisticated attack that detonated hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah fighters. It followed that up with an intense aerial bombardment campaign against Hezbollah assets, killing many of its top leaders including longtime chief Hassan Nasrallah, and it launched a ground invasion in early October. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon during the conflict, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel — over half of them civilians — as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon. The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas' October 2023 attack, when militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians and took some 250 hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 44,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count but say more than half the dead were women and children. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut and Shurafa from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-11-30-2024-506c8f976ad62afcf2a0ec977a8b6451	2024-11-30T01:33:01-08:00	
Counting begins in Ireland's election as 3 parties battle for top place	DUBLIN (AP) — Vote counting was underway Saturday in Ireland’s national election after an exit poll suggested the contest is a close-fought race among the country’s three largest political parties. Ballot boxes were opened at 9 a.m. at count centers across the country, kicking off long hours, or even days, of tallying the results. If the exit poll is borne out, that could be followed by days or weeks of negotiations to form a coalition government. The exit poll suggested voters’ support is split widely among the three big parties — Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein — as well as several smaller parties and an assortment of independents ranging from the left to the far right. The poll said center-right party Fine Gael was the first choice of 21% of voters, and another center-right party, Fianna Fail, of 19.5%. The two parties governed in coalition before the election. Left-of-center opposition party Sinn Fein was at 21.1% in the poll. Pollster Ipsos B&amp;A asked 5,018 voters across the country how they had cast their ballots. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.4 percentage points. The figures only give an indication and don’t reveal which parties will form the next government. Ireland uses a complex system of proportional representation in which each of the country’s 43 constituencies elects several lawmakers and voters rank candidates in order of preference. As a result, it can take some time for full results to be known. Fianna Fail politician Michael McGrath, a former finance minister and now a European Union official, said 'a number of different parties and groups will have to be involved' in forming a government. 'I hope it is a stable government that has the prospect of lasting the five years because of the challenges we are facing in Ireland and throughout the European Union,' he told the PA news agency at a count in Cork, southwest Ireland. 'Let’s allow the picture to emerge over the days ahead.' The result will show whether Ireland bucks the global trend of incumbents being ousted by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures. The cost of living — especially Ireland’s acute housing crisis — was a dominant topic in the three-week campaign, alongside immigration, which has become an emotive and challenging issue in a country of 5.4 million people long defined by emigration. The outgoing government was led by the two parties that have dominated Irish politics for the past century: Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. They have similar policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland’s 1920s civil war. After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat, they formed a coalition. Before polling day, analysts said the most likely outcome was another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition. That remains a likely option, but the parties would need the support of smaller groups or independents to achieve a majority in the 174-seat Dail, the lower house of Parliament. Sinn Fein achieved a stunning breakthrough in the 2020 election, topping the popular vote, but was shut out of government because Fianna Fail and Fine Gael refused to work with it, citing its leftist policies and historic ties with militant group the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Though Sinn Fein, which aims to reunite Northern Ireland with the independent Republic of Ireland, could become the largest party in the Dail, it may struggle to get enough coalition partners to form a government. During the election campaign, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail maintained they would not go into government with it. The party, which had urged people to vote for change, hailed the result after the exit poll was released. 'There is every chance that Sinn Fein will emerge from these elections as the largest political party,' Sinn Fein director of elections Matt Carthy told broadcaster RTE on Friday night. ___ Lawless reported from London.	https://apnews.com/article/ireland-election-vote-count-results-4e717dd614c3529783767e952d1ab967	2024-11-30T00:53:38-08:00	
Vietnam approves $67 billion high-speed railway project between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Vietnam on Saturday approved the construction of a high-speed railway connecting the capital Hanoi in the north to Ho Chi Minh city in the south at an estimated cost of $67 billion. The ambitious railway line will stretch 1,541 kilometers (957 miles) between the Vietnamese capital and the financial capital in the south. The new train is expected to travel at speeds of up to 350 kph (217 mph), reducing the journey from the current 30 hours to just five hours. The decision was taken by Vietnam's National Assembly, its parliament. Construction is expected to begin in 2027 and Vietnam hopes that the first trains will start operating by 2035. But the country has been beleaguered by delays to its previous infrastructure projects. The train will pass through 20 provinces and cities, with 23 passenger stations and five freight stations along the way. It will transport both people and goods and will also service defense purposes, state media said. Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyen Danh Huy said that the project was a response to growing transport needs, and that several studies had underscored the need for faster options on the north-south corridor, state media said. 'This project is pivotal for restructuring transport shares and serves as a cornerstone for Vietnam’s leap into a new era of growth,' he said. State media said that Vietnam will prioritize domestic funding for the project but may consider foreign loans if they are affordable and not restrictive.	https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-high-speed-train-102fcade1e996d34cb46133e21502649	2024-11-30T00:48:31-08:00	
8 arrested after blast disrupts Kosovo water and power supplies	PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — A powerful explosion damaged a water canal and temporarily cut water and power supplies to Kosovo’s cities, the prime minister said Saturday, blaming groups supported by Serbia. At least eight people were arrested. Prime Minister Albin Kurti said the blast on Friday in Vrage, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of capital Pristina, disrupted the supply of water to some cities and major power plants. It followed two other explosions in previous days on buildings of a police station and local authorities in the same area in the north of the country, mostly populated by the ethnic Serb minority. About 15 to 20 kilograms (30 to 45 pounds) of explosives were used to damage the critical infrastructure, according to Kosovo police chief Gazmend Hoxha. Kurti blamed 'official Belgrade and its criminal structures led by Milan Radoičić, supported by Serb institutions and Serbia President Aleksandar Vučić.' Radoičić, a politician and wealthy businessman with ties to Serbia’s ruling populist party and Vučić, was among 45 people charged in Kosovo in connection with a gunfight last year in which a Kosovar police officer was killed following an incursion by heavily armed Serb gunmen. Only three Serbs have been arrested and the others are at large, including Radoičić, who Pristina says is protected by Belgrade. Kosovo police have detained eight people suspected of being part of the attack, according to Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla. A big cache of weaponry, ammunition, military and police uniforms, cash and other items were confiscated at 10 locations in the north. Serbia Foreign Minister Marko Đurić condemned Friday's explosion but also criticized Kurti’s 'ethnonationalist regime' rushing 'to point fingers at Belgrade without evidence.' 'We believe that such premature accusations are a deliberate diversion,' Đurić said. 'These baseless allegations undermine efforts for constructive dialogue and serve only to escalate tensions in an already delicate situation.' The European Union and the United States strongly denounced the explosion and demanded that the perpetrators are brought to justice. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell spoke on the phone with Kurti to condemn the 'despicable act of sabotage on Kosovo’s critical civilian infrastructure' and he called 'on all stakeholders to cooperate fully with the Kosovo authorities.' The U.S. Embassy in Pristina said that 'these violent actions have no place in a democratic society, and those responsible for these criminal attacks against the legitimate authorities of the Republic of Kosovo should be held accountable.' Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani, who canceled a trip to Brunei because of the incidents, met with diplomatic representatives of Western powers and the EU to express her concern that such 'attacks aim not only at destabilizing Kosovo but also represent a serious threat to the stability of the whole region.' Kosovo-Serbia relations remain tense despite efforts by the international community to normalize them. Kosovo was a Serbian province until NATO’s 78-day bombing campaign in 1999 ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which left about 13,000 dead, mainly ethnic Albanians, and pushed Serbian forces out. Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008 which is not recognized by Belgrade. Brussels and Washington are urging both sides to implement agreements that Vučić and Kurti reached in February and March last year. They include a commitment by Kosovo to establish an Association of the Serb-Majority Municipalities. Serbia is also expected to deliver on the de facto recognition of Kosovo, which Belgrade still considers its province. The NATO-led international peacekeepers known as KFOR have increased their presence in Kosovo after last year’s tensions. KFOR has been providing security to the water pipe and to the surrounding areas since Friday night, according to a statement. ___ Llazar Semini reported from Tirana, Albania.

Taiwan's president departs for Pacific visit with a two-day stop in the US. China isn't happy	TAOYUAN, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan's president departed Saturday for his trip to the South Pacific that will include a two-day transit in the U.S., his first since assuming office, though few details about his itinerary were made public. The planned stopovers in Hawaii and the territory of Guam have already drawn fierce criticism from Bejing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory and objects to official exchanges between it and the U.S., the island's biggest backer and military provider. Lai Ching-te will go on a weeklong trip to visit the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — three diplomatic allies of the self-governed island in the Pacific. 'I want to use the values of democracy, peace, and prosperity to continue to expand our cooperation with our allies, to deepen our partnership and let the world see Taiwan not just as a model of democracy, but a vital power in promoting the world's peace and stability, and prosperous development,' he said at the Taoyuan International Airport, ahead of his departure. Though Taiwan retains strong contacts with dozens of other nations, it has only 12 formal diplomatic allies. The self-ruled democracy has recently been facing increasing pressure from China. It is unclear whether Lai will meet with any members of the incoming U.S. administration during his transit. President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg in July that Taiwan should pay for its defense. The island has purchased billions of dollars of defense weaponry from the U.S. He also evaded answering whether he would defend the island from Chinese military action. While the U.S. is obligated to help the island defend itself under the Taiwan Relations Act, it has maintained a position of strategic ambiguity over whether it would ever get involved if Taiwan were to be invaded by China. A second Trump administration is expected to test U.S.-China relations even more than the Republican’s first term, when the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion in Chinese products. Taiwan is one of the main sources of tension in the bilateral relationship. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday if the U.S. wanted to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it is important for it to handle the Taiwan issue 'with utmost caution, clearly opposing Taiwan independence and supporting China’s peaceful reunification.' She also said China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, including visits by Taiwan’s leaders to the U.S. for any reason. When former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen went to the U.S. last year as part of a transit to Latin America, it drew vocal opposition from China. Tsai met with the former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the time. The Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as a 'stern warning' over what it called collusion between 'separatists and foreign forces' days after Lai, then Taiwan’s vice president, stopped over in the U.S. China also strongly objects to leading American politicians visiting the island as it views any official contact with foreign governments and Taiwan as an infringement on its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. — Wu reported from Bangkok	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-us-china-lai-ching-te-hawaii-guam-21442df9a4d2f41827764f67d5701e07	2024-11-30T00:36:39-08:00	
More than 100 arrested as Georgian police clash with protesters over suspension of EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — More than 100 demonstrators were arrested overnight in Georgia as protesters clashed with police following the government’s decision to suspend negotiations to join the European Union, the country’s Interior Ministry said Saturday. It was the second straight night of protests after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of the country’s ruling Georgian Dream party announced the decision the previous day. Demonstrators faced off against police late Friday in a number of major Georgian cities, including the capital, Tbilisi, and the Black Sea port of Batumi. The Associated Press saw protesters in Tbilisi being chased and beaten by police as demonstrators rallied in front of the country's parliament building. Riot police used water cannons to push protesters away from the building and later moved to force them farther back along Rustaveli Avenue, the city’s main boulevard. Police also used heavy force against members of the media and used loudspeakers to shout profanities and insults at the crowds. Georgian Dream’s disputed victory in the country’s Oct. 26 parliamentary election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s aspirations to join the European Union, has sparked massive demonstrations and led to an opposition boycott of the parliament. The opposition has said that the vote was rigged with the help of Russia, Georgia’s former imperial master, with Moscow hoping to keep Tbilisi in its orbit. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili joined protesters on Thursday after accusing the government of declaring war on its own people. In an address to the nation Friday, she urged police not to use force against protesters. 'This is evident in every way — no one is willing to accept a Russified Georgia, a Georgia deprived of its constitution, or a Georgia in the hands of an illegitimate government and parliament,' Zourabichvili said. 'That is why so many of you are out here today: I see you. I see you on Rustaveli Avenue and in cities across Georgia: Batumi, Kutaisi, Zugdidi, Akhmeta, Lagodekhi, Telavi. It is unprecedented for citizens of Georgia to rise up simultaneously and spontaneously in this way.' Kobakhidze, the prime minister, characterized the protests Saturday as 'violent demonstrations.' He said that unspecified 'foreign entities' wished to see the 'Ukrainization' of Georgia with a 'Maidan-style scenario' – a reference to Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan revolution. Kobakhidze also said that Georgia remained committed to European integration. 'Once again, we pledge to the Georgian public, which expressed solid trust in us during the Oct. 26 elections, that no one will shake the peace and stability of Georgia,' he said. 'Despite artificial barriers, Georgia will persistently continue its progress toward European integration.' The government’s announcement that it was suspending negotiations to join the EU came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution that condemned last month’s vote as neither free nor fair. It said the election represented another manifestation of Georgia’s continued democratic backsliding 'for which the ruling Georgian Dream party is fully responsible.' European election observers said October’s vote took place in a divisive atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc’s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. EU lawmakers urged a rerun of the parliamentary vote within a year under thorough international supervision and by an independent election administration. They also called on the EU to impose sanctions and limit formal contacts with the Georgian government. The Georgian prime minister fired back, denouncing what he described as a 'cascade of insults' from the EU politicians and declaring that 'the ill-wishers of our country have turned the European Parliament into a blunt weapon of blackmail against Georgia, which is a great disgrace for the European Union.' Kobakhidze also said Georgia would reject any budgetary grants from the EU until the end of 2028. Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-cabinet-election-russia-european-union-kobakhidze-89aaec17654432e35a11b5226ca2d3bb	2024-11-30T00:33:20-08:00	
Syrian insurgents are inside Aleppo in a major setback for Assad as government forces regroup	BEIRUT (AP) — Thousands of Syrian insurgents fanned out inside Aleppo in vehicles with improvised armor and pickups, deploying to landmarks such as the old citadel on Saturday, a day after they entered Syria's largest city facing little resistance from government troops, according to residents and fighters. Witnesses said two airstrikes on the city's edge late Friday targeted insurgent reinforcements and hit near residential areas. A war monitor said 20 fighters were killed. Syria's armed forces said in a statement Saturday that to absorb the large attack on Aleppo and save lives, it has redeployed and is preparing for a counterattack. The statement acknowledged that insurgents entered large parts of the city but said they have not established bases or checkpoints. Insurgents were filmed outside police headquarters, in the city center, and outside the Aleppo Citadel. They tore down posters of Syrian President Bashar Assad, stepping on some and burning others. The surprise takeover is a huge embarrassment for Assad, who managed to regain total control of the city in 2016, after expelling insurgents and thousands of civilians from its eastern neighborhoods following a grueling military campaign in which his forces were backed by Russia, Iran and its allied groups. Aleppo has not been attacked by opposition forces since then. The 2016 battle for Aleppo was a turning point in the war between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters after 2011 protests against Assad’s rule turned into an all-out war. The push into Aleppo followed weeks of simmering low-level violence, including government attacks on opposition-held areas. Turkey, which has backed Syrian opposition groups, failed in its diplomatic efforts to prevent the Syrian government attacks, which were seen as a violation of a 2019 agreement sponsored by Russia, Turkey and Iran to freeze the line of the conflict. The offensive came as Iran-linked groups, primarily Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which has backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battles at home. A ceasefire in Hezbollah’s two-month war with Israel took effect Wednesday, the day the Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days. Insurgents raise flag over Aleppo Citadel A witness in Aleppo said government troops remained in the city's airport and at a military academy but most of the forces have already filed out of the city from the south. Syrian Kurdish forces remained in two neighborhoods. The redeployment 'is a temporary measure and (the military central command and armed forces) will work to guarantee the security and peace of all our people in Aleppo,' the military statement said. Speaking from the heart of the city in Saadallah Aljabri square, opposition fighter Mohammad Al Abdo, said it was his first time back in Aleppo in 13 years, when his older brother was killed at the start of the war. 'God willing, the rest of Aleppo province will be liberated' from government forces, he said. There was light traffic in the city center on Saturday. Opposition fighters fired in the air in celebration but there was no sign of clashes or government troops presence. Abdulkafi Alhamdo, an teacher who fled Aleppo in 2016 and returned Friday night after hearing the insurgents were inside, described 'mixed feelings of pain, sadness and old memories.' 'As I entered Aleppo, I kept telling myself this is impossible! How did this happen?' He said he strolled through the city at night, visiting the citadel, where the insurgents raised their flags, a major square and the university of Aleppo, as well as the last spot he was in before he was forced to leave for the countryside. 'I walked in (the empty) streets of Aleppo, shouting, ‘People, people of Aleppo. We are your sons,’' Alhamdo told The Associated Press in a series of messages. The insurgents launched their shock offensive in the Aleppo and Idlib countryside on Wednesday and wrestled control of dozens of villages and towns before entering Aleppo on Friday. The pro-government Al-Watan newspaper reported airstrikes on the edge of Aleppo city targeting rebel supply lines. It posted a video of a missile landing on a gathering of fighters and vehicles, in a street lined with trees and buildings. City hospitals are full Twenty fighters were killed in the airstrikes, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Aleppo residents reported clashes and gunfire. Some fled the fighting. Schools and government offices were closed Saturday as most people stayed indoors, according to Sham FM radio, a pro-government station. Bakeries were open. Witnesses said the insurgents deployed security forces around the city to prevent any acts of violence or looting. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the city's airport has been shut and all flights suspended. On Friday, Aleppo's two key public hospitals were reportedly full of patients while many private facilities closed, OCHA said. In social media posts, the insurgents were pictured outside of Aleppo Citadel, the medieval palace in the old city center, and one of the largest in the world. In cellphone videos, they recorded themselves having conversations with residents they visited at home, seeking to reassure them they will cause no harm. The Syrian Kurdish-led administration in the country's east said nearly 3,000 people, most of them students, had arrived in their areas after fleeing the fighting in Aleppo, which has a sizeable Kurdish population. State media reported that a number of 'terrorists,' including sleeper cells, infiltrated parts of the city. Government troops chased them and arrested a number who posed for pictures near city landmarks, state media said. On a state TV morning show Saturday, commentators said army reinforcements and Russia’s assistance will repel the 'terrorist groups,' blaming Turkey for supporting the insurgents’ push into Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Russia’s state news agency Tass quoted Oleg Ignasyuk, a Russian Defense Ministry official coordinating in Syria, as saying that Russian warplanes targeted and killed 200 militants who launched the offensive in the northwest on Friday. It provided no further details. —— Associated Press writer Albert Aji in Damascus contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-insurgents-aleppo-iran-russia-turkey-abff93e4f415ebfd827d49b1a90818e8	2024-11-30T00:19:39-08:00	
In Bolivia's scrappy highlands, proud Indigenous Cholas take the runway by storm	VIACHA, Bolivia (AP) — In the huddled markets, sprawling farms and pulsing parties of Viacha, a town southeast of Bolivia’s capital, it's typical for women to sport bowler hats, tiered skirts and fringed shawls. What's less typical is for the fashion spotlight to turn to these outfits — worn by 'Cholas,' Indigenous women from the highland Altiplano. But late Friday in Viacha, some 22 kilometers (13 miles) from Bolivia's capital of La Paz — over 12,000 feet (3,650 meters) above sea level — awe-struck teenage boys and proud mothers throbbed the main square as the town’s dirt roadway was briefly transformed into a runway. One by one, the girls from Viacha — mostly students between 15-25 years old — strutted down the catwalk to a surprising soundtrack of early 2000s American pop music. Street vendors hawked hot dogs and empanadas. Supporters cheered in Spanish and the Indigenous Aymaran language. Wearing glittering shoes and brightly colored, bunched-out skirts called 'polleras,' the amateur models of all heights and sizes twirled, tipped their hats and threw sultry glances at the crowd. 'Years ago, people would associate these skirts with the fields, they'd look down on us as rural peasants,' said Rogelia Canaviri, 42, who couldn't stop smiling as she watched her daughter, Carolina, stride down the runway in dangling pearl earrings, the sequins on her layer-cake red skirt catching the stage lights. 'It's something I'm proud of, to see my daughter and her friends enjoy what I've worn for work my whole life,' she said, pointing to the wool shawl, velvet hat and lower-key beige pollera she had on — the same clothes, she said, she still wears to milk her cows and sell her cheese at open-air markets. Her own mother did the same. Generations ago, the Aymara were subject to waves of conquest and dispossession, first by the Inca, then by the Spanish, who forced the Indigenous communities to abandon their traditional way of dressing and adopt the style then-popular in the court of Seville. Legend has it that the jaunty felt bowler hat became critical to the get-up after being introduced by British railway workers in the 1920s. Bolivia's whiter, more affluent population has used 'Chola' — and its diminutive, 'Cholita' — as dismissive racial epithets. But in recent decades that stigma has dissipated, with Indigenous Aymara proudly reclaiming the word and younger Bolivians rediscovering the charm of their mothers' and grandmothers' vibrant garments. 'I think the ‘Cholita’ has become something very interesting, very exciting in our current context,' said Brittany Cantuta Valeria, 21, a first-time model, her hat brimmed upward and cheeks flushed a reddish gold. 'We’re now at the point of being respected because of everything that’s been implemented, so I wear this to have fun, to show off, to go to parties and dances. I have nothing to do with working the fields.' Most of the girls parading onstage Friday, in the show organized by the Viacha municipality, grew up during the tenure of former leftist President Evo Morales (2006-2019), the country’s first-ever Indigenous president whose championing of Bolivia's Indigenous majority earned him fervent support across the cinderblock and adobe homes of the Altiplano. Morales instituted a new constitution, which, among other things, expanded recognition for Bolivia’s 36 ethnic groups. He promoted the teaching of Indigenous languages and boosted state funding for folkloric arts. More Chola runway shows and beauty contests cropped up, widening the reach of Bolivia's native highland culture. But fashion fanfare was largely limited to La Paz, the seat of the government. Before Friday, the town of Viacha, like most of the other villages across these austere mountain-rimmed plains, had never taken its turn on the runway. 'I was really nervous but I realized this is the first time for all of us,' said 15-year-old Tomasa Ramirez. 'I feel so pretty. Now I know it’s my dream to be a Cholita model.' With Bolivia's economic crisis closing like a vise on families whose money has diminished in value while the cost of food has doubled, many girls said walking the show was no easy feat. Top-notch velvet hats and shawls made from vicuña wool with silk fringes can fetch thousands of dollars. Polleras cost a few hundred dollars. Then there's the jewelry — ideally made of real gold, pearls and diamonds when worn to these kinds of formal events. 'This year there was no way I could have real ones,' said Julieta Mamani, 16, pointing to her gold-colored earrings. 'I hope things will be different next year.' Watching her 24-year-old daughter pose for selfies in her elaborate skirt, Canaviri, the dairy farmer, has another hope. 'I hope she doesn't like wearing pants,' she said of her daughter. 'I tried on pants once in my life, and I felt naked. Never again.'	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-indigenous-morales-andean-aymara-fashion-a1d8b5bfa1414bd54fa2ef1ae181cf65	2024-11-29T21:59:16-08:00	
Fishers at a Lebanese port hope ceasefire with Israel means normal life is returning	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah brought hope for normality back to many in southern Lebanon on Friday, including fishermen who have long launched their single-engine wooden boats into the Mediterranean at dawn. During the last two months of its year fighting Hezbollah, Israel imposed a siege on southern Lebanon that kept hundreds of fishers at this ancient Phoenician port on shore, upending their lives and the industry. While less important than destruction and displacement, the port siege cut many people off from the key ingredients for traditional Lebanese dishes like sayadiyeh — fish and rice boiled in fish sauce — or fried and grilled fish eaten with dips such as hummus and tabbouleh or fattoush salads. The loss of fish damaged a deep association with home, but now the possibility of renewed Lebanese fishing on the country's southern coast is helping fuel hope for a brighter future. On Friday, a few boats went out close to the shore as fishers in the port worked on the nets of small boats painted white, blue or red. Hussein Sukmani, 55, said Friday that he was considering going to sea in coming days but was waiting to see how things unfold. He hasn't dared set sail since the Israel-Hezbollah war dramatically intensified on Sept. 23. 'They were days of fear and horror,' he said. 'They were the most difficult days of our lives.' A week ago, a drone strike killed two young fishers in the city as they prepared their nets on the coast, and some fishermen said Friday that the Lebanese army told them that they if headed out it would be at their own risk . Among those who sailed near the coast on Friday was Walid Darwish, who returned to the port with two plastic boxes filled with mullet. 'Today is the first time that we sail,' Darwish said, adding that fishers had missed the prime season in October and November. 'We lost it,' he said. The Israeli army barred any boats from an area 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the border in October and has not said whether the warning is still in effect. Sukmani said that most of the 700 fishers who work on the 270 boats at the port have not sailed out of concern since then. The area around the port is a predominantly Christian neighborhood that has been spared much of the airstrikes on other parts of Tyre that leveled buildings in this city. In peaceful times, the port is a major tourist attraction, beloved by Lebanese and foreigners who come for the views, the restaurants and the beaches. On Friday, Mohammed Hammoud walked along the coast of Tyre carrying his fishing rod. 'It is enough that someone is able to stand in this beautiful area,' he said, pointing to the white sands. 'Fishing is everything for me,' added Hammoud, who went to fish several times in the area north of the city of Sidon that was not part of the siege. In the old market of Tyre, Gilbert Spiridon watched from inside his shop as people came to buy freshly brought fish. Before the war, it took hours to sell all his fish to people from around Lebanon. 'All I wish is that the war has ended and we are back on track to the old good days,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-tyre-fishers-1eb9dad3ab8f0f5dae73db12a17f1a94	2024-11-29T20:46:05-08:00	
Romania's parliamentary vote risks being overshadowed by presidential race chaos	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Hundreds of protesters gathered in Bucharest after a far-right populist unexpectedly won the first round of a presidential race, plunging Romania into turmoil just days before the country holds parliamentary elections. 'Better to be dead than a fascist,' one placard reads. Sunday's ballot will determine a new government and prime minister to lead the European Union and NATO member country. However, the vote is sandwiched between the two rounds of the presidential race and is overshadowed by controversies and chaos following the outcome of the first vote. Despite polling at less than 10% before the first round, a far-right politician who has praised Romanian fascist leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin won the most votes in the Nov. 24 ballot. Calin Georgescu is due to face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a Dec. 8 runoff. 'He’s pro-Russia, pro-Putin, and we, the people — and especially the young people — we are supporting democracy,' said Sebastian Marin, an 18-year-old student who attended a protest on Wednesday in the capital. 'It’s really important for people to mobilize.' Georgescu's success, which many have attributed to his rapid rise in popularity on the social media platform TikTok, has triggered nightly protests throughout Romania by those who oppose his past remarks and view him as a threat to democracy. According to a report by Expert Forum, a Bucharest-based think tank, Georgescu’s TikTok account has had an explosion which it said 'appears sudden and artificial, similar to his polling results.' Without naming Georgescu, who declared zero campaign spending, Romania’s top defense body said on Thursday that 'a presidential candidate benefited from massive exposure due to preferential treatment' granted by TikTok. Romania has become a 'priority target for hostile actions' by Russia, it added. The Kremlin denies it is meddling. The same day, the Constitutional Court requested a recount of all 9.4 million votes after a former presidential candidate who obtained 1%, lodged a complaint alleging the Save Romania Union had violated electoral laws against campaign activities on polling day. The Central Election Bureau approved the request and said scanned reports were due to be sent in by 10.00 p.m. Sunday. On Friday, the court postponed a decision until Monday on whether to annul the vote. Opposite the government headquarters, people of all ages, but mostly young people, could be heard chanting: 'Democracy saves Romania!' 'I find it a bit worrying that these elections are so close together,' Andrei Ienculescu-Popovici, a 28-year-old computer programmer, told The Associated Press. 'At the moment, almost no one talks about the parliamentary elections … it has become a non-topic.' He said he is suspicious of the unprecedented decision to recount the vote, which pro-democracy groups and Save Romania Union have complained is not transparent enough. 'These are strange and unprecedented times for our young and fragile democracy ... this move will probably only benefit the extreme right-wing parties,' he said. A protest in Bucharest on Friday organized by the 'Corruption Kills' community, demanded 'that the votes be recounted with independent observers and cameras' and accused the Constitutional Court of 'once again attacking democracy' in the interest of a specific party. It is the first time in Romania’s 35-year post-communist history that the leftist Social Democratic Party did not have a candidate in a presidential runoff. Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu resigned as party leader after he lost to Lasconi by a wafer-thin 2,740 votes, and Nicolae Ciuca also resigned as leader of the center-right National Liberal Party after obtaining just 8.7%. While the presidential role in Romania has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security and foreign policy, the prime minister is the head of the nation’s government. Sunday’s vote will determine the formation of the country’s 466-seat legislature. 'The most important vote is the parliamentary one, not the presidential one, they decide who really runs the country,' said Ienculescu-Popovici. 'We were perceived as being one of the most stable and trustworthy allies, and I fear current events might unravel that.' Since 2021, Romania’s two biggest parties — the Social Democrats and the National Liberal Party — formed an unlikely coalition, which has become bitterly strained. A small ethnic Hungarian party exited the cabinet last year following disputes over a power-sharing agreement. Like many countries throughout Europe or even the U.S., anti-incumbency sentiment is running high in Romania, which has experienced high inflation and cost of living, has a large budget deficit, and a sluggish economy. It has bolstered support for far-right populist parties. Recent surveys have suggested the top three parties in Sunday’s race will be the PSD; the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, and the PNL. After rising to the political scene eight years ago on an anti-corruption ticket, the Save Romania Union's popularity has waned in recent years but could garner the next most votes. More minor parties that may not pass the 5% threshold to enter parliament include the pro-EU reformist REPER party and the liberal-conservative Force of the Right. Some have predicted that the far-right nationalist S.O.S Romania party, and the recently formed and little-known Party of Young People, which has backed Georgescu, could pass the threshold. Romania's Minister of Energy Sebastian Burduja told the AP: 'Nobody saw this coming … and I mean nobody.' He added that the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians gaining more power in parliament after Sunday’s race, and Georgescu winning the final presidential vote, 'is a very real concern.' After the unpredictable presidential vote and the confusion surrounding it, many political observers are reluctant to predict the outcome of the parliamentary vote. Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest, says Sunday’s vote could see strong anti-establishment turnout for far-right populism, which could win as much as 30-40% of the ballot and 'polarize the population even more.' 'People who voted for Georgescu seem to really enjoy the victory in this first round ... they have a lot more courage to say who they are and be proud of their vote,' he said. 'We’ve had people who are really angry at the governing party, and they voted for the opposition, only this time, the governing parties were actually the two main parties.'	https://apnews.com/article/romania-elections-parliament-georgescu-europe-42548c4841392bd7a504761752e0970c	2024-11-29T20:26:48-08:00	
Stealth destroyer to be home for 1st hypersonic weapon on a US warship	The U.S. Navy is transforming a costly flub into a potent weapon with the first shipborne hypersonic weapon, which is being retrofitted aboard the first of its three stealthy destroyers. The USS Zumwalt is at a Mississippi shipyard where workers have installed missile tubes that replace twin turrets from a gun system that was never activated because it was too expensive. Once the system is complete, the Zumwalt will provide a platform for conducting fast, precision strikes from greater distances, adding to the usefulness of the warship. 'It was a costly blunder but the Navy could take victory from the jaws of defeat here, and get some utility out of them by making them into a hypersonic platform,' said Bryan Clark, a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute. The U.S. has had several types of hypersonic weapons in development for the past two decades, but recent tests by both Russia and China have added pressure to the U.S. military to hasten their production. Hypersonic weapons travel beyond Mach 5, five times the speed of sound, with added maneuverability making them harder to shoot down. Last year, The Washington Post reported that among the documents leaked by former Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira was a defense department briefing that confirmed China had recently tested an intermediate-range hypersonic weapon called the DF-27. While the Pentagon had previously acknowledged the weapon's development, it had not recognized its testing. One of the U.S. programs in development and planned for the Zumwalt is 'Conventional Prompt Strike.' It would launch like a ballistic missile and then release a hypersonic glide vehicle that would travel at speeds seven to eight times faster than the speed of sound before hitting the target. The weapon system is being developed jointly by the Navy and Army. Each of the Zumwalt-class destroyers would be equipped with four missile tubes, each with three of the missiles for a total of 12 hypersonic weapons per ship. In choosing the Zumwalt, the Navy is attempting to add to the usefulness of a $7.5 billion warship that is considered by critics to be an expensive mistake despite serving as a test platform for multiple innovations. The Zumwalt was envisioned as providing land-attack capability with an Advanced Gun System with rocket-assisted projectiles to open the way for Marines to charge ashore. But the system featuring 155 mm guns hidden in stealthy turrets was canceled because each of the rocket-assisted projectiles cost between $800,000 and $1 million. Despite the stain on its reputation, the three Zumwalt-class destroyers remain the Navy’s most advanced surface warship in terms of new technologies. Those innovations include electric propulsion, an angular shape to minimize radar signature, an unconventional wave-piercing hull, automated fire and damage control and a composite deckhouse that hides radar and other sensors. The Zumwalt arrived at the Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, in August 2023 and was removed from the water for the complex work of integrating the new weapon system. It is due to be undocked this week in preparation for the next round of tests and its return to the fleet, shipyard spokeswoman Kimberly Aguillard said. A U.S. hypersonic weapon was successfully tested over the summer and development of the missiles is continuing. The Navy wants to begin testing the system aboard the Zumwalt in 2027 or 2028, according to the Navy. The U.S. weapon system will come at a steep price. It would cost nearly $18 billion to buy 300 of the weapons and maintain them over 20 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Critics say there is too little bang for the buck. 'This particular missile costs more than a dozen tanks. All it gets you is a precise non-nuclear explosion, some place far far away. Is it really worth the money? The answer is most of the time the missile costs much more than any target you can destroy with it,' said Loren Thompson, a longtime military analyst in Washington, D.C. But they provide the capability for Navy vessels to strike an enemy from a distance of thousands of kilometers — outside the range of most enemy weapons — and there is no effective defense against them, said retired Navy Rear Adm. Ray Spicer, CEO of the U.S. Naval Institute, a think tank, and former commander of an aircraft carrier strike force. Conventional missiles that cost less aren’t much of a bargain if they are unable to reach their targets, Spicer said, adding the U.S. military really has no choice but to pursue them. 'The adversary has them. We never want to be outdone,' he said. The U.S. is accelerating development because hypersonics have been identified as vital to U.S. national security with 'survivable and lethal capabilities,' said James Weber, principal director for hypersonics in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Critical Technologies. 'Fielding new capabilities that are based on hypersonic technologies is a priority for the defense department to sustain and strengthen our integrated deterrence, and to build enduring advantages,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/navy-hypersonic-weapon-zumwalt-china-russia-ec3272a36042796518aec665a4e65df3	2024-11-29T20:06:23-08:00	
How Brazilian police say Bolsonaro plotted a coup to stay in office	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's Federal Police in late November formally accused far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro and 36 others of planning a coup to keep him in office. The agency described a multi-step scheme, substantiated by evidence and testimony, in an 884-page report. The plan included systematically sowing distrust of the electoral system among the populace, drafting a decree to give the plot a veneer of legal basis, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan, and inciting a riot in the capital. Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet will now decide whether to formally charge the accused parties, toss the investigation or request more testimony to understand each person’s participation in different parts of the alleged plot before deciding who stands trial on which counts. Bolsonaro and his main allies have denied any wrongdoing or involvement and accuse the authorities of political persecution. Here is a breakdown of the plan's key elements as laid out in the report and how they are supposedly connected. Sowing doubt about Brazil’s voting system Police allege that efforts to disseminate fake news about Brazil’s electronic voting system began in 2019, Bolsonaro’s first year in office, but were conducted more strategically and intensively as his 2022 reelection bid drew near. Police say so-called 'digital militias' comprised of thousands of social media accounts linked to pro-Bolsonaro propaganda, as well as other prominent right-wing influencers and politicians, spread propaganda claiming the voting system could be tampered with. Bolsonaro also openly expressed admiration for Brazil’s military dictatorship (1964-1985), which he claimed saved the country from communism. The narrative of an impending illegitimate election defeat helped Bolsonaro rally tens of thousands of supporters to multiple street demonstrations and also muster many to set up camp outside military barracks and headquarters to pressure leaders. Three months before the election, Bolsonaro invited dozens of diplomats to the presidential palace for a nationally televised meeting in which he presented supposed vulnerabilities of the voting system, without providing any evidence. Following Bolsonaro’s loss in 2022 to leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro's Liberal Party questioned results at the country's top electoral court, arguing voting devices made in specific years could have permitted fraud. The electoral court swiftly dismissed the claims. 'They spread false studies on the vulnerabilities of the electronic voting machines through the Liberal Party, in an attempt to create a factual basis for a presidential decree' that would set the coup in motion, the report says. A draft decree to set the coup in motion In January 2023, Brazilian police found a draft decree in the home of Bolsonaro’s former justice minister Anderson Torres. It was one of many versions drafted either at the far-right leader's behest or with his knowledge, police say. The former president presented the document, unsigned, to the commanders of the three divisions of the armed forces on Dec. 7, seeking their support. Investigators say the draft decree shows Bolsonaro and his allies sought to create a committee to probe alleged fraud and crimes in the October 2022 vote, so they could later suspend the powers of the nation’s top electoral court and possibly convene a new election. The navy’s commander was ready to comply with the decree, but army and air force leaders objected to any plan that would prevent Lula's inauguration, the report said. Those refusals are why the plan did not go ahead, according to witnesses who spoke to investigators. Many legal experts including say evidence that former president presented the draft to military leaders and supported for different versions of the document are very damaging. '(The goal) was to unduly intervene in elections,' said Luiz Henrique Machado, a law professor at the IDP university in the capital Brasilia. 'In Brazil, it is the electoral prosecutors' office and the top electoral court that have the final word about electoral legislation.' In an interview with website UOL published Thursday, Bolsonaro said he discussed with military leaders moves including decreeing a state of emergency and other exceptional measures that would have suspended the rule of law for the public good. He said such measures are provided for by the constitution, so there is nothing unseemly about evaluating those options. 'What is being said is absurd. For my part, there has never been any discussion of a coup,' Bolsonaro told journalists in Brasilia on Monday. Plan to assassinate the president-elect On Nov. 19, Brazil's Federal Police arrested four army special operations officers and a federal police officer accused of plotting in 2022 to assassinate Lula, vice-president-elect Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The arrested men were all mentioned in a police report that was unsealed later. The assassination plan sought to leave Bolsonaro's ticket as the only remaining valid one in the 2022 runoff, police say. As for de Moraes, he led a five-year probe into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led some far-right allies and supporters being barred from social media and even imprisoned. In early 2023, he presided over the nation’s top electoral court when it declared Bolsonaro ineligible for office until 2030 over abuse of power related to a meeting he convened with foreign ambassadors to spread lies about the voting system. Gen. Walter Braga Netto, Bolsonaro’s 2022 running mate and former defense minister, greenlit the assassination plan at a meeting with the plotters inside his home, investigators added. Federal Police portray the retired general as one of the plot's leaders, also involved in pressuring military leaders to sign onto the coup. Braga Netto said in a statement on Tuesday that he never plotted a coup. He added that several of the documents seized from one of his aides, including 'writings, drafts and media reports' were 'preparatory material to answer media requests and to prepare for testimony in congressional hearings.' The police report contains no indication that any attempt to assassinate Lula or Alckmin was put into motion. However, investigators found messages and documents indicating that the plotters were monitoring and following de Moraes at the time. Police said they found evidence that retired Brig. Gen. Mário Fernandes, one of the officers arrested who had been serving as interim general secretary of the presidency, also visited the protest camps outside military installations, including at the army headquarters in Brasilia. Investigators said they have evidence that he gave instructions and financial support to the protesters. Jan. 8 uprising Federal Police linked Bolsonaro and some of his top ministers to the Jan. 8, 2023 riot in which supporters of the former president, many of whom had been camped outside army headquarters for months, ransacked the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace in Brasilia. The protesters had pleaded for the armed forces to keep the leftist leader out of office and their uprising — which came after Lula was sworn in — was an attempt to force military intervention and oust the new president, police say. The riot appears in the report as one of several 'other actions to pressure the army commander to join the coup d’etat.' Police also say that Brig. Gen. Fernandes sent a message in November 2022 to Gen. Marco Antônio Freire Gomes, then the Army's commander, discussing the need for a 'triggering event' for a coup. Defendants, including Bolsonaro, have argued that the riot was an isolated event, and many legal experts have noted that the report's evidence of a connection between it and a broader plot is tenuous. 'It is clear that the alleged coup plotters had contacts with people camped outside military barracks, people who were there on Jan. 8. But how much of that contact was transformed into planning, coordination, stimulus for those people to take public buildings that day? That is to be debated, it is going to be discussed in the process and the collection of more evidence,' said João Pedro Pádua, a professor of criminal law proceedings at the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro. Bolsonaro left for the United States days before Lula’s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2023 and stayed there three months, keeping a low profile. The police report alleges he was avoiding possible imprisonment related to the coup plot and awaiting the fallout from the uprising. ___ Hughes reported from Rio de Janeiro. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/bolsonaro-brazil-coup-legal-woes-report-43bae30906925a8dc04e319b901488f8	2024-11-29T19:07:59-08:00	
China sentences journalist detained at meal with Japanese diplomat to 7 years for espionage	BANGKOK (AP) — A court in Beijing on Friday sentenced a prominent Chinese journalist to seven in years in prison for espionage, his family said. Dong Yuyu, a commentator and editor, was taken away by police while meeting a Japanese diplomat at a restaurant in February 2022. He has been in police custody since then. The Beijing Number 2 Intermediate People's Court read the verdict but did not share a copy with Dong's lawyers or family. No announcement was available on the court's website or its Weibo account. The verdict named then-Japanese ambassador Hideo Tarumi and Shanghai-based chief diplomat Masaru Okada as agents belonging to an espionage organization, according the family's statement. Dong had served as the deputy head of the editorial department at Guangming Daily, one of the five major state-owned papers in China. The paper was once considered more liberal than other state-backed papers. Dong also contributed to the Chinese edition of the New York Times. In his published writings, including essays as well as opinion articles, Dong had voiced his support for constitutional democracy and political reform, which later were considered to be against the stance of the Communist Party. He had contacts with foreign diplomats, scholars and other journalists as part of his decades-long career and counted Tarumi, the ambassador, as a friend. Still, his family said he knew he was always watched by state security, and therefore sought to be as open as possible while meeting his Japanese or American contacts. 'With Yuyu’s conviction, every Chinese citizen, when dealing with the Japanese embassy — or perhaps any other foreign embassy and diplomat — will be expected to know that the Chinese government may consider those embassies to be ‘espionage organizations,’' said the family in a statement. 'Every sensible Chinese citizen should be appalled by this reasoning.' The U.S. Ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, condemned Dong's conviction. 'Punishing Dong for exercising his freedom of speech and the press, guaranteed by the PRC’s constitution for all its citizens, is unjust.'	https://apnews.com/article/china-spying-journalist-sentenced-japanese-diplomat-d50beb4ba4fe794869a51d3b944a7c4c	2024-11-29T18:18:04-08:00	
North Korea's Kim vows steadfast support for Russia’s war in Ukraine	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed his country will 'invariably support' Russia’s war in Ukraine as he met Russia's defense chief, the North’s state media reported Saturday. A Russia military delegation led by Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in North Korea on Friday, amid growing international concern about the two countries’ expanding cooperation after North Korea sent thousands of troops to Russia last month. The official Korean Central News Agency said that Kim and Belousov reached 'a satisfactory consensus' on boosting strategic partnership and defending each country’s sovereignty, security interests and international justice in the face of the rapidly-changing international security environments in a Friday meeting. Kim said that North Korea 'will invariably support the policy of the Russian Federation to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity from the imperialists’ moves for hegemony,' KCNA said. North Korea has supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, calling it a defensive response to what both Moscow and Pyongyang call NATO’s 'reckless' eastward advance and U.S.-led moves to stamp out Russia’s position as a powerful state. Kim slammed a U.S. decision earlier in November to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles as a direct intervention in the conflict. He called recent Russian strikes on Ukraine 'a timely and effective measure' demonstrate Russia's resolve, KCNA said. According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops to Russia and some of them have already begun engaging in combat on the frontlines. U.S., South Korean and others say North Korea has also shipped artillery systems, missiles and other conventional weapons to replenish Russia’s exhausted weapons inventory. Both North Korea and Russia haven’t formally confirmed the North Korean troops’ movements, and have steadfastly denied reports of weapons shipments. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners are concerned that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles. Last week, South Korean national security adviser Shin Wonsik told a local SBS TV program that that Seoul assessed that Russia has provided air defense missile systems to North Korea. He said Russia also appeared to have given economic assistance to North Korea and various military technologies, including those needed for the North’s efforts to build a reliable space-based surveillance system. Belousov also met North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol on Friday. During a dinner banquet later the same day, Belousov said the the two countries' strategic partnership was crucial to defend their sovereignty from aggression and the arbitrary actions of imperialists, KCNA said. In June, Kim and Putin signed a treaty requiring both countries to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. It's considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-troops-ukraine-belousov-visit-35a6fd80f64ae2dd01637ed5e5b6451d	2024-11-29T17:30:52-08:00	
What to know about sudden rebel gains in Syria's 13-year war and why it matters	WASHINGTON (AP) — The 13-year civil war in Syria has roared back into prominence with a surprise rebel offensive on Aleppo, one of Syria's largest cities and an ancient business hub. The push is among the rebels' strongest in years in a war whose destabilizing effects have rippled far beyond the country's borders. It was the first opposition attack on Aleppo since 2016, when a brutal air campaign by Russian warplanes helped Syrian President Bashar Assad retake the northwestern city. Intervention by Russia, Iran and Iranian-allied Hezbollah and other groups has allowed Assad to remain in power, within the 70% of Syria under his control. The surge in fighting has raised the prospect of another violent front reopening in the Middle East, at a time when U.S.-backed Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both Iranian-allied groups. Robert Ford, the last-serving U.S. ambassador to Syria, pointed to months of Israeli strikes on Syrian and Hezbollah targets in the area, and to Israel’s ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon this week, as factors providing Syria’s rebels with the opportunity to advance. Here's a look at some of the key aspects of the new fighting: Why does the fighting at Aleppo matter? Assad has been at war with opposition forces seeking his overthrow for 13 years, a conflict that's killed an estimated half-million people. Some 6.8 million Syrians have fled the country, a refugee flow that helped change the political map in Europe by fueling anti-immigrant far-right movements. The roughly 30% of the country not under Assad is controlled by a range of opposition forces and foreign troops. The U.S. has about 900 troops in northeast Syria, far from Aleppo, to guard against a resurgence by the Islamic State. Both the U.S. and Israel conduct occasional strikes in Syria against government forces and Iran-allied militias. Turkey has forces in Syria as well, and has influence with the broad alliance of opposition forces storming Aleppo. Coming after years with few sizeable changes in territory between Syria's warring parties, the fighting 'has the potential to be really quite, quite consequential and potentially game-changing,' if Syrian government forces prove unable to hold their ground, said Charles Lister, a longtime Syria analyst with the U.S.-based Middle East Institute. Risks include if Islamic State fighters see it as an opening, Lister said. Ford said the fighting in Aleppo would become more broadly destabilizing if it drew Russia and Turkey — each with its own interests to protect in Syria — into direct heavy fighting against each other. What do we know about the group leading the offensive on Aleppo? The U.S. and U.N. have long designated the opposition force leading the attack at Aleppo — Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, known by its initials HTS — as a terrorist organization. Abu Mohammed al-Golani emerged as the leader of al-Qaida's Syria branch in 2011, in the first months of Syria's war. It was an unwelcome intervention to many in Syria's opposition, who hoped to keep the fight against Assad's brutal rule untainted by violent extremism. Golani and his group early on claimed responsibility for deadly bombings, pledged to attack Western forces, confiscated property from religious minorities and sent religious police to enforce modest dress by women. Golani and HTS have sought to remake themselves in recent years, focusing on promoting civilian government in their territory as well as military action, researcher Aaron Zelin noted. His group broke ties with al-Qaida in 2016. Golani cracked down on some extremist groups in his territory, and increasingly portrays himself as a protector of other religions. That includes last year allowing the first Christian Mass in the city of Idlib in years. By 2018, the Trump administration acknowledged it was no longer directly targeting Golani, Zelin said. But HTS has allowed some wanted armed groups to continue to operate on its territory, and shot at U.S. special forces at least as recently as 2022, he said. What's the history of Aleppo in the war? At the crossroads of trade routes and empires for thousands of years, Aleppo is one of the centers of commerce and culture in the Middle East. Aleppo was home to 2.3 million people before the war. Rebels seized the east side of the city in 2012, and it became the proudest symbol of the advance of armed opposition factions. In 2016, government forces backed by Russian airstrikes laid siege to the city. Russian shells, missiles and crude barrel bombs — fuel canisters or other containers loaded with explosives and metal — methodically leveled neighborhoods. Starving and under siege, rebels surrendered Aleppo that year. The Russian military's entry was the turning point in the war, allowing Assad to stay on in the territory he held. This year, Israeli airstrikes in Aleppo have hit Hezbollah weapons depots and Syrian forces, among other targets, according to an independent monitoring group. Israel rarely acknowledges strikes at Aleppo and other government-held areas of Syria.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-hts-assad-aleppo-fighting-2be43ee530b7932b123a0f26b158ac22	2024-11-29T13:21:07-08:00	
Canadian news publishers sue OpenAI over alleged copyright infringement	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A coalition of Canadian news publishers, including The Canadian Press, Torstar, Globe and Mail, Postmedia and CBC/Radio-Canada, has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for using news content to train its ChatGPT generative artificial intelligence system. The outlets said in a joint statement on Friday that OpenAI regularly breaches copyright by scraping large amounts of content from Canadian media. 'OpenAI is capitalizing and profiting from the use of this content, without getting permission or compensating content owners,' the statement said. The publishers argue that OpenAI practices undermine the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in journalism, and that content is protected by copyright. 'News media companies welcome technological innovations. However, all participants must follow the law, and any use of intellectual property must be on fair terms,' the statement said. Generative AI can create text, images, videos and computer code based on a simple prompt, but the systems must first study vast amounts of existing content. OpenAI said in a statement that its models are trained on publicly available data. It said they are 'grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation.' The company said it collaborates 'closely with news publishers, including in the display, attribution and links to their content in ChatGPT search' and offers outlets 'easy ways to opt-out should they so desire.' This is the first such case in Canada, though numerous lawsuits are underway in the United States, including a case by the New York Times against OpenAI and Microsoft. Some news organizations have chosen to collaborate rather than fight with OpenAI by signing deals to get compensated for sharing news content that can be used to train its AI systems. The Associated Press is among the news organizations that have made licensing deals over the past year with OpenAI. Others include The Wall Street Journal and New York Post publisher News Corp., The Atlantic, Axel Springer in Germany and Prisa Media in Spain, France’s Le Monde newspaper and the London-based Financial Times. Canada has passed a law requiring Google and Meta to compensate news publishers for the use of their content, but has previously declined to say whether the Online News Act should apply to use by AI systems. In response to that legislation, Meta pulled news from its platforms in Canada, while Google has reached a deal to pay $100 million Canadian (US$ 71 million) to Canadian news outlets.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-news-publishers-lawsuit-chatgpt-3e1790fcf4c9f001f1d32609c4d547af	2024-11-29T09:47:35-08:00	
Trudeau says Trump would raise prices on Americans if he follows through on Canada tariff threat	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on this threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, he would be raising prices for Americans and hurting American businesses. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if the countries don’t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across southern and northern borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders. 'It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There’s no question about it,' Trudeau said to reporters in Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada. 'Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for Americans citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,' he added. Trudeau said Trump got elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries but now he's talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products including potatoes from Prince Edward Island. Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump’s team negotiated during his initial term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully re-negotiate the deal, which he calls a 'win win' for both countries. 'We can work together as we did previously,' Trudeau said. Trump made the tariff threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border. The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone — and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024. Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border are few in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security. 'We’re going to work together to meet some of the concerns,' Trudeau said. 'But ultimately it is through lots of real constructive conversations with President Trump that I am going to have, that will keep us moving forward on the right track for all Canadians.' Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she is confident that a tariff war with the United States will be averted. Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with her and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States. When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the U.S. should Trump follow through on his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, a senior official told The Associated Press this week. A government official said Canada is preparing for every eventuality and has started thinking about what items to target with tariffs in retaliation. The official stressed no decision has been made. The person spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly. In the U.S., business groups were quick to warn about rapidly escalating inflation. House Democrats put together legislation to strip a president’s ability to unilaterally apply tariffs this drastic, warning that they would likely lead to higher prices for autos, shoes, housing and groceries. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. 'Canada has reason to fear because Trump is impulsive, often influenced by the last thing he sees on Fox News,' said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. 'He can leverage that by catering to what he thinks will sound and look good to the public rather than to what happens or will happen.'	https://apnews.com/article/canada-us-trudeau-trump-tariffs-4129d793d8e1a60fd6d1f45697901a21	2024-11-29T09:19:00-08:00	
Arrests in North Macedonia after raucous celebrations by members of ethnic Albanian minority	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — Police in North Macedonia have arrested 10 people following raucous celebrations — allegedly including gunfire — by members of the country's ethnic Albanian minority to mark an Albanian national holiday, officials said Friday. Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski said the suspects, who include several minors, face charges of 'inciting national, racial and religious hatred, discord and intolerance.' If tried and convicted, they face up to five years in prison. Hundreds of people took part in celebrations late Thursday of Albanian Flag Day in North Macedonia's capital, Skopje, and other cities. In Skopje, at least one flag of North Macedonia was hauled down, torn up and set on fire. Local reports said some people taking part in the celebrations had apparently fired bursts of shots in the air with automatic rifles. No injuries were reported. Thursday night's celebrations boosted ethnic tensions in the small Balkan country, which has a sizeable and occasionally restive ethnic Albanian minority. North Macedonia's right-wing government condemned the incidents as a bid to destabilize the country. All political parties, including those representing the ethnic Albanian minority, also issued statements of condemnation. Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski called the attack on the flag 'an act of aggression,' while Interior Minister Toshkovski said it was 'a direct attack against the state.' 'I appeal to Macedonian citizens, regardless of ethnicity, not to allow these criminal groups ... to destabilize our common homeland,' Mickoski said on Friday. According to the latest census in 2021, ethnic Albanians comprise nearly a third of the country's 1,8 million population. Relations between the Albanian minority and Macedonian majority have been fragile since North Macedonia left the former Yugoslavia in 1991. Ten years later, an armed ethnic Albanian uprising ended with a deal that granted more minority rights. North Macedonia borders to the west with Albania and to the north with Kosovo, most of whose population is ethnic Albanian. Albanian Flag Day celebrates Albania's declaration of independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912.	https://apnews.com/article/north-macedonia-ethnic-albanians-celebrations-arrests-skopje-0900a16e5aad9f788407f767ba4f110e	2024-11-29T09:03:03-08:00

Israelis are wary of returning to the north because they don't trust the ceasefire with Hezbollah	KIBBUTZ MALKIYA, Israel (AP) — Dean Sweetland casts his gaze over a forlorn street in the Israeli community of Kibbutz Malkiya. Perched on a hill overlooking the border with Lebanon, the town stands mostly empty after being abandoned a year ago. The daycare is closed. The homes are unkempt. Parts of the landscape are ashen from fires sparked by fallen Hezbollah rockets. Even after a tenuous Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire designed to let Israelis return to the north, the mood here is far from celebratory. 'The ceasefire is rubbish,' said Sweetland, a gardener and member of the kibbutz’s civilian security squad. 'Do you expect me to ring around my friends and say, ‘All the families should come home?’ No.' Across the border, Lebanese civilians have jammed roads in a rush to return to homes in the country's south, but most residents of northern Israel have met the ceasefire with suspicion and apprehension. 'Hezbollah could still come back to the border, and who will protect us when they do?' Sweetland asked. Israel’s government seeks to bring the northern reaches of the country back to life, particularly the line of communities directly abutting Lebanon that have played a major role in staking out Israel’s border. But the fear of Hezbollah, a lack of trust in United Nations peacekeeping forces charged with upholding the ceasefire, deep anger at the government and some Israelis' desire to keep rebuilding their lives elsewhere are keeping many from returning immediately. When the truce took effect, about 45,000 Israelis had evacuated from the north. They fled their homes after Hezbollah began firing across the border on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with its ally Hamas in Gaza. That triggered more than a year of cross-border exchanges, with Lebanese villages in the south and Israeli communities facing the border taking the brunt of the pain. During the truce's initial 60-day phase, Hezbollah is supposed to remove its armed presence from a broad band of southern Lebanon where the military says the militant group had been digging in for years by gathering weapons and setting up rocket launch sites and other infrastructure. Under the ceasefire, a U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL and a beefed-up Lebanese army presence are supposed to ensure Hezbollah doesn’t return. Many residents of northern Israel are skeptical that the peace will hold. Sarah Gould, who evacuated Kibbutz Malkiya at the start of the war with her three kids, said Hezbollah fired on the community up to and just past the minute when the ceasefire took effect early Wednesday. 'So for the government to tell me that Hezbollah is neutralized,' she said, 'it’s a perfect lie.' Residents fear for their safety in the far north In Gaza, where Israel is pushing forward with a war that has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, Israel’s goal is the eradication of Hamas. But in Lebanon, Israel’s aims were limited to pushing Hezbollah away from the border so northern residents could return home. Israeli critics say the government should have kept fighting to outright cripple Hezbollah or to clear out the border area, which is home to hundreds of thousands of Lebanese. 'I won’t even begin to consider going home until I know there’s a dead zone for kilometers across the border,' the 46-year-old Gould said. Some wary Israelis trickled back home Thursday and Friday to areas farther from the border. But communities like Kibbutz Manara, set on a tiny slice of land between Lebanon and Syria, remained ghost towns. Orna Weinberg, 58, who was born and raised in Manara, said it was too early to tell whether the ceasefire would protect the community. Perched above all the other border villages, Manara was uniquely vulnerable to Hezbollah fire throughout the war. Three-quarters of its structures were damaged. In the kibbutz’s communal kitchen and dining hall, ceiling beams have collapsed. The uprooted floorboards are covered with ash from fires that also claimed much of the kibbutz’s cropland. Rocket fragments abound. The torso of a mannequin, a decoy dressed in army green, lies on the ground. Weinberg tried to stay in Manara during the war, but after anti-tank shrapnel damaged her home, soldiers told her to leave. On Thursday, she walked along her street, which looks out directly over a UNIFIL position separating the kibbutz from a line of Lebanese villages that have been decimated by Israeli bombardment and demolitions. Weinberg said UNIFIL hadn’t prevented Hezbollah’s build-up in the past, 'so why would they be able to now?' 'A ceasefire here just gives Hezbollah a chance to rebuild their power and come back to places that they were driven out of,' she said. The truce seemed fragile. Associated Press reporters heard sporadic bursts of gunfire, likely Israeli troops firing at Lebanese attempting to enter the towns. Israel’s military says it is temporarily preventing Lebanese civilians from returning home to a line of towns closest to the border, until the Lebanese military can deploy there in force. Even in less battered communities, no one returns home Though the atmosphere along the border was tense, Malkiya showed signs of peace. With Hezbollah’s rockets stopped, some residents returned briefly to the kibbutz to peer around cautiously. At a vista overlooking the border, where the hulking wreckage of Lebanese villages could made out, a group of around 30 soldiers gathered. Just days ago, they would have made easy targets for Hezbollah fire. Malkiya has sustained less damage than Manara. Still, residents said they would not return immediately. During a year of displacement, many have restarted their lives elsewhere, and the idea of going back to a front-line town on the border is daunting. In Lebanon, where Israeli bombardment and ground assaults drove some 1.2 million people from their homes, some of the displaced crowded into schools-turned-shelters or slept in the streets. In Israel, the government paid for hotels for evacuees and helped accommodate children in new schools. Gould predicted residents would return to the kibbutz only when government subsidies for their lodging dried up — 'not because they want to, but because they feel like they can’t afford an alternative.' 'It’s not just a security issue,' Gould said. 'We’ve spent more than a year rebuilding our lives wherever we landed. It’s a question of having to gather that up and move back somewhere else, somewhere that’s technically our old house but not a home. Nothing feels the same.' It’s unclear if schools in the border communities will have enough students to reopen, Gould said, and her children are already enrolled elsewhere. She’s enjoyed living farther from the border, away from an open war zone. There’s also a deep feeling that the communities were abandoned by the government, Sweetland said. Sweetland is one of roughly 25 civilian security volunteers who stayed throughout the war, braving continual rocket fire to keep the kibbutz afloat. They repaired damaged homes, put out blazes and helped replace the kibbutz generator when it was taken out by Hezbollah fire. They were on their own, with no firefighters or police willing to risk coming, he said. 'We didn’t have any help for months and months and months, and we pleaded, ‘Please help us.’' Sweetland said he will keep watching over the hushed pathways of the once-vibrant community in hopes his neighbors will soon feel safe enough to return. But he predicted it would take months. Weinberg hopes to move back to Manara as soon as possible. On Thursday, she spotted a former neighbor who was about to leave after checking the damage to her home. Weinberg grasped her hand through the car window, asking how she was. The woman grimaced and began to cry. Their hands parted as the car slowly rolled out through the gates and drove away.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-ceasefire-residents-return-8688dd6431960ca8ce9aed4f6e85cb87	2024-11-29T08:13:11-08:00	
Atlantic hurricane season comes to an end, leaving widespread damage in its wake	The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season comes to a close Saturday, bringing to an end a season that saw 11 hurricanes compared to the average seven, and death and destruction hundreds of miles from where storms came ashore on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Meteorologists called it a ' crazy busy ' season, due in part to unusually warm ocean temperatures. Eight hurricanes made landfall, in the U.S., Bermuda, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Grenada. Here is some of what made the 2024 season stand out: Hurricane Beryl became the first Category 4 hurricane on record to form in the month of June, slamming into the island of Carriacou in Grenada. In Jamaica it went on to destroy crops and houses and left two dead. The last time the island was scraped by a Category 4 hurricane was Dean in 2007, making it 'pretty rare,' said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. The storm then intensified into the earliest Category 5 hurricane ever in the Atlantic on July 1. Major hurricanes — Category 3 and above — are not usually seen until September 1, according to the National Hurricane Center. In September, Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage across the southeastern U.S. and was the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005. More than 200 people died. North Carolina estimates the storm caused at least $48.8 billion in direct or indirect damages with houses, drinking water systems and farms and forests destroyed. Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia also sustained extensive damage. In October, Hurricane Milton rapidly intensified and the storm’s maximum wind speeds hit a screaming 180 mph, making it one of the strongest hurricanes by wind speed ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. The only one stronger by that measure was Hurricane Rita in 2005. The areas where Helene and Milton struck saw as much as three times their usual rainfall for September and October, the heart of the Atlantic hurricane season. For Asheville, Tampa and Orlando, the two-month period was the wettest on record. In November, Hurricane Rafael reached 120 mph and was nearly the strongest November hurricane on record in the Gulf of Mexico, tying with Hurricane Kate in 1985. Rafael made landfall in Cuba and battered the island as it was trying to recover from widespread blackouts caused by Hurricane Oscar in October. Hurricane season and climate change Planet-warming gases like carbon dioxide and methane released by transportation and industry are causing oceans to rapidly warm. Several factors contribute to the formation of hurricanes, but unusually warm oceans allow hurricanes to form and intensify in places and times we don’t normally anticipate, McNoldy said. 'In other words, we never had a storm as strong as Beryl so early in the season anywhere in the Atlantic and we never had a storm as strong as Milton so late in the season in the Gulf of Mexico,' he said. 'I don’t ever point to climate change as causing a specific weather event, but it certainly has its finger on the scale and makes these extreme storms more likely to occur,' said McNoldy. ____ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Middle East latest: 2 children and a woman crushed to death outside Gaza bakery amid food shortage	Two children and a woman were crushed to death Friday as a crowd of Palestinians pushed to get bread at a bakery in the Gaza Strip amid a worsening food crisis in the war-ravaged territory, medical officials said. The bodies of two girls aged 13 and 17 and the 50-year-old woman were taken to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where a doctor confirmed that they died from suffocation due to crowding at the al-Banna bakery. Video from The Associated Press showed their bodies placed next to each other on the floor inside the hospital's morgue. The flow of food allowed into Gaza by Israel has fallen to nearly its lowest level of almost 14-month-old war for the past two months, according to Israeli official figures. U.N. and aid officials say hunger and desperation are growing among Gaza’s population, almost all of which relies on humanitarian aid to survive. Osama Abu Laban, the father of one of the girls, wailed over the loss of her life outside the hospital. 'My wife fell when she heard that she (our daughter) was suffocating. She did not yet know that she was dead,' he told the AP. Some bakeries in Gaza were closed for several days last week due to a shortage of flour. AP footage taken last week after they reopened showed large crowds of people cramming together, screaming and pushing, at one bakery in Deir al-Balah. Palestinians across the Gaza Strip are heavily relying on bakeries and charitable kitchens, with many able to only secure one meal a day for their families. In Lebanon, thousands of displaced people began returning to their homes this week after a ceasefire was announced between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. Many found their homes reduced to rubble after intense Israeli airstrikes over the past two months leveled entire neighborhoods in eastern and southern Lebanon, as well as the southern suburbs of Beirut. Nearly 1.2 million people have been displaced. The truce was the first major sign of progress in the region since war began more than a year ago, triggered by Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. But it does not address the devastating war in Gaza. For Palestinians in Gaza and families of hostages held in the territory, the ceasefire marked another missed opportunity to end fighting that has stretched on for nearly 14 months. More than 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 wounded, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel has destroyed large parts of Gaza and displaced nearly all of its 2.3 million people. Here's the Latest: Hezbollah again starts holding public funerals for its fallen fighters MAARAKEH, Lebanon — Hezbollah held a public funeral in a southern village on Friday for five of its fighters killed during the fighting with Israel. It was the first time the Lebanese militant group held a public funeral since after the war intensified in late September. 'My son is in heaven,' said Zeinab al-Haj holding a bag or roses to toss them on the coffin of her son Ali Hijazi during the ceremony in the village of Maarakeh. Hijazi died of wounds suffered in an airstrike last week. Hezbollah’s last public funeral was held on Sept. 27, the same day the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a southern Beirut’s suburb. 'We are people who are proud of their martyrs,' said Hezbollah’s media chief in south Lebanon Salman Harb. 'Our martyrs are the symbol of our victory by all means.' After a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect on Wednesday, the group began announcing again its fallen fighters. More funerals are expected in the coming days including the funeral of three more fighters in Maarakeh on Saturday. Hezbollah had announced the death of nearly 500 fighters before Sept. 23, when the war intensified. Since late September, Hezbollah is believed to have lost hundreds of fighters whose funerals will be held whenever their bodies are recovered. Hezbollah is also expected to hold a funeral for Nasrallah and other top officials, including his successor Hashem Safieddine who was killed in an airstrike in early October. Hezbollah chief says the group agreed to the ceasefire deal ‘from a position of strength’ BEIRUT — Hezbollah chief Naim Kassem said on Friday that the militant group will coordinate closely with the Lebanese military to implement the U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement with Israel that followed nearly 14 months of intense fighting. He also claimed that with the deal, Hezbollah achieved 'a great victory that surpasses the victory of July 2006,' the last time the Iran-backed group was at war with Israel. 'The ceasefire agreement aligns with Lebanese sovereignty and we have accepted it from a position of strength,' he asserted, speaking in a pre-recorded message from an undisclosed location on the third day of the ceasefire. Kassem added there would be no confrontation between Hezbollah fighters and the Lebanese Army. 'Don’t bet on any disagreement or friction between us and the army,' he said. 'The army will be deploying in its country, which is also ours.' Kassem also pledged Hezbollah will help 'with rebuilding and cooperate with the state and all organizations and countries willing to assist Lebanon, aiming to make Lebanon more beautiful than it was.' The World Bank estimates that Lebanon’s financial losses from the conflict — which was initially limited to the border but escalated dramatically in mid-September —exceed $8 billion, further straining a country already reeling from a series of cascading crises since 2019. Israeli military says it struck a site of a Hezbollah rocket launcher in southern Lebanon JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said it struck an area in southern Lebanon where it detected movement of a Hezbollah rocket launcher on Friday, the third day of the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel. In the statement on the airstrike, the military said it would 'actively enforce violations of the ceasefire agreement.' The strike followed several Israeli military attacks in southern Lebanon earlier in the day, which were reported by the Lebanese state media, and an Israeli drone strike on a Hezbollah weapons depot on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Lebanese army, which has accused Israel of breaking the ceasefire several times since it came into effect. Hamas claims attack on Israeli bus in West Bank that wounded 8 people, including 4 soldiers RAMALLAH, West Bank — Hamas claimed responsibility for a shooting attack on an Israeli bus in the occupied West Bank on Friday that wounded eight people, including four soldiers. It was the latest violence to scar the territory as tensions run high 14 months into the Israel-Hamas war. The attacker, who Hamas identified in a statement as Samer Hussein, 46, was killed by Israeli troops shortly after opening fire toward the bus at a junction near the Israeli settlement of Ariel. The military said four soldiers were lightly wounded. Paramedics said three people were critically wounded. Attacks by Palestinian militants on Israelis in the volatile territory have grown more common since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, as Palestinian deaths have also spiked. Israeli fire has killed 796 Palestinians since Oct. 7, 2023, mostly in military raids on Palestinian cities and towns. Attacks by settlers on Palestinians and their property have also increased. Lebanon's state media says Israel carried out several attacks in the south BEIRUT — The Israeli army carried out several attacks in southern Lebanon on Friday, the third day of the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, Lebanon’s state media said. Artillery bombardment struck the villages of Markaba, Talusa and Khiyam while four Israeli tanks moved into the western part of Khiyam, the report said, adding that an Israeli tank fired at a house in Nabatiyeh province. Local media also reported that the Israeli army fired on civilians in the nearby village of Bint Jbeil. No casualties were immediately reported and The Associated Press was not immediately able to verify the claims. Israel's and Lebanon's armies did not comment on the alleged attacks. Lebanon politician calls on Hezbollah to work with Lebanese army BEIRUT — The leader of a leading Christian political party in Lebanon has called on Hezbollah to engage with the Lebanese army and devise a plan to dismantle its military infrastructure south and north of the Litani river. In a press conference Friday, Samir Geagea, head of the Lebanese Forces Party, criticized Hezbollah for opening a front with Israel and accused the Shiite militant group of committing a 'major crime' against the Lebanese people. 'We could have done without the martyrdom of more than 4,000 people, the displacement of thousands and the destruction across the country,' Geagea said. 'Despite all these tragedies, Hezbollah continues to talk about a victory using a bizarre and disconnected logic that has no basis in reality.' Geagea’s comments came two days after a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel went into effect. More than 3,900 people have been killed in Lebanon since Israel's conflict with Hezbollah escalated. Geagea, whose Lebanese Forces Party holds the largest bloc in Lebanon’s 128-member parliament, also addressed Lebanon’s presidential deadlock. The country has been without a president for more than two years. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has scheduled a session for presidential elections in January. 'Consultations with opposition factions and our allies will begin in the coming days to explore the possibility of agreeing on presidential candidates and bringing them to parliament,' Geagea said. 2 children and a woman crushed to death outside Gaza bakery Two children and a 50-year-old woman were crushed to death Friday as a crowd of Palestinians pushed to get bread at a bakery in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, medical officials said. The flow of food allowed into Gaza by Israel has fallen to nearly its lowest level of the almost 14-month-old war for the past two months, according to Israeli official figures. U.N. and aid officials say hunger and desperation are growing among Gaza’s population, almost all of which relies on humanitarian aid to survive. A doctor at Al-Aqsa Hospital confirmed that the three died from suffocation due to crowding at the al-Banna bakery in Deir al-Balah. Some bakeries in Gaza were closed for several days last week due to a shortage of flour. AP footage taken last week after they reopened showed large crowds of people cramming together, screaming and pushing, at one bakery in Deir al-Balah. Bags of bread now sell in the black market near bakeries for up to $17 each. Palestinians across the Gaza Strip are heavily relying on bakeries and charitable kitchens, with many able to only secure one meal a day for their families. Osama Abu Laban, the father of one of the girls killed Friday, wailed over the loss of her life outside the hospital. 'My wife fell when she heard that she (our daughter) was suffocating. She did not yet know that she was dead,' he told the AP. He added that he had also lost his son, father, uncle, and cousins, all in northern Gaza. Several women gathered inside the morgue to mourn their dead relatives, with one woman screaming 'they went to buy bread, they crushed them.' ___ Read more of the AP's coverage of the Middle East wars: https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-war-latest-29-november-2024-841bab5c3c9cbc1c0bc7f94b5d4cae56	2024-11-29T03:46:10-08:00	
Family returns to Lebanon to find a crater where their 50-year-old home once stood	BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) — In eastern Lebanon's city of Baalbek, the Jawhari family gathered around a gaping crater where their home once stood, tears streaming as they tried to make sense of the destruction. 'It is heart-breaking. A heartache that there is no way we will ever recover from,' said Lina Jawhari, her voice breaking as she hugged relatives who came to support the family. 'Our world turned upside down in a second.' The home, which was a gathering place for generations, was reduced to rubble by an Israeli airstrike on Nov. 1, leaving behind shattered memories and twisted fragments of a once-vibrant life. The family, like thousands of Lebanese, were returning to check on their properties after the U.S.-mediated ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect early Wednesday. Intense Israeli airstrikes over the past two months leveled entire neighborhoods in eastern and southern Lebanon, as well as the southern suburbs of Beirut, which are predominantly Shiite areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a strong base of support. Nearly 1.2 million people have been displaced. The airstrikes have left a massive trail of destruction across the country. A photo of the Jawhari family's home — taken on a phone by Louay Mustafa, Lina’s nephew — is a visual reminder of what had been. As the family sifted through the rubble, each fragment recovered called them to gather around it. A worn letter sparked a collective cheer, while a photo of their late father triggered sobs. Reda Jawhari had built the house for his family and was a craftsman who left behind a legacy of metalwork. The sisters cried and hoped to find a piece of the mosque-church structure built by their father. Minutes later, they lifted a mangled piece of metal from the debris. They clung to it, determined to preserve a piece of his legacy. 'Different generations were raised with love... Our life was music, dance, dabke (traditional dance). This is what the house is made up of. And suddenly, they destroyed our world. Our world turned upside down in a second. It is inconceivable. It is inconceivable,' Lina said. Despite their determination, the pain of losing their home and the memories tied to it remains raw. Rouba Jawhari, one of four sisters, had one regret. 'We are sad that we did not take my mom and dad’s photos with us. If only we took the photos,' she said, clutching an ID card and a bag of photos and letters recovered from the rubble. 'It didn’t cross our mind. We thought it’s two weeks and we will be back.' The airstrike that obliterated the Jawhari home came without warning, striking at 1:30 p.m. on what was otherwise an ordinary Friday. Their neighbor, Ali Wehbe, also lost his home. He had stepped out for food a few minutes before the missile hit and rushed back to find his brother searching for him under the rubble. 'Every brick holds a memory,' he said, gesturing to what remained of his library. 'Under every book you would find a story.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-return-destroyed-family-home-e147e2ae416986cb75ae9fd00be347d0	2024-11-29T03:23:56-08:00	
Protesters in Serbia hold 15-minute blockade for 15 victims of roof collapse, demanding justice	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Protesters in Serbia stood in silence for 15 minutes on Friday for the victims of a roof collapse four weeks ago in a northern city, seeking to keep up pressure on the populist authorities to punish those responsible for the tragedy. Traffic was blocked for a third week in a row at various spots in several Serbian cities and towns, including in the northern city of Novi Sad where the concrete outer roof at the central railway station smashed down on people on Nov. 1 without warning. Initially 14 people died and three were injured but one more person later died in hospital. The railway station building was renovated twice in recent years. Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption and opaque deals resulted in sloppy work during reconstruction and led to the collapse of the roof. Street protests and blockades have been held almost daily since the roof crash, demanding justice. Another rally is planned on Sunday in Novi Sad to mark one month since the tragedy. While prosecutors have announced the arrests of 13 people, a Serbian court this week released from detention former government construction minister Goran Vesic. This has fueled widespread skepticism of the ongoing investigation, as the populists control both the police and judiciary. Serbia's authoritarian President Aleksandar Vucic has accused the protesters of being bullies and thugs who used people's deaths for political gains. Scuffles have erupted both in Serbia's parliament and during some of the recent rallies when pro-government protesters showed up to break up the opposition-led blockades. Minor incidents were also reported during Friday's silent protest in Belgrade, the capital city. In Novi Sad, residents held a long black banner for the victims. Some people at the protests in other cities held white roses or posters with a red handprint, telling the authorities they have 'blood on their hands.' Opposition parties have repeatedly called for the resignation of Serbia’s prime minister and his government, as well as access to full documentation in the train station building and other infrastructure projects with Chinese state companies. The station in Novi Sad was originally built in 1964. Its renovation was part of a bigger project with China and Hungary to build a high-speed railway between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-protest-novi-sad-station-76c599b237a4e3052039f0c3b1bfde2f	2024-11-29T03:21:37-08:00	
Thousands of workers march across Italy in general strike demanding better pay and services	MILAN (AP) — Thousands of teachers, health care workers, trash collectors and others walked off their jobs across Italy on Friday to protest a decline in spending power, persistently low salaries and government policies they say have weakened public services. Italy’s most powerful trade unions called the eight-hour strike and mobilized marches in cities across the country to target Premier Giorgia Meloni’s latest budget that they say penalizes schools, health care and other services. They also are pressing for a more equitable distribution of profits from private companies to workers. 'These protests don’t just speak to the government,’’ Maurizio Landini, head of the powerful CGIL conglomerate, told reporters in Bologna. 'They speak also to entrepreneurs, managers and businesses, who in these years have made profits like never before.' The strike forced ITA airlines to cancel dozens of domestic and international flights, and hit schools, hospitals and local transport. Unions called for an eight-hour strike but Transport Minister Matteo Salvini imposed an injunction limiting the strike in the transport sector to four hours. It was the first general strike since last November. Unions faced possible sanctions for involving the health care and justice sectors, which have staged strikes recently. The Italian railway, which also has been the target of recent labor actions, was exempted. Italy’s health care sector has been suffering staffing shortages that has forced the hiring of nurses from abroad, with care in the poorer south particularly lagging that in the more prosperous north. 'There are many people who go abroad because the salaries are too low,’’ said Anna Salsa, a member of the UIL health care union, at the demonstration in Rome. 'We are forced to do double shifts to give the minimal levels of essential care.' Protesters also cited persistent increases in the cost of basic necessities. Despite indications that inflation is cooling, the Codacons consumer protection lobby said that grocery costs for a family of four have risen by 238 euro ($251) a year in 2024 compared with last year, forcing many families to reduce their consumption. While starting salaries in Italy are aligned with the rest of Europe, pay increases do not keep pace, said Maurizio Del Conte, a labor law expert at Milan’s Bocconi University. As a result, Italy’s gross median salary of 35,000 euros (nearly $37,000) a year is at the low end of European averages, well behind its G7 partners in France and Germany. He noted that such protests are historically more influential when engaging center-left governments, which are friendly to unions, rather than conservative governments, such as Meloni's far-right-led government. ___ Paolo Santalucia contributed from Rome.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-labor-strike-services-meloni-budget-unions-0c14a99aba5e17f03bd4cb63dc6cb3f9	2024-11-29T03:07:17-08:00	
Senior figure with Scholz's ex-allies quits over 'D-Day' paper on German government collapse	BERLIN (AP) — A senior figure in the party whose departure from Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition three weeks ago put Germany on the road to an early election resigned Friday in a furor over an internal document discussing how the party could leave the government, a presentation whose title referred to 'D-Day.' Bijan Djir-Sarai of the pro-business Free Democrats said he was quitting as general secretary, the official responsible for day-to-day political strategy and election planning. He said he was 'taking the political responsibility in order to head off damage to my credibility and that of the Free Democrats.' The affair threatens to complicate further the Free Democrats' campaign for an election in which polls already suggest they risk falling short of the 5% support needed to keep any seats in parliament. Scholz fired Christian Lindner, the Free Democrats' leader, as finance minister on Nov. 6 as a long-running dispute in his three-party coalition over how to revitalize Germany's stagnant economy came to a head. The Free Democrats quit the government, leaving Scholz without a parliamentary majority. Scholz plans to call a confidence vote on Dec. 16. He is expected to lose, paving the way for an election on Feb. 23. Scholz and Lindner have traded blame for the collapse of the coalition, a combination of the chancellor's center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the Free Democrats that had long been notorious for infighting. After the coalition collapsed, German media reported on an internal strategy document which they said set out plans by the Free Democrats to end the government. On Nov. 18, Djir-Sarai denied that the term 'D-Day' — a reference to the Allied landings in France in 1944 that helped liberate Europe from Nazi Germany's rule — had been used. But on Thursday, the Free Democrats released what they said was a working document drawn up by a lower-level official on questions of how the party could communicate a possible departure from the government. It is headed 'D-Day process scenario and measures' and contains a reference to the 'beginning of the open battle' as one stage in the communication effort. That language drew criticism even from within the party. Djir-Sarai said in his brief resignation statement that he had not known of the internal document at the time of his denial and had unwittingly given false information. He apologized. The party said the paper was first drawn up on Oct. 24 and was last updated on Nov. 5, the version it released.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-election-free-democrats-resignation-dday-djirsarai-b85630b66301ba75b1017e11a777e848	2024-11-29T02:21:48-08:00	
Iran to begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges, UN watchdog says	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran will begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges at its two main nuclear facilities at Fordo and Natanz, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said Friday, further raising tensions over Tehran's program as it enriches at near weapons-grade levels. The notice from the International Atomic Energy Agency only mentioned Iran enriching uranium with new centrifuges to 5% purity, far lower than the 60% it currently does — likely signaling that it still wants to negotiate with the West and the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. However, it remains unclear how Trump will approach Iran once he enters office, particularly as it continues to threaten to attack Israel amid its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and just after a ceasefire started in its campaign in Lebanon. Trump withdrew America from the accord in 2018, setting in motion a series of attacks and incidents across the wider Mideast. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the IAEA's report. Tehran had threatened to rapidly advance its program after the Board of Governors at the IAEA condemned Iran at a meeting in November for failing to cooperate fully with the agency. In a statement, the IAEA outlined the plans Iran informed it of, which include feeding uranium into multiple cascades of its advanced IR-2M, IR-4 and IR-6 centrifuges. Cascades are a group of centrifuges that spin uranium gas together to more quickly enrich the uranium. Each of these advanced classes of centrifuges enrich uranium faster than Iran’s baseline IR-1 centrifuges, which have been the workhorse of the country’s atomic program. The IAEA did not elaborate on how many machines would be in each cascade but Iran has put around 160 centrifuges into a single cascade in the past. It's unclear if Iran has begun feeding the uranium yet into the centrifuges. Tehran so far has been vague about its plans. But starting the enrichment at 5% gives Tehran both leverage at negotiations with the West and another way to dial up the pressure if they don't like what they hear. Weapons-grade levels of enrichment are around 90%. Since the collapse of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers following the U.S.’ unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, it has pursued nuclear enrichment just below weapons-grade levels. U.S. intelligence agencies and others assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program. Iran, as a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has pledged to allow the IAEA to visit its atomic sites to ensure its program is peaceful. Tehran also had agreed to additional oversight from the IAEA as part of the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw sanctions lifted in exchange for drastically limiting its program. However, for years Iran has curtailed inspectors’ access to sites while also not fully answering questions about other sites where nuclear material has been found in the past after the deal's collapse. Iranian officials in recent months, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, had signaled a willingness to negotiate with the West. But Iran also has launched two attacks on Israel amid the war. Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian diplomat, said in a post on the social platform that he met with EU diplomat Enrique Mora, criticizing Europe as being 'self-centered' while having 'irresponsible behavior.' 'With regard to the nuclear issue of Iran, Europe has failed to be a serious player due to lack of self-confidence and responsibility,' Gharibabadi wrote. For his part, Mora described having a 'frank discussion' with Gharibabadi and another Iranian diplomat. Those talks included 'Iran’s military support to Russia that has to stop, the nuclear issue that needs a diplomatic solution, regional tensions (important to avoid further escalation from all sides) and human rights,' he wrote on X. ___ Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-iaea-mideast-wars-israel-7450481f9e42ea5b786c5d672ec382a1	2024-11-29T02:15:51-08:00	
Inflation rose to 2.3% in Europe. That won't stop the central bank from cutting interest rates	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro currency rose in November — but that likely won’t stop the European Central Bank from cutting interest rates as the prospect of new U.S. tariffs from the incoming Trump administration adds to the gloom over weak growth. The European Union’s harmonized index of consumer prices stood up 2.3% in the year to November, up from 2.0% in October, the EU statistics agency Eurostat reported Friday. Energy prices fell 1.9% from a year ago, but that was offset by price increases of 3.9% in the services sector, a broad category including haircuts, medical treatment, hotels and restaurants, and sports and entertainment. Inflation has come down a long way from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 as the ECB quickly raised rates to cool off price rises. It then started cutting them in June as worries about growth came into sharper focus. High central bank benchmark rates combat inflation by influencing borrowing costs throughout the economy. Higher rates make buying things on credit — whether a car, a house or a new factory — more expensive and thus reduce demand for goods and take pressure off prices. However, higher rates can also dampen growth. Growth worries got new emphasis after surveys of purchasing managers compiled by S&amp;P Global showed the eurozone economy was contracting in October. On top of that come concerns about how U.S. trade policy under incoming President Donald Trump, including possible new tariffs, or import taxes on imported goods, might affect Europe’s export-dependent economy. Trump takes office Jan. 20. The eurozone’s economic output is expected to grow 0.8% for all of this year and 1.3% next year, according to the European Commission’s most recent forecast. All that has meant the discussion about the Dec. 12 ECB meeting has focused not on whether the Frankfurt-based bank’s rate council will cut rates, but by how much. Market discussion has included the possibility of a larger than usual half-point cut in the benchmark rate, currently 3.25%. Inflation in Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, held steady at 2.4%. That 'will strengthen opposition against a 50 basis point cut,' said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING bank, using financial jargon for a half-percentage-point cut. The ECB sets interest rate policy for the European Union member countries that have joined the euro currency.	https://apnews.com/article/ecb-european-central-bank-eurozone-economy-inflation-d84aca91a80813ec3193e4df6d0bcac5	2024-11-29T01:41:05-08:00	
British lawmakers give initial approval to a bill to allow terminally ill adults to end their lives	LONDON (AP) — British lawmakers gave initial approval on Friday to a bill to help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales, following an impassioned debate that saw people sharing personal stories of loss and suffering. Members of Parliament approved the assisted dying bill by a 330-275 vote, signaling their approval in principle for the bill, which will undergo further scrutiny before it goes to a final vote. Friday's vote came after hours of debate — emotional at times — that touched on issues of ethics, faith and law. There was no braying and shouting that often marks debates in the House of Commons and speeches were considered respectfully and heard in silence. 'Let’s be clear, we’re not talking about a choice between life or death, we are talking about giving dying people a choice about how to die,' the bill’s main sponsor, Kim Leadbeater, said as she presented the bill to a packed chamber. Supporters said the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent suffering, while protecting the vulnerable. Opponents said the disabled and elderly were at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, to end their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members. Others called for the improvement of palliative care to ease suffering as an alternative. The proposed bill would allow adults over the age of 18 who are expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided help to end their life, subject to several safeguards. They would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves, and two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision. The bill will not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland. Backers of the bill told heart-wrenching stories about constituents and family members who suffered in the final months of their lives and dying people who committed suicide in secret because it is currently a crime for anyone to provide assistance. Danny Kruger, who led the argument against the bill, cautioned lawmakers not to back a 'state suicide service.' He argued that no amount of safeguards will stop many vulnerable people feeling the pressure to make a request to end their lives. Kruger voiced his disappointment at the outcome but said there's a chance lawmakers will reject the bill when it comes back for a vote in the next few months. Some of those voting in favor said they only did so to examine the details further and could potentially vote against it in the future. 'I still think we can stop it,' he said. Although the bill was proposed by Leadbeater, a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it was an open vote with alliances formed across the political divide. The government is widely expected to come up in the next few months with assessments on how assisted dying will be funded and how it would impact the U.K.'s state-funded National Health Service, hospice care and the legal system. Prime Minister Keir Starmer did not show his hand ahead of the vote, but backed the change. Others in his Cabinet, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood, voted against. There were similar divisions across other political parties. Long-time British campaigner Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with lung cancer and played a leading role in advocating the need for a vote on assisted dying, voiced her joy at the 'wonderful' outcome and said it will give people an 'equal choice.' When diagnosed with her terminal illness, Rantzen said she would travel to Switzerland to bring an end to her life, where the law allows assisted dying for non-residents. Hundreds of people on both sides of the issue gathered outside Parliament on a cold but bright day as the debate continued for nearly five hours. Opponents held signs saying, 'Kill the bill, not the ill,' and, referring to the National Health Service, 'NHS It's cradle to grave. Not 'til old, inconvenient or expensive!' The group Dignity in Dying, many wearing pink winter hats, led supporters as they clutched signs saying 'Giving me choice over my death,' and 'You can't cure death. Please make it fear free.' Backers of the measure erupted in cheers when the result was announced and hugged each other. 'It’s a relief, it’s history, finally we are getting towards having a society that shows love and compassion above the need to just keep people alive,' said Joshua Cook, 33, who has Huntington’s disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disease. Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction. Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-assisted-dying-debate-legalizing-0bc2de13d41fe6d62753935e91dfb0f8	2024-11-29T01:20:57-08:00	
Syria insurgents push their advance toward 2nd largest city Aleppo	BEIRUT (AP) — Thousands of Syrian insurgents pushed on with their advances on government-held areas in the country’s northwest, reaching the outskirts of Syria’s second largest city Aleppo and wrestling control of several strategic towns and villages along the way, activists and fighters said Friday. Syria’s state media said projectiles from insurgents landed in the student accommodations at Aleppo's university, killing four people, including two students. Public transportation to the city has also been diverted from the main highway linking Aleppo to the capital Damascus to avoid clashes, state-controlled media reported. Fighters also advanced on the town of Saraqab, in northwestern Idlib province, a strategic area that would secure supply lines to Aleppo. This week's advances were one of the largest by opposition factions, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, and comes after weeks of low simmering violence. It is most intense fighting in northwestern Syria since 2020, when government forces seized areas previously controlled by opposition fighters. Syria’s Armed Forces said the insurgents are violating a 2019 agreement that de-escalated fighting in the area, which has been the last remaining opposition stronghold for years. State media reported airstrikes on insurgents’ positions in Aleppo countryside. The insurgents reported that fighters have wrestled controlled of the Scientific Research Center neighborhood, on the western outskirts of Aleppo city. It is the closest the rebels have come to Aleppo city since they were ousted from its eastern side in 2016. Russia and Iran had helped Syrian government forces reclaim control of all of Aleppo that year, after a gruelling military campaign and a siege that lasted for weeks. The battle for Aleppo was a turning point in the war between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters since the 2011 protests against Bashar Assad’s rule turned into an all-out war. The war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of fighters from both sides have been killed in the battle that started Wednesday. The insurgents have seized control of more than 50 villages in their advance, which seem to have caught the government forces unprepared. Insurgents posted videos online showing they were using drones in their advance, a new weapon they had not had previously in the earlier stages of their confrontation with government forces. It was not clear to what extent the drones were used on the battleground. Aid groups said the fighting has displaced thousands of families, and forced some services to be suspended. The opposition fighters said their offensive will allow the return of thousands of displaced people who were forced to flee government bombardment in recent weeks. The offensive also came as Iran-linked groups, who had backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battle at home. Israel and Hezbollah, the lead group in the Iran-backed alliance, have been locked in a war that escalated since September. A cease-fire was announced Wednesday, the day the Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days. Russia, along with Iran, backed Syrian government forces soon after the anti-government protests in 2011 turned into a war. Turkey has backed an array of opposition forces and established military presence in parts of northwestern Syria. Meanwhile, the United States has supported Syrian Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State militants largely in the east of the country.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085	2024-11-29T01:20:34-08:00	
Amazon workers in India join Black Friday strike action for better wages and working conditions	NEW DELHI (AP) — Amazon staff in India have joined strike action calling for better wages and working conditions as the company prepares for one of the busiest shopping periods of the year . About 200 warehouse workers and delivery drivers rallied in the capital, New Delhi, under a ``Make Amazon Pay' banner. Some donned masks of Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and joined hands against the Seattle-based company’s practices. The walkout on Black Friday, which starts one of the biggest shopping weekends of the year, was repeated at Amazon warehouses in other countries as workers called for higher wages, better working conditions, and union rights. There was no immediate statement by Amazon India. 'Our basic salary is 10,000 rupees ($120), which should be at least 25,000 rupees ($295),' said Manish Kumar, 25, a warehouse worker who joined the New Dehli protest. 'And the environment there is to work under pressure,' he added. Nitesh Das, a union leader, said the workers took to the streets because they want the government to take up their cause. A statement from the Amazon India Workers Union said similar protests are planned in other parts of India as well as in other countries, including the United States, Germany, Japan, and Brazil. The demonstrations will call on Amazon to pay its workers fairly, respect their right to join unions, and commit to environmental sustainability, it said. The union said it would submit a memorandum highlighting its demands to India’s Labor Minister Mansukh Mandaviya. The gig economy has become huge in India due to its fast economic growth, but workers face low wages and difficult working conditions. India’s National Human Rights Commission sent a notice to Amazon in June 2023 after local media reports that workers were being made to work without breaks during the peak hot summer season. Amazon India denied the charge.	https://apnews.com/article/amazon-india-workers-strike-pay-protest-b039fb4b0ad7b2a2ca7639d62643b5e4	2024-11-29T01:04:29-08:00	
Malaysian billionaire tycoon Ananda Krishnan dies at age 86	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Ananda Krishnan, one of Malaysia's richest tycoons with a vast business empire including telecommunications, media, petroleum and real estate, has died. He was 86. His investment holding company, Usaha Tegas, said he passed away peacefully on Thursday and that his family requested privacy. It didn't specify the cause of death. 'Ananda made significant contributions to nation-building and the corporate world. His philanthropic initiatives have touched many lives,' it said in a statement. Ananda was ranked Malaysia’s sixth-richest man by Forbes with a net worth of $5.1 billion (22.6 billion ringgit). Born April 1, 1983, Ananda was a graduate of Harvard Business School who started his career in oil trading before venturing into other sectors. He owned stakes in telecommunications firm Maxis, media company Astro, satellite services firm Measat and oil services provider Bumi Armada, among others. Local media reported that Ananda made most of his wealth during the 1980s and 1990s, making him closely associated with then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. He was a founding director of state oil firm Petronas, and the national Bernama news agency reported Friday that he sold the idea of building the 88-story Petronas Twin Towers to Mahathir. Ananda was instructed to lead its construction, transforming a horse racing track into the landmark and forever changing Kuala Lumpur's skyline. Ananda donated to education, the arts, sports and humanitarian causes in Malaysia. The Edge newspaper reported that his fortunes took a hit in 2018 when Indian authorities linked him to a high-profile corruption scandal involving high-ranking government officials. Although arrest warrants were issued in India for him and his former deputy, Ralph Marshall, neither was apprehended or extradited to face charges. Despite his success, Ananda avoided the limelight and shuttled between Malaysia and France, where he resided with his wife, local media reported. His only son is a Buddhist monk in Thailand. His two daughters are not involved in his businesses. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim paid tribute to Ananda, saying his 'contribution in the corporate world, philanthropy and society will definitely be remembered.'	https://apnews.com/article/malaysia-tycoon-death-ananda-krishnan-obit-1cdae998436c19ab09dcc4e8e9be71c4	2024-11-29T00:14:39-08:00	
Negotiators get closer to agreeing on a plastic pollution treaty	BUSAN, South Korea (AP) — Negotiators working on a treaty to address the global crisis of plastic pollution inched closer to an agreement Friday, with more countries saying they want to address the total plastic on Earth. The most contentious issue of the talks is whether there will be a limit on the amount of plastic that companies are allowed to produce. Panama proposed text for the treaty to address plastic production on Thursday. Juan Carlos Monterrey, head of Panama's delegation, said it's a compromise proposal to build consensus because it does not include a numerical target or production cap. Instead, it says countries would adopt a global target at a later conference of the parties meeting. Support for Panama's proposal quickly grew to over 100 countries. Some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, including Saudi Arabia, vigorously oppose including plastic production in the treaty, calling it a red line. Russia’s delegation has said if the world is serious about this treaty, negotiators must concentrate on provisions acceptable for all delegations. Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the committee chair from Ecuador, issued a paper on Friday with draft treaty text, condensing the views expressed by negotiators during the week. The treaty article on production has Panama's proposal. The other option is to strike that article. 'This is great! This is great,' Monterrey said as he read the document on his cellphone. 'It is a big show of force, of muscle, for those countries that are ambitious. And also this shows that consensus is still possible,' he said in an interview. Global plastics production is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, up 70% from 2020, without policy changes, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Environmental organizations demonstrated with signs outside the convention center Friday morning, demanding that negotiators show courage. Many of those organizations want a treaty that addresses both the volume of production and chemicals of concern used in plastic products. The draft treaty text does not contain global, legally-binding controls on any of those chemicals. Countries that oppose such a provision, and plastics industry leaders, have said the treaty is not the proper venue to regulate chemicals. Fiji's delegation said it would not support a treaty without a provision on chemicals of concern. 'The world is watching. The world sees the divide in the room for what it is,' Sivendra Michael, Fiji's permanent secretary for environment and climate change, said at a press conference about the importance of production in the plastics treaty. 'The divide is between those, all of us here, looking to protect the people and the planet and those looking to protect the profits in the interests of the past and present industries.' Anthony Agotha, with the European Union delegation, said the 'time for freedom to pollute should be over.' Graham Forbes, head of the Greenpeace delegation, said the new paper is a 'weak attempt to force us to reach a conclusion and get a treaty for treaty’s sake,' with the only silver lining being the inclusion of a process for achieving a global target to reduce plastic production. Negotiators began meeting Monday in Busan. They split into groups to consider text for treaty articles. By the midpoint of the negotiations, none had agreed to anything. They were having long discussions over topics where there’s more agreement, such as the need to manage plastic waste better. And they hadn't settled on some of the basics of the treaty, such as the scope and definitions. Valdivieso told them Wednesday night their progress was too slow and they had to speed up significantly. The delegations will now discuss Valdivieso's paper and decide whether to agree to the articles. The meeting ends late Sunday or early Monday. U.N.

Notre Dame Cathedral unveils its new interior 5 years after devastating fire	PARIS (AP) — After more than five years of frenetic reconstruction work, Notre Dame Cathedral showed its new self to the world Friday, with rebuilt soaring ceilings and creamy good-as-new stonework erasing somber memories of its devastating fire in 2019. Images broadcast live of a site visit by French President Emmanuel Macron showed the inside of the iconic cathedral as worshippers might have experienced it back in medieval times, its wide, open spaces filled with bright light on a crisp and sunny winter’s day that lit up the vibrant colors of the stained-glass windows. Gaping holes that the blaze tore into the vaulted ceilings, leaving charred piles of debris, are gone, now filled in with new stonework. Delicate golden angels look on from the centerpiece of one of the rebuilt ceilings. The cathedral's limestone walls look brand new, cleaned not only of dust from the fire but also of grime that had accumulated for years. The cathedral attracted millions of worshippers and visitors annually before the blaze. Powerful vacuum cleaners were used to first remove toxic dust released when the fire melted the cathedral's lead roofs. Fine layers of latex were then sprayed onto the surfaces and removed a few days later, taking dirt away with them. Macron entered via the cathedral’s giant and intricately carved front doors and stared up at the ceilings in wonder. He was accompanied by his wife, Brigitte, the archbishop of Paris and others. Their visit kicks off a series of events ushering in the reopening of the 12th-century Gothic masterpiece. Macron will return on Dec. 7 to deliver an address and attend the consecration of the new altar during a solemn Mass the following day. Macron's administration is hailing the reconstruction as a symbol of national unity and French can-do.	https://apnews.com/article/paris-notre-dame-macron-fire-reconstruction-0a6c183693b55a55e0dc3a909000cb02	2024-11-28T23:41:55-08:00	
Georgian protesters and police clash after prime minister suspends talks on joining the EU	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Police and protesters brutally clashed in Georgia after the country's ruling party suspended negotiations to join the European Union until 2028. Police used water cannons, pepper spray and tear gas late Thursday to disperse protesters who took to the streets following the announcement by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of the ruling Georgian Dream party. Georgian Dream claimed victory in last month's parliamentary election that the opposition in the South Caucasus nation dismissed as fraudulent and that has been condemned by European officials. The election on Oct. 26 was widely seen as a referendum on the country’s aspirations to join the European Union and the ruling party had indicated to voters that it would continue to seek membership of the bloc. The interior ministry said it detained 43 people during the protests. President Salome Zourabichvili said the government declared 'war' on its own people and confronted riot police at the protest, asking them whether they served Russia or Georgia. The Georgian president, who has a largely ceremonial role, previously said the ruling party rigged the election with the help of Russia, which previously ruled Georgia from Moscow when it was part of the Soviet Union. She said the decision to suspend EU membership marked the 'conclusion of the constitutional coup which has been unfolding for several weeks.' The government's announcement that it was suspending negotiations to join the EU came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution that condemned last month’s vote as neither free nor fair, representing yet another manifestation of the continued democratic backsliding 'for which the ruling Georgian Dream party is fully responsible.' European election observers said October's vote took place in a divisive atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc’s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. EU lawmakers urged a rerun of the parliamentary vote within a year under thorough international supervision and by an independent election administration. They also called on the EU to impose sanctions and limit formal contacts with the Georgian government. The Georgian prime minister fired back, denouncing what he described as a 'cascade of insults' from the EU politicians and declaring that 'the ill-wishers of our country have turned the European Parliament into a blunt weapon of blackmail against Georgia, which is a great disgrace for the European Union.' 'We will continue on our path toward the European Union; however, we will not allow anyone to keep us in a constant state of blackmail and manipulation, which is utterly disrespectful to our country and society,' Kobakhidze said. 'We must clearly show certain European politicians and bureaucrats, who are completely devoid of European values, that they must speak to Georgia with dignity, not through blackmail and insults.' Kobakhidze also said Georgia would reject any budgetary grants from the EU until the end of 2028. Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely in June, after parliament passed a law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-cabinet-election-russia-european-union-kobakhidze-9f6e6f274e61fea2c50bfaba0850f004	2024-11-28T22:50:22-08:00	
Ukrainian energy workers carry out repairs despite Russia's pounding of the country's power grid	On a bright winter day, workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant repair its heavily damaged equipment as drops of water from melted snow leak through gaping holes in its battered roof. Several weeks earlier, the facility was targeted by a Russian air attack that left scorch marks, shrapnel scars on the walls, and missile fragments scattered across the production floor. 'This is our life now. Workers at a thermal power plant that’s supposed to produce electricity are walking on frozen floors and using firewood to keep warm,' Oleksandr, 52, head of the Production Management Department, told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition that only his first name be used citing security concerns. Repeated Russian strikes on infrastructure have seriously impacted Ukraine's energy sector often resulting in rolling blackouts across the country. On Thursday, Moscow launched another large-scale air attack. Ukrainian authorities said nearly 200 drones and missiles targeted infrastructure, d isrupting power supply to more than a million people. The scale of the ongoing work to fix the sector is huge. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, th e G7 and other allied countries have allocated more than $4 billion in energy assistance to Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in September. Oleksandr, who works at the power plant operated by Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, says since the station was first attacked in November 2022, it has been unable to return to full capacity due to continuous strikes that have left critical equipment in ruins. The exact location of the plant visited by the AP, details on the damage and even workers’ last names cannot be disclosed for fear this information could help Russia coordinate future attacks. DTEK operated around 20% of Ukraine’s electricity production before the full-scale invasion, but this figure dropped to 12% since the war broke out. The company says its facilities have been attacked by Russia almost 200 times since 2022. They also say nearly 90% of the company’s infrastructure was destroyed or suffered damage and that was before Russia launched its large-scale attack on Nov 17. Oleksandr says he expects repairs at the station to continue through the winter into next year, and potentially far beyond. Repair efforts at the plant are further complicated by the fact that some critical equipment was manufactured in the Soviet Union and finding parts is now difficult. To mitigate this, some former Soviet countries who are now Ukraine’s allies have helped supply equipment. 'Potentially, Western countries could also help us with equipment, but their power grids have different characteristics,' Oleksandr said. Only half of DTEK’s generating capacities have been restored since the first attacks on its plants in November 2022 until the latest large-scale strike. Earlier this week, the European Commission and the U.S. government a nnounced a donation of $112 million in equipment and construction materials to help DTEK prepare for the winter. With the war in its third year, staff at DTEK’s plant have adapted to the grim reality of their day-to-day existence. They know the protocols by heart. Not everyone can take shelter during an air alert. A minimal crew must remain in the control room to oversee operations, putting themselves at risk of a direct strike. 'You have to sit and wait while monitoring the trajectories of whatever was fired, but the power units keep working so we cannot just leave, we stay in the control room,' said Dmytro, 41, a power unit operator at the plant. Despite the challenges, Dmytro and his colleagues press on, driven by a mission to keep the lights on in their town and region over the winter months. 'Who’ll do it, if not us? I also have family waiting for me at home, but if we all leave and the equipment breaks down, the responsibility will be on our shoulders, the entire city will lose electricity and heating,' he said. 'Some are risking (their lives) at the frontline, while we here have our own energy front.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-energy-power-plant-repairs-3490e01e850bd4d1b07d3ae190b6f91c	2024-11-28T22:09:54-08:00	
Ireland votes in a close-run election where incumbents hope to cling on to power	DUBLIN (AP) — Ireland is voting Friday in a parliamentary election that will decide the next government — and will show whether Ireland bucks the global trend of incumbents being ousted by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and a cost-of-living pressures. Polls opened at 7 a.m.. (0700GMT), and Ireland’s 3.8 million voters are selecting 174 lawmakers to sit in the Dail, the lower house of parliament. Here’s a look at the parties, the issues and the likely outcome. Who’s running? The outgoing government was led by the two parties who have dominated Irish politics for the past century: Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. They have similar center-right policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland’s 1920s civil war. After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat they formed a coalition, agreeing to share Cabinet posts and take turns as taoiseach, or prime minister. Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin served as premier for the first half of the term and was replaced by Fine Gael’s Leo Varadkar in December 2022. Varadkar unexpectedly stepped down in March, passing the job to current Taoiseach Simon Harris. Opposition party Sinn Fein achieved a stunning breakthrough in the 2020 election, topping the popular vote, but was shut out of government because Fianna Fail and Fine Gael refused to work with it, citing its leftist policies and historic ties with militant group the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Under Ireland’s system of proportional representation, each of the 43 constituencies elects multiple lawmakers, with voters ranking their preferences. That makes it relatively easy for smaller parties and independent candidates with a strong local following to gain seats. This election includes a large crop of independent candidates, ranging from local campaigners to far-right activists and reputed crime boss Gerry 'the Monk' Hutch. What are the main issues? As in many other countries, the cost of living — especially housing — has dominated the campaign. Ireland has an acute housing shortage, the legacy of failing to build enough new homes during the country’s 'Celtic Tiger' boom years and the economic slump that followed the 2008 global financial crisis. 'There was not building during the crisis, and when the crisis receded, offices and hotels were built first,' said John-Mark McCafferty, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Threshold. The result is soaring house prices, rising rents and growing homelessness. After a decade of economic growth, McCafferty said 'Ireland has resources' — not least 13 billion euros ($13.6 billion) in back taxes the European Union has ordered Apple to pay it — 'but it is trying to address big historic infrastructural deficits.' Tangled up with the housing issue is immigration, a fairly recent challenge to a country long defined by emigration. Recent arrivals include more than 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by war and thousands of people fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East and Africa. This country of 5.4 million has struggled to house all the asylum-seekers, leading to tent camps and makeshift accommodation centers that have attracted tension and protests. A stabbing attack on children outside a Dublin school a year ago, in which an Algerian man has been charged, sparked the worst rioting Ireland had seen in decades. Unlike many European countries, Ireland does not have a significant far-right party, but far-right voices on social media seek to drum up hostility to migrants, and anti-immigrant independent candidates are hoping for election in several districts. The issue appears to be hitting support for Sinn Fein, as working-class supporters bristled at its pro-immigration policies. What’s the likely outcome? Opinion polls suggest voters’ support is split into five roughly even chunks — for Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Sinn Fein, several smaller parties and an assortment of independents. Fine Gael has run a gaffe-prone campaign, Fianna Fail has remained steady in the polls and Sinn Fein says it has momentum, but is unlikely to win power unless the other parties drop their opposition to working with it. Analysts say the most likely outcome is another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition, possibly with a smaller party or a clutch of independents as kingmakers. 'It’s just a question of which minor group is going to be the group that supports the government this time,' said Eoin O’Malley, a political scientist at Dublin City University. 'Coalition-forming is about putting a hue on what is essentially the same middle-of-the-road government every time.' When will we know the results? Polls close Friday at 10 p.m. (2200GMT), when an exit poll will give the first hints about the result. Counting ballots begins on Saturday morning. Full results could take several days, and forming a government days or weeks after that. Harris, who cast his vote in Delgany, south of Dublin, said Irish voters and politicians have 'got a long few days ahead of us.' 'Isn’t it the beauty and the complexity of our system that when the clock strikes 10 o’clock tonight, there’ll be an exit poll but that won’t even tell us the outcome of the election,' he said. ___ Lawless reported from London	https://apnews.com/article/ireland-election-fianna-fail-fine-gael-sinn-fein-987733afb259859d88c84ebb60203b09	2024-11-28T22:07:24-08:00	
China criticizes Taiwanese president's plan to stop in Hawaii and Guam during trip to South Pacific	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te will stop over in Hawaii and Guam during his trip to the South Pacific, drawing criticism from China. Lai is to leave Taiwan on Saturday on a weeklong trip to visit the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — three diplomatic allies of the self-governed island. Asked by the AP, Lai's office on Friday confirmed reports that he would make stopovers in the U.S. state of Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam. Under pressure from China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, the island has just 12 formal diplomatic allies. However, it retains strong contacts with dozens of other nations, including the U.S., its main source of diplomatic and military support. Lai's planned stopovers drew criticism from Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said if the U.S. wants to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it is important for it to handle the Taiwan issue 'with utmost caution, clearly opposing Taiwan independence and supporting China’s peaceful reunification.' Mao said China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, and visits by Taiwan's leaders to the U.S. for any reason. When his predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, began a stopover in the U.S. on her way to Central America last year, China said it was closely watching and would 'resolutely safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.' The Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as a 'stern warning' over what it called collusion between 'separatists and foreign forces' days after Lai, then Taiwan's vice president, stopped over in the U.S. China objects strongly to such U.S. stopovers by Taiwan’s leaders, as well as visits to the island by leading American politicians, terming them violations of the U.S. commitment not to afford diplomatic status to Taiwan after Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. With the number of its diplomatic partners declining under Chinese pressure, Taiwan has redoubled efforts to participate in international forums, even from the sidelines.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-president-lai-hawaii-guam-c4f9f004912656fe2e7b823cd155eaa3	2024-11-28T21:32:08-08:00	
3 dead, over 80,000 displaced as Malaysia prepares for worst floods in a decade	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia prepared on Friday for its worst floods in a decade after heavier-than-expected monsoon rains caused severe flooding that killed three people and displaced more than 80,000. The National Disaster Command Center online portal said Friday that 84,597 people, from more than 25,000 families, across seven states were evacuated to 488 temporary shelters. The northeastern state of Kelantan, bordering Thailand, was the worst affected with 56,029 people evacuated from their homes followed by neighboring Terengganu with 21,264. Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Thursday that floods this year were expected to the worse than 2014, when more than 250,000 people were displaced and 21 killed. He was quoted by local media as saying that weather forecast indicated that heavy rainfall next month would likely affect more states. He was quoted by New Straits Times as saying that government agencies were prepared to tackle the disaster. Nearly 83,000 personnel and thousands of rescue boats, four-wheel vehicles and life jackets as well as 31 helicopters are ready, he said. The government has also identified 8,481 temporary evacuation centers nationwide that can accommodate over two million people, he said. 'Given the severity of the situation, all parties have been mobilized to ensure the safety and welfare of flood victims,' he was quoted as saying by national Bernama news agency. Floods are common in parts of Malaysia during the annual monsoon season, that starts in November and could last until March. The Meteorological Department has said the country can expect between five and seven episodes of heavy rainfall during this period.	https://apnews.com/article/malaysia-floods-monsoon-rains-08532d729eb70026e968b1ee34b029c6	2024-11-28T21:28:27-08:00	
Russian defense minister visits North Korea for talks with military and political leaders	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in North Korea on Friday for talks with North Korean military and political leaders as the countries deepen their cooperation over Russia’s war in Ukraine. In announcing the visit, Russia’s Defense Ministry didn’t say whom Belousov would meet or the purpose of the talks. North Korean state media didn’t immediately confirm the visit. Belousov, a former economist, replaced Sergei Shoigu as defense minister in May after Russian President Vladimir Putin started a fifth term in power. Photos released by the Defense Ministry showed Belousov walking alongside North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol on a red carpet at a Pyongyang airport. North Korean military officials were seen clapping under a banner that read, 'Complete support and solidarity with the fighting Russian army and people.' Belousov noted after his arrival that military cooperation between the countries is expanding. He applauded a strategic partnership agreement signed by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un following their June meeting in Pyongyang, which he said is aimed at reducing tensions by maintaining a 'balance of power' in the region and lowering the risk of war, including with nuclear weapons. The June meeting demonstrated the 'highest level of mutual trust' between the leaders, Belousov said, and 'also the mutual desire of our countries to further expand mutually beneficial cooperation in a complex international environment.' North Korean Defense Minister No also praised the expanding cooperation between the countries’ militaries and reiterated North Korea’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, describing it as a 'just struggle to protect the country’s sovereign rights and security interests.' The visit comes days after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol met with a Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in the South Korean capital, Seoul, and called for the two countries to formulate countermeasures in response to North Korea’s dispatch of thousands of troops to Russia to help its fight against Ukraine. Kim in recent months has prioritized relations with Russia as he tries to break out of isolation and strengthen his international footing, embracing the idea of a 'new Cold War.' The United States and its allies have said North Korea has sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia in recent weeks and that some of those troops were engaging in combat. North Korea has also been accused of supplying artillery systems, missiles and other military equipment to Russia that may help Putin further extend an almost three-year war. There are also concerns in Seoul that North Korea, in exchange for its troops and arms supplies, could receive Russian technology transfers that could improve its nuclear weapons and missile programs. 'The Russian defense minister doesn’t visit North Korea just to celebrate bilateral ties,' said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. 'This visit indicates Putin and Kim’s military cooperation in violation of international law is about to increase further.' Yoon’s national security adviser, Shin Wonsik, said in a TV interview last week that Seoul believes that Russia has provided air defense missile systems to North Korea in exchange for sending its troops. Shin said Russia also appears to have given economic assistance to North Korea and various military technologies, including those needed for the North’s efforts to build a reliable space-based surveillance system, which Kim has stressed is crucial for enhancing the threat of nuclear-capable missiles targeting South Korea. Shin didn’t say whether Russia has already transferred sensitive nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technologies to North Korea. Yoon’s office hasn’t said whether the two governments discussed the possibility of South Korea supplying weapons to Ukraine in his talks with Umerov. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and provided humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv. But it has avoided directly supplying arms, citing a longstanding policy of not giving lethal weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. Yoon has said his government will take phased countermeasures, linking the level of its response to the degree of Russian-North Korean cooperation. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Belousov will meet with Kim, the North Korean leader. Last year, Kim hosted a Russian delegation led by then-Defense Minister Shoigu and gave him a personal tour of a North Korean arms exhibition, in what outside critics likened to a sales pitch. That event came weeks before Kim traveled to Russia for talks with Putin which sped up military cooperation between the countries. During another meeting in Pyongyang in June this year, Kim and Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked, in what was considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. The Russian report about Belousov’s visit came as South Korea scrambled fighter jets to repel six Russian and five Chinese warplanes that temporarily entered the country’s air defense identification zone around its eastern and southern seas, according to the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. It said the Russian and Chinese planes did not breach South Korea’s territorial airspace. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it held telephone calls with Chinese and Russian defense attaches based in Seoul to protest the flights and urge the countries to prevent recurrences. ___ Associated Press writer Emma Burrows in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-defense-minister-andrei-belousov-ukraine-5c0f784ef56ab68482113dfe5419b962	2024-11-28T21:24:40-08:00	
Stripped of citizenship, these Nicaraguans live in limbo scattered across the world	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Sergio Mena's life dissolved in hours. After years resisting President Daniel Ortega, the rural activist fled Nicaragua in 2018, joining thousands of protesters fleeing a yearslong crackdown on dissent. Mena returned from exile in neighboring Costa Rica in 2021 to continue protesting, only to be thrown in a prison where he said jailers hung prisoners by their feet and shocked them with electricity. 'We were tortured all the time, physically and psychologically, from the moment we arrived until the very last day,' said Mena, 40. Now in exile in Guatemala, Mena may be out of prison but he's far from free. Upon their release, he and hundreds of religious leaders, students, activists, dissidents and journalists were rendered 'stateless' – stripped of their citizenship, homes and government pensions. The United Nations says that they’re among 4.4 million stateless people worldwide who struggle to find jobs, education and healthcare or even open bank accounts or marry without valid ID documents. 'Statelessness is torture,' said Karina Ambartsoumian-Clough executive director of United Stateless, a U.S.-based organization advocating for the stateless. 'You just legally cease to exist, even if you’re here physically as a human.' Free but unfree In September, Ortega’s government loaded Mena and 134 other prisoners onto the flight that took them to Guatemala. They joined 317 others whom the government has deemed adversaries who no longer deserve legal Nicaraguan identities. The Associated Press spoke to more than 24 Nicaraguan exiles who have been stripped of their citizenship and are trying to chart paths forward. They're scattered across the United States, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Mexico and Spain in limbo as they struggle to recover from physical and psychological trauma, extending the torture many suffered in Nicaragua. The Ortega government did not respond to a request for comment by the AP. The agony of statelessness The majority of stateless people worldwide are born to refugees and migrants in countries that don't offer birthright citizenship, the right to become a citizen if you're born within a country's territory. Many Nicaraguans struggle to scrape together enough money to feed themselves. Others hide away in fear that the Nicaraguan government will someday come for them. Many more reel from watching their lives go up in smoke. For those stranded in the U.S. or seeking respite there, President-elect Donald Trump’s promises to crack down on immigration and asylum have added more uncertainty. Intensifying repression Ortega's government began stripping people of their citizenship early last year. It was in that crackdown that Mena, the member of a rural activist movement, said he was imprisoned. The government claimed that he had participated in drug trafficking and organized crime, which he denies. In February 2023, the government broke international law when it began sending prisoners to the U.S and most recently to Guatemala. Others in exile were stripped of their citizenship without ever having been jailed. Torment beyond borders The Nicaraguan government has not explained why it released Mena and other people from prison, although experts have speculated about the desire to duck international criticism and the costs involved while continuing to maintain a grip on enemies. Mena lives in a hotel in Guatemala City, where he flips through photos of a crumbling jail, scraps of food and his bruised, beaten body – indelible memories of more than two years in prison. His life is painted by constant fear. 'The tentacles of (the Nicaraguan government) still reach here,' he said with tears in his eyes. The Biden administration has offered the Nicaraguans temporary protections and Mena hopes the U.S. government will grant him asylum, but such protections are likely to vanish or be severely restricted under Trump. The Spanish government has offered to provide nationality to some of the stateless exiles, but few have the resources needed to build a new life in Spain, or are confused about the process. Stateless struggle Allan Bermudez, 54, was a university professor in Nicaragua. He was imprisoned after accusations that he was conspiring against the government as Ortega identified universities as hotbeds for antigovernment protests. In February 2023, he was among 222 prisoners loaded onto a flight to the United States with no idea where they were going. While the U.S. government provided Bermudez and others with temporary support, a few days at a hotel, a new phone, $400 and limited access to aid from a group of NGOs, help has since dried up. Today, Bermudez, who has multiple advanced degrees, works at a Dunkin’ Donuts on the fringes of Salisbury, Maryland, struggling to pick up hours. He rents a small room, suffers from chronic heart problems and post-traumatic stress disorder, and has no medical care. 'I haven’t bought my medicine, because if I do, I’ll have nothing to eat,' he said. Back in Nicaragua, his mother had stroke this year. He's struggled to send money home. With his daughter and wife also back home, he’s plagued with anxiety and depression. He applied for asylum in February after living in the U.S. under humanitarian parole offered by the Biden administration, but said he hasn’t heard back. He's put all his hopes into building a life in the U.S. and doesn’t know what he’ll do if asylum doesn't come through. 'I can’t leave, I have my hands tied,' he said. 'All I can do is pray that God helps me.' Lives upended Like Bermudez, hundreds of thousands have fled Nicaragua. Thousands of civil society organizations have been shuttered, their assets seized as the government seeks to silence any dissent. While many of the Nicaraguan exiles hope to one day return to their country, 82-year-old Moises Hassan has given up hope as he hides away in a town in the mountains of Costa Rica. Hassan was once a guerrilla fighter against the Anastasio Somoza dictatorship and then, alongside Ortega, a member of the junta that succeeded it. He built a family and a home with thousands of books, and planned to live out the rest of his days there. He was elected mayor of the capital, Managua, but saw his life and hopes sour when he began to criticize Ortega's anti-democratic moves. He fled the country in 2021. While on a trip to visit his daughter he heard the government was detaining critics, and knew they would come for him. It was no surprise when his name appeared on a list of people who were stripped of their citizenship and home and called traitors. 'The message is ... 'Don't think that just because you're out of the country that you're out of our reach,'' he said. But he said that with his pension seized along with his belongings, it has been a shock to depend on money from his children. He and his wife remain in their corner of Costa Rica, too scared to even go to the capital, where they worry Ortega's agents could track them down. 'I feel like I'm under house arrest,' he said, cradling his worn, now useless Nicaraguan passport. 'I'm a prisoner in my own home.' —— Janetsky reported from Costa Rica and Mexico City.

Desertion threatens to starve Ukraine's forces at a crucial time in its war with Russia	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Desertion is starving the Ukrainian army of desperately needed manpower and crippling its battle plans at a crucial time in its war with Russia, which could put Kyiv at a clear disadvantage in future ceasefire talks. Facing every imaginable shortage, tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops, tired and bereft, have walked away from combat and front-line positions to slide into anonymity, according to soldiers, lawyers and Ukrainian officials. Entire units have abandoned their posts, leaving defensive lines vulnerable and accelerating territorial losses, according to military commanders and soldiers. Some take medical leave and never return, haunted by the traumas of war and demoralized by bleak prospects for victory. Others clash with commanders and refuse to carry out orders, sometimes in the middle of firefights. 'This problem is critical,' said Oleksandr Kovalenko, a Kyiv-based military analyst. 'This is the third year of war, and this problem will only grow.' Although Moscow has also been dealing with desertions, Ukrainians going AWOL have laid bare deeply rooted problems bedeviling their military and how Kyiv is managing the war, from the flawed mobilization drive to the overstretching and hollowing out of front-line units. It comes as the U.S. urges Ukraine to draft more troops, and allow for the conscription of those as young as 18. The Associated Press spoke to two deserters, three lawyers, and a dozen Ukrainian officials and military commanders. Officials and commanders spoke on condition of anonymity to divulge classified information, while one deserter did so because he feared prosecution. 'It is clear that now, frankly speaking, we have already squeezed the maximum out of our people,' said an officer with the 72nd Brigade, who noted that desertion was one of the main reasons Ukraine lost the town of Vuhledar in October. The troops who walk away More than 100,000 soldiers have been charged under Ukraine’s desertion laws since Russia invaded in February 2022, according to the country’s General Prosecutor’s Office. Nearly half have gone AWOL in the last year alone, after Kyiv launched an aggressive and controversial mobilization drive that government officials and military commanders concede has largely failed. It's a staggeringly high number by any measure, as there were an estimated 300,000 Ukrainian soldiers engaged in combat before the mobilization drive began. And the actual number of deserters may be much higher. One lawmaker with knowledge of military matters estimated it could be as high as 200,000. Many deserters don't return after being granted medical leave. Bone-tired by the constancy of war, they are psychologically and emotionally scarred. They feel guilt about being unable to summon the will to fight, anger over how the war effort is being led, and frustration that it seems unwinnable. 'Being quiet about a huge problem only harms our country,' said Serhii Hnezdilov, one of few soldiers to speak publicly about his choice to desert. He was charged shortly after the AP interviewed him in September. Another deserter said he initially left his infantry unit with permission because he needed surgery. By the time his leave was up, he couldn’t bring himself to return. He still has nightmares about the comrades he saw get killed. 'The best way to explain it is imagining you are sitting under incoming fire and from their (Russian) side, it’s 50 shells coming toward you, while from our side, it’s just one. Then you see how your friends are getting torn to pieces, and you realize that any second, it can happen to you,' he said. 'Meanwhile guys (Ukrainian soldiers) 10 kilometers (6 miles) away order you on the radio: ‘Go on, brace yourselves. Everything will be fine,’' he said. Hnezdilov also left to seek medical help. Before undergoing surgery, he announced he was deserting. He said after five years of military service, he saw no hope of ever being demobilized, despite earlier promises by the country’s leadership. 'If there’s no end term (to military service), it turns into a prison – it becomes psychologically hard to find reasons to defend this country,' Hnezdilov said. A growing problem for Kyiv Desertion has turned battle plans into sand that slips through military commanders' fingertips. The AP learned of cases in which defensive lines were severely compromised because entire units defied orders and abandoned their positions. 'Because of a lack of political will and poor management of troops, especially in the infantry, we certainly are not moving in a direction to properly defend the territories that we control now,' Hnezdilov said. Ukraine’s military recorded a deficit of 4,000 troops on the front in September owing largely to deaths, injuries and desertions, according to a lawmaker. Most deserters were among recent recruits. The head of one brigade’s legal service who is in charge of processing desertion cases and forwarding them to law enforcement said he's had many of them. 'The main thing is that they leave combat positions during hostilities and their comrades die because of it. We had several situations when units fled, small or large. They exposed their flanks, and the enemy came to these flanks and killed their brothers in arms, because those who stood on the positions did not know that there was no one else around,' the official said. That is how Vuhledar, a hilltop town that Ukraine defended for two years, was lost in a matter of weeks in October, said the 72nd Brigade officer, who was among the very last to withdraw. The 72nd was already stretched thin in the weeks before Vuhledar fell. Only one line battalion and two rifle battalions held the town near the end, and military leaders even began pulling units from them to support the flanks, the officer said. There should have been 120 men in each of the battalion’s companies, but some companies' ranks dropped to only 10 due to deaths, injuries and desertions, he said. About 20% of the soldiers missing from those companies had gone AWOL. 'The percentage has grown exponentially every month,' he added. Reinforcements were sent once Russia wised up to Ukraine's weakened position and attacked. But then the reinforcements also left, the officer said. Because of this, when one of the 72nd Brigade battalions withdrew, its members were gunned down because they didn't know no one was covering them, he said. Still, the officer harbors no ill will toward deserters. 'At this stage, I do not condemn any of the soldiers from my battalion and others. … Because everyone is just really tired,' he said. Charging deserters Prosecutors and the military would rather not press charges against AWOL soldiers and do so only if they fail to persuade them to return, according to three military officers and a spokesperson for Ukraine’s State Investigative Bureau. Some deserters return, only to leave again. Ukraine's General Staff said soldiers are given psychological support, but it didn't respond to emailed questions about the toll desertions are having on the battlefield. Once soldiers are charged, defending them is tricky, said two lawyers who take such cases. They focus on their clients' psychological state when they left. 'People cannot psychologically cope with the situation they are in, and they are not provided with psychological help,' said attorney Tetyana Ivanova. Soldiers acquitted of desertion due to psychological reasons set a dangerous precedent because 'then almost everyone is justified (to leave), because there are almost no healthy people left (in the infantry),' she said. Soldiers considering deserting have sought her advice. Several were being sent to fight near Vuhledar. 'They would not have taken the territory, they would not have conquered anything, but no one would have returned,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/deserters-awol-ukraine-russia-war-def676562552d42bc5d593363c9e5ea0	2024-11-28T20:26:47-08:00	
Battered by war and divisions, Lebanon faces a long list of challenges after ceasefire deal	BEIRUT (AP) — Hours after a U.S.-brokered ceasefire to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect, Lebanon woke up to the sound of celebratory gunfire instead of Israeli airstrikes and drones buzzing overhead. It was a rare moment of respite for Lebanon, as bombs stopped falling after a year of war. Thousands of displaced people joyfully drove back to their towns and villages in southern and eastern Lebanon. But the realization of what lies ahead quickly sank in. Town after town in the south and east as well as parts of Beirut have been destroyed, entire border villages leveled to the ground, and thousands of buildings damaged. The World Bank estimates losses amounting to some $8.5 billion. For the tiny and broken Mediterranean country, which has dealt with compounded calamities for over half a decade, the ceasefire deal has brought more questions than answers. Among them, who will foot the bill for rebuilding? Will Hezbollah fully remove its fighters and arsenals from the south, relocating north of the Litani River — and how will the Lebanese army ensure that it does so? And will Israel ultimately accept the militants being pushed back, battered but not destroyed? Meanwhile, Lebanon’s political paralysis between groups allied and opposed to Hezbollah has only worsened during the war — raising the possibility of instability that could rattle the ceasefire. Anger has grown among some over that they see as the Iran-backed group’s decision to provoke another disastrous war with Israel. Temporary calm or a step toward long-term security? During the 60-day first phase of the ceasefire deal, based on Security Council Resolution 1701, Hezbollah and Israeli forces are to withdraw from south Lebanon, and the Lebanese military is to step in. The Lebanese troops are to ensure that Hezbollah dismantles its facilities and military positions and that it doesn’t try to rebuild. That’s a major point of tension, potentially putting the army in a dangerous confrontation with the more powerful militant group. The army, largely funded by the United States and other Western governments, is a rare point of unity in Lebanon’s tense sectarian power-balancing political system. But it's always tried to avoid friction with Hezbollah, which is backed by a large constituency among Lebanon's Shiite Muslims. Hassan Fadlallah, a Hezbollah lawmaker, told reporters Thursday that the group will cooperate with the army to implement the ceasefire. But he also said the military doesn’t have the capability to defend Lebanon against Israel — a role Hezbollah has long claimed. He said the group would continue in that role. 'Can anyone say if Israel attacks, we watch?' Fadlallah said. 'When Israel attacks our country, we will fight and resist. This is our right.' Mike Azar, a Lebanese commentator, said the army is 'in an impossible position.' 'To suggest that it can disarm or dismantle Hezbollah’s infrastructure is, frankly, absurd,' he said in an online post. A Lebanese military official told The Associated Press that troops’ deployment will be gradual into areas of the south, including those from which Israeli troops withdraw. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of not being cleared to speak to the media. The U.S. and France will also be involved in a monitoring mechanism to make sure Resolution 1701 is implemented. Its viability is really being put to the test — 'if there really is going to be that commitment' by all sides, said Salman Shaikh, who served as political adviser to the U.N. special envoy for Lebanon during the 2006 war, when the resolution was passed. He now runs The Shaikh Group, a mediation and conflict resolution organization. Critics of the deal fear the pressure is far greater on Lebanon, and Israel has more space to attack Hezbollah — which it has vowed to do if it believes Hezbollah isn't abiding by its terms. With U.S. support, Israel has given itself 'almost total freedom to determine when it needs or wants to attack Lebanon again for whatever reason,' said Matt Duss, executive vice president of The Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank. Cash-strapped Lebanon needs support for its military and battered country Lebanon since late 2019 has been mired in a crippling financial crisis that pushed millions into poverty, destroyed its banking system, and limited the country to just a few hours of state electricity daily. The Lebanese military has suffered as well, with troops quitting or working second jobs to pay the bills. Yet, the aim of the agreement is for Lebanon to recruit more and deploy an additional 10,000 troops south of the Litani River. Without significant funding, this would be impossible — especially with the huge rebuilding costs Lebanon now faces. The international community in a donor conference in Paris last month pledged $1 billion dollars for Lebanon, including $800 million for humanitarian assistance and $200 million to support the army. But aid groups say none of that funding has materialized yet. Mercy Corps says Lebanon’s gross domestic product shrunk by 6.4% — some $1.15 billion — just in the last two months of the war. The organization is scrambling to secure housing and services for displaced people ahead of the winter. 'The worst civilian impacts could still be ahead,' Laila Al Amine, Mercy Corps' Lebanon country director, said in a statement. A looming question is who will foot the bill. Iran has offered to help, but it's cash-strapped and under Western sanctions. Oil-rich Gulf Arab states, who helped rebuild after the 2006 war, are weary of Lebanon’s political class and not inclined to step in. Growing tensions over Hezbollah at home Even before the war, Hezbollah and its arsenal were a point of contention in Lebanon. Its allies say Hezbollah’s militants are crucial in protecting Lebanon, while critics say its weaponry violates state sovereignty and is used to pressure political opponents. They have long demanded Hezbollah be disarmed. Senior parliamentarian Alain Aoun said Lebanon has a long list of urgent matters to address, including electing a president after over two years of vacuum, securing reconstruction funding and resolving a host of neglected economic issues. 'There are a number of challenges awaiting us,' Aoun told the AP. Hezbollah's opponents were also angered over its decision to unilaterally start firing rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023. The group said it was acting in solidarity with its ally Hamas in the Gaza Strip and vowed not to stop until a ceasefire there was reached. Critics say it dragged Lebanon into war and brought Israel’s destructive bombardment. Even some of its allies expressed frustration. Lawmaker Gebran Bassil, who heads a party that for years was Hezbollah’s main Christian ally in government, said in a video posted on X that Hezbollah 'should be at the service of the state,' not the other way around. Hezbollah's top ally Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who spearheaded negotiation efforts, has long pushed for Hezbollah to decouple its campaign against Israel from the war in Gaza. Now he is calling for parliament to vote for a president in January in order to ease Lebanon’s political gridlock — a move that could put Hezbollah's political power to the test. This is where international funding and political support would also be crucial, says Shaikh. The international community, he said, needs 'to help the Lebanese sort out their issues, which still persist and which are not exclusively just to do with the Israeli actions against them.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-ceasefire-crisis-be0df65fa96162ca5ca02da73f172614	2024-11-28T20:04:33-08:00	
Stock market today: Global shares mostly lower, with US markets closed for Thanksgiving	HONG KONG (AP) — Global shares mostly fell on Friday after U.S. markets were closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. France’s CAC 40 was nearly unchanged at 7,178.37 in early trading, while Germany’s DAX edged down 0.1% to 19,407.50. Britain’s FTSE 100 declined less than 0.1% to 8,279.02. Investors were awaiting preliminary inflation data for November for the region using the euro, which may influence the European Central Bank’s future interest rate decisions. The futures for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were both 0.3% higher. U.S. markets will reopen for a half day on Friday. In Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.4% to 38,208.03 after the government reported that inflation in Tokyo, considered an indicator for national trends, was 2.6% in November, up from 1.8% last month mainly due to a surge in fresh food prices. Core inflation, which excludes fresh food prices, rose modestly to 2.2% year-on-year from 1.8% in October. Higher inflation tends to reinforce expectations that the Bank of Japan will push ahead with more increases in its benchmark lending rate. That, in turn, pushes up the value of the Japanese yen, which was trading at 150.02 to the U.S. dollar early Friday. A week earlier it was trading above 155 yen per dollar. The central bank's current policy rate is 0.25%. It only ended a long spell of negative rates in March on the presumption that Japan had largely achieved its 2% inflation target. South Korea’s Kospi lost 2% to 2,455.91 after the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate on Thursday to relieve pressure on its slowing economy. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% lower to 8,436.20. Chinese markets advanced. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.3% to 19,423.61. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite index surged 0.9% to 3,326.46. Gains in retailers' stocks drove market gains after a two-day meeting in Beijing focused on promoting consumption ended on Thursday. Shares of Yonghui Superstore, China’s fifth-largest hypermarket chain operator, surged by over 10%. Investors also are looking ahead to a major economic planning meeting that is usually held in December. The holiday Thursday brought a respite in news on President-elect Donald Trump's plans for after he takes office, after markets were rocked earlier in the week by his announcement that he plans to order immediate sharp tariff hikes on imports from Canada, Mexico and China. On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow fell 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, fell 0.6%. In other dealings Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 16 cents to $68.56 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, fell 37 cents to $72.41 per barrel. The euro rose to $1.0580 from $1.0554.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-tariffs-8575d0c7231225fc8c1fa89285de9a13	2024-11-28T19:39:43-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Jakarta TNR effort aims to help stray cats like lively Hitam and feisty Aing Maung	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Hitam, a lively black-and-white stray cat has been spayed and returned to the loving arms of Alvin, a parking attendant in a bustling street in Indonesia's capital. 'I feed her rice and fish every day,' Alvin said. The nimble feline is part of an estimated whopping 700,000 stray cats that roam Jakarta. Trap-neuter-return programs, or TNR, have been spearheaded by community-based groups including Let’s Adopt Indonesia that advocate humane methods to control the cat population. Every weekend, volunteers like 28-year-old Vanya Afreenzha work tirelessly to trap as many stray cats as possible. Armed with cat food, long pole nets and plastic carriers, they roam parks, train stations and public areas where cats can be easily spotted. They then drop them off at a clinic in southern Jakarta to be neutered by qualified veterinarians. During a recent excursion, volunteers trapped 80 cats, including Hitam, and got them spayed or neutered. Among them was a notoriously aggressive female cat that Afreenzha nicknamed Aing Maung, which means 'I am a tiger' in Sundanese. Carolina Fajar, the head of operations at Let’s Adopt Indonesia, says neutering and spaying cats reduces aggression and disruptive behavior and even prevents property damage as the felines scavenge for food and look to mate. 'So how can we handle this without having to get rid of them? Through neutering which lowers their hormonal levels, allowing them to coexist peacefully,' she said. Despite the occasional scratch and resistance from some locals who doubt the effectiveness of TNR, volunteers like Afreenzha remain committed to the cause. She finds solace in helping cats live healthier lives and aiding those abandoned by their owners. She says spaying and neutering helps the cats live better so 'they don’t have to keep giving birth on the streets.' Afreenza believes that harmony between humans and animals is possible, allowing them to coexist peacefully.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-jakarta-stray-cats-tnr-3fb46b3c8b6bf6ef40d815ba9501b851	2024-11-28T18:57:02-08:00

Crew mistakes caused the sinking of a New Zealand navy ship off Samoan coast, inquiry finds	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Mistakes by members of the crew caused a New Zealand navy ship to plow into a reef off the coast of Samoa, where it caught fire and sank, according to the preliminary findings of a military Court of Inquiry released Friday. The ship’s crew did not realize autopilot was engaged, believed something else had gone wrong with the ship, and did not check the HMNZS Manawanui was under manual control as it maintained course toward land, a summary of the inquiry’s first report said. The full report has not been made public. All 75 people on board the vessel evacuated safely as the boat foundered about 1.6 kilometers (a mile) off the coast of Upolu, Samoa, in October. The ship was one of only nine in New Zealand’s navy and was the first the country lost at sea since World War II. Officials did not know the cause of the sinking at the time, and Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding ordered a Court of Inquiry to investigate. 'The direct cause of the grounding has been determined as a series of human errors which meant the ship’s autopilot was not disengaged when it should have been,' Golding told reporters in Auckland on Friday. 'Muscle memory from the person in control should have leaned over to that panel and checked whether the screen said autopilot or not.' The crew 'mistakenly believed its failure to respond to direction changes was the result of a thruster control failure,' he said. A number of contributing factors were identified, Golding said, including training, planning, supervision, readiness and risk assessment. The Court of Inquiry is expected to continue until the first quarter of next year. Golding said given human error was identified as the cause, a separate disciplinary process will begin after the inquiry. Three crew members who were on the bridge as the disaster unfolded are likely to face such a process, Golding added. They were the officer in control of the ship, an officer supervising that person, and the ship's commanding officer. The navy chief would not name them. 'I want to reassure the public of New Zealand that we will learn from this situation and that it is on me, as the Chief of Navy, to earn back your trust,' Golding said. In the days after the sinking, New Zealand's Defense Minister gave stinging rebukes of 'misogynistic' online commenters who directed abusive comments at the ship's captain because she was a woman. The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service for New Zealand since 2019 and was surveying the reef that it ran aground on. The sinking prompted fears in villages along the Samoan coastline near the wreck about damage caused by the ship's diesel spilling into the ocean. New Zealand officials have said since the sinking that most of the fuel burned off in the fire and that no environmental damage has been recorded. The current flow of fuel into the sea was a 'persistent slow leak' which divers are monitoring, Golding said Friday. Specialist equipment is due to be transported from New Zealand to Samoa by sea, departing this week, to remove fuel and other potential pollutants from the ship. New Zealand officials have not made public plans to remove the ship from the reef. 'This has had an impact to our reputation,' Golding said. 'We will own it, fix it and learn from it.'	https://apnews.com/article/zealand-navy-ship-samoa-manawanui-sinking-military-dd9cccaa0739ef98f615cc4969a117b0	2024-11-28T17:06:02-08:00	
South Korean politician calls for investigation of biomass energy material imported from Indonesia	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A South Korean National Assembly member has called for a moratorium on wood pellet imports from Indonesia and an investigation into their environmental impacts after government data and satellite analysis linked the country's biomass imports to deforestation in Indonesia. 'We should stop imports of wood pellets … and it’s important for our government to investigate exactly what kinds of environmental destruction is occurring on the spot,' Moon Dae-Lim, a lawmaker with South Korea's main liberal opposition Democratic Party, said in recent written responses to questions from The Associated Press. 'Identifying and correcting potential risks in supply chains and value chains is key to a sustainable project.' Biomass can come from organic material like plants, wood and waste, and many coal-fired power plants can be easily modified to burn it alongside coal to make energy. As countries accelerate their energy transitions, demand for biomass is growing: The use of bioenergy has increased an average of about 3% per year between 2010 and 2022, the International Energy Agency said. Experts including the IEA say it’s important for that demand to happen in a sustainable way, such as using waste and crop residue rather than converting forest land to grow bioenergy crops. In South Korea, bioenergy has grown to become the second-largest source of renewable energy and over 80% of its main raw material — energy-dense wood pellets — is dependent on imports, according to a policy report on the state audit authored by Moon and published in October. Data shows that a growing number of those wood pellets come from the vast tropical archipelago nation of Indonesia. In 2023 the country was the third-largest source of wood pellet imports for South Korea behind Vietnam and Russia. Over 60% of biomass made from pristine natural forests destroyed for wood pellet production since 2021 were shipped to South Korea, AP found in an examination of satellite images, company records and Indonesian export data. In the same time frame, Indonesia's wood pellet exports to South Korea jumped from 50 tons to over 68,000 tons. The largest exporter of wood pellets from Indonesia from 2021-2023, according to data Indonesian nongovernmental conservation organization Auriga Nusantara compiled from the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry database, was Biomasa Jaya Abadi. The wood pellet processing company is located in Gorontalo, near a concession owned by Banyan Tumbuh Lestari. Over 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) of forest have been razed in a concession owned by Banyan Tumbuh Lestari, from 2021 to 2024, according to satellite analysis shared with AP by international environmental organization Mighty Earth. An additional 2,850 hectares (7,040 acres) were cleared for logging roads. 'If we block the imports of (Biomasa Jaya Abadi's) wood pellets, we can prevent a great deal of forest destructions that happen in Indonesia for the purpose of exporting to South Korea,' Moon said. 'The Korean government’s active responses to forest destructions can also send a message on the importance of sustainability to not only the Indonesian government but also related industries across Asia.' In an email, a spokesperson from Biomasa Jaya Abadi said that it harvested its forest products strictly from within government-designated areas and that it replants trees. 'The company’s wood pellet ecosystem has a very rigorous legality, traceability and compliance procedures put in place to ensure that the company adheres fully to all applicable regulations in Indonesia,' the spokesperson wrote. Environmental activist groups lauded Moon's report and questioning as a step in the right direction for demanding accountability for South Korea's biomass use. 'Moon’s questioning represents a pivotal moment. By highlighting the climate injustice tied to South Korea’s energy policies, these inquiries put pressure on the Korea Forest Service to confront its role in failing to regulate high-risk imports,' said Hansae Song, program lead at South Korea-based nongovernmental organization Solutions for our Climate. 'We hope to see this scrutiny lead to a reevaluation of import standards and compel the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy to rethink its subsidy policies, which currently benefit a narrow group of corporate interests at the expense of global forests.' In responses to question posed by AP, the Korea Forest Service said it had asked the Indonesian government to provide biomass-related data via a South Korean-Indonesia forestry cooperation center in Indonesia. But it hasn’t received an official response as Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry was split into the environment ministry and the forest ministry in October. The Korea Forest Service also told AP it had confirmed that Indonesia wood pellets were produced via legal tree-cut procedures in the country. It said it respects other countries’ related domestic policies on tree cuts. 'Each country has rights to govern itself in line with its own economic and environmental policies, and that must be respected,' the Korea Forest Service said. 'If we take unilateral actions on the wood products endorsed by the Indonesian government, there are concerns about possible diplomatic and trade disputes erupting. Thus, we ask for the Indonesian government to confirm relevant data and validity of certifications of legality.' Indonesia's Ministry of Forestry did not respond to requests for interview or comment from AP. Banyan Tumbuh Lestari do not have contact information publicly available; AP contacted their main shareholders seeking comment but got no response. ___ Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.
