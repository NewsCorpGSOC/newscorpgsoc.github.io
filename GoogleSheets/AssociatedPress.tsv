Ukrainian drones hit a Russian fuel depot for the second time this month	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drones struck a major Russian fuel depot for the second time in just over a week on Sunday, according to a senior Russian regional official, as part of a 'massive' cross-border attack on fuel and energy facilities that Kyiv says supply Moscow's military. The strikes came days after Russia launched sweeping attacks on Ukraine’s already battered energy grid, threatening to plunge thousands of homes into darkness as winter tightens its grip over the region, and as Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor nears the three-year mark. A fire broke out at the Stalnoy Kon oil terminal in Russia’s southern Oryol region, local Gov. Andrey Klychkov said in a post on the Telegram messaging app, adding Russian forces downed 20 drones targeting 'fuel and energy infrastructure' in the province. Russian independent news outlet Astra shared video of what it said was an explosion at the site, showing a massive orange blaze lighting up the night sky. While the clip could not be independently verified, it was later shared by a Ukrainian security official who described it as footage from Oryol. The official, Andriy Kovalenko of the Council of National Security and Defense, claimed the Oryol fuel depot supplies Russian forces fighting in Ukraine and southern Russia, including the Kursk province where Ukrainian troops have dug in following a lightning incursion in August. According to Klychkov, the Russian local governor, the fire was extinguished hours later and did not cause casualties or 'significant' damage. Ukraine's military previously claimed to have struck the Stalnoy Kon terminal with drones on Dec. 14, causing a 'powerful' blaze. Other key war-related developments from Ukraine and Russia: — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday vowed retaliation after Ukrainian drones the day before struck residential buildings in the city of Kazan, in the Tatarstan region over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the front line. Speaking to Tatarstan's regional governor, Rustam Minnikhanov, Putin asserted that anyone attacking Russia has to reckon with Moscow inflicting 'many times greater damage' in return, but did not elaborate. His remarks were carried by Russian state news agencies. Minnikhanov's press service on Saturday said that eight drones attacked Kazan. Local authorities said there were no casualties. — A 30-year-old man died on the spot Sunday in Ukraine's southern Kherson region after a Russian drone dropped explosives nearby, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Hours earlier, Prokudin said that two other civilians died as a result of Russian drone strikes on the province late on Saturday. A man in his late 40s suffered fatal injuries from a drone blast, and a woman was found dead under rubble after another drone slammed into her house. — In the Kharkiv region in the northeast, a Russian drone strike Sunday severely injured a 56-year-old man as he walked down a road in the city of Kupiansk, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov reported. He said the man would need to have at least one limb amputated as a result, but gave no further detail. — In the Kyiv suburb of Brovary, debris from a Russian drone sparked a fire late on Saturday on the roof of a 25-story tower block, according to regional Gov. Ruslan Kravchenko. There were no immediate reports of any casualties. — According to Ukraine’s Air Force, Russia launched 103 Iranian-made Shahed drones at its neighbor overnight into Sunday. Ukrainian air defense shot down 52 of the drones while another 44 failed to reach their targets, the force said in a statement, in a likely reference to electronic jamming. — Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that its forces had intercepted 42 Ukrainian drones launched overnight at Russian territory. According to the ministry, 20 of those were over the Oryol region, where the local governor said a blaze tore through the oil terminal. — Separately, Russian forces have continued grinding forward in Ukraine’s northeast, in addition to eking out gains near the eastern town of Kurakhove. On Sunday, Russia’s Defense Ministry reported that its troops had captured two northeastern settlements: Lozova in the Kharkiv region and Krasne in the Luhansk province. There was no immediate confirmation from Kyiv.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-depot-7153abcbd0d8e2c6e33dba89f7d2e0ef	2024-12-22T03:45:04-08:00	
Bluesky finds with growth comes growing pains — and bots	Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk's X, which they view as increasingly leaning too far to the right given its owner's support of President-elect Donald Trump, or wanting an alternative to Meta's Threads and its algorithms. The platform grew out of the company then known as Twitter, championed by its former CEO Jack Dorsey. Its decentralized approach to social networking was eventually intended to replace Twitter's core mechanic. That's unlikely now that the two companies have parted ways. But Bluesky's growth trajectory — with a user base that has more than doubled since October — could make it a serious competitor to other social platforms. But with growth comes growing pains. It's not just human users who've been flocking to Bluesky but also bots, including those designed to create partisan division or direct users to junk websites. The skyrocketing user base — now surpassing 25 million — is the biggest test yet for a relatively young platform that has branded itself as a social media alternative free of the problems plaguing its competitors. According to research firm Similarweb, Bluesky added 7.6 million monthly active app users on iOS and Android in November, an increase of 295.4% since October. It also saw 56.2 million desktop and mobile web visits, in the same period, up 189% from October. Besides the U.S. elections, Bluesky also got a boost when X was briefly banned in Brazil. 'They got this spike in attention, they’ve crossed the threshold where it is now worth it for people to flood the platform with spam,' said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and a member of Issue One’s Council for Responsible Social Media. 'But they don’t have the cash flow, they don’t have the established team that a larger platform would, so they have to do it all very, very quickly.' To manage growth for its tiny staff, Bluesky started as an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other distinctive features to attract new users, such as 'starter packs' that provide lists of topically curated feeds. Meta recently announced that it is testing a similar feature. Compared to the bigger players like Meta's platforms or X, Bluesky has a 'quite different' value system, said Claire Wardle, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in misinformation. This includes giving users more control over their experience. 'The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders,' Bluesky said on its blog in March. 'Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.' Because of this mindset, Bluesky has achieved a scrappy underdog status that has attracted users who've grown tired of the big players. 'People had this idea that it was going to be a different type of social network,' Wardle said. 'But the truth is, when you get lots of people in a place and there are eyeballs, it means that it’s in other people’s interests to use bots to create, you know, information that aligns with their perspective.' Little data has emerged to help quantify the rise in impersonator accounts, artificial intelligence-fueled networks and other potentially harmful content on Bluesky. But in recent weeks, users have begun reporting large numbers of apparent AI bots following them, posting plagiarized articles or making seemingly automated divisive comments in replies. Lion Cassens, a Bluesky user and doctoral candidate in the Netherlands, found one such network by accident — a group of German-language accounts with similar bios and AI-generated profile pictures posting in replies to three German newspapers. 'I noticed some weird replies under a news post by the German newspaper ‘Die Ziet,’' he said in an email to The Associated Press. 'I have a lot of trust in the moderation mechanism on Bluesky, especially compared to Twitter since the layoffs and due to Musk’s more radical stance on freedom of speech. But AI bots are a big challenge, as they will only improve. I hope social media can keep up with that.' Cassens said the bots' messages have been relatively innocuous so far, but he was concerned about how they could be repurposed in the future to mislead. There are also signs that foreign disinformation narratives have made their way to Bluesky. The disinformation research group Alethea pointed to one low-traction post sharing a false claim about ABC News that had circulated on Russian Telegram channels. Copycat accounts are another challenge. In late November, Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, found that of the top 100 most followed named individuals on Bluesky, 44% had at least one duplicate account posing as them. Two weeks later, Mantzarlis said Bluesky had removed around two-thirds of the duplicate accounts he’d initially detected — a sign the site was aware of the issue and attempting to address it. Bluesky posted earlier this month that it had quadrupled its moderation team to keep up with its growing user base. The company also announced it had introduced a new system to detect impersonation and was working to improve its Community Guidelines to provide more detail on what’s allowed. Because of the way the site is built, users also have the option to subscribe to third-party 'Labelers' that outsource content moderation by tagging accounts with warnings and context. The company didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. Even as its challenges aren’t yet at the scale other platforms face, Bluesky is at a 'crossroads,' said Edward Perez, a board member at the nonpartisan nonprofit OSET Institute, who previously led Twitter’s civic integrity team. 'Whether BlueSky likes it or not, it is being pulled into the real world,' Perez said, noting that it needs to quickly prioritize threats and work to mitigate them if it hopes to continue to grow. That said, disinformation and bots won't be Bluesky's only challenges in the months and years to come. As a text-based social network, its entire premise is falling out of favor with younger generations. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that only 17% of American teenagers used X, for instance, down from 23% in 2022. For teens and young adults, TikTok, Instagram and other visual-focused platforms are the places to be. Political polarization is also going against Bluesky ever reaching the size of TikTok, Instagram or even X. 'Bluesky is not trying to be all things to all people,' Wardle said, adding that, likely, the days of a Facebook or Instagram emerging where they're 'trying to keep everybody happy' are over. Social platforms are increasingly splintered along political lines and when they aren't — see Meta's platforms — the companies behind them are actively working to de-emphasize political content and news. ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Prominent Lebanese figure meets Syrian insurgent who led Assad's ouster, seeking better relations	BEIRUT (AP) — A prominent Lebanese politician held talks on Sunday with the insurgent who led the overthrow of Syria's President Bashar Assad, with both expressing hope for a new era in relations between their countries. Druze leader Walid Jumblatt is the most prominent Lebanese politician to visit Syria since the Assad family’s 54-year rule ended two weeks ago. Jumblatt was a longtime critic of Syria's involvement in Lebanon and blamed Assad's father, former leader Hafez Assad, for the assassination of his own father. He held talks with Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the Sunni Islamist rebels who swept into Damascus earlier this month and forced the younger Assad from power. Now wearing a suit and tie, al-Sharaa has been meeting with diplomats and others from around the region and beyond as Assad's fall reshapes alliances and gives many long-stifled Syrians hope after more than 13 years of civil war and international sanctions. 'We salute the Syrian people for their great victories and we salute you for your battle that you waged to get rid of oppression and tyranny that lasted over 50 years,' said Jumblatt, a key figure in Lebanon’s Druze minority. He expressed hope that Lebanese-Syrian relations 'will return to normal.' Jumblatt's father, Kamal, was killed in 1977 in an ambush near a Syrian roadblock during Syria's military intervention in Lebanon's civil war. 'Syria was a source of concern and disturbance, and its interference in Lebanese affairs was negative,' al-Sharaa said, referring to the Assad government. 'Syria will no longer be a case of negative interference in Lebanon,' he added. Al-Sharaa also repeated longstanding allegations that Assad's government was behind the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which was followed by other killings of prominent Lebanese critics of Assad. Last year, the United Nations closed an international tribunal investigating that assassination after it convicted three members of Lebanon's Hezbollah — an ally of Assad — in absentia. Hezbollah denied involvement in the bombing that killed Hariri and 21 others. 'We hope that all those who committed crimes against the Lebanese will be held accountable, and that fair trials will be held for those who committed crimes against the Syrian people,' Jumblatt said. Iran's leader predicts trouble for new Syrian rulers Separately, Iran's supreme leader asserted that young Syrians will resist the new government emerging after Assad's ouster, as he again accused the United States and Israel of sowing chaos in the country. Iran provided crucial support to Assad throughout Syria's civil war, which erupted after he launched a violent crackdown on a popular uprising. Syria had long served as a key conduit for Iranian aid to Hezbollah. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in an address on Sunday that the 'young Syrian has nothing to lose' and suffers from insecurity following Assad's fall. 'What can he do? He should stand with strong will against those who designed and those who implemented the insecurity,' Khamenei said. He also accused the United States and Israel of plotting against Assad's government in order to seize resources. Iran and its militant allies in the region have suffered major setbacks over the past year, with Israel battering Hamas in Gaza and landing heavy blows on Hezbollah before they agreed to a ceasefire in Lebanon last month. Khamenei denied that such groups were proxies of Iran, saying they fought because of their beliefs. 'If one day we plan to take action, we do not need proxy force,' he said. Preserving evidence of crimes The head of a U.N.-backed team investigating crimes committed during the civil war said they are working with the country’s new authorities in hopes of preserving evidence uncovered after Assad’s ouster. 'We welcome the fact that we were invited to come and to engage with the authorities,' Robert Petit said Sunday, describing the meeting as 'constructive.' As journalists, researchers and the public stream into former detention centers and mass grave sites, many express fears that evidence is taken or destroyed. Wafa Mustafa, a Syrian activist whose father, Ali, disappeared in 2013 in Damascus, said that 'no one gets to tell the families what happened without evidence, without search, without work, without effort.' Returning Syrians search for shattered homes Syria's civil war created millions of refugees, and thousands have begun returning. In a gray field of rubble outside Damascus, returnee Alaa Badawi worked with a shovel, looking for traces of his home. His community, Qaboun, was an anti-government center and many of its buildings were flattened under Assad's administration. 'Which is our house? Which is our alley? There is nothing visible,' Badawi said. He and others decided to dig a little here and there to look for the house's distinctive tiles. 'We finally discovered that this is our house,' he said. 'I do not know by then if I was happy to have located the house amid the rubble or upset because the house did not exist.' Ziad Al-Hilli, one of the many people freed from prison as Assad fled to Russia, could not find his house, or his family. ___ Associated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-iran-khamenei-assad-29c9df300bbacc00247832bcd19929c6	2024-12-22T02:04:03-08:00	
Stampedes in Nigeria leave at least 32 dead during Christmas food distribution	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — The death toll from stampedes during two Christmas charity events in Nigeria has increased from 13 to 32, police said Sunday. The victims, including at least four children, collapsed during crowd surges as people grew desperate for food items while the country grapples with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. The dead included 22 people in southeastern Anambra state’s Okija town, where a philanthropist on Saturday organized a food distribution, local police spokesman Tochukwu Ikenga said. Ten others died in the capital, Abuja, during a church-organized similar charity event. Police said they were investigating the two incidents, only days after another stampede in which 35 children were killed. Africa’s most populous country is seeing a growing trend by local organizations, churches and individuals to organize charity events ahead of Christmas to ease economic hardship caused by a cost-of-living crisis. Witnesses of the Abuja stampede told The Associated Press there was a crowd surge at one of the church gates, as dozens tried to enter the premises at around 4 a.m., hours before gift items were to be shared. Some of them, including older people, waited overnight to get food, said Loveth Inyang, who rescued one baby from the crush. The stampedes prompted growing calls for authorities to enforce safety measures at such events. Nigerian police also mandated that organizers obtain prior permission.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-christmas-stampedes-eaf1e6d852a7014f24166c948d7e906a	2024-12-22T00:49:14-08:00	
German authorities received tipoffs last year about the suspect in Christmas market attack	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — German authorities said they received tipoffs last year about the suspect in a car attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg as more details emerged on Sunday about the five people killed. Authorities have identified the suspect as a Saudi doctor who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had received permanent residency. Police haven’t publicly named the suspect, in line with privacy rules, but some German news outlets have identified him as Taleb A. and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Authorities say he does not fit the usual profile of perpetrators of extremist attacks. The man described himself as an ex-Muslim who was highly critical of Islam and in many posts on social media expressed support for the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. He is being held in custody as authorities investigate him. 'This perpetrator acted in an unbelievably cruel and brutal manner — like an Islamist terrorist, although he was obviously ideologically an Islamophobe,' Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said Sunday. The suspect originally lived in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where he completed his specialist training in Stralsund and also came to the attention of authorities due to threatening criminal acts, the state interior minister, Christian Pegel, said Sunday. In a dispute over the recognition of examination results, he threatened members of the state medical association with an act that would attract international attention, triggering an investigation and a search of his home, the dpa news agency reported, citing Pegel. No evidence was found of real preparations for an attack but a court found him guilty in 2013 of threatening an attack. That was followed by other threats he made, Pegel said. The head of the Federal Criminal Police Office, Holger Münch, said in an interview on the German broadcaster ZDF on Saturday that his office received a tipoff from Saudi Arabia in November 2023, which led authorities to launch 'appropriate investigative measures.' 'The man also published a huge number of posts on the internet. He also had contact with various authorities, made insults and even threats. However, he was not known to have committed acts of violence,' said Münch, whose office is the German equivalent of the FBI. He said that the warnings, however, proved to be very unspecific. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees also said it received a tipoff about the suspect in the late summer of last year. 'This was taken seriously, like every other of the numerous tips,' the office said on X on Saturday. But it also noted that it is not an investigative authority and that it referred the information to the responsible authorities. It gave no other details. The Central Council of Ex-Muslims said in a statement that the suspect had 'terrorized' them for years as it expressed shock at the attack. 'He apparently shared beliefs from the far-right spectrum of the AfD and believed in a large-scale conspiracy aimed at Islamizing Germany. His delusional ideas went so far that he assumed that even organizations critical of Islamism were part of the Islamist conspiracy,' said the statement. The group's chairwoman, Mina Ahadi, said in the same statement: 'At first we suspected that he might be a mole in the Islamist movement. But now I think he is a psychopath who adheres to ultra-right conspiracy ideologies.' Police in Magdeburg, the capital of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, said Sunday that those who died were four women aged 45, 52, 67 and 75, as well as a 9-year-old boy. Authorities said 200 people were injured, including 41 in serious condition. They were being treated in multiple hospitals in Magdeburg, which is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Berlin, and beyond. The suspect was on Saturday evening brought before a judge, who behind closed doors ordered him to be kept in custody on allegations of murder and attempted murder. He is facing a possible indictment. The horror triggered by yet another act of mass violence in Germany makes it likely that migration will remain a key issue as the country heads toward an early election on Feb. 23. A deadly knife attack by a suspected Islamic extremist from Syria in Solingen in August pushed the issue to the top of the agenda, and led the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz to tighten border security measures. Right-wing figures from across Europe have criticized German authorities for having allowed high levels of migration in the past and for what they see as security failures now. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is known for a strong anti-migration position going back years, used the attack in Germany to lash out at the European Union’s migration policies and described it as a 'terrorist act.' At an annual press conference in Budapest on Saturday, Orbán insisted that 'there is no doubt that there is a link between the changed world in Western Europe, the migration that flows there, especially illegal migration and terrorist acts.' ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

Israeli strikes in Gaza kill at least 22 as Vatican envoy visits Christians for pre-Christmas Mass	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Sunday killed at least 22 people, including five children, Palestinian medical officials said, while Gaza's small Christian community celebrated a pre-Christmas Mass. Israeli authorities allowed a rare Gaza visit by the leader of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, for the Mass while the ever-present buzz of Israeli drones was heard outside. One of the latest Israeli strikes hit a school housing displaced people in Gaza City and killed at least eight, including three children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel's military said it struck Hamas militants sheltering there. A strike on a home in the central city of Deir al-Balah late Saturday killed at least eight, including three women and two children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. Another six people were killed in separate strikes on Sunday, according to local hospitals. 'The children are still inside the house. We are looking for them. They were sleeping in the living room, five of them together,' said a relative of a victim, Noman Abu Samra, as people searched rubble in Deir al-Balah. A window full of children looked on. Israel has carried out daily strikes in Gaza more than 14 months into the war with Hamas. It says it only targets militants, accusing them of hiding among civilians, but the bombings frequently kill women and children. Israel and Hamas recently appeared to draw closer to a ceasefire agreement that would include the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, but several obstacles remain, and the indirect talks have repeatedly stalled. Vatican envoy celebrates Mass with Gaza's Christians Dozens of worshipers gathered in the Holy Family Church in Gaza City as Pizzaballa and other clergy celebrated Mass. A twinkling Christmas tree was decorated with golden ornaments. 'I want to say, to tell you, that all the world, not only the Christian world, all the world is with you, So the war will finish and we will rebuild,' the cardinal said, urging Gazans to never be afraid. His visit came as Pope Francis again criticized Israel's actions in Gaza. Francis said Saturday that his envoy had been unable to enter the territory because of Israeli bombing. 'Yesterday children have been bombed. This is cruelty, this is not war,' Francis said during his annual Christmas greetings at the Vatican. On Sunday, he called for a ceasefire. The pope recently called for an investigation to determine if Israel's actions in Gaza constitute genocide, a conclusion later reached by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The International Court of Justice is investigating genocide allegations brought against Israel by South Africa. Israel, which was founded as a refuge for Jews after the Nazi Holocaust, rejects such allegations. It says it is only at war with Hamas, which it accuses of genocidal violence in the attack that ignited the war. Now winter sets in In that Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel and killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still in Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead. Israel’s subsequent bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 45,000 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps along the coast as the cold, wet winter sets in. Israel has been carrying out a major operation in northern Gaza since early October, battling Hamas in the most isolated and heavily damaged part of the territory. Tens of thousands have fled as the military has ordered a complete evacuation and allowed almost no humanitarian aid to enter. The Israeli military body overseeing civilian affairs in Gaza, known as COGAT, said on Friday it facilitated the evacuation of over 100 patients, caregivers and others from Kamal Adwan Hospital and Al-Awda Hospital in the north. They have struggled to function. COGAT said it also facilitated the delivery of 5,000 liters of fuel and food packages to the hospitals. Kamal Adwan's director on Saturday asserted that Israel's military had ordered an evacuation and said shelling was occurring. Israel's military on Sunday said there was no evacuation order and it was unaware of any strikes there. Palestinian security force member killed in West Bank In the volatile West Bank town of Jenin, militants shot and killed a member of the Palestinian security forces and wounded two others. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority launched a rare crackdown there this month. A statement from the security forces blamed the shooting on 'outlaws,' without elaborating. The PA is internationally recognized but deeply unpopular among Palestinians, in part because it cooperates with Israel on security matters. The PA exercises limited authority in population centers in the West Bank. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast War, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-12-22-2024-6638c448bcc5780d98c3e8284ce58fe1	2024-12-21T23:38:02-08:00	
China says US is 'playing with fire' after latest military aid for Taiwan	BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese government protested Sunday the latest American announcements of military sales and assistance to Taiwan, warning the United States that it is 'playing with fire.' U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Saturday the provision of up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and in military education and training for Taiwan. Separately, the Defense Department said Friday that $295 million in military sales had been approved. A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement urged the U.S. to stop arming Taiwan and stop what it called 'dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.' Taiwan is a democratic island of 23 million people that the Chinese government claims as its territory and says must come under its control. U.S. military sales and assistance aim to help Taiwan defend itself and deter China from launching an attack. The $571 million in military assistance comes on top of Biden's authorization of $567 million for the same purposes in late September. The military sales include $265 million for about 300 tactical radio systems and $30 million for 16 gun mounts. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry welcomed the approval of the two sales, saying in a social media post on X that it reaffirmed the U.S. government's 'commitment to our defense.'	https://apnews.com/article/china-taiwan-us-military-arms-sales-89a657717d0ef2d0565726d141a530a3	2024-12-21T20:36:27-08:00	
In Assad's hometown, few shared in his family's fortune. They hope they won't share in his downfall	QARDAHA, Syria (AP) — On the walls of the palatial mausoleum built to house the remains of former Syrian President Hafez Assad, vandals have sprayed variations of the phrase, 'Damn your soul, Hafez.' Nearly two weeks after the ouster of his son, Bashar Assad, people streamed in to take photos next to the burned-out hollow where the elder Assad’s grave used to be. It was torched by rebel fighters after a lightning offensive overthrew Assad's government, bringing more than a half-century rule by the Assad dynasty to an end. The mausoleum's sprawling grounds — and the surrounding area, where the ousted president and other relatives had villas — were until recently off limits to residents of Qardaha, the former presidential dynasty's hometown in the mountains overlooking the coastal city of Latakia. Nearby, Bashar Assad’s house was emptied by looters, who left the water taps running to flood it. At a villa belonging to three of his cousins, a father and his two young sons were removing pipes to sell the scrap metal. A gutted piano was tipped over on the floor. While the Assads lived in luxury, most Qardaha residents — many, like Assad, members of the Alawite minority sect — survived on manual labor, low-level civil service jobs and farming to eke out a living. Many sent their sons to serve in the army, not out of loyalty to the government but because they had no other option. 'The situation was not what the rest of the Syrian society thought,' said Deeb Dayoub, an Alawite sheikh. 'Everyone thought Qardaha was a city built on a marble rock and a square of aquamarine in every house,' he said, referring to the trappings of wealth enjoyed by Assad's family. In the city’s main street, a modest strip of small grocery stores and clothing shops, Ali Youssef, stood next to a coffee cart, gesturing with disdain. 'This street is the best market and the best street in Qardaha and it’s full of potholes.' Families resorted to eating bread dipped in oil and salt because they could not afford meat or vegetables, he said. Youssef said he dodged mandatory military service for two years, but eventually was forced to go. 'Our salary was 300,000 Syrian pounds,' a month, he said — just over $20. 'We used to send it to our families to pay the rent or live and eat with it' while working jobs on the side to cover their own expenses. 'Very few people benefited from the former deposed regime,' Youssef said. So far, residents said, the security forces made up of fighters from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — the main group in the coalition that unseated Assad, and which is now ruling the country — have been respectful toward them. 'The security situation is fine so far, it’s acceptable, no major issues,' said Mariam al-Ali, who was in the market with her daughter. 'There were a few abuses … but it was fixed.' She did not elaborate, but others said there had been scattered incidents of robberies and looting or threats and insults. Al-Ali called Assad a 'traitor,' but she remained circumspect about her Alawite community's position in the new Syria. 'The most important thing is that there should be no sectarianism, so there will be no more blood spilled,' she said. Dayoub, the Alawite sheikh, described 'a state of anticipation and caution among all citizens in this area, and in general among Alawites,' although he said fears have started to ease. At the town’s municipal building, dozens of notables sat on bleachers discussing the country' s new reality and what they hoped to convey to the new leadership. Much was centered around economic woes — retired public servants' salaries had not been paid, the price of fuel had risen, there was no public transportation in the area. But others had larger concerns. 'We hope that in the next government or the new Syria, we will have rights and duties like any Syrian citizen — we are not asking for any more or less,' said Jaafar Ahmed, a doctoral student and community activist. 'We don’t accept the curtailment of our rights because the regime was part of this component.' Questions also loomed about the fate of the area's sons who had served in Assad's army. Since the army's collapse in the face of the rebel advance, residents said several thousand young army recruits from Qardaha have gone missing. Some later turned up on lists of former soldiers being held at a detention center in Hama. 'These are young guys who are 22 or 23 and they never took part' in active combat, said Qais Ibrahim, whose nephews were among the missing. Over the past few years, active combat was largely frozen in the country's civil war. 'We send our children to the army because we don’t have any other source of income.' Um Jaafar, who gave only her nickname out of fear of reprisals, said the family had no information about the fate of her two sons, stationed with the army in Raqqa and Deir Ezzour, though one son's name later turned up on the list of those imprisoned in Hama. 'My children got the best grades in school, but I didn’t have the ability to send them to the university,' she said. 'They went to the army just for a salary that was barely enough to cover their transportation costs.' Syria's new authorities have set up 'reconciliation centers' around the country where former soldiers can register, hand over their weapons and receive a 'reconciliation ID' allowing them to move freely and safely in Syria for three months. But Ahmed, the doctoral student, said he wants more. As the country attempts to unify and move on after nearly 14 years of civil war, he said, 'We want either forgiveness for all or accountability for all.' Ahmed acknowledged that during the war, 'rural Latakia was responsible for some radical groups,' referring to pro-Assad militias accused of widespread abuses against civilians. But, he said, opposition groups also committed abuses. Rebels often indiscriminately targeted Alawites because they were seen as the firmest pillar of Assad’s rule — and some Islamist extremists among the rebels consider them heretics. 'We hope that there will be either an open process of reconciliation ... or transitional justice in which all will be held accountable for their mistakes, from all parties,' he said. 'We can’t talk about holding accountable one ... group but not another.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-bashar-assad-hometown-qardaha-alawites-cbeb4ab8d5bf4bacc75fb9792bb4cd14	2024-12-21T20:04:54-08:00	
Winter is hitting Gaza and many Palestinians have little protection from the cold	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Winter is hitting the Gaza Strip and many of the nearly 2 million Palestinians displaced by the devastating 14-month war with Israel are struggling to protect themselves from the wind, cold and rain. There is a shortage of blankets and warm clothing, little wood for fires, and the tents and patched-together tarps families are living in have grown increasingly threadbare after months of heavy use, according to aid workers and residents. Shadia Aiyada, who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah to the coastal area of Muwasi, has only one blanket and a hot water bottle to keep her eight children from shivering inside their fragile tent. 'We get scared every time we learn from the weather forecast that rainy and windy days are coming up because our tents are lifted with the wind. We fear that strong windy weather would knock out our tents one day while we’re inside,' she said. With nighttime temperatures that can drop into the 40s (the mid-to-high single digits Celsius), Aiyada fears that her kids will get sick without warm clothing. When they fled their home, her children only had their summer clothes, she said. They have been forced to borrow some from relatives and friends to keep warm. The United Nations warns of people living in precarious makeshift shelters that might not survive the winter. At least 945,000 people need winterization supplies, which have become prohibitively expensive in Gaza, the U.N. said in an update Tuesday. The U.N. also fears infectious disease, which spiked last winter, will climb again amid rising malnutrition. The U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees, known as UNRWA, has been planning all year for winter in Gaza, but the aid it was able to get into the territory is 'not even close to being enough for people,' said Louise Wateridge, an agency spokeswoman. UNRWA distributed 6,000 tents over the past four weeks in northern Gaza but was unable to get them to other parts of the Strip, including areas where there has been fighting. About 22,000 tents have been stuck in Jordan and 600,000 blankets and 33 truckloads of mattresses have been sitting in Egypt since the summer because the agency doesn’t have Israeli approval or a safe route to bring them into Gaza and because it had to prioritize desperately needed food aid, Wateridge said. Many of the mattresses and blankets have since been looted or destroyed by the weather and rodents, she said. The International Rescue Committee is struggling to bring in children’s winter clothing because there 'are a lot of approvals to get from relevant authorities,' said Dionne Wong, the organization’s deputy director of programs for the occupied Palestinian territories. 'The ability for Palestinians to prepare for winter is essentially very limited,' Wong said. The Israeli government agency responsible for coordinating aid shipments into Gaza said in a statement that Israel has worked for months with international organizations to prepare Gaza for the winter, including facilitating the shipment of heaters, warm clothing, tents and blankets into the territory. More than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry's count doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but it has said more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war was sparked by Hamas’ October 2023 attack on southern Israel, where the militant group killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages in Gaza. Negotiators say Israel and Hamas are inching toward a ceasefire deal, which would include a surge in aid into the territory. For now, the winter clothing for sale in Gaza's markets is far too expensive for most people to afford, residents and aid workers said. Reda Abu Zarada, 50, who was displaced from northern Gaza with her family, said the adults sleep with the children in their arms to keep them warm inside their tent. 'Rats walk on us at night because we don’t have doors and tents are torn. The blankets don’t keep us warm. We feel frost coming out from the ground. We wake up freezing in the morning,' she said. 'I’m scared of waking up one day to find one of the children frozen to death.' On Thursday night, she fought through knee pain exacerbated by cold weather to fry zucchini over a fire made of paper and cardboard scraps outside their tent. She hoped the small meal would warm the children before bed. Omar Shabet, who is displaced from Gaza City and staying with his three children, feared that lighting a fire outside his tent would make his family a target for Israeli warplanes. 'We go inside our tents after sunset and don’t go out because it is very cold and it gets colder by midnight,' he said. 'My 7-year-old daughter almost cries at night because of how cold she is.'	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-winter-palestinians-aid-israel-24fe23c8ae2743294c169cff4a1431d3	2024-12-21T20:03:45-08:00	
Two US Navy pilots shot down over Red Sea in apparent 'friendly fire' incident, US military says	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent 'friendly fire' incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels. Both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become over the ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area. The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels at the time, though the U.S. military’s Central Command did not elaborate on what their mission was and did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press. The F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn't specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea. 'The guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,' Central Command said in a statement. From the military's description, the aircraft shot down was a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the 'Red Rippers' of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. It wasn't immediately clear how the Gettysburg could mistake an F/A-18 for an enemy aircraft or missile, particularly as ships in a battle group remain linked by both radar and radio communication. However, Central Command said that warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Incoming hostile fire from the Houthis has given sailors just seconds to make decisions in the past. Since the Truman's arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II. On Saturday night and early Sunday, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes that shook Sanaa, the capital of Yemen that the Houthis have held since 2014. Central Command described the strikes as targeting a 'missile storage facility' and a 'command-and-control facility,' without elaborating. Houthi-controlled media reported strikes in both Sanaa and around the port city of Hodeida, without offering any casualty or damage information. In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. The Houthis later acknowledged the aircraft being shot down in the Red Sea. The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also have increasingly targeted Israel itself with drones and missiles, resulting in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-yemen-us-navy-pilots-houthi-95a792daae3b0120186bfc6c66e1b6fe	2024-12-21T17:57:03-08:00	
The water was their livelihood. Now Thailand's sea nomads work to preserve a vanishing way of life	SURIN ISLANDS, Thailand (AP) — When Hook was a child, he started his days by jumping off the boat that his family lived on and into the ocean. By age 3, he could already swim and dive in shallow waters. His home was a kabang, a boat, that his family sailed in Thailand’s southern waters. The ocean was his backyard. Now Hook, whose full name is Suriyan Klathale, lives on land like the rest of his community, a people known as the Moken. The recollections of his childhood, which many Moken of his generation still have, are mostly just memories. The community, a group of indigenous people from Thailand and Myanmar, came to worldwide attention for its members' understanding of waves when the Indian Ocean Tsunami struck in December 2004 and killed more than 200,000 people. The few tourists who happened to be on the islands inhabited by the Moken survived because locals knew when they saw the water recede that people needed to get to higher ground. Today, things are different and changing fast. This once free-sailing people have been grounded by powerful forces of change. How do you hold onto tradition when everything is working against it? The Moken are one of the various tribal groups and indigenous communities not formally recognized by the Thai government. For years, activists from these communities have tried to push for formal recognition with a bill that would help them hold on to traditions. But as recently as October, the latest draft of this proposed bill, called the Protection and Promotion of Ethnic Groups’ Way of Life, was tabled by Parliament. The bill would legally guarantee these communities' basic rights, such as health care, education and land, as well as provide government support to preserve their ethnic identities. For the Moken, the kabang and their way of living on the ocean are something they hope the law could help preserve. The wooden boat, with a distinctive curve that juts out from its bow and a pavilion set in the middle, is central to the Moken’s identity. 'It’s like a lifetime of a person, of a family,' Hook said. 'In the past, we lived and died on that boat.' Multiple generations could live on a kabang, which were much bigger in the past. The parents would stay in the middle of the boat; their married children lived at the front until they built their own boat. Tat, an elder in the Moken community who uses only one name, said that a Moken became an adult when he could build a boat. It meant he was capable of starting a family. Today, though, almost no one lives on a boat. Narumon Arunotai, an associate professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok who has worked with the Moken and other indigenous communities for decades, said the shift toward permanent dwelling on land had already started more than 40 years ago. It was a gradual shift, driven both by stricter border controls as well as the inability to get the wood necessary to build the kabangs. Further, the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 destroyed many of the traditional boats. The change to dwelling on land has happened with other communities known colloquially as sea nomads in Thailand as well. The Moken are scattered across an archipelago of some 800 islands on the coast of Myanmar and Thailand. In the days when they lived on boats, Moken stayed on land only during the monsoon season, which started around May. They’d stay on land until the winds shifted, usually around December, and then abandon their temporary homes for the sea. For food, they fished and foraged. Many of the older generation were born on boats and sailed regularly amongst the islands. 'We could move freely without having to worry about the Myanmar government or the Thai government,' said Tawan Klathale, Hook’s older brother, who was born on a boat. All Moken in Thailand use the surname Klathale, given to the community by one of Thailand’s former queens. 'Back then,' said the brother, who is known as Ngui, 'there was no clear line to where is Myanmar and where is Thailand.' Freedoms began to constrict, and making boats became harder But by the time Ngui and Hook were teenagers, they could no longer travel as freely between those islands. Many Moken started settling more permanently in the Surin Islands, off the Thai coast. Some came from Myanmar to Thailand, looking for jobs and safety from pirates. Hook’s family stayed ashore. The parts of the community that stayed in Thailand found that the land they had always visited each season had become a national park by 1981. As a result, they could no longer cut down the large trees they needed to build their boats. To make a kabang, one needs a good strong tree, at least 1 meter wide and 10 meters tall. The trunk needs to be straight and be free of defects. Over the course of months, men of the community would dig out the trunk and carve it into a boat’s hull, while also using fire to make the wood pliable and stretch it out. It was a communal thing, involving up to 10 people. Now, it’s difficult to gather enough people. Other men of the village would often be out working during the day. They did not have time to join and work together on a boat. Ngui and other members of an informal group called Moken Pa Ti’ao, concerned they were losing the knowledge of boat-building, said they approached the park now and then across the years get a tree to make the boat. They were refused years ago by the chief of Mu Ko Surin National Park. The group hasn’t asked since. The park allows them to cut down only small trees, said Ngui, who is also assistant to the village chief in Surin Island. 'The restrictions has been like this as far as we can remember.' Today, the village in Surin only has one kabang, built by Tat and used mostly to ferry tourists and take children out on day trips. Hook, who lives on the mainland in Thailand, also has a kabang built with the funding of a private donor from Norway after a filmmaker made a documentary about his journey to make one such boat in 2014. But his kabang is built with planks of wood, rather than a single hollowed out tree. They are among the few keen to remember the boats and other traditions. Tat says he has made sure to pass down what he knew to his children, from songs to boat building. 'If my generation is gone, there would be just very few people left who know how to do these things,' Tat said. Learning about the ocean remains a priority Together, Tat and Wilasinee Klathale, a teacher at the school on the island, also try to take village children out on the boats to teach them about the ocean as well as about music and dance. 'It’s not in the curriculum, but I added them myself, because I could see that these things are going to be lost,' Wilasinee said. Today, young Moken are more worried about their livelihoods and finding jobs than how to build a boat. Most only make money during Thailand’s peak tourist season when the national park is open to tourists, from November to April, and have to live on that money for the rest of the year. Boyen Klathale, a young Moken man, said it’s difficult to find a job. On Surin, the opportunities are either with the national park or operating boats to take tourists out. Though it’s peak season, he wasn’t able to find a job this year, and he didn’t want to leave behind his family to find work on the mainland. The Moken have asked for more fishing rights in the past, but were denied a further quota beyond the subsistence amount they’re allowed from the park. Ngui, the village chief’s assistant, said he hopes the Moken can sell the souvenirs they make to tourists all year around with help from the government. The future holds some hope. In 2024, the Surin Islands National Park appointed a new chief, Kriengkrai Pohcharoen. In a shift, he said he was open to collaborating with the Moken on a kabang — as long as it was a tree that fell over on its own. 'I think about how to improve their quality of life, and how they can sustainably live in nature,' he said. 'I want them to have a good quality of life.' The Moken are realistic about their permanent switch to land. These days, most prefer it. But some still remember the old ways — and an aquamarine bay filled with handmade kabangs. 'The world is changing and that’s the way it is, if you ask me,' Ngui said. 'I think everything is bound to be lost at some point, but I just want it to stay as long as possible.'	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-sea-nomads-tsunami-moken-01bbf0c099652e6bd7f67ef191b73e8a	2024-12-21T17:41:06-08:00

Trump taps 'Apprentice' producer, Mark Burnett, as special envoy to the United Kingdom	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Mark Burnett, the power producer who helped reintroduce Donald Trump to a national television audience with 'The Apprentice,' is being tapped by the president-elect as special envoy to the United Kingdom in his upcoming administration. 'With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,' Trump announced Saturday. Burnett, who was born in London, helped produce hits like 'Survivor' and 'The Voice,' but is perhaps best known for teaming up with Trump for 'The Apprentice,' which first aired on NBC in 2004. Trump had been well-known in real estate and pop culture circles for decades. But the show helped again make him a household name — though Trump severed ties with NBC in 2015, the same year he launched his first White House run. The selection of Burnett continues Trump's trend of filling out his incoming administration with people who have high-profile backgrounds in television or politics, or both — including his choice to be defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a former co-host of 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend,' and ex-television doctor and unsuccessful Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, Mehmet Oz. Trump’s first campaign in 2016 was rocked by allegations about his conduct on 'The Apprentice' and other appearances during his association with NBC, notably in footage in which he said he could sexually assault women and get away with it because he was a 'star.' Almost a decade after he left his reality TV role, Trump’s television career remains central to his biography and political rise. The show presented Trump Tower to tens of millions of people as a symbol of power and success before Trump launched his first campaign from the building’s lobby. 'Mark is known for creating and producing some of the biggest shows in Television History,' Trump wrote in his statement on Burnett, listing many of his biggest hits before adding, 'most notably, ‘The Apprentice’' and noting that Burnett 'has won 13 Emmy Awards!' Special envoys are usually picked by presidents for the world's traditional hotspots, including the Middle East — where Trump has already said he'd like Steven Witkoff to fill the role. The United Kingdom, which has long enjoyed a 'special relationship' with the U.S. that makes it one of Washington's strongest global allies, is not typically a candidate for such posts. But Trump has announced a series of special envoy positions to several top loyalists ahead of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, including his former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell who he chose as envoy for special missions. That announcement joined previous ones including Adam Boehler as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, and Keith Kellogg to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. The president-elect said Burnett 'will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities, and cultural exchanges.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-apprentice-producer-burnett-envoy-united-kingdom-add9ff1ff9f72ddba482410f46070977	2024-12-21T12:43:39-08:00	
38 people are dead and over 100 remain missing in Congo after a ferry capsizes in the river Busira	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Thirty-eight people are confirmed dead, and over 100 remain missing after an overloaded ferry in the Congo capsized late Friday night, according to local officials and eyewitnesses. Twenty people are confirmed to have been rescued so far. The boat was traveling on the Burisa River in the northeast of the Congo as part of a convoy of other vessels, and the passengers were primarily merchants returning home for Christmas, said Joseph Joseph Kangolingoli, the mayor of Ingende, the last town before the site of the accident.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-boat-capsizes-busira-river-ac222ab809e107b119a8e86f1d5aa3f2	2024-12-21T11:08:16-08:00	
Ex-OpenAI engineer who raised legal concerns about the technology he helped build has died	Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI engineer and whistleblower who helped train the artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT and later said he believed those practices violated copyright law, has died, according to his parents and San Francisco officials. He was 26. Balaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before quitting in August. He was well-regarded by colleagues at the San Francisco company, where a co-founder this week called him one of OpenAI's strongest contributors who was essential to developing some of its products. 'We are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news and our hearts go out to Suchir’s loved ones during this difficult time,' said a statement from OpenAI. Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26 in what police said 'appeared to be a suicide. No evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation.' The city's chief medical examiner's office confirmed the manner of death to be suicide. His parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy said they are still seeking answers, describing their son as a 'happy, smart and brave young man' who loved to hike and recently returned from a trip with friends. Balaji grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and first arrived at the fledgling AI research lab for a 2018 summer internship while studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. He returned a few years later to work at OpenAI, where one of his first projects, called WebGPT, helped pave the way for ChatGPT. 'Suchir’s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn’t have succeeded without him,' said OpenAI co-founder John Schulman in a social media post memorializing Balaji. Schulman, who recruited Balaji to his team, said what made him such an exceptional engineer and scientist was his attention to detail and ability to notice subtle bugs or logical errors. 'He had a knack for finding simple solutions and writing elegant code that worked,' Schulman wrote. 'He’d think through the details of things carefully and rigorously.' Balaji later shifted to organizing the huge datasets of online writings and other media used to train GPT-4, the fourth generation of OpenAI's flagship large language model and a basis for the company's famous chatbot. It was that work that eventually caused Balaji to question the technology he helped build, especially after newspapers, novelists and others began suing OpenAI and other AI companies for copyright infringement. He first raised his concerns with The New York Times, which reported them in an October profile of Balaji. He later told The Associated Press he would 'try to testify' in the strongest copyright infringement cases and considered a lawsuit brought by The New York Times last year to be the 'most serious.' Times lawyers named him in a Nov. 18 court filing as someone who might have 'unique and relevant documents' supporting allegations of OpenAI's willful copyright infringement. His records were also sought by lawyers in a separate case brought by book authors including the comedian Sarah Silverman, according to a court filing. 'It doesn’t feel right to be training on people’s data and then competing with them in the marketplace,' Balaji told the AP in late October. 'I don’t think you should be able to do that. I don’t think you are able to do that legally.' He told the AP that he gradually grew more disillusioned with OpenAI, especially after the internal turmoil that led its board of directors to fire and then rehire CEO Sam Altman last year. Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations. But of the 'bag of issues' he was concerned about, he said he was focusing on copyright as the one it was 'actually possible to do something about.' He acknowledged that it was an unpopular opinion within the AI research community, which is accustomed to pulling data from the internet, but said 'they will have to change and it’s a matter of time.' He had not been deposed and it’s unclear to what extent his revelations will be admitted as evidence in any legal cases after his death. He also published a personal blog post with his opinions about the topic. Schulman, who resigned from OpenAI in August, said he and Balaji coincidentally left on the same day and celebrated with fellow colleagues that night with dinner and drinks at a San Francisco bar. Another of Balaji’s mentors, co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, had left OpenAI several months earlier, which Balaji saw as another impetus to leave. Schulman said Balaji had told him earlier this year of his plans to leave OpenAI and that Balaji didn't think that better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence 'was right around the corner, like the rest of the company seemed to believe.' The younger engineer expressed interest in getting a doctorate and exploring 'some more off-the-beaten path ideas about how to build intelligence,' Schulman said. Balaji's family said a memorial is being planned for later this month at the India Community Center in Milpitas, California, not far from his hometown of Cupertino. —————- EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide.

Tensions over Essequibo region resurface as Venezuela completes a bridge to a disputed border base	GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — Guyana’s government Saturday formally protested to Venezuela following the completion by Venezuela's armed forces of a bridge built on a remote river island shared by both countries. Work on the bridge, which links Venezuela’s mainland to a military base, has caused a decades-old row over border lines in the Essequibo region to flare up again. Guyana Foreign Minister Hugh Todd said in a statement that he was forced to summon Venezuelan Ambassador Amador Perez Silva to his office Thursday to condemn the move by Venezuela to build the bridge. The bridge links Venezuela's mainland to the eastern side of Ankoko island. The ministry claims the bridge connects the Venezuelan mainland to a small military base that Venezuela built illegally on Guyana's side of Ankoko, a small island that is mostly inhabited by gold miners and military personnel. The two neighboring states have feuded over land and maritime borders for decades as Venezuela claims that an 1890s boundaries commission cheated it out of the oil rich Essequibo region. The region currently makes up two-thirds of Guyana's territory. The area was administered by Britain for more than a century, and it has been under Guyanese control since 1966, when the nation gained its independence from the United Kingdom. Last year, Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro threatened to annex the region by force, following a referendum in which Venezuelan voters were asked if the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state. But Caribbean leaders, Brazil and the U.N. organized an emergency summit between the presidents of both nations on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent, where they agreed to resolve the dispute though peaceful means, and to avoid taking actions that would raise tensions. On Thursday, Todd said that Venezuela's decision to build the Ankoko island bridge violated the St Vincent agreement. 'Venezuela’s activities, including its military activities east of the boundary line, violate Guyana’s sovereignty, and international law requires that they be halted and that all personnel, facilities or equipment built or brought there by Venezuela be removed,' the ministry said. Guyana has argued the case in the World Court in The Netherlands for a final settlement and recently submitted its last piece of evidence to the court. Venezuela has until August to reply.	https://apnews.com/article/guyana-venezuela-border-essequibo-military-ankoko-mining-072e3f69997521fb178091362ba27ccf	2024-12-21T09:47:32-08:00	
What we know about the deadly Christmas market attack in Germany	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — Five people were killed, including a 9-year-old, after a Saudi doctor drove into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers in the German city of Magdeburg, officials said Saturday, as people mourned the victims and their shaken sense of security. City official Ronni Krug didn't provide further information on the adults killed in the attack on Friday night. He said 200 people were injured, of whom 41 were in serious or very serious condition. How did the attack unfold? Thi Linh Chi Nguyen, a 34-year-old manicurist from Vietnam — whose salon is located in a mall across the Christmas market — was on the phone during a break when she heard loud bangs and thought at first they were fireworks. She then saw a car drive through the market at high speed. People screamed and a child was thrown into the air by the car. The woman recalled seeing the car bursting out of the market and turning right onto Ernst-Reuter-Allee street and then coming to a standstill at the tram stop where the suspect was arrested. The market itself was still cordoned off Saturday with red-and-white tape and police vans every 50 meters (yards). Police with machine pistols guarded every entry to the market. Some thermal security blankets still lay on the street. Who’s the man behind the attack? Prosecutors said the suspect, a 50-year-old Saudi doctor, is under investigation on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and bodily harm. Several German media outlets identified the suspect as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. He has lived in Germany since 2006, practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg. officials said. Taleb’s X account describes him as a former Muslim. It is filled with tweets and retweets focusing on anti-Islam themes and criticism of the religion, while sharing congratulatory notes to Muslims who left the faith. He was critical of German authorities, saying they had failed to do enough to combat the 'Islamism of Europe.' He has also voiced support for the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Some described Taleb as an activist who helped Saudi women flee their homeland. Recently, he seemed focused on his theory that German authorities have been targeting Saudi asylum-seekers. The motives behind the attack There were still no answers Saturday as to what motivated the man to drive his black BMW into a crowd in the eastern German city. Prosecutors said the motive may have been 'dissatisfaction with the treatment of Saudi refugees in Germany,' but investigators are still trying to get to the bottom of what was behind the attack. Investigators have to analyze computers, mobile devices and other evidence, 'and at the end of the day we will know, or at least hope to know, what drove him to this act.' A string of violence The violence shocked Germany and the city, prompting several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution, and out of solidarity with Magdeburg’s loss. Berlin kept its markets open but has increased its police presence at them. Germany has suffered a string of extremist attacks in recent years, including a knife attack that killed three people and wounded eight at a festival in the western city of Solingen in August. Those attacks have led cities to beef up security at Christmas markets and other events. Friday’s attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-christmas-market-attack-magdeburg-c28c6ed42c7d1692798a28d2aba47514	2024-12-21T09:00:47-08:00	
Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for a deadly military checkpoint attack in the northwest	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — The Pakistani Taliban on Saturday claimed responsibility for a deadly military checkpoint attack in the country’s northwest. The militant group said it killed 35 soldiers and injured 15 others in an early morning raid. It also claimed seizing equipment including a night vision device and weapons. It’s Pakistan Taliban's latest assault on troops in the restive province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which borders Afghanistan. They made the claims in one of their WhatsApp chat groups. The army has yet to officially comment on the incident in South Waziristan, but a security official said militants used light and heavy weapons. He said they killed 16 soldiers and injured eight others. The official spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to talk to the media. The Pakistani Taliban have stepped up their offensive against the military and police since November 2022, when they unilaterally ended a ceasefire with the government after the failure of months of talks, hosted by Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers in Kabul. Also Saturday, Pakistan’s army said a military court had handed down prison sentences to 25 people it alleged were involved in riots last year following the arrest of former premier Imran Khan. Thousands of demonstrators attacked the military’s headquarters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, stormed an air base in Mianwali in eastern Punjab province and torched a building housing state-run Radio Pakistan in the northwest. The prison terms ranged from two years to 10 which, the army warned, acted as a 'stark reminder' for people to never take the law into their own hands.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-taliban-checkpoint-attack-waziristan-fff19247b8a3f72b10b12554527ea039	2024-12-21T06:33:22-08:00	
Vatican advances beatification process for Belgium's king who abdicated rather than approve abortion	ROME (AP) — The Vatican has taken the first main step to implement Pope Francis’ wish that Belgium’s late king be beatified for having abdicated for a day rather than approve legislation to legalize abortion. The Holy See’s saint-making office on Dec. 17 established a historical commission, made up of experts in Belgian history and archives, to begin investigating the life and virtues of King Baudouin, the Vatican said in a communique Saturday. Francis surprised and even enraged some Belgians when, during his September visit to Brussels, he prayed at Baudouin’s tomb, denounced Belgium’s abortion laws as 'homicidal' and announced he wanted to beatify the late king. Doubling down on the issue during his in-flight press conference en route home, Francis called doctors who perform abortions 'hitmen.' In the days after, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo called Francis’ comments 'totally unacceptable,' and summoned the Vatican’s ambassador to Belgium to complain. 'That a foreign head of state makes such a statement about democratic decision-making in our country is absolutely unacceptable,' De Croo said during question time in Parliament, according to Belgian media. 'We have no lessons to learn about how our parliamentarians democratically approve laws. Fortunately, the time when the church dictated the law in our country is long behind us.' Francis has strongly backed the Catholic Church’s opposition to abortion and long equated it to murder or 'hiring a hitman to solve a problem.' But his strong comments about abortion in Belgium only served to inflame an already troubled visit, given the Belgian church's wretched legacy of clergy sexual abuse. Baudouin became king after the abdication of his father, King Leopold. He abdicated for a day in 1990 rather than give his assent to a parliament-approved bill legalizing abortion. He died in 1993. While praying at his tomb alongside Belgium's current monarchs, Francis praised Baudouin’s courage and urged Belgians today to look to his example in rejecting a new legislative proposal to extend the legal limit for an abortion from 12 weeks to 18 weeks after conception. The Vatican’s saint-making process usually takes years, decades or even centuries and typically begins when the local church ascertains an enduring reputation for sanctity among the faithful by a particular candidate. An investigation into the life and virtues of the candidate follows, during which historians collect documentation and interview acquaintances and experts. If historians determine the candidate has lived a heroic life of Christian virtue, he or she can be declared venerable. The Vatican must then ascertain a miracle attributed to the candidate’s intercession for beatification, and a second miracle for the person to be declared a saint. Martyrs are exempt from the miracle for beatification, and popes can bypass the process altogether and declare saints, as Francis has done on several occasions. The convening of a historical commission suggests that church historians at the very least will conduct the research into Baudouin's life. But the Vatican communique noted that the cause wasn't originating as it normally would with the local Belgian church. Rather, the Holy See's secretariat of state directed the Vatican's saint-making office to open the process, suggesting Francis may be seeking to keep close tabs on the process and see it through quickly. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

AP PHOTOS: Holiday lights illuminate the world	Holiday lights are everywhere – and everywhere they look a little different. In recent weeks, Associated Press photographers have captured glistening scenes around the globe. In Jemez Springs, New Mexico, traditional luminarias, also known as farolitos, flickered through the Jemez Historic Site during last week’s annual Lights of Gisewa event. On the same day across the globe in Moscow, you could peer through a window of the Hotel Baltschug Kempinski out at St. Basil’s Cathedral and the GUM department store, bathed in lights for holiday festivities. And at the Johannesburg, South Africa zoo, actors in glowing, winged costumes welcomed visitors for the Christmas festival of lights. Few avenues anywhere in the world as as grand during the holidays as the Champs-Élysées in Paris, where hundreds of trees were recently lit up to resemble bubbly wine glasses — and will remain sparkling through the season. And in New York, the famed Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center stands majestic — a Norway spruce from small-town Massachusetts, adorned with 50,000 multi-colored lights. The giant tree is also topped with a Swarovski star crown featuring 3 million crystals. In Germany, a 42-meter-high bright red candle — actually an illuminated medieval tower – shone in the historic city center of Schlitz in late November. In Milan, Italy, it was a symphony in gold as people stood on a bridge and Christmas lights illuminated the Darsena dei Navigli, the neighborhood named for canals that run through the area. Reindeer figures sparkled in Hong Kong, part of waterfront Christmas decorations. And in Tokyo, people walked through a forest’s worth of glistening trees in Roppongi district, decorated with hundreds of thousands of blue LED lights. At Space Center Houston, a child hopped among colored circles, part of space-themed holiday lights, near a replica of the shuttle Independence. Illuminated angels spread their wings over Regent Street in London, thanks to hundreds of thousands of LED lights on the busy shopping street. And sometimes, nature does the trick herself. That’s what happened when a supermoon rose last month in Santiago, Chile, framed perfectly by star-shaped holiday street lights.	https://apnews.com/article/holiday-lights-world-photo-gallery-f3bab9c5c7b9cfeb43a126a6d84d7cc3	2024-12-21T05:07:52-08:00	
38 people die in a crash between a passenger bus and a truck in Brazil	SAO PAULO (AP) — A crash between a passenger bus and a truck early Saturday killed 38 people on a highway in Minas Gerais, a state in southeastern Brazil, officials said. The Minas Gerais fire department, which responded to the scene, said 13 others were taken to hospitals near the city of Teofilo Otoni. The bus had reportedly departed from Sao Paulo and was carrying 45 passengers. Authorities said Saturday afternoon that all victims had been removed from the site and an investigation would determine the cause of the accident. Witnesses told rescue teams that the bus blew a tire, causing the driver to lose control and collide with a truck. Others said that a granite block hit the bus, the fire department added. A car with three passengers also collided with the bus, but all three survived. Gov. Romeu Zema wrote on X that he ordered 'full mobilization' of the Minas Gerais government to assist the victims. 'We are working to ensure that families of the victims are supported to face this tragedy in the most humane way possible, especially as it comes just before Christmas,' Zema said. Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in a statement Saturday that federal officials were at Minas Gerais state disposal. 'I deeply regret and send my prayers to the families of the more than 30 fatalities from the accident in Teófilo Otoni, Minas Gerais. I pray for the recovery of the survivors of this terrible tragedy,' Lula said. In 2024, more than 10,000 people died in traffic accidents in Brazil, according to the Ministry of Transportation. In September, a bus carrying a football team flipped on a road and killed three people. The Coritiba Crocodiles, a team from the southern Brazilian city of Curitiba, was headed to a game in Rio de Janeiro, where they were set to play in the country’s American football championship. The game was canceled following the deadly accident. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-minas-gerais-bus-crash-b521a7fc2626f6b1faaa177d8b8c0fdd	2024-12-21T04:55:30-08:00	
German Christmas market ramming is the latest attack to use vehicles as deadly weapons	LONDON (AP) — A car-ramming at a Christmas market in Germany, which police are treating as an attack, is the latest in a grim series of events in which vehicles have been used as deadly weapons. There have been a spate of such attacks over the past decade, some committed by groups but most by individuals. The motives – where they could be established – have varied widely. Some were inspired by Islamic militant groups such as al-Qaida and ISIS, which encouraged followers to carry out low-cost, low-tech attacks with cars and trucks. Others have been linked to mental illness, far-right extremism and online misogyny. What law-enforcement authorities term 'vehicle as a weapon attacks' have reshaped cities around the world, as planners erect concrete barriers around public spaces and build anti-vehicle obstacles into new developments. Here are some major vehicle attacks: MAGDEBURG, Germany, Dec. 20. 2024 — At least five people are killed and more than 200 injured when a car slams into a Christmas market in eastern Germany. The suspect, who was arrested, is a 50-year-old doctor originally from Saudi Arabia who had expressed anti-Muslim views and support for the far-right AFD party. ZHUHAI, China, Nov. 11, 2024 — A 62-year-old driver rams his car into people exercising at a sports complex in southern China, killing 35 people in the country’s deadliest mass slaying in years. Authorities said the perpetrator was upset about his divorce but offered few other details. LONDON, Ontario, June 6, 2021 — Four members of a Muslim family die when an attacker hits them with a pickup truck while they are out for a walk, in what Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calls 'a terrorist attack, motivated by hatred.' White nationalist attacker Nathaniel Veltman was sentenced to life in prison. TORONTO, April 23, 2018 — A 25-year-old Canadian man, Alek Minassian, drives a rented van into mostly female pedestrians on Yonge St., the main thoroughfare in Toronto, killing 10 people and injuring 16. Minassian told police he belonged to the online 'incel' community of sexually frustrated men. NEW YORK, Oct. 31, 2017 — Sayfullo Saipov, an Islamic extremist from Uzbekistan, drives a pickup truck onto a popular New York City bike path, killing eight. BARCELONA, Aug. 17, 2017 — A man driving a van slams into people on the Spanish city’s crowded Las Ramblas boulevard, killing 14 and injuring many others. Several members of the same cell carry out a similar vehicle attack in the nearby resort town of Cambrils before they are shot dead by police. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. CHARLOTTESVILLE, Virginia, Aug. 12, 2017 — During a 'Unite the Right' rally, white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. intentionally drives his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one woman and injuring dozens of people. LONDON: March 22, 2017 — British man Khalid Masood rams an SUV into people on Westminster Bridge, killing four, before stabbing to death a policeman guarding the Houses of Parliament nearby. He is shot dead. June 3, 2017 — three attackers drive a van at pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in nearby Borough Market. Eight people are killed and the attackers shot dead by police.

In a calendar rarity, Hanukkah starts this year on Christmas Day	Hanukkah, Judaism’s eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day, which has only happened four times since 1900. For some rabbis, the intersection of the two religious holidays provides an auspicious occasion for interfaith engagement. 'This can be a profound opportunity for learning and collaboration and togetherness,' said Rabbi Josh Stanton, a vice president of the Jewish Federations of North America. He oversees interfaith initiatives involving the 146 local and regional Jewish federations that his organization represents. 'The goal is not proselytizing; it's learning deeply from each other,' he said. 'It’s others seeing you as you see yourself.' One example of togetherness: a Chicanukah party hosted Thursday evening by several Jewish organizations in Houston, bringing together members of the city’s Latino and Jewish communities for a 'cross cultural holiday celebration.' The venue: Houston’s Holocaust museum. The food on offer was a blend of the two cultures — for example a latke bar featuring guacamole, chili con queso and pico de gallo, as well as applesauce and sour cream. The doughnut-like pastries were sufganiyot — a Hanukkah specialty — and buñuelos, And the mariachi band took a crack at playing the Jewish folk song 'Hava Nagila.' 'What really brings us together is our shared values — our faith, our families, our heritage,' said Erica Winsor, public affairs officer for the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston. Rabbi Peter Tarlow, executive director of the Houston-based Center for Latino-Jewish Relations, said the first Chicanukah event 12 years ago drew 20 people, while this year the crowd numbered about 300, and could have been larger had not attendance been capped. He said the party-goers were a roughly even mix of Latinos — some of them Jews with Latin American origins — and 'Anglo' Jews. 'There’s too much hate, too much separation against both Jews and Latinos,' Tarlow said. 'This is a way we can come together and show we support each other.' While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it’s taking place this year amid continuing conflicts involving Israeli forces in the Middle East, and apprehension over widespread incidents of antisemitism. Rabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, acknowledged that many Jews may be feeling anxious heading into Hanukkah this year. But he voiced confidence that most would maintain the key tradition: the lighting of candles on menorah candelabras and displaying where they’re visible through household windows and in public spaces. 'The posture of our community — without stridency, just with determination — is that the menorah should be in our windows, in a place where the public sees it,' Hauer said. 'It is less for us, the Jewish community, than for the world,' he added. 'We have to share that light. Putting the menorah in the window is our expression of working to be a light among the nations.' Hauer concurred with Stanton that this year’s overlap of Hanukkah and Christmas is 'an exceptional opportunity to see and experience the diversity of America and the diversity of its communities of faith.' Rabbi Motti Seligson, public relations director for the Hasidic movement Chabad-Lubavitch, noted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of a milestone in the public lightings of menorahs. It was on Dec. 8, 1974 — as part of an initiative launched by the Lubavitcher leader, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson — that a menorah was lit outside Philadelphia’s Independence Hall, where the Liberty Bell was housed at the time. 'Hanukkah is a celebration of religious liberty, so that it’s not taken for granted,' Seligson said. 'One of the ways of doing that is by celebrating it publicly.' He said Chabad was organizing about 15,000 public menorah lightings this year through its numerous branches around the world. 'There certainly is some apprehension,' Seligson said, referring to concerns about antisemitism and political friction. 'Some people question whether Jews will be celebrating as openly as in the past.' 'What I’m hearing is there’s no way that we can’t,' he added. 'The only way through these difficult times is by standing stronger and prouder and shining brighter than ever.' Stanton concurred. 'Through our history, we’ve been through moments that are easy and moments that are hard,' he said. 'Safety for us does not come from hiding. It comes from reaching out.' Why is Hanukkah so late this year? The simple answer is that the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles, and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. Hanukkah always begins on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev, a date which occurs between late November and late December on the Gregorian calendar. The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005. But the term 'Chrismukkah' — signifying the overlap of the two holidays — had become a popular term before then. The term gained extra currency in 2003, when the character Seth Cohen on the TV drama 'The O.C.' embraced the fusion holiday as a tribute to his Jewish father and Protestant mother. This season, the Hallmark Channel introduced a new Christmas movie called 'Leah’s Perfect Gift,' depicting a young Jewish woman who had admired Christmas from a distance, and gets a chance to experience it up close when her boyfriend invites her to spend the holidays with his family. Spoiler alert: All does not go smoothly. Despite such storylines suggesting a fascination with Christmas among some Jews, Stanton says research by the Jewish Federations reveals a surge in Jews seeking deeper connections to their own traditions and community, as well as a surge in Jews volunteering for charitable activities during the holidays. 'The opportunity is to share with others how we celebrate Hanukkah,' he said. 'It’s a holiday of freedom, hope, showing proudly you are Jewish.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

13 people including children die in stampedes in Nigeria at Christmas charity events	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — At least 13 people, including four children, were killed in two separate stampedes in Nigeria as large crowds gathered to collect food and clothing items distributed at annual Christmas events, the police said Saturday. The two accidents came days after another such stampede in Africa’s most populous country, amid a growing trend by local organizations, churches and individuals to organize charity events ahead of Christmas, as the country struggles with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. Ten people were killed in the first stampede in the early hours at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Maitama, an upmarket part of the capital, Abuja, police spokesman Josephine Adeh said in a statement, adding that more than 1,000 people have been evacuated from the church. There was a crowd surge at one of the church gates, as dozens tried to enter the premises at around 4 a.m., hours before the gift items were to be shared, witnesses said, pointing out that some had been waiting since the previous night. 'The way they were rushing to enter, some people were falling and some of them were old,' Loveth Inyang, a witness. Inyang said he managed to rescue one baby as his mother struggled in the surge. Three people died in a similar crush later in the southeastern Anambra state's Okija town at a charity event organized by a philanthropist, the state police said. 'The event had not even started when the rush began,' police spokesman Tochukwu Ikenga said. There could be more deaths recorded as officers investigate the incident, he said. Viral footage that appeared to be from the Abuja scene showed lifeless bodies lying on the ground as people shouted for help. Some of the injured have been treated and discharged while others continue to receive medical care, police said. The church canceled the charity event with bags of rice and clothing items still arranged within the premises. As the church held a marriage ceremony after the crowd was evacuated, the agony and sadness remained palpable even as families and friends gathered for wedding pictures. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu expressed his sympathy with the victims' families and asked states and relevant authorities to enforce strict crowd control measures. The recent stampedes in Nigeria have raised questions about safety measures in such events. Several children were killed on Wednesday this week when a local foundation organized a well-attended funfair to distribute gift items and food to kids in southwestern Oyo state. After the latest disaster, the police in Abuja announced that prior permission must be obtained before such charity events are organized. The current economic hardship under Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who promised 'renewed hope' when he was sworn into office in May 2023, is blamed on surging inflation that is at a 28-year high and the government’s economic policies that have pushed the local currency to record low against the dollar. Frustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot dead and hundreds of others were arrested at protests demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-stampede-christmas-406a2e4839c579ed07462a7780de9c42	2024-12-21T04:36:40-08:00	
What to know about Hanukkah and how it's celebrated around the world	Hanukkah — also spelled Chanukah or other transliterations from Hebrew — is Judaism’s 'festival of lights.' On eight consecutive nightfalls, Jews gather with family and friends to light one additional candle in the menorah — a multibranched candelabra. In Hebrew, Hanukkah means 'dedication,' and the holiday marks the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the 2nd century BC, after a small group of Jewish fighters liberated it from occupying foreign forces. With the tiny supply of ritually pure oil that they found in the temple, they lit the menorah — and it stayed lit for eight days. The ritual of lighting a nightly candle, as well as the emphasis on cooking foods in oil such as potato pancakes called latkes, memorialize this miraculously long-lasting oil. When is Hanukkah 2024? The dates of the holiday are based on Hebrew month of Kislev, which usually coincides with November-December in the Gregorian calendar. This year, Hanukkah will be celebrated from Dec. 25, 2024, through Jan. 2, 2025. It's only the fifth time since 1900 that Hanukkah has fallen on Christmas Day. Why is Hanukkah so late this year? The simple answer is that the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles, and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. Hanukkah always begins on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev, a date which occurs between late November and late December on the Gregorian calendar. Does Hanukkah observance vary? Jews across the religious observance spectrum — from Reform to Conservative to Orthodox — focus on the same theme of bringing light into the darkness and emphasizing that even a small, against-the-odds effort can have a transforming effect. For this reason, even though the Talmud reflects a dispute over the order of lighting, most start with one candle and increase the lighting by one more candle each night while reciting or chanting special blessings. The candles are added from right to left, but lit from left to right on the menorah, thus always starting with the newest light. The special menorah used for Hanukkah has eight branches, with a ninth place for the candle called shamash from which all others are lit. The tradition calls for candles with a real flame, though some also use electric ones in public displays, such as in hospitals, for safety reasons. How is Hanukkah celebrated? A menorah is lit in each household and traditionally is placed where it can be seen from the outside, such as a doorway or windowsill, to symbolize the spreading of God’s light to all nations. The lighting of menorahs in city streets and parks has become more prominent in recent years in countries around the world, including in front of public landmarks. In addition to menorah lightings, giving to charity and social works are also part of the celebration for many, reflecting the belief that the Jewish people are called by God to help make the world better for all. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

France's Mayotte struggles to recover as cyclone overwhelms hospitals	MAMOUDZOU, Mayotte (AP) — A week after its worst cyclone in nearly a century, France’s impoverished Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte is still grappling to count the dead, restore essential services and aid a beleaguered population. Already stretched thin, hospitals are overwhelmed with patients suffering not only from cyclone-related injuries but dehydration, malnutrition and disease. At Mayotte’s main hospital in the capital, Mamoudzou, doctors face a cascade of crises. 'We lost 40% of patient rooms, about 50 to 60 beds,' said Dr. Roger Serhal, chief of the obstetrics and gynecology department. 'There are so many patients coming to the hospital, and we don’t have space to admit them.' As Cyclone Chido battered the archipelago last weekend and 220 kph (136 mph) winds howled around the hospital, Serhal and his team delivered three babies, including by cesarean section. The hospital’s structural damage has forced staff to triage patients, prioritizing the most severe cases. Thirty-five people have been confirmed dead as of Friday in Mayotte but French Health Minister Geneviève Darrieussecq has warned that any estimates were likely major undercounts 'compared to the scale of the disaster.' The storm has devastated entire neighborhoods and many people had ignored warnings, thinking the storm wouldn’t be so extreme. Even worse, many migrants avoided shelters out of fear of deportation, authorities said, adding there could be hundreds or possibly thousands of fatalities. Doctors fear that the lack of clean water and electricity — compounded by overcrowded living conditions — is setting the stage for a health crisis. 'Patients are coming because their illnesses are untreated, there’s no water, and no electricity. We’re concerned about epidemics, like the cholera outbreak we stopped just months ago,' said Dr. Vincent Gilles, the hospital’s emergency medical director. The hospital staff continues to work tirelessly, but resources are running dangerously low. 'If we have rain,' Serhal added, 'it will be catastrophic.' Among the patients struggling to recover was Saindou Mohamadi, 54, who fractured his arm and sprained his ankle during the storm that left his home completely destroyed. Speaking from his hospital bed, Mohamadi expressed despair for his family. 'My mother is sick, I’m sick, and my child is sick,' he said. 'They need to eat, but I’m the one who takes care of the food, and now we have nothing.' With six children to support, Mohamadi is among countless residents left homeless and destitute. 'I’m not alone,' he said. 'There are many of us who have lost everything — our houses, our food. I want the government to care about us, to give us food and a place to sleep.' Mayotte is a densely populated archipelago between Madagascar and the African continent of more than 320,000 people, but authorities have estimated another 100,000 migrants live there from as far away as Somalia. France’s poorest overseas territory long struggled with systemic neglect and underinvestment. Around 75% of its population lives in poverty, and the archipelago’s infrastructure was ill-equipped to withstand a disaster of this magnitude. Chido’s destruction has compounded these challenges, leaving many residents with little faith in the government’s ability to provide timely and adequate relief. Efforts to deliver emergency aid, including airlifts of water and food, are underway but the scale of the need is staggering. Mayotte’s airport remains closed to civilian flights due to damage, further complicating logistics. French President Emmanuel Macron, during his visit on Friday, acknowledged the gravity of the situation and pledged to rebuild but faced criticism from residents frustrated by the slow pace of aid. France's Interior Ministry estimated that 70% of the population has been gravely affected, with many left homeless and vulnerable. ___ Adamson reported from Paris.	https://apnews.com/article/france-mayotte-cyclone-hospitals-284271ed0dcf66626533df49e9dfb23f	2024-12-21T02:25:11-08:00	
Cyprus can help rid Syria of chemical weapons and search for its missing, Cypriot top diplomat says	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cyprus stands ready to help eliminate Syria’s remaining chemical weapons stockpiles and to support a search for people whose fate remains unknown after more than a decade of war, the top Cypriot diplomat said Saturday. Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos said Cyprus’ offer is grounded on its own past experience both with helping rid Syria of chemical weapons 11 years ago and its own ongoing, decades-old search for hundreds of people who disappeared amid fighting between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriots in the 1960s and a 1974 Turkish invasion. Cyprus in 2013 hosted the support base of a mission jointly run by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to remove and dispose of Syria's chemical weapons. 'As a neighboring country located just 65 miles from Syria, Cyprus has a vested interest in Syria’s future. Developments there will directly impact Cyprus, particularly in terms of potential new migratory flows and the risks of terrorism and extremism,' Kombos told The Associated Press in written replies to questions. Kombos said there are 'profound concerns' among his counterparts across the region over Syria’s future security, especially regarding a possible resurgence of extremist groups like Islamic State in a fragmented and polarized society. Other challenges include new migratory flows from the country as well as ensuring the safety and rights of women and minorities including Druze, Christians, Jews and Kurds, so that the 'rich mosaic of Syria is preserved.' 'This is particularly critical in light of potential social and demographic engineering disguised as 'security' arrangements, which could further destabilize the country,' Kombos said. The diplomat also pointed to the recent proliferation of narcotics production like the stimulant Captagon that is interconnected with smuggling networks involved in people and arms trafficking. Kombos said ongoing attacks against Syria’s Kurds must stop immediately, given the role that Kurdish forces have played in combating extremist forces like the IS group in the past decade. A Syrian-led process transitioning the country to an inclusive democracy should integrate the Kurds’ 'legitimate asks' while safeguarding the country’s unity and territorial integrity. Saleh Muslim, a member of the Kurdish Presidential Council, said in an interview that the Kurds primarily seek 'equality' enshrined in rights accorded to all in any democracy. He said a future form of governance could accord autonomy to the Kurds under some kind of federal structure. 'But the important thing is to have democratic rights for all the Syrians and including the Kurdish people,' he said. Muslim warned that the Kurdish-majority city of Kobani, near Syria’s border with Turkey, is in 'very big danger' of falling into the hands of Turkish-backed forces, and accused Turkey of trying to occupy it. Kombos said the international community needs to ensure that the influence Turkey is trying to exert in Syria is 'not going to create an even worse situation than there already is.' 'Whatever the future landscape in Syria, it will have a direct and far-reaching impact on the region, the European Union and the broader international community,' Kombos said.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-syria-chemical-weapons-missing-35f2f3eee23785b25d01bb016ed2720d	2024-12-21T01:24:59-08:00	
Ukrainian drones strike deep into Russian territory, hundreds of miles from the front line	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine brought the war into the heart of Russia Saturday morning with drone attacks that local authorities said damaged residential buildings in the city of Kazan in the Tatarstan region, over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the front line. The press service of Tatarstan's governor, Rustam Minnikhanov, said that eight drones attacked the city. Six hit residential buildings, one hit an industrial facility and one was shot down over a river, the statement said. A video posted on local Telegram news channel Astra, verified by The Associated Press, shows a drone flying into the upper floors of a high-rise building. Local authorities said there were no casualties. Flights were halted at Kazan’s airport and all mass gatherings canceled on Saturday and Sunday. The attacks, which Ukraine didn’t acknowledge in keeping with its security policy, comes after a Ukrainian attack Friday on a town in Russia’s Kursk border region using U.S.-supplied missiles killed six people, including a child. Moscow sent 113 drones into Ukraine overnight into Saturday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine’s Air Force, 57 drones were shot down during the attacks. A further 56 drones were 'lost,' likely having been electronically jammed. The governor of Ukraine's Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, said eight people were wounded Friday night in drone attacks on the regional capital, also called Kharkiv.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kazan-d235822b758fd4f3540270bc324a7b77	2024-12-20T23:30:09-08:00	
A rocket fired from Yemen strikes an area of Tel Aviv overnight, lightly injuring 16 people	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — A rocket fired from Yemen hit an area of Tel Aviv overnight, leaving 16 people slightly injured by shattered glass from nearby windows, the Israeli military said Saturday. A further 14 people sustained minor injuries as they rushed to shelters when air raid sirens sounded before the projectile hit just before 4 a.m. Saturday, the military said. The Houthis later issued a statement on their Telegram channel saying they had aimed at a military target, which they did not identify, with a hypersonic ballistic missile. The attack comes less than two days after a series of Israeli airstrikes on Yemen’s Houthi rebel-held capital, Sanaa, and port city of Hodeida killed at least nine people. The Israeli strikes were in response to a Houthi attack in which a long-range missile hit an Israeli school building. The Houthis also claimed a drone strike targeting an unspecified military target in central Israel on Thursday. The Israeli military says the Iran-backed Houthis have launched more than 200 missiles and drones during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Houthis have also been attacking shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden — attacks they say won’t stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. The Israeli strikes Thursday caused 'considerable damage' to the Houthi-controlled Red Sea ports 'that will lead to the immediate and significant reduction in port capacity,' United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. The port at Hodeida has been key for food shipments into Yemen in its decade-long civil war. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said both sides’ attacks risk further escalation in the region and undermine U.N. mediation efforts. Israeli strikes in Gaza claim more lives In the Gaza Strip on Saturday, mourners held the funerals of 19 people — 12 of them children — killed in Israeli strikes on Friday and overnight. One strike Friday afternoon hit a residential building in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least seven Palestinians, including five children and one woman, and injuring 16 others, health officials said. In Gaza City, an Israeli strike on a house overnight killed 12 people, including seven children and two women, according to Ahli hospital where the bodies were taken. Mourners gathered at the hospital in Gaza City Saturday morning. Women comforted each other as they wept over the bodies before they were carried out of the hospital. One man, stony-faced, cradled a tiny shroud-wrapped body in his arms as he carried it along the funeral procession. In the Aqsa hospital of Deir al Balah, white body bags containing those killed in Nuseirat were taken from the hospital morgue and loaded onto the back of an open truck to be taken for burial. Israel faces heavy international criticism over the unprecedented levels of civilian casualties in Gaza and questions about whether it has done enough to prevent them. Israel says it only strikes militants, and blames the Hamas militant group for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in residential areas. More than 45,200 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since October 2023, when a Hamas attack in Israel killed about 1,200 people and triggered the devastating 14-month war in Gaza. Local health officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but have said more than half of the fatalities are women and children.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-yemen-mideast-bffc2f7ae556942e2e6760720d63038c	2024-12-20T22:39:32-08:00	
Germans mourn attack on Christmas market with no answers about why	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — Germans on Saturday mourned a violent attack and their shaken sense of security after a Saudi doctor intentionally drove a black BMW into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers, killing at least two people, including a small child, and injuring at least 60 others. Authorities arrested a 50-year-old man at the site of the attack Friday evening and took him into custody for questioning. He has lived in Germany for nearly two decades, practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg. officials said. Several German media outlets identified the man as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Mourners lit candles and placed flowers outside a church near the market on the cold and gloomy day. Several people stopped and cried. A Berlin church choir whose members witnessed the 2016 Christmas market attack sang Amazing Grace, a hymn about God's mercy, offering their prayers and solidarity with the victims. The man behind the attack There were still no answers Saturday as to what caused him to drive into a crowd in the eastern German city of Magdeburg. Describing himself as a former Muslim, the suspect shared dozens of tweets and retweets daily focusing on anti-Islam themes, criticizing the religion and congratulating Muslims who left the faith. He also accused German authorities of failing to do enough to combat what he said was the 'Islamism of Europe.' Some described him as an activist who helped Saudi women flee their homeland. He has also voiced support for the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Recently, he seemed focused on his theory that German authorities have been targeting Saudi asylum seekers. Prominent German terrorism expert Peter Neumann said he had yet to come across a suspect in an act of mass violence with that profile. 'After 25 years in this ‘business’ you think nothing could surprise you anymore. But a 50-year-old Saudi ex-Muslim who lives in East Germany, loves the AfD and wants to punish Germany for its tolerance towards Islamists — that really wasn’t on my radar, ' Neumann, the director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King’s College London, wrote on X. The two people confirmed dead were an adult and a toddler, but officials said additional deaths couldn’t be ruled out because 15 people had been seriously injured. 'As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,' Saxony-Anhalt’s governor, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters. 'Every human life that has fallen victim to this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many.' Magdeburg is still shaken The violence shocked Germany and the city, bringing its mayor to the verge of tears and marring a festive event that’s part of a centuries-old German tradition. It prompted several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution and out of solidarity with Magdeburg’s loss. Berlin kept its markets open but has increased its police presence at them. Germany has suffered a string of extremist attacks in recent years, including a knife attack that killed three people and wounded eight at a festival in the western city of Solingen in August. Magdeburg is a city of about 240,000 people, west of Berlin, that serves as Saxony-Anhalt’s capital. Friday’s attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Interior Minister Nancy Faeser traveled to Magdeburg on Saturday, and a memorial service is to take place in the city cathedral in the evening. A recount of the horrifying attack Verified bystander footage distributed by the German news agency dpa showed the suspect’s arrest at a tram stop in the middle of the road. A nearby police officer pointing a handgun at the man shouted at him as he lay prone, his head arched up slightly. Other officers swarmed around the suspect and took him into custody. Thi Linh Chi Nguyen, a 34-year-old manicurist from Vietnam whose salon is located in a mall across from the Christmas market, was on the phone during a break when she heard loud bangs and thought at first they were fireworks. She then saw a car drive through the market at high speed. People screamed and a child was thrown into the air by the car. Shaking as she described the horror of what she witnessed, she recalled seeing the car bursting out of the market and turning right onto Ernst-Reuter-Allee street and then coming to a standstill at the tram stop where the suspect was arrested. The number of injured people was overwhelming. 'My husband and I helped them for two hours. He ran back home and grabbed as many blankets as he could find because they didn’t have enough to cover the injured people. And it was so cold,' she said. The market itself was still cordoned off Saturday with red-and-white tape and police vans every 50 meters (about 54 yards). Police with machine pistols guarded every entry to the market. Some thermal security blankets still lay on the street. Christmas markets are a German holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages, now successfully exported to much of the Western world. Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry condemned the attack on X. ___ Aboubakr reported from Cairo and Gera from Warsaw, Poland.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-christmas-market-attack-magdeburg-32ec923f21cccb2a34e287da42ced921	2024-12-20T22:18:27-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Scenes of devastation from the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami	On Dec. 26, 2004, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the west coast of Sumatra, causing a massive wave that devastated Asian coastal communities across thousands of miles. Some 230,000 people died as the tsunami leveled remote villages, ports and tourist resorts in Indonesia, Thailand, India and Sri Lanka, among other countries. Ahead of the 20th anniversary of a disaster that's still vividly remembered in the region, here's a look back at the aftermath. In these photos, a resident of a fishing village in India's Tamil Nadu state contemplates the remains of her house as fires continue to burn in her village. In Thailand, dozens of bodies are lined up at a Buddhist temple, and a young Swedish boy carries a sign listing family members he hasn't seen since they were swept out to sea from their beachfront hotel. In Sri Lanka, villagers search for the dead among derailed train cars, lighting fires to cremate those they find. And in Aceh, Indonesia, the worst-hit area nearest the quake's epicenter, people search for survivors and food in towns that have been largely reduced to rubble. Today, many coastal communities have rebuilt, and new early warning systems are in place that could give people time to get to shelter. But the true toll of these events will never be known for certain.	https://apnews.com/article/indian-ocean-tsunami-anniversary-photo-gallery-65a5fdaeed08d68336523e7e4a4835a2	2024-12-20T20:01:20-08:00	
Sectarian violence in Syria has been less intense than feared since Assad's ouster	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The toppling of Bashar Assad has raised tentative hopes that Syrians might live peacefully and as equals after a half century of authoritarian rule. While there have been bursts of deadly sectarian violence in the days since Assad was ousted, it’s nothing close to what was feared after nearly 14 years of civil war. Much credit for the relative calm so far is being given to the Islamic militant group that led the insurgency against Assad and is helping to rebuild the country and unite its many factions. The group — Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS — had ties to al-Qaida, but it has vowed not to discriminate against any religion or ethnicity, and it has denounced revenge killings. In the days since Assad’s fall, dozens of Syrians have been killed in acts of revenge, according to activists and experts who monitor Syria. The vast majority have been from the minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shia Islam that the Assad family adheres to. Given the key role Alawites played in Assad's brutally repressive government, experts had expected sectarian violence to be more widespread. But HTS has worked to reduce tensions in villages where revenge killings — as well as looting and harassment — have taken place, according to local activists. Whether peace and pluralism will prevail longer-term remains to be seen, experts caution. 'The extent of the reprisals has been quite limited,' said Hilal Khashan, a political science professor at the American University of Beirut. 'We hope this violence will not escalate, leading to an outburst of civil strife.' During the Assad family’s 50 years of iron-fisted rule, Alawites held many top positions in the military and in the intelligence and security services, which ran prisons where thousands of people accused of anti-government activities were tortured and killed, according to human rights groups. The interim government led by HTS has vowed to gather evidence and hold trials in a special court against former officials who oversaw, or worked in, Assad's notorious prisons. It has also promised amnesty for other government workers and former members of the military, some of whom have started handing in their weapons. 'If we want to establish social peace there must be justice, and there is no justice without accountability,' said Obeida Arnaout, a spokesman for the interim government. 'Those who have blood on their hands will get no amnesty.' The interim government has urged reconciliation among the country’s different ethnic factions — mainly Arabs and Kurds — and mutual respect among its religious groups. Three-quarters of Syria's 23 million citizens are Sunnis, one-tenth are Alawites, and the rest are a mix of Christians, Ismaili Shiites and Druze. Under Assad, Syrians enjoyed religious and other freedoms. Men and women mingled freely at beaches and other public places; restaurants served alcoholic beverages; and women held senior posts in government. Now that power resides in the hands of HTS, many Syrians — as well as Western governments and human rights groups — are concerned the country could be transformed into a theocracy. So far, the HTS-led coalition has not imposed any strict religious rules, such as forcing women to wear veils, and it has allowed journalists from around the world to report freely. Over years of control in the northwest Syrian province of Idlib, HTS allowed Christians and Druze to practice without interference. HTS is led by a former al-Qaida member who has renounced extremism and spent years working to remake his public image, depicting himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. Still, the United States, other Western countries and the U.N. still consider HTS a terrorist organization — a branch of al-Qaida in Syria, but with a different name. One of the top priorities of HTS and its leader – Ahmad al-Sharaa -- is to get the terror designation removed, which could then lead to economic sanctions against Syria being lifted. U.S. officials say al-Sharaa’s public statements about protecting minority and women’s rights are welcomed. But they are skeptical he will follow through on them in the long run. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last weekend that the U.S. is in contact with HTS and that its 'message to the Syrian people is this: We want them to succeed and we’re prepared to help them do so.' Since Assad fled the country, at least 72 men and women have been killed in sectarian violence, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor based in Britain. It says the killings occurred in four religiously mixed provinces — Hama and Homs in central Syria, and Tartus and Latakia along its eastern coast. Gunmen stormed the village of Bahra in Hama province on Dec. 9, and killed a dozen Alawites over three days — eight of whom were from the same family, according to a resident of the village who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals. In nearby Mouaa, six men were killed, and in Um al-Amad, a man and his son were shot dead, the resident of Bahra said. The three villages are now almost empty after the most residents fled to the Alawite heartland, in the coastal province of Tartus, the Bahra resident said. 'The reason why I am speaking is to try stop the killings,' he said. In the Assad stronghold of Masyaf, gunmen last week kidnapped Muhieddine al-Haybe, the brother of a Shiite cleric who fled the town in Hama province shortly after the fall of Assad’s government, according to an anti-Assad activist who would only provide his first name, Hussein, out of concern for his safety. He said al-Haybe's body and three other unidentified dead bodies were later found near a military post. A third person from the area said the situation was tense for days until HTS hosted a meeting over the weekend that brought together Sunni and Alawite dignitaries from nearby villages, including Rabia, Tizin, Metnine and Mouaa. By the end of the meeting, the participants reconciled and agreed to end any acts of violence, according to this person, who is Alawite and insisted on anonymity out of fear. 'We were also the victims of the regime,' the person said, adding that the Assad government did not offer civilian jobs to Alawites, which put pressure on them to join the military and security services. The man said his house was looted and his six cows were stolen. There have been reports of al-Sharaa himself trying to keep the peace among Syria’s many factions. Syrian media reported that he met in Damascus on Monday with a delegation from the Druze community and told them that his goal was to unite Syria and create a free society. Some Syrians say there might have been more sectarian violence in the aftermath of Assad's ouster had his forces mounted a serious fight against HTS and other militants behind the insurgency. Instead, Assad's army essentially melted away and chose not to defend his government. 'We are witnessing some sectarian incidents, but they are all individuals acts,' said Rayan Maarouf, an anti-Assad activist who is a member of Syria's Druze minority in the southern city of Sweida. ___ Associated Press writer Sarah El Deeb contributed from Damascus.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-religion-revenge-killings-peace-alawites-6fef01639ed9833f9421c1a88abc61cf	2024-12-20T20:00:05-08:00	
Indonesians mark 2 decades since the tragic tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands	BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) — Two decades after a catastrophic tsunami destroyed her village, Tria Asnani still cries when she recalls how she lost her mother while trying to escape the giant waves. Asnani, now a school teacher, was only 17 at the time. Her father, who was a fisherman, never returned home from sea. She doesn't know how she survived. 'I cannot swim. I could only rely on dhikr (Islamic prayer).' On Dec. 26, 2004, a powerful 9.1-magnitude earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa. But Indonesia’s Aceh province, located closest to the earthquake’s epicenter and with 18 of 23 districts and cities located in the coastal line in the Northern side of Sumatra, bore the brunt of the disaster with more than half of the total death toll reported. The worst-hit areas were in Aceh Besar and Banda Aceh, according to the Aceh Disaster Management Agency. Asnani's Lampuuk village lies in a fishermen’s community in Aceh Besar, known for its white sandy beaches and turquoise waters. However, on that day, it was among the hardest hit, with waves more than 30 meters (98 feet) high which changed the coastline in Aceh and led to land subsidence after the earthquake. Buildings by the coast were flattened to the ground except for Rahmatullah Mosque, 500 meters (1,600 feet) from the shore, and about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from Asnani’s house. The photo of the place of worship, left pretty much unscathed, later became iconic. After the disastrous event, thousands, including Asnani, had to relocate to start afresh. She moved with her uncle to another region in Aceh to continue her studies. After she got married, she returned in 2007 to her parents' house which was rebuilt with assistance from the Turkish government and lived there for 10 years. Many international donors and organizations poured in money to help rebuild the affected areas that lost schools, hospitals and basic infrastructure, made stronger than before the tsunami hit. Tsunami and Disaster Mitigation Research Center at Syiah Kuala University in Aceh recorded more than 1,400 wrecked schools and about 150,000 students had their education process disrupted by the destructive waves in a report published in 2019. Three 'escape buildings' were also constructed in a relatively safer area to accommodate thousands of people if an earthquake and tsunami strike. Across the province, memories of the tsunami can be felt almost everywhere. The Aceh Tsunami Museum in Banda Aceh houses photos of the aftermath and vehicle debris, serving as a constant reminder of what was lost that day. Local authorities have also turned a former floating diesel-powered power plant barge that washed about 6 kilometers (about 4 miles) inland by the tsunami into another memorial place. Both places have become the most popular tourist destinations in the area. But development never stops and 20 years after the tsunami the Aceh coast is brimming with residential housing, cafes and restaurants, as well as tourism support facilities, while the hills in some areas from which people are currently being mined for sand and stone. Fazli, the head of Preparedness in Aceh Disaster Management Agency, said that the government initially stipulated that there should be no activity up to 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from the coast. Over time, many displaced fishermen returned to their original coastal homes, drawn by their livelihoods and ties to the sea, despite having received housing elsewhere. He also said the agency has 'provided the Acehnese people with information ' to deal with a potential tsunami. 'People already know what to do,' said Fazli, who, like other Indonesians, uses a single name. Siti Ikramatoun, a sociologist in Banda Aceh, said that despite years of recovery and rebuilding, the people of Aceh must stay vigilant. 'If people experienced (the tsunami), they may have an instinct to anticipate it. But those who do not have the experience, they won’t get what to do,' Ikramatoun said. Various communities in Aceh commemorate the tsunami yearly along with the government and local authorities. In Banda Aceh, art communities in early December spread disaster awareness through theatrical or musical performances that can be easier for people to follow and target all groups, including those born after the tsunami. Muslina, 43, a civil servant, took her youngest son to the Aceh Tsunami Museum to watch one of the shows. She lost relatives and loved ones 20 years ago and she wants to make sure she always remembers them. 'Earlier my son asked me if there might be another tsunami when he grows up,' she said. 'I told him I do not know. Only God knows, but if there is a strong earthquake and the seawater recedes, we run, run, run to find higher ground.'	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-aceh-indian-ocean-tsunami-earthquake-2004-d62f2c5590fb8427e97ffa1b81dc09d5	2024-12-20T17:07:53-08:00	
Guatemala authorities raid ultra-orthodox Jewish sect's compound after report of abuse	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Guatemalan authorities searched the compound of an extremist ultra-orthodox Jewish sect Friday, taking at least 160 minors and 40 women into protective custody after reports of abuse. Interior Minister Francisco Jiménez said the National Civil Police and members of military participated in the raid on the Lev Tahor group’s community about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southeast of the capital. 'The protection of boys and girls is an absolute priority,' Jiménez said. Guatemala’s Attorney General’s Office said in a statement on the social platform X that suspected bones of one child were found. The office said a complaint was made in November of possible crimes including forced pregnancies, mistreatment of minors and rape. The sect has run into legal problems in various countries. In 2022, Mexican authorities arrested a leader of the sect near the Guatemalan border and removed a number of women and children from their compound. In 2021, two leaders of the group were convicted of kidnapping and child sexual exploitation crimes in New York. They allegedly kidnapped two children from their mother to return a 14-year-old girl to an illegal sexual relationship with an adult male. The sect is known to have members in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Guatemala and Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/guatemala-lev-tahor-mexico-abuse-a9cf9d57fab3c71831efec23c9139a99	2024-12-20T15:02:00-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Cyclone Chido's devastation of Mayotte was immediate and decades coming	The devastation from Cyclone Chido that shattered corrugated metal shacks and thousands of lives on the island of Mayotte was both immediate and long coming. Residents of Mayotte, one of 12 tiny overseas territories remaining from one of the great global empires, have complained for decades of neglect by bureaucrats in France. Authorities have confirmed 35 deaths from Cyclone Chido’s landfall Sunday, but fear hundreds or thousands may be dead. The shacks of corrugated metal stood no chance in the Kaweni slum on the outskirts of the capital, Mamoudzou, where residents are still taking stock of their shattered lives. Mayotte, the poorest place in the European Union, has struggled to care for migrants from the nearby independent Comoros islands. They have been moving to Mayotte — the only part of the Comoros that voted to remain part of France in a 1974 referendum — and last year, the government mobilized 2,000 troops and police to carry out mass expulsions, destroy slums and eradicate gangs. This week, survivors lined up to collect water. Once among the island’s rare riches — with rivers and springs nestled between mountains and forests — water has grown scare as mismanagement and climate change have taken their toll. Mayotte has had its driest year since 1997, according to the national weather service. Even before Chico, indoor plumbing only worked from 4 p.m. to 10 a.m. once every three days on an island territory of about 350,000 people. Women rested Thursday on a footbridge over a stream filled with debris in the Kaweni slum after families rushed to prepare food, wash dishes, clean their homes and anything else involving water. Those living in neighborhoods without plumbing lined up at public taps with buckets, plastic jerrycans, reused bottles — anything to collect water. Then for 48 hours, they were dry again.	https://apnews.com/article/mayotte-cyclone-photos-dad1e05aea1ec1de518fec9b2b0fbef1	2024-12-20T13:40:15-08:00	
Oregon sheriff concerned about letters asking people to track possible immigrants	LINCOLN CITY, Ore. (AP) — A sheriff in Oregon says he has contacted the FBI and is increasingly concerned about a letter circulating in his rural, coastal community asking people to write down the license plate numbers of possible immigrants. The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office issued a news release on Thursday condemning the letters that have appeared across the county, describing them as divisive. Sheriff Curtis Landers told KPTV that he contacted federal authorities after receiving such a letter himself. The FBI said Friday it was aware of the mailings. In a statement, it encouraged community members who feel physically threatened to report their concerns to law enforcement. The letter tells the recipient to be on alert while sitting in their church parking lot or waiting in line to pick up their children at school, so as to write down the license plate numbers of cars believed to belong to immigrants who might lack permanent legal status. The sheriff's office said it was committed to upholding Oregon’s sanctuary law, which prohibits local police in most cases from inquiring about an individual’s immigration or citizenship status and sharing that information with federal authorities. 'We are encouraging our community members to do the right thing and use compassion as we encounter these types of messages,' the sheriff’s office said in its news release. 'We strongly advise against engaging in activities such as those outlined in this letter, including collecting or sharing information about individuals based on their demographic or perceived immigration status.' Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum similarly condemned the letters. 'Attempts to intimidate our communities and their leaders through racist letter writing campaigns has no place in Oregon, and we will continue to stand together in opposition to those who seek to divide us,' she said in a statement Friday. The Associated Press emailed the sheriff’s office on Friday, requesting comment and asking about the number and distribution method of the letters. When reached by phone, the sheriff’s office said Landers and its spokesperson were both out of the office and unable to respond to calls or emails that day. Landers received a copy of the letter in his mailbox, according to KPTV. Elsewhere in the county, the mayor and city councilors of the small town of Toledo and the mayor of Lincoln City also received copies in the mail, KGW reported. In response to Trump’s vows to conduct mass deportations during his second term, advocacy groups across the country have hosted know-your-rights trainings to teach immigrants how to protect themselves and their loved ones. The trainings are underway in immigrant-friendly states including California and Illinois — which both enacted protections for immigrants in response to Trump’s focus on enforcement during his first administration — and those with more stringent laws affecting immigrants such as Florida. Meanwhile, officials in a growing number of Republican-led states are proposing to give local law officers the power to arrest people who entered the country illegally, mirroring recent laws in Texas and elsewhere that have been placed on hold while courts weigh whether they unconstitutionally usurp federal authority. Oregon became the first sanctuary state in 1987. Its law bars local and state police from participating in federal immigration enforcement without a judicial warrant, and also prohibits private immigration detention facilities from operating in the state. Oregon's sanctuary law has been updated and strengthened over the years, including in 2021, when the Legislature passed a measure creating a hotline for reporting violations of the law.	https://apnews.com/article/immigration-undocumented-letters-lincoln-city-oregon-01d1f737e8e47f56014f25d6bfaf3a4c	2024-12-20T13:13:48-08:00	
Regional court faults El Salvador for denying a mother's access to abortion, violating her rights	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — The Inter-American Court of Human Rights on Friday found El Salvador’s government responsible for violating the rights of a young Salvadoran woman who was denied an abortion of her anencephalic fetus in a country with a total ban on abortions. The Costa Rica-based regional court said the government was responsible for obstetric violence, health violations and violating the physical integrity of the woman who had other health issues. The court faulted a lack of protocols for high-risk pregnancies that led to her care being 'bureaucratized and judicialized' in 2013. The woman, identified only as Beatriz, had requested and was denied an abortion early in her pregnancy. The fetus died hours after delivery. The case had been brought by various organizations that demanded reparations for the woman’s family. She died after a traffic accident in 2017. El Salvador’s government had argued that the medical team had autonomy to decide the best course of treatment and to preserve the life of the fetus. The court ordered El Salvador to pay damages amounting to $75,000 to be divided among some of Beatriz’s relatives, including her surviving son. The 2013 pregnancy was Beatriz’s second. She had already been diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disease, and rheumatoid arthritis among other illnesses. Her first pregnancy had been complicated as well, requiring two hospitalizations for herself and a 38-day hospital stay for her baby after birth. During her second pregnancy, after the fetus was diagnosed as anencephalic — a congenital defect characterized by an underdeveloped brain and skull — a 15-person medical committee recommended her pregnancy be terminated at 14 weeks to avoid undue risks to the mother’s health, according to testimony before the court. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which sent the case to the court, said the response was that 'legally it (abortion) is not permitted in the country.' Morena Herrera, president of the Citizen Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion, said shortly before the decision was announced that a finding in favor of Beatriz would be 'very important for women's human rights and especially their right to health.' On the other side of the issue, Julia Regina de Cardenal, president of the Yes to Life Foundation, said she feared the decision would have a ripple effect in the region. 'What we're afraid of is that this is going to pressure not just our country to legalize abortion, but that it is going to pressure other Latin American countries too,' she said. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/abortion-el-salvador-human-rights-beatriz-98cafc34eb5187c39648d49e5fe38259	2024-12-20T12:57:08-08:00	
Zambian police arrest 2 over alleged plot to bewitch President Hichilema	LUSAKA, Zambia. (AP) — Two people have been arrested for allegedly plotting to harm Zambia’s President Hakainde Hichilema using witchcraft, police said Friday. Police spokesperson Rae Hamoonga said in a statement that the two suspects, Jasten Mabulesse Candunde, 42, and Leonard Phiri, 43, were allegedly hired by Nelson Banda, the younger brother of fugitive lawmaker Jay Banda, to bewitch the president. Jay Banda escaped from police custody in August 2024 while facing charges of aggravated robbery. His whereabouts are unknown. The two suspects face charges of practicing witchcraft, possession of charms and cruelty to animals. 'The suspects were found in possession of assorted charms, including a live chameleon, and are alleged to be practicing witchdoctors,' Hamoonga said, adding that their purported mission 'was to use charms to harm the Head of State, His Excellency President Hakainde Hichilema.' The police spokesperson said the suspects disclosed that they had agreed to receive a full payment of $7,400.	https://apnews.com/article/zambia-president-arrest-witchcraft-33d02420755f02c931d7908fb6f9a282	2024-12-20T12:22:56-08:00	
Amazon Indigenous community wins latest stage of court battle for lost territory	An Indigenous community in the Peruvian Amazon is celebrating a legal victory in the latest stage of its attempt to take back claimed ancestral rainforests. The Puerto Franco community of the Kichwa tribe say their territory was stolen to form the Cordillera Azul National Park in 2001. Companies such as Shell and TotalEnergies spent tens of millions of dollars on carbon credits in the park to counter emissions from their fossil fuel operations. The Kichwas got next to nothing and were left in hunger, despite a 2022 Associated Press investigation finding that it was almost certainly their ancestral territory, by the terms of a convention Peru signed decades ago. The community celebrated a dramatic legal victory last year, when provincial Judge Simona del Socorro Torres Sánchez ruled that creating the park without their consent had violated their rights. Authorities were ordered to grant them legal ownership and proceeds from the carbon credit sales. But that was quickly overturned by an appeals court in a move that some legal experts called questionable. Judge Sánchez has now ruled once again in the Kichwas’ favor, however, making a new order that the Kichwas should get their land back and benefit from the carbon credit sales. She found the Kichwas were Indigenous, and their territorial rights counted for more than the amount of time that’s passed. The Peruvian government and a nonprofit which runs the park, CIMA, have argued that too much time has passed for the Kichwas to make a claim, and that they are not truly Indigenous people. Peruvian authorities have also argued in legal filings that the community didn’t object to the park’s creation in 2001. Kichwa leader Inocente Sangama said he was 'outraged' at the claim they were not Indigenous people. 'Who said an Indigenous person cannot wear clothes?' 'The justice system has proved us right,' he said. 'We feel pride and happiness.' The AP emailed the Peruvian government but did not immediately receive a reply. Jorge Aliaga Arauco, a director at CIMA, said by email that they would appeal the decision and were on solid evidential ground. The nonprofit says proceeds from the carbon credit project help protect the ancient rainforest, one of Peru’s most pristine and biodiverse environments. The case may be moving towards a conclusion. Juan Carlos Díaz, a constitutional lawyer at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, told the AP that the ruling could be appealed before a superior court. If the Kichwas win there, the decision would be final, he said. Should the Kichwas lose, they would have one last right of appeal, to a Constitutional Court in Lima, but the government doesn't have that last recourse. ———- The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Gravy Day' is an Australian tradition inspired by an unlikely Christmas song by Paul Kelly	NEW YORK (AP) — To many Australians, Saturday is more than just Dec. 21. It's 'Gravy Day,' all because of a lyric in one of the most unlikely Christmas songs ever written. 'How to Make Gravy,' written by singer Paul Kelly, has become a holiday classic in Australia over the past few decades. It was cited this week by the nation's prime minister, Anthony Albanese, as he announced a decision to release five drug smugglers from prison, and is the subject of a new movie that creates a story behind the song. 'It has become our most-loved Christmas song,' Jeff Jenkins, of the Australian publication The Music, wrote this week. The story is set in a prison, the lyrics coming from a letter an inmate writes to his brother to pass along a recipe for the family's Christmas dinner. The song is about much more, though, as 'Joe' expresses regret, longing, fear, paranoia, some humor and the near-universal holiday emotion of someone who wishes to be somewhere else. The prisoner is writing, as the song says in its second line, on the 21st of December, 'and now they're ringing the last bells.' The inspiration behind ‘Gravy Day’ Kelly wrote 'How to Make Gravy' in 1996 after being asked to contribute to a holiday album being put together for charity. He wanted to record a cover of the Band's 'Christmas Must Be Tonight,' but someone else had already claimed it. So Kelly tried putting words to a melody he had kicking around. Inspiration came from one of his favorite holiday albums, 'A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector,' and Darlene Love's recording of the classic 'White Christmas.' Love includes writer Irving Berlin's often-bypassed first verse, where the singer talks of being in Los Angeles while wishing to be somewhere snowy and cold. 'There's a clue,' Kelly said in a TED talk explaining the song's origins, and off he went. The story of ‘Gravy Day’ In the song, 'Joe' imagines the family gathering without him. 'Who's going to make the gravy now?' he said. 'I bet it won't taste the same.' He passes along a recipe, one Kelly got in real life from a former father-in-law. The narrator asks his brother to kiss the sleeping children, and to 'give my love to Angus, and to Frank and Dolly. Tell ‘em all I’m sorry I screwed up this time.' He gossips about Mary and her new boyfriend. 'Do you remember the last one? What was his name again? What was his problem? He never did get Nina Simone.' In performance, Kelly has occasionally replaced Simone with Joey Ramone or 'a little too much cologne.' He asks Dan to look after his wife Rita, and pictures the dancing after dinner. 'Just don't hold her too close, oh brother please don't stab me in the back,' he sings, quickly catching himself to note the idle time in prison that 'turns imagination into fact.' The conclusion is a promise: 'I'm gonna pay 'em all back.' An unusual holiday song with lasting resonance Kelly's love for Shakespeare, the bard's mix of comedy and drama, is also evident in the composition. One of Kelly's first clues that he had tapped into something was a call from his real-life brother. He'd been driving and heard the song for the first time over the radio, and had to pull to the side of the road in tears. It's a holiday song without mistletoe or holly. Structurally, it doesn't have a catchy chorus, or any chorus at all. Yet as years went by, his fans would request the song in concert all year, not just the holidays. Some of them began marking Dec. 21 by leaving a can of gravy on their front porches. 'I can't predict what songs will become popular or speak to my audience,' Kelly said this fall in an interview with The Associated Press, and 'Gravy' is a prime example. The evocation of family is the song's most important ingredient. Kelly's own large family gathers each Christmas Eve to sing carols. Bella O'Grady, a 27-year-old woman who moved to New York and attended a Kelly concert in New York this fall for a taste of home, said 'How to Make Gravy' always evokes warm feelings of holiday celebrations. Sometimes very warm. While many of the song's emotions are universal, a reference in the lyrics to expected heat on Christmas Day — 'I hear it's going to be 100 degrees' — places the setting clearly in Australia. Down under, the holiday is at the beginning of summer. Gravy Day in Australia this year Prime Minister Albanese alluded to 'Gravy Day' in his decision this week to release the five men who were convicted in 2005 of smuggling heroin from Indonesia to Australia. 'Australians speak about what it's like to have someone who's a loved one — they sing the great Paul Kelly song — in jail over Christmas,' Albanese said, according to The Nightly. 'Who's going to make the gravy? Well, these families had their loved ones in jail for 20 Christmases, and that was enough.' Using the characters in Kelly's song and building a story around it, filmmaker Nick Waterman made a movie of 'How to Make Gravy' this year that is airing on the Australian streaming service Binge. It is being shown in some movie theaters free on 'Gravy Day' weekend. So what's in that gravy recipe, anyway? 'Just add flour, salt, a little red wine and don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce for sweetness and that extra tang.' It's all in the song. ____ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

At least 2 dead and 60 hurt after a car drives into a German Christmas market in a suspected attack	MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — A car plowed into a busy outdoor Christmas market in the eastern German city of Magdeburg on Friday, killing at least two people and injuring at least 60 others in what authorities called a deliberate attack. The driver was arrested at the scene shortly after the car barreled into the market at around 7 p.m., when it was teeming with holiday shoppers looking forward to the weekend. Verified bystander footage distributed by the German news agency dpa showed the suspect’s arrest on a walkway in the middle of the road. A nearby police officer pointing a handgun at the man shouted at him as he lay prone. Other officers soon arrived to take the man into custody. The two people confirmed dead were an adult and a toddler, but officials said additional deaths couldn't be ruled out because 15 people had been seriously injured. The violence shocked the city, bringing its mayor to the verge of tears and marring a festive event that's part of a centuries-old German tradition. It also prompted several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution. The suspect is a 50-year-old Saudi doctor who moved to Germany in 2006, Tamara Zieschang, the interior minister for the state of Saxony-Anhalt, said at a news conference. He has been practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg, she said. 'As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,' Saxony-Anhalt's governor, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters. 'Every human life that has fallen victim to this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many.' The violence occurred in Magdeburg, a city of about 240,000 people west of Berlin that serves as Saxony-Anhalt’s capital. Friday's attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Christmas markets are a huge part of German culture as an annual holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages and successfully exported to much of the Western world. In Berlin alone, more than 100 markets opened late last month and brought the smells of mulled wine, roasted almonds and bratwurst to the capital. Other markets abound across the country. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said late last month that there were no concrete indications of a danger to Christmas markets this year, but that it was wise to be vigilant. Hours after Friday's tragedy, the wail of sirens clashed with the market’s festive ornaments, stars and leafy garlands. Magdeburg resident Dorin Steffen told dpa that she was at a concert in a nearby church when she heard the sirens. The cacophony was so loud 'you had to assume that something terrible had happened.' She called the attack 'a dark day' for the city. 'We are shaking,' Steffen said. 'Full of sympathy for the relatives, also in the hope that nothing has happened to our relatives, friends and acquaintances.' The attack reverberated far beyond Magdeburg, with Haseloff calling it a catastrophe for the city, state and country. He said flags would be lowered to half-staff in Saxony-Anhalt and that the federal government planned to do the same. 'It is really one of the worst things one can imagine, particularly in connection with what a Christmas market should bring,' the governor said. Chancellor OIaf Scholz posted on X: 'My thoughts are with the victims and their relatives. We stand beside them and beside the people of Magdeburg.' NATO’s secretary-general and the European Commission’s president also expressed their condolences on X. Magdeburg Mayor Simone Borris, who was on the verge of tears, said officials plan to arrange a memorial at the city’s cathedral on Saturday. After a soccer match Friday evening between Bayern Munich and Leipzig, Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen asked fans at the club’s stadium to observe a minute of silence. ___ Moulson reported from Berlin.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-magdeburg-christmas-market-6b2bcf305eb9f60f8d7273949dbba4c8	2024-12-20T10:02:06-08:00	
Italian court clears Vice Premier Salvini of illegally detaining migrants on a rescue ship in 2019	ROME (AP) — A court in Sicily Friday found Italian Vice Premier Matteo Salvini not guilty of illegally detaining 100 migrants aboard a humanitarian rescue ship in 2019, when he was interior minister. The court in the city of Palermo dropped all the charges against Salvini in relation an incident in 2019, when he refused to allow the migrants to leave the Open Arms rescue ship at Italy’s southernmost island of Lampedusa. Verdicts in Italy are only considered final once all appeals are exhausted, a process that can take years. Now transport minister in Premier Giorgia Meloni’s far-right-led government, Salvini has always defended himself, saying he acted to protect Italy’s borders. 'Protecting our country's borders from smugglers is not a crime,' the leader of the right-wing League party said shortly after the verdict. 'This is a victory for the League and for Italy.' Premier Meloni also expressed her 'great satisfaction,' saying in a statement that the verdict 'shows how the accusations against Salvini were baseless and surreal.' Salvini had always stated he didn't plan to step down in case of a guilty verdict, but such an outcome would have dealt a big blow to Meloni's government. He has the strong support of the premier, other government ministers and anti-migrant European lawmakers, as well as Elon Musk, who expressed his sympathy for the Italian leader in a message on the social media platform X. During the 2019 standoff, some of the migrants threw themselves overboard in desperation as the captain pleaded for a safe port nearby. The remaining 89 people onboard were eventually allowed to disembark on Lampedusa by a court order. Salvini took a hard line against migration as interior minister from 2018-2019 in the first government of former Premier Giuseppe Conte. He refused permission for humanitarian rescue ships to dock and accused the groups that rescued migrants at sea of effectively encouraging smugglers.	https://apnews.com/article/matteo-salvini-italy-migration-trial-rescue-ship-237adf612c6a16e9ed3d3d65a0995b6a	2024-12-20T09:50:48-08:00	
Trump adds Europe to the list of US trade partners he's threatening with tariffs	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Friday added the 27 countries that make up the European Union to the list of trade partners he's threatening with tariffs — unless the group takes steps to import more U.S. goods. 'I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas,' Trump posted shortly after 1 a.m. on social media. 'Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!' In 2023, the United States’ trade imbalance with the EU on goods was $209 billion, according to the Census Bureau. There were $576 billion in imports from Europe and $367 billion in exports from the United States. Trump's transition team did not respond to questions seeking greater clarity on the message, which for all its bluntness was unclear on next steps. When Trump threatened Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs in November, the leaders of both countries spoke with him to try and resolve any tensions. But the European Union lacks a single figure who can make the purchase commitments of natural gas and oil on behalf of its 27 member states that Trump is seeking. EU Commission spokesman Olof Gill said in reaction to Trump's post that 'we are ready to discuss with President-elect Trump how we can further strengthen an already strong relationship, including by discussing our common interests in the energy sector.' Gill noted that the EU is already 'committed to phasing out energy imports from Russia and diversifying our sources of supply. We’re not going to go into any details about what that might entail in the future, given that the new administration isn’t even in place yet.' Scott Lincicome, a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it was difficult to parse what Trump was trying to say relative to European trade, given that natural gas exports to the continent are already up after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'What we really need to chalk all of this up to is Trump laying the groundwork for future negotiations,' Lincicome said. 'This is for better or worse a lot of what we’re going to see for the next four years.' While there is a $209 billion trade imbalance, a more complicated relationship lies beneath those numbers. A company such as German automaker BMW can import parts needed to assemble vehicles at its factory in South Carolina, such that the trade totals also reflect the flow of goods within European companies that employ U.S. workers. More than half of the liquified natural gas imported by the EU and the United Kingdom in 2023 came from the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The volume of LNG going to the EU and UK has tripled since 2021. On Tuesday, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm issued a statement based off a new study that unfettered exports of LNG could increase prices domestically and increase carbon emissions. Trump ran for president on the idea that increased oil and natural gas production would reduce costs for U.S. voters who were left frustrated by a 2022 inflationary spike that still lingers. Trump's demands on Europe to buy more oil and natural gas were not especially new. He also made them during his initial term as president and in 2018 reached a deal with Jean-Claude Juncker, then-president of the European Commission, to sell more LNG to Europe. The problem with that agreement, as noted by the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, is that the U.S. 'cannot force companies to send products to a specific region or country' and the EU cannot force its members to buy American fossil fuels. ___ Casert contributed to this report from Brussels.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-europe-trade-tariffs-natural-gas-oil-08d762fdf17a0737aa6add3c9382c4bd	2024-12-20T09:25:56-08:00	
What will Syria's future look like? The answer could lie in other Arab countries' recent pasts	CAIRO (AP) — Even with hopes running high, so much can go wrong when a country ousts a longtime dictator and tries to start anew. The Middle Eastern and North African nations that attempted to transition to democracy in recent years can attest to that. Now it's Syria's turn to try to get it right. It’s hard to draw lessons from the experiences of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Sudan since the wave of Arab Spring uprisings that began in 2011, as each country’s dynamics are different, But there are common themes. In some cases, 'the Revolution' was lost when armed factions battled it out for power or an ambitious would-be strongman emerged. In others, the miliary refused to cede control to civilians or foreign countries fueled conflicts by backing one side or another with money and weapons. Questions must be asked before major decisions are made that can spark a destabilizing backlash: How do you deal with the old police state — purge or compromise? What do you do first, hold elections or write a constitution? And how do you fix a crippled economy riddled with corruption? So far, Syria’s transition has been surprisingly smooth. But it's only been two weeks since President Bashar Assad was toppled, and many of those same dangers lurk in the background. The insurgents who ousted Assad are rooted in extremist Islamist ideology, and though they have vowed to create a pluralist system, it isn't clear how or whether they plan to share power. Other armed factions — or even remnants of Assad's feared security forces — could lash out. And it remains to be seen whether the Kurds, who hold autonomous rule in the east, will be brought back into the fold, especially when Turkey fiercely opposes the main Kurdish faction. Groups such as the Alawites, to whom Assad's family belongs, fear being squeezed out of any role, or worse, being targeted for revenge. Here's a look at the power dynamics in some of these other countries: Yemen Protests forced Yemen’s Ali Abdullah Saleh to resign in November 2011, ending his 33-year rule. Under a deal brokered by Gulf countries, Saleh received immunity and handed his powers to his vice president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Hadi was to serve as caretaker president for two years, during which a new constitution would be written, leading eventually to elections. But Saleh, who remained in the capital, Sanaa, allied himself with Houthi rebels based in the north — his longtime enemy -- in a bid to regain power. Backed by Saleh’s loyalists, the Houthis seized Sanaa and much of the populated center of the country. Hadi and his government fled south, where they are based in the city of Aden and control southern and much of eastern Yemen. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab countries launched a bombardment campaign aimed at restoring Hadi’s government. Since then, Yemen has been torn by civil war that has killed more than 150,000 people and caused one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The war became a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Yemen has remained split between the Houthis, who later broke with Saleh’s camp and killed Saleh, and Hadi’s government. Various militias nominally back Hadi but also have their own interests and are funded by the United Arab Emirates. Libya Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi met the most violent end of any of the region’s strongmen. An uprising turned into a civil war, and then with NATO backing, the rebels seized the capital, Tripoli, and killed a fleeing Gadhafi in October 2011. The oil-rich nation quickly splintered into regions controlled by a dizzying array of militias, including local and tribal groups, nationalists and mainstream Islamist factions, and diehard jihadis such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Attempts to stitch it back together with elections or agreements have failed. A disputed parliamentary election in 2014 led to two rival administrations: one in the east backed by powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter, and the other in the west based in Tripoli that is backed by militias and recognized by the United Nations. Hifter tried to seize the west in 2019, triggering a 14-month war. Then, an attempt at a unity government and new elections fell apart, and once again Libya was left split between east-west governments. Foreign powers, including Russia, Turkey and the UAE, backed various sides. European countries have funneled money to the Tripoli government trying to stem the flow of migrants from Africa through Libya toward Europe, but the money has largely helped fund militias. Efforts to end the conflict remain deadlocked. Sudan In Sudan, the powerful military has thwarted attempts to transition to an elected civilian government. Pro-democracy protests prompted the military to remove strongman Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, and the generals took power for themselves. The protesters stayed in the streets, demanding a handover of power to civilians, despite a crackdown that killed hundreds. Finally, the generals agreed to a power-sharing deal with the pro-democracy alliance that led the protests. A civilian prime minister led a Cabinet backed by a council headed by two powerful generals, including one notorious for atrocities committed in Darfur and during the 2019 crackdown on protesters. But just before the military was supposed to hand over the council's leadership to civilians, the generals orchestrated a coup. A few months later, in April 2023, the generals turned on each other, triggering a war in which their forces have battled throughout the country, including in the capital, Khartoum. The war has been marked by atrocities, caused widespread hunger and driven millions from their homes, becoming the world’s worst displacement crisis. Tunisia The Arab Spring started in Tunisia more than 13 years ago. Until recently, the country was hailed as a role model in the transition to democracy. It held free elections and drafted a constitution lauded by Western rights groups. But since being elected in 2019, President Kais Saied has increased his powers in what activists call a backslide from democracy. Saied temporarily suspended the parliament, redrafted the constitution and launched a crackdown on his opponents, imprisoning hundreds allegedly for undermining state security — a claim autocrats have long used to stamp out dissent. Egypt The military has been the main power player in Egypt. It seized direct control after 18 days of protests forced longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak to resign on Feb. 11, 2011. Within 15 months, parliamentary and presidential elections were held. The Muslim Brotherhood, the most powerful opposition force during Mubarak’s era, swept both votes. Despite repeatedly insisting it wouldn't seek to dominate politics, it formed a majority in parliament and created a Brotherhood-led government. Over the next year, turmoil increased over accusations by opponents that the Brotherhood was unfairly imposing its will on the country, including writing an Islamist-leaning constitution. Many, including the large Coptic Christian minority, feared Islamist rule. Amid anti-Brotherhood protests, the military stepped in and removed President Mohammed Morsi in July 2013, a move supported by many secular parties and activists. It launched a ferocious crackdown on the Brotherhood, killing hundreds. Militant violence swelled with attacks on security forces and Christians. Military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sissi was elected president in 2014 and has since increased the influence of the army on the government and economy. The government has gone further than Mubarak did in stifling dissent, arresting Islamists and secular activists, and silencing media criticism.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-future-assad-arab-spring-lessons-51635b7aabc0760bb7841829586ede7c	2024-12-20T08:29:10-08:00	
At one of Rio de Janeiro's hardest trails, one paraplegic athlete climbed into the clouds	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — It’s perhaps Rio de Janeiro’s hardest trail, featuring one particularly daunting section requiring a perilous scramble that can cause hikers to freeze up with fright. But this week, paraplegic athlete Ezequiel da Luz, 40, traversed jungle and surmounted rocks to reach Pedra da Gavea’s peak that towers over the Atlantic Ocean. Da Luz had been waiting since 2021, and traveled more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) by bus from southern Brazil when his chance arrived to ascend with the assistance of an organization called the Inclusion Collective. Its volunteers on Dec. 18 surrounded and shouldered the weight of a specialized wheelchair, set inside a metal frame as they helped da Luz upward. 'What logistics!' da Luz exclaimed as their tightly packed throng helped him weave through one narrow stretch at the start of the trail. Inclusion Collective started three years ago and has completed more than 50 hikes, 12 of which to Pedra da Gavea, plus others on less challenging trails, according to Bruna Souza, the group’s administrator. 'We can show that if we have the will, inclusion can happen anywhere, not just where there’s a ramp,' she told The Associated Press along the trail. 'It’s not just shopping centers you can go to; you can go to other places. It can be fun for everyone.' Volunteers on Wednesday were mostly trail and climbing guides already familiar with the route. They were joined by hikers who encouraged da Luz during his eight-hour ascent, with 800 meters (2,600 feet) of elevation gain. At the infamously hair-raising section, called Carrasqueira, volunteers used a system of ropes to hoist his chair. 'I’ve never seen anything like this in terms of accessibility, people helping,' said Adriele Neves, a 29-year-old hiker. 'It’s beautiful work.' With Carrasqueira conquered, it was straight on to the summit. As da Luz wheeled himself forward, waving a Brazilian flag in the air, volunteers and other hikers already atop the mountain erupted in applause. 'I didn’t know it had so many challenges, and so many obstacles,' he told the AP atop the mountain. 'Today, to be up here on Pedra da Gavea, together with this group that promotes inclusion, is the fulfilment of a dream.' Alas, the peak was shrouded in clouds, leaving Rio de Janeiro’s Ipanema beach and iconic Two Brothers Hill hidden away. It seemed da Luz wouldn’t get to enjoy Pedra da Gavea’s majestic view. But within mere minutes, the clouds parted and some sunlight filtered down from the heavens, maybe just for him. 'Even in this, God was generous,' da Luz said. 'Look there, what an incredible view. What a marvelous vision!'	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-rio-accessibility-disability-parathlete-pedra-gavea-36523779270b201c0e0b0a59c4d2b5e0	2024-12-20T06:49:31-08:00	
Italy's privacy watchdog fines OpenAI for ChatGPT's violations in collecting users personal data	ROME (AP) — Italy’s data protection watchdog said Friday it has fined OpenAI 15 million euros ($15.6 million) after wrapping up a probe into the collection of personal data by the U.S. artificial intelligence company's popular chatbot ChatGPT. The country’s privacy watchdog, known as Garante, said its investigation showed that OpenAI processed users’ personal data to train ChatGPT 'without having an adequate legal basis and violated the principle of transparency and the related information obligations towards users'. OpenAI dubbed the decision 'disproportionate' and said it will appeal. 'When the Garante ordered us to stop offering ChatGPT in Italy in 2023, we worked with them to reinstate it a month later,' an OpenAI spokesperson said Friday in an emailed statement. 'They’ve since recognized our industry-leading approach to protecting privacy in AI, yet this fine is nearly 20 times the revenue we made in Italy during the relevant period.' OpenAI added, however, it remained 'committed to working with privacy authorities worldwide to offer beneficial AI that respects privacy rights.' The investigation, launched last year, also found that OpenAI didn’t provide an 'adequate age verification system' to prevent users under 13 years of age from being exposed to inappropriate AI-generated content, the watchdog said. The Italian authority also ordered OpenAI to launch a six-month campaign on different Italian media to raise public awareness about ChatGPT, specifically in regard to data collection. The booming popularity of generative artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT has drawn scrutiny from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been examining OpenAI and other companies that have played a key part in the AI boom, while governments around the world have been drawing up rules to protect against risks posed by AI systems, led by the European Union's AI Act, a comprehensive rulebook for artificial intelligence. ___ AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report	https://apnews.com/article/italy-privacy-authority-openai-chatgpt-fine-6760575ae7a29a1dd22cc666f49e605f	2024-12-20T06:35:03-08:00	
Warring tribes in Pakistan’s northwest ordered to hand over weapons after weeks of deadly clashes	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Warring tribes in Pakistan’s northwest were ordered to hand over their weapons after weeks of deadly violence, authorities said Friday. Clashes in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have killed at least 130 people in recent weeks, triggering road closures and other measures that have disrupted people’s access to medicine, food, fuel, education and work. The violence flared on Nov. 21 when gunmen ambushed a vehicle convoy and killed 52 people, mostly Shiite Muslims. Nobody claimed responsibility for the assault, which triggered retaliatory gunfire and arson by rival groups in several areas. On Friday, authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ordered tribes to hand over their weapons and sign an agreement through government mediation to ensure compliance. 'A 15-day framework will be provided for voluntary weapon collection. All weapons must be handed over to the administration by February,' provincial government spokesman Mohammed Ali Saif said. Authorities also ordered the dismantling of bunkers and the temporary reopening of roads on humanitarian grounds on an intermittent basis. Security personnel will guard convoys to ensure safe passage and there will be helicopters to address transport issues. 'Both parties will refrain from any violent actions to keep the ground routes open. Otherwise, the administration will be compelled to close the routes again,' the spokesman added. But a group of Shiite scholars said the confiscation of weapons could put the community at risk, and they expressed their disappointment with the order. 'This approach will result in further harm,' they said at a news conference in the city of Parachinar city. 'Without weapons, residents will be at the mercy of terrorists who could easily capture and kill them.' Shiite Muslims dominate parts of Kurram, although they are a minority in the rest of the country. The area has a history of sectarian conflict, with militant groups previously targeting the minority group. But they generally live peacefully alongside Sunni Muslims, who are the majority in Pakistan.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-kurram-sectarian-violence-6add22531d526301e135c9b3f473650d	2024-12-20T06:08:02-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau reshuffles his Cabinet as resignation calls mount and new election threat looms	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chances of staying on in power have become more tenuous after the opposition party that backed his government for years announced it will vote no confidence in the government when Parliament resumes. An embattled Trudeau reshuffled his Cabinet on Friday — but whether he will step aside in the coming days or weeks remains an open question. Trudeau participated in the swearing-in ceremony and will chair a meeting with his new Cabinet later Friday. He is not expected to speak publicly Friday as he mulls his future. 'The prime minister has simply asked for some time to reflect on his own future,' said David McGuinty, the new Public Safety Minister. 'He deserves to have that time to think about what he wants to do.' Rachel Bendayan, the official languages minister, said Trudeau 'told us he had a difficult choice to make.' Trudeau is facing rising discontent over his leadership, and the abrupt departure of his finance minister on Monday could be something he can’t recover from. Parliament is now shut for the holidays until late next month, but the leftist New Democratic Party said Friday it would trigger a vote of no confidence in Trudeau after lawmakers reconvene on Jan. 27. Because Trudeau’s Liberals do not hold an outright majority in Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the NDP to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has vanished — NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has called on Trudeau to resign — and he made clear Friday the NDP will vote to bring down the government. 'No matter who is leading the Liberal Party, this government’s time is up. We will put forward a clear motion of non-confidence in the next sitting of the House of Commons,' Singh said in letter released just before the Cabinet shuffle. The Liberals could delay Parliament’s return. Trudeau could decide not to run in the next year’s election and allow for a party leadership race. New Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Thursday that Trudeau has the 'full support of his Cabinet' but acknowledged a rising number of Liberal members of Parliament want Trudeau to leave. Liberal Rob Oliphant became the latest lawmaker to call for the prime minister to step aside, saying there should be a 'robust, open leadership contest.' Trudeau, who has led the country for nearly a decade, has become widely unpopular in recent years over a wide range of issues, including the high cost of living and rising inflation. The political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if the government does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the United States — even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened. Canada’s Transport Minister Anita Anand, who on Friday added the role of minister of internal trade to her portfolio, said it won't be good if the Liberal government is not united as it deals with Trump's threats. There is no mechanism for Trudeau’s party to force him out in the short term. He could say he will step aside when a new party leader is chosen, or his Liberal party could be forced from power by a 'no confidence' vote in Parliament that would trigger an election that would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party. 'It's clear the prime minister has lost control,' Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said. Poilievre said Canada needs an immediate election and requires a prime minister who can face Trump from a position of strength. 'This cannot go on with a U.S. president coming in threatening tariffs early next year. We cannot have a chaotic clown show running our government into the ground,' he said. 'The only way for me to have the moral authority to get a deal with incoming President Trump is to have the strength that comes with winning an election and having a four year mandate.' Concerns about Trudeau’s leadership were exacerbated Monday when Chrystia Freeland, Trudeau’s finance minister and deputy prime minister, resigned from the Cabinet. Freeland was highly critical of Trudeau’s handling of the economy in the face of steep tariffs threatened by Trump. Shortly before Freeland announced her decision, the housing minister also quit. Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Friday's Cabinet reshuffle was necessary because of recent departures but said for many Canadians 'it might simply appear as rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.'	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-cabinet-1f222c037bbe7d1e8d68845f91d76417	2024-12-20T05:49:03-08:00	
In Florida, the Miccosukee fight to protect the Everglades in the face of climate change	EVERGLADES, Fla. (AP) — As a boy, when the water was low Talbert Cypress from the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida rummaged through the Everglades’ forests, swam in its swampy ponds and fished in its canals. But the vast wetlands near Miami have radically changed since Cypress was younger. Now 42 and tribal council chairman, Cypress said water levels are among the biggest changes. Droughts are drier and longer. Prolonged floods are drowning tree islands sacred to them. Native wildlife have dwindled. 'It’s basically extremes now,' he said. Tribal elder Michael John Frank put it this way: 'The Everglades is beautiful, but it’s just a skeleton of the way it used to be.' ______ EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change. ______ For centuries, the Everglades has been the tribe's home. But decades of massive engineering projects for development and agriculture severed the wetlands to about half its original size, devastating an ecosystem that’s sustained them. Tribe members say water mismanagement has contributed to fires, floods and water pollution in their communities and cultural sites. Climate change, and the fossil fuel activities that caused it, are ongoing threats. The Miccosukee people have long fought to heal and protect what remains. They were historically reluctant to engage with the outside world due to America’s violent legacy against Indigenous people. But with a new tribal administration, the tribe has played an increasingly collaborative and leadership role in healing the Everglades. They’re working to stop oil exploration and successfully fought a wilderness designation that would have cut their access to ancestral lands. They’ve pushed for a project to reconnect the western Everglades with the larger ecosystem while helping to control invasive species and reintroducing racoons, hawks and other native animals. In August they signed a co-stewardship agreement for some of South Florida's natural landscapes. They've held prayer walks, launched campaigns to raise awareness of important issues and used airboat tours as public classrooms. Even so, a new report on the progress of Everglades work acknowledges a lack of meaningful and consistent engagement with the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes. It calls for applying Indigenous knowledge to restoration efforts and a steady partnership with tribes, whose longstanding, intimate and reciprocal relationship with the environment can help with understanding historical and present ecological conditions. The Miccosukee's past fuels their activism today For generations, the Miccosukee people would make pilgrimages from northern Florida to the Everglades to fish, hunt and hold religious ceremonies. When the Seminole Wars broke out in 1817, the tribe navigated the vast terrain better than the U.S. Army. By the late 1850s, Col. Gustavus Loomis had seared every tribal village and field in a region known as the Big Cypress, forcing the Miccosukee and Seminole people to seek refuge on tree islands deep in the Everglades. 'That’s the reason we’re here today. We often look at the Everglades as our protector during that time. And so now, it’s our turn to protect the Everglades,' said Cypress. Many of the Everglades’ modern problems began in the 1940s when the region was drained to build cities and plant crops. Over time, the ecosystems where the Miccosukee people hunted, fished and gathered plants, held sacred rituals and put their deceased to rest, have been destroyed. A state-federal project to clean the water and rehydrate the landscape aims to undo much of the damage. But water management decisions and restoration efforts have flooded or parched lands where tribe members live and hold ceremonies. That’s a reason the tribe has pushed for decades for a comprehensive response with the Western Everglades Restoration Project. Members have spoken at public meetings, written letters to federal agencies, lobbied with state and federal leaders while gathering with stakeholders to hear their concerns. If all goes right, the project will clean polluted water, improve hydrology, provide flood protection and reduce the likelihood and severity of wildfires. Groundbreaking for the project began in July there . Still, there are concerns about community flood risks and whether the project will do enough to improve water quality and quantity after a part of the plan was removed. A second engineered wetland that would have cleaned water was removed from the project proposal after landowners wouldn't give up their lands. The area's geology was also deemed too porous to sustain it. In the absence of an alternative, some people worry water will not meet standards. Even so, Curtis Osceola, chief of staff for the Miccosukee Tribe, said of the project: 'If we get this done, we will have forever changed the future for the Miccosukee and Seminole.' Victory in fight over wilderness designation In a region of the Everglades now known as the Big Cypress National Preserve, environmental activist and Miccosukee tribe member Betty Osceola learned as a child to spear hunt and subsist off the land like her ancestors did. It's where she still lives, in one of 15 traditional villages that a few hundred Miccosukee and Seminole people also call home. In its cypress swamps and sawgrass prairies, they hunt, gather medicinal plants and hold important events. It’s home to ceremonial and burial grounds, and to the endangered Florida panther. The National Park Service wanted to designate the preserve as wilderness to protect it from human impacts. The tribe pushed back, saying it would have significantly affected their traditional ways of life, limited access to their homelands and ignored the critical stewardship they've provided for centuries. Allowing Indigenous people to remain caretakers of their lands and waters, numerous studies have shown, are critical to protecting biodiversity, forests and fighting climate change. After a stern fight involving campaigns, a petition, testimonials and support from numerous government officials, the tribe succeeded. The National Park Service listened to the tribe's concerns about the legal conflicts the designation would have on their tribal rights, said Osceola, the Miccosukee's chief of staff. Although they continue objecting to the agency's advancing proposal to expand trail systems in the preserve, which the tribe said are near or past culturally significant sites, 'they did listen to us on the wilderness designation and at least they’re not, at this time, proceeding with any such designation,' he added. The Miccosukee continue pushing to phase out oil drilling in Big Cypress, writing op-eds and working with local, state and federal governments to stop more oil exploration by acquiring mineral rights in the preserve. Elders look to the next generation to protect the Everglades On a windy afternoon, Frank, the tribal elder, and Hector Tigertail, 18, sat under a chickee, or stilt house, on the tribe’s reservation. A wooden swing swayed near garden beds where flowers, chilies and other plants sprung from the soil. A plastic deer with antlers lay on the grass nearby, used to teach Indigenous youth how to hunt. Frank, 67, shared stories of growing up on tree islands. He remembered when the water was so clean he could drink it, and the deer that emerged to play when a softball game was underway. He spoke of the tribe’s history and a time when wildlife in the Everglades was abundant. Of his distrust of government agencies and the tribe's connection to the land. And he spoke often of his grandfather's words, uttered to him decades ago that still resound. 'We were told to never, ever leave the Everglades,' said Frank. 'The only way to prolong your life, your culture, your identity is to stay here in the Everglades... as long as you're here, your maker's hand is upon you.' Tigertail heard similar stories from his uncles and grandfather growing up. They helped him feel connected to the Everglades and to his culture. Their stories remind him of the importance of being stewards of the lands that have cared for him and his ancestors. Tribal elders are teaching youth what Cypress called 'the modern' way to protect the Everglades – with policy, understanding government practices and integrating traditional and Western science. As a tribal youth member, Tigertail is doing what he can to preserve the Everglades for his generation and ones to come. He works with the Miccosukee Tribe's Fish and Wildlife Department to remove invasive species like pythons and fish like peacock bass. And he tries to be a voice for his people. 'To hear that we’re losing it slowly and slowly saddens me,' said Tigertail. 'But also gives me hope that maybe there is a chance to save it.' ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Zimbabwe launches new land policy to empower Black farmers with direct farm ownership	HARARE (AP) — Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Friday launched a new policy that will allow beneficiaries of land taken from white people under contentious land reforms to sell it and to be able to borrow from banks using it as collateral. This marks a major shift in Zimbabwe's land policy. Previously, the resettled farmers couldn't transfer ownership of land. However, ownership of the land can only be transferred between 'Indigenous Zimbabweans,' a reference to Black Zimbabweans, and will need government approval under the new policy. Tens of thousands of Black people took over white-owned farms after then President Robert Mugabe initiated the land reforms in 2000. Mugabe, who died in 2019, justified the reforms as being necessary to redress some of the wrongs of colonialism that put most of Zimbabwe's fertile land in the hands of a few white people. But the new Black farmers weren't allowed to sell or transfer ownership of the land, which was deemed to belong to the state. As a result, banks were reluctant to advance loans to the resettled farmers, who couldn't use their land as collateral. On Friday, a handful of farmers, including Mnangagwa, received title deeds to the farms they are occupying. Mnangagwa also announced a technical committee to spearhead the process for other resettled Black farmers. Speaking at an event held at his farm near Kwekwe city in central Zimbabwe, Mnangagwa said the policy would help 'unlock the value' of the land and make it 'bankable and transferable.' About 4,500 white farmers who owned the majority of prime farmland were removed from their farms, often forcibly by violent mobs led by veterans of the country’s 1970s independence war more than 20 years ago. Some farmers and their workers died or were seriously injured in the violence, which included beatings and rape, according to Human Rights Watch. The land seizures badly impacted commercial farming, forcing a country that was a key regional food producer and exporter to rely on assistance from donors. Zimbabwe’s agriculture sector has rebounded in recent years, but droughts are now the main challenge. Securing finance has been another problem that Mnangagwa hopes could be solved by the new policy of issuing title deeds to Black farmers. Secure land tenure means 'our farmers can access credit facilities' and it 'lifts many out of poverty into prosperity,' Mnangagwa said. In October, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said that Zimbabwe would compensate local and foreign white farmers who lost land and property in the farm seizures.	https://apnews.com/article/zimbabwe-land-policy-black-farmers-reform-ownership-87e4cfaf7b6ad1f43f4ca886f20546d5	2024-12-20T05:11:31-08:00	
Hungary’s Orbán says European leaders must change strategy on Ukraine	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said Friday that European leaders must acknowledge the need to change their strategy regarding Ukraine. In comments to Hungary’s state broadcaster on Friday, Orbán argued that the current strategy was not working and Russia was advancing on the frontlines. He added that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory 'has changed the state of the war.' The nationalist Hungarian leader is a vocal supporter of Trump and has long sought to undermine EU support for Ukraine. He has routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc’s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion. Orbán did not specify what actions he believed Europe should take regarding Ukraine, but reiterated his call for a Christmas truce in the Ukraine war. He suggested the exchange of up to 1,000 prisoners of war between Moscow and Kyiv. He said such a ceasefire should start on the Orthodox Christmas, Jan. 7. That could be seen as another insult against the Ukrainians, who split from the Orthodox calendar last year and are celebrating Christmas on Dec. 25. Orbán had repeatedly maintained previously that Russian President Vladimir Putin had accepted his ceasefire proposal. But on Friday he took a step back, saying that he got Putin 'to consider it.' He did not provide more details.	https://apnews.com/article/hungary-ukraine-orban-trump-war-truce-aedac0e0a73a602083d76ef9f7beaeb8	2024-12-20T05:11:26-08:00	
Two AP journalists in Ukraine and the Mideast break down the wars they covered in 2024	For the world, 2024 was riven by — and in some ways defined by — conflict on two fronts. The ripples after the previous year's Hamas attacks in Israel left Gaza a shambles and tens of thousands dead, and an adjacent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is playing out across the Lebanon landscape as the year ends. A continent away, the Russia-Ukraine war, which began with Russia's invasion in early 2022, rages on and evolves, claiming more casualties as it goes. Associated Press journalists have been covering these conflicts since they began. Now, as 2024 ends and a new year begins, we asked two veteran AP reporters — Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Samya Kullab in Kyiv — to talk about what they saw the past year and what struck them. Here are their accounts: JOSEF FEDERMAN, news director, Israel/Palestinian territories/Jordan ON REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS: There's a shift going on. There are these two blocs in the Middle East. You have Iran and its allies, and then you have the pro-western Arab countries and Israel. The Iranians' allies include Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, Assad's government in Syria. Now you see all of this falling apart. Oct. 7 triggered this chain reaction across the region. And what we’ve seen is that the Iran bloc as a whole is collapsing before our eyes. So what Hamas had hoped to do, if you go back and you look at what they said on Oct. 7th, they were expecting the entire Middle East to kind of rise up against Israel with them. And the only one that really did it was Hezbollah in Lebanon. Some of these other Iranian-backed groups kind of joined in. But what you’ve seen over this past year is that Israel has been dismantling Hamas. Hamas still exists at a very low level, but it is nothing close to what it was, and it probably never will be again. So it has dismantled Hamas in Gaza. And it struck a very tough blow to Hezbollah as well. IMPACT ON HEZBOLLAH: For years, the Israelis built up Hezbollah as like the boogeyman. They said, 'Oh, Hamas is a walk in the park compared to what we’re going to deal with Hezbollah.' And people were really dreading that second front opening up. And then it really boiled over into a full-fledged war over the summer. And then Israel moved in and sent ground troops into Lebanon. And it delivered, not as hard hit as what it did to Hamas, but a body blow to Hezbollah as well. Israel assassinated Hassan Nasrallah. who was this very charismatic figure who led the group for 30 years. It killed nearly all of the group's top leaders. And the exploding pager incident was more psychological than anything — hundreds of Hezbollah members suddenly are afraid to look at their phones and use their devices after these mysterious explosions. It just shows how far Israel infiltrated this group. HOW SYRIA FITS IN: There’s a clear connection here. Israel struck a blow to Iran’s allies, and then these rebels in Syria saw weakness. Once Hezbollah caved, within days they were moving across Syria. And within a week or two, Assad had been toppled — after his family was in power for half a century. And the reason Syria was so important was it was the main route for Hezbollah to rearm. The arms would be transferred through Syria across the Lebanese border. That option doesn’t exist anymore. So what was already fragmentation has become even more fragmented. And now Syria is no longer an arms smuggling route to Hezbollah, so Hezbollah is also not going to be the same threat. Israel’s not out of the woods, though, because you don’t know what’s going to emerge in Syria. WHAT 2025 MIGHT HOLD FOR GAZA: There are signs the war is in its final stages. But even if it ends, I don’t see how anybody would want to invest into rebuilding Gaza again, given the history where every three or four years there is another war where all your work gets destroyed. So for them to get investment this time on that the scale that’s needed, there are going to have to be some big changes in the way people think. They're not going to just go back to Oct. 6. That's where diplomacy comes in — who’s going to run it? It has to be somebody that’s trusted by all of the sides. It has to be somebody that’s confident they can do things differently. And you’re going to have that constant threat of Hamas undermining the work if they’re not part of this anymore. ON TRAUMA: When this is over one thing that seems safe to say is there’s not going to be a happy ending here. Nobody’s going to come out of this war smiling. Many of the hostages aren't coming back alive. Even if Israel succeeds in dismantling Hamas, if all of these hostages that are alive get out, who knows what sort of trauma they are facing and future they’re going to have? There are the Oct. 7 victims, and hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed since then. Their friends and families are all grieving. And the future of Gaza, it has been bombed really into oblivion. I mean, the amount of damage that we can see from satellite photos and from our people on the ground, it will probably take decades to rebuild. No one knows who’s going to govern Gaza. Nobody knows who’s going to pay for this reconstruction. And then just think about all the trauma, what everybody’s been through. Tens of thousands of people killed — lots of militants but also lots of civilians. We have 90% of the territory that has been displaced. Many, if not most, are living in tents in squalid conditions. About half of Gaza's population is below the age of 18. It’s a young society. You have an entire generation of children who have missed two full years of school. Who knows what type of education they will get? How do you make up that time? And what future do they have? SAMYA KULLAB, correspondent, Ukraine ON THE STATUS OF THE WAR: Ukraine is not winnable in the way maybe Ukrainians had hoped back in 2022, when there were real victories the the failure of the battle for Kyiv the winning back territory and the counter-offensive. The jubilation and the joy from those initial moments has kind of turned into this incredible feeling of gloom and coming to terms with what we’ve always known — that Ukraine is at a terrible disadvantage. I would describe it as being bled out slowly. ON OUTSIDE BACKING: A lot hangs on what kind of support Ukraine will get from allies. And that’s also been wanting. One of the reasons Ukrainian military leaders can’t execute battle plans is because the military support they expected coming from Western allies did not arrive. It did not come on time. But at the same time, those decisions, those battle plans, we have to also look at them and question whether they are, in fact, effective on the battlefield. ON MORALE: The men are just holding onto these defensive lines with everything they have. A year ago, even, I would never hear soldiers say anything negative on record about their leaders. Now people are not only saying it to me on record, they are going online on their social media, with their names, their rank, their units, and telling everyone they know about what is not working. And that, I think, says a lot about where we are. And Ukraine can’t afford to fire anyone. They need as much manpower as possible. There have been tens of thousands of cases of desertion — 100,000 since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. And more than half of that figure is from just the last year. Many of them go back and then leave again, but Ukraine doesn’t have the ability to prosecute 100,000 men. So they much prefer to try to convince them to come back. ON LIFE FOR NONCOMBATANTS: The war is all-encompassing, so you can’t escape that it’s happening. You walk down the street, you look at some lovely little things on sale, and you see a little sign that says, 'Please buy these handmade things. I’m trying to raise money for my husband’s military unit.' There are donation boxes everywhere. The number of amputees I see walking on the street — I see them every single day. And now it’s being more normalized. There is a version of 'The Bachelor' here in Ukraine where the main guy is a double amputee, so it’s becoming more normalized in that way. For people who are not fighting, Kiev feels a bit like a bubble in the sense that there are cafes, there are lovely restaurants, there are bars, people are out. But there’s curfew so by midnight everything is closed and there’s air raid alerts all the time all the time. Today we had almost 200 drones, 90 missiles and one of the largest attacks in at least in a few weeks. So this is all happening around you. ON THE NEAR FUTURE: Two years ago, Zelenskyy would never have said anything about a ceasefire or any kind of agreement that would not include the return of the occupied territories, and now Zelenskyy has said, 'Well, we may not be able to get them back military by military force alone it might be a mix of military and diplomacy. That was a signal to all of us that things have changed. My sense from talking to people in Kyiv is everyone is waiting for Donald Trump and what he will decide. And then the other kind of elephant in the room is, does Russia even want to engage in any kind of negotiation? Why would they? They have the advantage. Another question is, how long can they go? A MEMORABLE MOMENT IN 2024: We found this one woman, and she told us that she had to leave with her children because her daughter was injured. She needed a proper doctor. She couldn’t leave with her husband because her husband had served with Ukraine and the Russians knew that. And so he was basically under house arrest and he had been tortured. So she left and we asked her, were you there during the floods? And she said, yeah, I dragged bodies and I buried them with my own hands. And she described this experience she had of picking up bodies in boats, taking them to the shore and then burying them in the cemetery. And one thing I’ll never forget of what she said was, 'The dead don’t scare me. The living frighten me far more.' We don’t communicate with her anymore, and I still think about where she is, what she’s what she’s going through and the bravery it takes to leave your home and then the bravery it takes to go back to a place that’s not safe. ___ Follow AP's yearend coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/year-in-review.	https://apnews.com/article/wars-ukraine-gaza-israel-lebanon-2024-8e21353182a8543b712cdff8823d1c4a	2024-12-20T04:26:07-08:00	
Crowds in Mayotte vent frustration with cyclone response as Macron tours devastation	MIRERENI, Mayotte (AP) — Crowds in Mayotte vented their frustration at French President Emmanuel Macron, with some booing, as he toured destruction wrought by the strongest cyclone to hit the French territory in nearly a century. Particularly tense scenes on Thursday underscored the discontent that many residents of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean feel toward their government, based about 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) away in Paris. The people of Mayotte, the poorest department in France, have previously said they suffer from underinvestment and neglect by the government. Now, they are expressing disappointment with the response to Cyclone Chido, which hit Saturday. The storm has devastated entire neighborhoods and caused an unknown number of deaths, as many people ignored warnings, thinking the storm wouldn’t be so extreme. Authorities have said hundreds or possibly thousands may be dead, but the official toll rose to 35 on Friday. In the morning, Macron visited a neighborhood in Tsingoni on Mayotte’s main island, where people remain without access to drinking water or phone service nearly a week after the storm. As he walked through the area, some shouted: 'We want water, we want water.' Others, however, offered him a warmer welcome, posing for selfies with the French leader and showing him their children. But the night before, Macron was met with boos from dozens of residents in Pamandzi on another nearby island. As people expressed frustration at the slow pace of aid efforts, Macron grabbed a microphone and became angry. Moving towards the crowd, he said: 'I have nothing to do with the cyclone, you can blame me, it wasn’t me!' Macron, who is known for his appetite for debate and for confronting people who are angry at him, vacillated between acknowledging the hardship and pushing back against criticism. 'You’ve been through something terrible, everyone’s struggling, regardless of skin color,' he said. Visibly losing patience, Macron then shouted: 'If it wasn’t France, you’d be 10,000 times more screwed!' The French president added: 'There’s no place in the Indian Ocean where people get so much help!' A woman could be heard saying 'we disagree.' In a reflection of further frustration, a woman working with local authorities in Mayotte’s capital told The Associated Press on Friday that many deaths recorded by officials on the ground have not yet been published in official tallies. The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, said most of the people who died were migrants, living in the hills in flimsy houses. Mayotte is home to 320,000 residents and an estimated 100,000 additional migrants. The woman was not able to give her own estimate. The reported death toll has only slowly ticked up in the week since the cyclone hit and stood at 35 on Friday, even though authorities have said they know that is a dramatic undercount. Many in Mayotte have expressed disbelief that the toll hasn’t been updated more quickly. The Interior Ministry said Friday that in addition to the deaths, 67 people were seriously injured and more than 2,400 slightly injured. 'The number of deaths does not reflect the reality of the 100,000 people living in precarious housing,' the statement said. 'The prefect has therefore ordered the deputy prefect to set up a mission to search for the dead.' It said 70% of residents were 'seriously affected.' The government said it has created a way to count the dead by ordering a census of the population district by district, with the help of mayors and local associations. In just one example of how the toll might grow, French Health Minister Geneviève Darrieussecq said Friday that about 17% of hospital staff and 40% of all regional health staff on the archipelago are still unaccounted for. 'That’s around 60 to 70 people,' she said on news broadcaster FranceInfo, stressing a large part of the population still has no access to phone service. Meanwhile, French military and local authorities scrambled to repair busted water pipes across the islands and get water to villages who haven’t had any. In the village of Mirereni, about 35 kilometers (20 miles) outside Mayotte’s capital, Civil Security officers were trying to remove a large, felled mango tree that busted a water pipe. The pipe provides water to around 10,000 people in three nearby villages. But officials said repairing it might take longer than usual because of the heat, which impacts equipment. Locals said they’re worried the lack of water would cause disease. Earlier this year, there was a cholera outbreak on the island, with at least 200 cases. Mayotte is part an archipelago located between Africa’s east coast and Madagascar that had been a French colony. Its residents voted to remain part of France in a 1974 referendum while the rest of the islands became the independent nation of Comoros. In recent decades, the French territory has seen massive migration from Comoros, one of the world’s poorest countries, most of whom entered and live illegally in Mayotte. Macron said Friday fighting illegal immigration was key to state efforts to get Mayotte back on track. 'When you have schools where the population has multiplied by five in two years, when you have hospitals that are exploding under migration pressure, they feel they are being abandoned even if the state is doing a lot,' he said. 'We won’t be able to solve Mayotte’s fundamental problems unless we solve the problem of illegal immigration.' He has proposed rules that would apply to the territory in order to reduce the numbers of people coming in illegally. On Thursday, he also announced a special law that would help rebuild Mayotte more quickly and would seek to destroy slums and replace tin shacks with more solid buildings. ___ Corbet reported from Paris.

7 inmates are dead after a prison riot in southern Mexico	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Seven inmates were killed in a prison riot in southern Mexico, when inmates resisting transfers to other jails fought police with guns and knives, authorities said. Four police officers and six other inmates were injured in the riot in the city of Villahermosa, the capital of the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. State police chief Víctor Hugo Chávez said late Thursday that officers were met by gunfire early in the day when they entered the prison to transfer two dangerous inmates to a federal penitentiary. One of the inmates with a gun held out for about three hours, protected by 20 fellow prisoners. Chávez did not specify if police opened fire on the group, but said: 'Authorities have to act to defend their own lives, too.' Fires also broke out in the prison during the riot, and crowds of angry, desperate relatives gathered outside the prison, demanding information about family members locked up inside. After regaining control of the facility several hours later, authorities found an assault rifle, five pistols, a hand grenade, 23 machetes, 14 knives and 23 homemade shivs. They did not explain how the firearms got into the prison. Jails in Mexico are known for notoriously loose controls and corruption, to the extent that gangs at some penitentiaries control their own cell blocks and extort other prisoners for protection money. President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday the riot would be investigated to see 'if there was any collusion' and 'to see if the (police) operation was correct and why they found weapons inside the prison.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-prison-riot-seven-inmates-killed-877490356e06f155c650d1ff602e06c6	2024-12-20T03:10:22-08:00	
Diplomatic spat erupts after Hungary gives asylum to Polish politician suspected of corruption	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Hungary has given political asylum to a Polish opposition politician who is wanted on suspicions of corruption, triggering a diplomatic spat that worsened on Friday. Poland's government decried Hungary's decision as a 'hostile act,' and Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that he was dismayed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's decision to shelter a man being sought on suspicions of defrauding the state of millions of zlotys. The Polish Foreign Ministry said Friday morning that it has summoned its ambassador to Hungary back home for 'indefinite consultations.' It also summoned the Hungarian ambassador in Warsaw to give him a protest note. The matter centers on the case of a former deputy justice minister, Marcin Romanowski, but also reveals a clash over rule of law and democracy. Tusk took office last year vowing to restore democratic norms and fight corruption that has prevailed under the national conservative government of Law and Justice. As part of that effort, his government has been seeking to bring to justice some former government officials who allegedly broke the law during the eight-year rule of Law and Justice. 'I did not expect corrupt politicians escaping justice would be able to choose between (Belarusian President Alexander) Lukashenko and Orbán,' Tusk said on Friday. Hungary on Thursday offered political asylum to Romanowski, who is wanted under a European arrest warrant. Romanowski through his lawyer argues that he is the victim of political retribution by Tusk's government. Gergely Gulyás, Orbán’s chief of staff. said that Budapest believed that Romanowski wouldn’t receive a fair trial in Poland. Both Poland and Hungary are members of the 27-member European Union, and Poland believes Budapest's move is 'an action contrary to the fundamental principle of loyal cooperation' as laid out in the EU treaties. 'We consider the decision of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government to grant political asylum to Marcin Romanowski, wanted under the European Arrest Warrant, to be an act hostile towards the Republic of Poland and contrary to the elementary principles binding on the member states of the European Union,' the ministry said. The Polish prosecutor's office has accused Romanowski of committing 11 crimes, including criminal group and rigging tenders, and the misappropriation of millions.	https://apnews.com/article/poland-hungary-asylum-politician-dispute-6c528154f2ca2a67ef45fad333aa1984	2024-12-20T02:40:48-08:00	
The Latest: 2 journalists working for Kurdish media killed in clashes in northern Syria	A journalists’ association says two reporters working for Kurdish media outlets have been killed in clashes between Syrian Kurdish militia and Turkish-backed fighters in northern Syria. Fighting in parts of Syria continues despite the fall of President Bashar Assad. Elsewhere in Syria, the transition following the government’s fall has been smooth so far, although it’s been less than two weeks since Assad was ousted by a lightning rebel advance on the capital Damascus. The country is home to diverse sects, and there is ongoing fear and uncertainty among minority groups, including Christians, regarding their rights and safety under the main rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, once an affiliate of al-Qaida. ___ Here’s the latest: KURDISH JOURNALISTS KILLED IN NORTHERN SYRIA ANKARA, Turkey - A journalists' association says two journalists working for Kurdish media outlets were killed in northern Syria while covering fighting between Turkish-backed fighters and Syrian Kurdish militia. Turkey-based Dicle-Firat Journalists Association said Friday Nazim Dastan and Cihan Bilgin were killed Thursday after their vehicle was reportedly targeted by a Turkish drone on a road near the Tishrin Dam. Tishrin Dam, located some 90 kilometers east of Aleppo, has been the scene of clashes between the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, SDF, and the Turkey-backed opposition forces. There was no immediate comment from Turkish officials. Bianet, a news website dedicated to human rights issues, said Bilgin was a reporter for the Kurdish Hawar News Agency, while Dastan worked as a freelance journalist for the Firat News Agency, which is associated with the militant group, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Turkey considers the SDF as a terrorist organization because its main component is a group aligned to the PKK. The group has been engaged in an armed struggle against the Turkish state since the 1980s in pursuit of its objective to secure autonomy for Kurds in the country. IOM head: Large-scale return of Syrians would ‘overwhelm’ Syria GENEVA – The head of the U.N. migration agency says that large-scale returns of Syrians to their homeland at this stage would 'overwhelm' the country. Syria’s civil war has displaced millions of people since 2011. The fall of Bashar Assad’s government earlier this month has fueled talk in some of the countries where they went of the refugees’ return. Amy Pope, the director-general of the International Organization for Migration, told reporters Friday after returning from a visit to Syria that her agency’s message to countries in Europe and elsewhere is that 'this is not the moment to talk about large-scale returns.' Pope said that communities 'are just not ready to absorb the people who are displaced and would come back.' She argued that if 'overwhelming numbers' of people return, 'it will overwhelm the country and it could risk more disruptive impact on a very fragile peace process.' Pope said it’s right to support individuals on a case-by-case basis who want to go home or know that their place of origin is safe, but that efforts now need to focus on the humanitarian situation, recovery and rebuilding. Swedish government ending ‘core support’ for the UN relief agency for Palestinians STOCKHOLM - The Swedish government says it is ending its 'core support' for the United Nations relief agency for Palestinians. The government said Friday that 800 million kronor ($72.4 million) being allocated for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the region next year will go through the channels of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and the government’s support for other agencies such as the World Food Program, the U.N. Children’s Fund, the U.N. Population Fund and the International Committee of the Red Cross. In October, Israel’s parliament approved legislation banning UNRWA’s activities in the Palestinian territories, a measure that was to take effect in 90 days. Sweden’s minister for international development cooperation and foreign trade, Benjamin Dousa, posted on X that the Israeli decision will make much of UNRWA’s work difficult or impossible. He said that Swedish aid must arrive and not get stuck in a bank account en route, and that the Israeli parliament’s decision forces it to pass on support to other organizations. Dousa added that UNRWA is undergoing a crisis of confidence. Sweden provided 451 million kronor to UNRWA this year.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-turkey-kurds-unwra-refugees-f640c60934d865775f8fc7fd64422a2b	2024-12-20T01:24:55-08:00	
A teenager stabs a 7-year-old to death and wounds a teacher and 3 more children in a Croatian school	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — A knife-wielding teenager walked into a school in Croatia’s capital on Friday, stabbed a 7-year-old girl to death and wounded three more children and their teacher, authorities said. The attack took place around 9:50 a.m. on the last day of school before Christmas at the Precko Elementary School in the Zagreb neighborhood of the same name. It caters for children between the ages of 7 and 15. 'The attacker is a 19-year-old who is a former student of that school and still lives nearby,' said Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic. 'Eventually he started injuring himself. Police prevented him from committing suicide.' Bozinovic said the attacker had mental health problems and had made a previous attempt to kill himself. 'It is hard to say this person was mentally balanced.' School attacks are rare in Croatia and in the Balkans as a whole, although in May 2023, a teenager in neighboring Serbia opened fire at a school in the capital, Belgrade, killing nine fellow students and a school guard. Video footage broadcast by Croatian media on Friday showed children running away from the school building and a medical helicopter landing in the schoolyard. Authorities in Croatia declared Saturday a day or mourning and canceled some of the Christmas festivities. Candidates for the upcoming presidential election said they were temporarily suspending their campaigns because of the tragedy. President Zoran Milanovic said 'there are no words to describe the grief over the horrible and unthinkable tragedy that shocked us all today.' Milanovic called for unity and an effort to ensure that schools are a safe and carefree place for children. Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said at a government session that he was 'appalled' by the attack and that authorities are still working to determine exactly what happened.. —— Associated Press writers Jovana Gec and Dusan Stojanovic in Belgrade, Serbia, contributed to this story. —— This story has been corrected to make clear that the attack in Serbia was in May 2023.	https://apnews.com/article/croatia-zagreb-school-attack-1fe667b5f8322b89c3352b8a498d3498	2024-12-20T01:13:19-08:00	
France's anti-terrorism court convicts 8 people of involvement in the 2020 beheading of a teacher	PARIS (AP) — France’s anti-terrorism court on Friday convicted eight people of involvement in the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty outside his school near Paris four years ago, a horrific death that shocked the country. Paty, 47, was killed outside his school on Oct. 16, 2020, days after showing his class cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a debate on free expression. The assailant, an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen origin, was shot to death by police. Those who have been on trial on terrorism charges at a special court in Paris since the end of November were accused, in some cases, of providing assistance to the perpetrator and, in others, of organizing a hate campaign online before the murder took place. The 540-seat courtroom in central Paris was packed for the verdict, which marked the final chapter of the Paty trial. The atmosphere became charged as the lead judge delivered the sentences. Families of the accused, seated on the benches, reacted strongly — there were gasps, cries, shouts, and even ironic clapping erupted, prompting the judge to pause several times and call for silence. 'They lied about my brother,' shouted one relative. Another woman, crying on the shoulder of a family member, exclaimed, 'They took my baby from me,' before being escorted out by police officers. Heavy surveillance, with over 50 police officers, kept order during the tense session. Prosecutors had requested sentences ranging from 18 months suspended imprisonment to 16 years in prison against the defendants. They include friends of assailant Abdoullakh Anzorov, who allegedly helped purchase weapons for the attack and the father of a schoolgirl whose lies started the fatal spiral of events. The national anti-terrorism prosecutor had asked the court to downgrade the offenses of four of the eight defendants, prompting ire from Paty's family. 'It's more than a disappointment,' Paty's sister Mickaëlle earlier told broadcaster TF1. 'In a moment like this, it feels like one is fighting for nothing.' Also, the public prosecutor dropped the charge of complicity in favor of a lower charge of association with a terrorist enterprise against the two young men accused of providing the logistical support to the killer. He asked for 14 years in prison for Naïm Boudaoud and 16 years for Azim Epsirkhanov. The attack occurred against a backdrop of protests in many Muslim countries and calls online for violence targeting France and the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The newspaper had republished its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad a few weeks before Paty’s death to mark the opening of the trial over deadly 2015 attacks on its newsroom by Islamic extremists. The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims, who saw them as sacrilegious. But the fallout from Paty’s killing reinforced the French state’s commitment to freedom of expression and its firm attachment to secularism in public life. His death left an imprint on the nation, and several schools in France are now named after Paty. Much attention at the trial focused on Brahim Chnina, the Muslim father of a teenager who was 13 at the time and claimed that she had been excluded from Paty’s class when he showed the caricatures on Oct. 5, 2020. Chnina, 52, sent a series of messages to his contacts denouncing Paty, saying that 'this sick man' needed to be fired, along with the address of the school in the Paris suburb of Conflans Saint-Honorine. In reality, Chnina’s daughter had lied to him and had never attended the lesson in question. Paty was giving a lesson mandated by the National Education Ministry on freedom of expression. He discussed the caricatures in this context, saying students who did not wish to see them could temporarily leave the classroom. An online campaign against Paty snowballed, and 11 days after the lesson, Anzorov attacked the teacher with a knife as he walked home, and displayed the teacher’s head on social media. Police later shot Anzorov as he advanced toward them, armed. Chnina is accused of alleged association with a terrorist enterprise for targeting the 47-year-old teacher through false information. The public prosecutor requested a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment for him His daughter was tried last year in a juvenile court and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Four other students at Paty’s school were found guilty of involvement and given suspended sentences; a fifth, who pointed out Paty to Anzorov in exchange for money, was given a 6-month term with an electronic bracelet. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, who presented himself as a spokesperson for Imams of France although he had been dismissed from that role, is another key figure in the trial. He filmed a video in front of the school with the father of the student. He referred to the teacher as a 'thug' multiple times and sought to pressure the school administration via social media. Prosecutors have requested a 12-year sentence for him. Some of the defendants expressed regrets and claimed their innocence on the eve of the verdict. They did not convince Paty's family. 'It’s something that really shocks the family,' lawyer Virginie Le Roy said. 'You get the feeling that those in the box are absolutely unwilling to admit any responsibility whatsoever. Apologies are pointless, they won’t bring Samuel back, but explanations are precious to us. But, unfortunately I have to make a more than mixed assessment. We haven’t had many explanations of the facts.' ___ Petrequin reported from London.	https://apnews.com/article/france-teacher-beheading-trial-paty-c03c4c29bef324fbe6dc3095a425ba9a	2024-12-20T01:05:19-08:00	
Taiwan lawmakers clash after party members break into legislature to occupy speaker's chair	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Lawmakers clashed in Taiwan's legislature Friday when members of a leading political party who had broken into the building overnight to occupy the speaker's chair tussled with members of another major party who forced their way in to evict them. Some lawmakers were injured in the clash, according to Taiwan media reports. At issue are three bills being pushed by the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, including one that critics say would paralyze the Constitutional Court. Lawmakers from the Democratic Progressive Party removed windows to get into the building Thursday night and take over the speaker's area, piling up a wall of chairs to block access, Taiwan's Central News Agency said. Photos and videos of the morning clash showed a crush of lawmakers pushing and shoving each other as Nationalist members barged in en masse to take control and allow the speaker, Han Kuo-yu, take his position. No details were immediately available on the injuries. The Democratic Progressive Party, known as the DPP, was attempting to block any votes on the bills. Neither they nor the Nationalists, known as the KMT, won a majority in the last legislative election, but the KMT has teamed up with a minor party to take control of the legislature. Taiwan's president, Lai Ching-te, is from the DPP. A DPP leader said in a social media video Thursday night that the party's actions were extreme but that it had no other options, the Central News Agency reported. Negotiations on the bills have failed to resolve differences between the parties. Besides restricting the court, the bills would make a public recall of elected officials more difficult and redistribute tax revenues by giving a larger share to local governments. Thousands of DPP supporters protested outside the legislature on Thursday night and Friday. Lawmakers in Taiwan have brawled in the past. In 2020, they threw pig guts at each other over a government decision to lift a ban on the import of U.S. pork and beef.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-legislature-brawl-clash-tussle-lawmakers-a832d9cee2bc99e7f46ba70a3defe3e9	2024-12-20T00:51:57-08:00	
Russian missiles target Kyiv after Ukraine fires US-made missiles across the border	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian ballistic missile attack on Ukraine’s capital Kyiv early Friday killed at least one person and injured nine others, officials said. Moscow claimed it was in response to a Ukrainian strike on Russian soil using American-made weapons. At least three loud blasts were heard in Kyiv shortly before sunrise. Ukraine’s air force said it intercepted five Iskander short-range ballistic missiles fired at the city. The attack knocked out heating to 630 residential buildings, 16 medical facilities, and 30 schools and kindergartens, the city administration said, and falling missile debris caused damage and sparked fires in three districts. 'We ask citizens to immediately respond to reports of ballistic attack threats, because there is very little time to find shelter,' the air force said. During the almost three years since the war began Russia has regularly bombarded civilian areas of Ukraine, often in an attempt to cripple the power grid and unnerve Ukrainians. Meanwhile Ukraine, struggling to hold back Russia's bigger army on the front line, has attempted to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country’s war effort. The Russian Ministry of Defense said the strike was in response to a Ukrainian missile attack on Russia's Rostov border region two days earlier. That attack used six American-made Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, missiles and four Storm Shadow air-launched missiles provided by the United Kingdom, it said. That day, Ukraine claimed to have targeted a Rostov oil refinery as part of its campaign to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country's war effort. The use of Western-supplied weapons to strike Russia has angered the Kremlin. Ukraine fired several American-supplied longer-range missiles into Russia for the first time on Nov. 19 after Washington eased restrictions on their use. That development prompted Russia to use a new hypersonic missile, called Oreshnik, for the first time. President Vladimir Putin suggested the missile could be used to target government buildings in Kyiv, though there have been no reports of an Oreshnik being used for a second time. Answering the Ukrainian attack on Rostov on Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said it carried out a group strike with 'high-precision, long-range weapons' on the command center of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency and another location where it said Ukraine’s Neptune missile systems are designed and produced. The attack also targeted Ukrainian ground-based cruise missile systems and U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems, the Defense Ministry said. 'The objectives of the strike have been achieved. All objects are hit,' the defense ministry said in a Telegram post. Its claims could not immediately be verified. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Russia claimed Friday's attack was in response to a Ukrainian strike on Dec. 18, not earlier Friday. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-missiles-47036510cfba6f0c58b490613d2e0ff1	2024-12-19T23:48:13-08:00	
Malaysia agrees to resume 'no find, no fee' hunt for flight MH370, 10 years after plane disappeared	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia's government has agreed in principle to accept a second 'no find, no fee' proposal from a U.S. company to renew the hunt for flight MH370, which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean more than 10 years ago, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said Friday. Loke said Cabinet ministers gave the nod at their meeting last week for Texas-based marine robotics firm Ocean Infinity to continue the seabed search operation at a new 15,000-square-kilometer (5,800-square-mile) site in the ocean next year. 'The proposed new search area, identified by Ocean Infinity, is based on the latest information and data analyses conducted by experts and researchers. The company’s proposal is credible,' he said in a statement. The Boeing 777 plane vanished from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, on a flight from Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing. Satellite data showed the plane deviated from its flight path to head over the southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed. An expensive multinational search failed to turn up any clues, although debris washed ashore on the east African coast and Indian Ocean islands. A private search in 2018 by Ocean Infinity also found nothing. Under the new deal, Ocean Infinity will get $70 million only if significant wreckage is discovered, Loke said. He said his ministry will finalize negotiations with Ocean Infinity in early 2025. The firm has indicated that January-April is the best period for the search, he said. 'This decision reflects the government’s commitment to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of MH370 passengers,' he added. Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Punkett earlier this year reportedly said the the company had improved its technology since 2018. He has said the firm is working with many experts to analyze data and narrow the search area to the most likely site.	https://apnews.com/article/malaysia-missing-plane-mh370-14f8de88d4b74bb41a5f110434c52838	2024-12-19T23:19:57-08:00	
Giant sloths and mastodons coexisted with humans for millennia in Americas, new discoveries suggest	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) — Sloths weren’t always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge — up to 4 tons (3.6 metric tons) — and when startled, they brandished immense claws. For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America. But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier — perhaps far earlier — than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts. 'There was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly — what’s called ‘Pleistocene overkill,’' said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that 'humans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.' Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms — a bit like the plates of modern armadillos — that may have been used to make decorations. In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher Mírian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there’s a tiny hole near one edge. 'We believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,' she said. Three similar 'pendant' fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table — those are rough-surfaced and without any holes. These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old — more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas. Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco’s research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving 'fresh bones' shortly after the animals died. Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas — and the effect they had on the environment they found. 'There’s still a big debate,' Pacheco said. Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story. Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. 'What I learned in school was that Clovis was first,' she said. Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago. This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America — giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia. And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time — with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% — many researchers surmised that humans’ arrival led to mass extinctions. 'It was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,' said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution’s Human Origins Program. 'But it doesn’t really work so well anymore.' In the past 30 years, new research methods — including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques — coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing. 'Anything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,' said Richard Fariña, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. 'But really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.' In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified. 'We found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process' in 'fresh bones' — meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later. Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. One of her collaborators, paleontologist Thaís Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires. Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites — whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn’t clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration. The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile. Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants. 'Monte Verde was a shock. You’re here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,' said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde. Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas. Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizcaíno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made 'cut marks' on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago. At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it’s hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools. 'They’ve made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,' said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. 'Why would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?' Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. 'We didn’t set out to find the oldest anything — we’ve really just followed the evidence where it leads,' he said. While the exact timing of humans’ arrival in the Americas remains contested — and may never be known — it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn’t immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered. And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions. As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows 'a giant ground sloth going along on four feet' when it encounters the footprints of a small human who’s recently dashed by. The huge animal 'stops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.' ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

For thousands of Jews, Israel still doesn't feel safe after the Oct. 7 attacks. So they're leaving	LONDON (AP) — Leaving Israel is easier, Shira Z. Carmel thinks, by saying it's just for now. But she knows better. For the Israeli-born singer and an increasing number of relatively well-off Israelis, the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack shattered any sense of safety and along with it, Israel's founding promise: to be the world's safe haven for Jews. That day, thousands of Hamas militants blew past the country's border defenses, killed 1,200 people and dragged 250 more into Gaza in a siege that caught the Israeli army by surprise and stunned a nation that prides itself on military prowess. This time, during what became known as Israel's 9/11, the army didn't come for hours. Ten days later, a pregnant Carmel, her husband and their toddler boarded a flight to Australia, which was looking for people in her husband's profession. And they spun the explanation to friends and family as something other than permanent — 'relocation' is the easier-to-swallow term — acutely aware of the familial strain and the shame that have shadowed Israelis who leave for good. 'We told them we're going to get out of the line of fire for awhile,' Carmel said more than a year later from her family's new home in Melbourne. 'It wasn't a hard decision. But it was very hard to talk to them about it. It was even hard to admit it to ourselves.' Thousands of Israelis have left the country since Oct. 7, 2023, according to government statistics and immigration tallies released by destination countries such as Canada and Germany. There's concern about whether it will drive a 'brain drain' in sectors like medicine and tech. Migration experts say it's possible people leaving Israel will surpass the number of immigrants to Israel in 2024, according to Sergio DellaPergola, a statistician and professor emeritus of Hebrew University in Jerusalem. 'In my view, this year people entering will be smaller than the total of the exit,' he said. 'And this is quite unique in the existence of the State of Israel.' Early information points to a surge of Israelis leaving The Oct. 7 effect on Israeli emigration is enough for prominent Israelis to acknowledge the phenomenon publicly — and warn of rising antisemitism elsewhere. 'There is one thing that worries me in particular: talks about leaving the country. This must not happen,' former premier Naftali Bennett, a staunch critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, tweeted in June after a conversation with friends who were leaving. Israel, he wrote, needs to retain the talent. 'Who wants to return to the days of the wandering Jew, without real freedom, without a state, subject to every anti-Semitic whim?' Thousands of Israelis have opted to pay the financial, emotional and social costs of moving out since the Oct. 7 attack, according to government statistics and families who spoke to The Associated Press in recent months after emigrating to Canada, Spain and Australia. Israel's overall population continues to grow toward 10 million people. But it's possible that 2024 ends with more Israelis leaving the country than coming in. That's even as Israel and Hezbollah reached a fragile ceasefire along the border with Lebanon and Israel and Hamas inch toward a pause in Gaza. Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics estimated in September that 40,600 Israelis departed long-term over the first seven months of 2024, a 59% increase over the same period a year earlier, when 25,500 people left. Monthly, 2,200 more people departed this year than in 2023, CBS reported. The Israeli Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, which does not deal with people leaving, said more than 33,000 people have moved to Israel since the start of the war, about on par with previous years. The interior minister refused to comment for this story. The numbers are equally dramatic in destination countries. More than 18,000 Israelis applied for German citizenship in 2024, more than double the same period in 2023 and three times that of the year before, the Interior Ministry reported in September. Canada, which has a three-year work visa program for Israelis and Palestinians fleeing the war, received 5,759 applications for work permits from Israeli citizens between January and October this year, the government told The Associated Press. In 2023, that number was 1,616 applications, and a year earlier the tally was 1,176 applications, according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada. ‘They want to wake up in the morning and enjoy life’ Other clues, too, point to a notable departure of Israelis since the Oct. 7 attacks. Gil Fire, deputy director of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, said that some of its star specialists with fellowship postings of a few years in other countries began to waver about returning. 'Before the war, they always came back and it was not really considered an option to stay. And during the war we started to see a change,' he said. 'They said to us, ‘We will stay another year, maybe two years, maybe more.’' Fire says it’s 'an issue of concern' enough for him to plan in-person visits with these doctors in the coming months to try to draw them back to Israel. Michal Harel, who moved with her husband to Toronto in 2019, said that almost immediately after the attacks the phone began ringing — with other Israelis seeking advice about moving to Canada. On Nov. 23, 2023, the couple set up a website to help Israelis navigate moving, which can cost at least 100,000 Israeli shekels, or about $28,000, Harel and other Israeli relocation experts said. Not everyone in Israel can just pack up and move overseas. Many of those who have made the move have foreign passports, jobs at multinational corporations or can work remotely. People in Gaza have even less choice. The vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced by relentless Israeli bombing since Oct. 7, 2023, yet no one has been able to leave the enclave since May. Before then, at least 100,000 Palestinians are believed to have left Gaza. Health officials in Gaza say Israeli bombing has killed more than 45,000 people. Speaking by phone last month, Harel reported that the site has received views from 100,000 unique visitors and 5,000 direct contacts in 2024 alone. 'It's people who want to move quickly with families, to wake up in the morning and enjoy life,' she said. 'Right now (in Israel), it's trauma, trauma, trauma.' 'Some of them,' Harel added, 'they want to keep everything a secret.' Leaving Zion, a threat to Israel and a shame? Aliya — the Hebrew term for immigration, literally the 'ascent' of Jews into Israel — has always been part of the country's plan. But 'yerida' — the term used for leaving the country, literally the 'descent' of Jews from Israel to the diaspora, emphatically has not. For Israel's first decades of independence, the government strongly discouraged departing Israelis, who were seen in some cases as cowardly and even treasonous. A sacred trust and a social contract took root in Israeli society. The terms go — or went — like this: Israeli citizens would serve in the military and pay high taxes. In exchange, the army would keep them safe. Meanwhile, it’s every Jew’s obligation to stay, work and fight for Israel’s survival. 'Emigration was a threat, especially in the early years (when) there were problems of nation-building. In later decades, Israel became more established and more self-confident,' said Ori Yehudai, a professor of Israel studies at Ohio State University and the author of 'Leaving Zion,' a history of Israeli emigration. The sense of shame is more of a social dynamic now, he said, but 'people still feel they have to justify their decision to move.' Shira Carmel says she has no doubt about her decision. She'd long objected to Netanyahu's government's efforts to overhaul the legal system, and was one of the first women to don the blood-red 'Handmaid's Tale' robes that became a fixture of the anti-government protests of 2023. She was terrified as a new mom, and a pregnant one, during the Hamas attack, and appalled at having to tell her toddler that they were gathering in the bomb shelter for 'hugging parties' with the neighbors. This was not the life she wanted. Meanwhile, Australia beckoned. Carmel's brother had lived there for two decades. The couple had the equivalent of a green card due to Carmel's husband's profession. In the days after the attack, Carmel's brother alerted her to the possibility of a flight out of Israel for free, if on very short notice, which she confirmed with the Australian embassy in Israel. Basic logic, she says, pointed toward moving. And yet. Carmel recalls the frenzied hours before the flight out in which she said to her husband in the privacy of their bedroom: 'My God, are we really doing this?' They decided not to decide, opting instead for: 'We're just getting on a plane for now, being grateful.' They packed lightly. On the ground half a world away, weeks became months. And they decided: 'I’m not going to go back to try to give birth in the war.' In December, they told their families back in Israel that they were staying 'for now.' 'We don't define it as ‘forever,’' Carmel said Tuesday. 'But we are for sure staying for the foreseeable future.' ___ Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Jerusalem and Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.

Gisele Pelicot's Australian supporters are moved that their French heroine wore an Aboriginal scarf	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A group of Gisele Pelicot’s Australian admirers said Friday they're moved that the victim in France’s notorious drugging-and-rape case has acknowledged her distant supporters Down Under by wearing a scarf adorned with Aboriginal art. The 71-year-old who refused to remain an anonymous victim wore the silk scarf several times during the court process in Avignon, including when 51 men were convicted and sentenced to prison for molesting her after she had been drugged by her former husband, Dominique Pelicot. The scarf was a 220 Australian dollar ($137) gift from a Sydney-based rights advocacy group, Older Women’s Network, its chief executive Yumi Lee said. 'We were astounded, absolutely gobsmacked, honored that she accepted our gesture of solidarity,' Lee said. Lee, 59, said her group with 1,000 members across New South Wales state, who campaign on issues including sexual violence, raised donations to buy the scarf in September when the court case was already underway. They decided on the gesture because Avignon, 17,000 kilometers (11,000 miles) from Sydney, was too distant for most to travel to demonstrate their support in person, Lee said. Gisele Pelicot 'has said that shame has to change sides and she wants all the victims of sexual assault to think that if she can do it, they can too,' Lee said. 'She has also proven that sexual assault knows no barriers. Everyone from young to old are victims of sexual assault. So she’s busted that myth,' Lee added. Lee said she was surprised that Gisele Pelicot’s lawyer wrote to her group to acknowledge the receipt of the scarf. 'Her lawyer wrote to us to say she has received it and was interested in the fact that it’s a First Nation’s design and that she will be wearing it in court. So she has worn it a few times,' Lee said. The scarf is a reproduction of the art of Indigenous painter Mulyatingki Marney. It depicts a cluster of saltwater pools known for their healing properties on Marney’s traditional land, the retailer One of Twelve said on its website. The Canberra-based business showcases art from the Asia-Pacific region and pays the artists royalties from the sales of scarves, ties and woven bags from Papua New Guinea called bilums. 'We picked this design because, number one, it’s beautiful, it’s got lovely colors, it’s drawn by a First Nations, older woman and it’s story about healing,' Lee said. One of Twelve owner Anna Saboisky said the attention Gisele Pelicot had brought to their scarf had overwhelmed the tiny business. A second print run of scarves had almost sold out and a third run was on the way. 'Since I woke up this morning, I’ve had about 20 orders placed online,' Saboisky said. 'We’re just a small business. It’s completely unprecedented to have so much interest in one scarf,' she added. Lee said if Avignon had not been so far away, 'we would be there shouting.' ,	https://apnews.com/article/australia-gisele-pelicot-indigenous-scarf-f286d7cd0d15ea9a446d3d9a3899db65	2024-12-19T21:45:46-08:00	
What to know about Vanuatu, the Pacific island nation struggling to recover from a massive quake	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A search expanded on Thursday for those killed or trapped alive by an earthquake in the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, as rescue workers arriving from abroad fanned out through the capital, Port Vila, encountering flattened buildings that had not yet been searched. Three days after the violent magnitude 7.3 quake struck just offshore from Vanuatu's most populous island, uncertainty persisted about the number of people dead and wounded. Damage was concentrated in Port Vila’s downtown area and the official figure of 10 confirmed deaths and more than 200 people injured was a day old and likely to rise, officials said. Not all of those killed or hurt had been brought to a hospital and would not be included in the figures, aid agencies said. Some residents were scared to visit badly-damaged Vila Central Hospital, the main treatment facility. Nearly 1,000 people were displaced, according to United Nations figures. Aid workers estimated about 20,000 people were likely without water. Water shortage threatens a fresh crisis The biggest threat was the spread of illness from people drinking contaminated water, said Brecht Mommen, a UNICEF water, sanitation and hygiene specialist based in Vanuatu. 'It’s a rush against time to get water trucks organized for those areas so that we prevent a second disaster, which is a diarrhea outbreak,' he said. It was still unclear where broken pipes were located in the immense network servicing Port Vila and it was unknown how long it would take to find and fix them all, Mommen added. Rain and landslides slow relief efforts Relief efforts were hampered by blocked roads, traffic jams and patchy communications. Rain forecast in the next few days threatens to worsen landslides prompted by the quake. They included a major slip that has blocked Vanuatu’s sea port. The airport, currently open only for humanitarian flights, will resume commercial airline operations on Sunday, according to local news outlets. It prompted quiet hope for a return to normal among residents accustomed to life in one of the world’s most natural disaster-prone countries. But analysts said the problems that afflicted Vanuatu before Tuesday’s quake were likely to hinder recovery. A perilous island paradise Vanuatu is an scenic, sprawling archipelago covering a vast expanse of South Pacific Ocean that lies between Australia and Fiji. More than 80 coral and volcanic islands are home to 330,000 people. Perched on the Pacific ring of fire – a belt of tectonic plates and volcanoes – Vanuatu is regularly jolted by earthquakes, though none in living memory as large as Tuesday’s. The country is also among the world’s most imperiled by climate change. Earlier this month Vanuatu led a group of small island nations in a landmark case on the matter in the top United Nations court. The country's envoys argued that as rising seas threaten the existence of Vanuatu and other nations, major polluting countries should be ordered to take more responsibility for curbing their emissions. A struggle to lure tourists back Lush tropical forests and azure seas make the country a popular destination for holidaymakers from Australia and New Zealand, and tourism accounts for about 40% of the economy. The other major contributor is agriculture, with products exported or sold to tourist resorts. Disasters of recent years have frustrated its growth. Visitor numbers dwindled during the coronavirus pandemic and had barely started to recover before three major cyclones in 2023 dealt another blow. In May, the country’s national airline collapsed. Political uncertainty could stall recovery Vanuatu is currently led by a caretaker government after President Nikenike Vurobaravu dissolved Parliament in November as Prime Minister Charlot Salwai faced a no-confidence vote. Salwai, now the caretaker leader, is Vanuatu’s fourth Prime Minister in four years, with his predecessor toppled in a confidence vote in 2023 after a month in office. A snap election is due in January. 'This is one of the most turbulent political systems in this part of the world,' said Riley Duke, a Pacific analyst at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. The political chaos has bred a 'permanent short-term focus', he said, and has deterred some funders of badly-needed development projects. Part of a bigger geopolitical contest Vanuatu has become part of a wider strategic battle for the Pacific in recent years as western countries seek to counter China’s growing influence. Australia is still Vanuatu’s biggest donor, but the government has increasingly looked to China to fund infrastructure and building projects including work this year on a presidential palace. In the process, it has amassed sizeable loans and was rated at high risk of debt distress by the International Monetary Fund before this week’s quake. 'There’s going to be a drive by the next government to secure additional financing, which opens the door to more interest in external financing,' said Duke. 'That obviously has secondary effects for geopolitics.'	https://apnews.com/article/vanuatu-earthquake-pacific-australia-china-recovery-5ad23ef3f4c869285475825234dd5b3e	2024-12-19T21:27:40-08:00	
US drops $10M terrorism bounty offered for capture of Syrian rebel leader who ousted Assad	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The Biden administration said Friday it has decided not to pursue a $10 million reward it had offered for the capture of a Syrian rebel leader whose forces led the ouster of President Bashar Assad earlier this month. The announcement followed a meeting in Damascus between the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, and the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, who led the first U.S. diplomatic delegation into Syria since Assad's ouster. HTS remains designated a foreign terrorist organization, and Leaf would not say if sanctions stemming from that designation would be eased. But, she told reporters that al-Sharaa had committed to renouncing terrorism and as a result the U.S. would no longer offer the reward. 'We discussed the critical need to ensure terrorist groups cannot pose a threat inside Syria or externally, including to the U.S. and our partners in the region,' she said. 'Based on our discussion, I told him that we would not be pursuing the Rewards for Justice reward offered,' Leaf said in a telephone news conference from Jordan where she traveled after visiting Syria. Leaf and other U.S. officials have said al-Sharaa’s public statements about protecting minority and women’s rights are welcomed, but they remain skeptical that he will follow through on them in the long run. 'He came across as pragmatic,' she said. 'It was a good first meeting. We will judge by deeds not just by words.' The US. delegation's visit was aimed at pushing for an inclusive government and seeking information on the whereabouts of missing American journalist Austin Tice. Along with Leaf, former special envoy for Syria Daniel Rubinstein and the Biden administration’s chief envoy for hostage negotiations, Roger Carstens, joined the meetings with interim leaders and members of civil society. Carstens said there was no new information confirming Tice's fate or whereabouts but vowed that efforts to find him would continue. He traveled previously to Lebanon to seek information. More U.S. officials are expected to visit Syria in the coming days to pick up the search, he said. 'We’re going to be like bulldogs on this,' Carstens said, adding that the U.S. was focusing on about six prisons where it believed Tice may have been held in the past. He said the U.S. also had information about three more prisons where Tice might have been incarcerated, and up to 40 sites may end up being examined for evidence of Tice’s presence. Tice, who has had his work published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and others, disappeared at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus as the Syrian civil war intensified. A video released weeks after Tice went missing showed him blindfolded and held by armed men and saying, 'Oh, Jesus.' He has not been heard from since. Assad's government publicly denied that it was holding him. Leaf’s team was the first group of American diplomats to formally visit Syria in more than a decade, since the U.S. shuttered its embassy in Damascus in 2012, although a small number of U.S. diplomats had been assigned to political advisory roles with military units inside Syria since then. Shortly before the delegation arrived in Damascus, the U.S. military said it had conducted airstrikes in northeastern Syria on Thursday, killing a leader of the Islamic State group and one other militant. The strike was part of an ongoing effort to prevent IS insurgents from taking advantage of the upheaval in Syria, including any plan to release the more than 8,000 IS prisoners held in detention by Kurds who have partnered with the U.S., Central Command said in a statement. The Pentagon revealed Thursday that the U.S. had doubled the number of its forces in Syria to fight IS before Assad’s fall. There are roughly 2,000 there now. The diplomats' visit to Damascus will not result in the immediate reopening of the U.S. embassy, which is under the protection of the Czech government, according to U.S. officials, who said decisions on diplomatic recognition will be made when the new Syrian authorities make their intentions clear. ___ Lee reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-united-states-austin-tice-assad-de71dc4920d4677fcfb2d31a2b6e6e54	2024-12-19T20:33:13-08:00	
France's military is being ousted from more African countries. Here's why	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — It's been a tumultuous month for France and its relationship with former colonies in Africa, as its influence on the continent faces the biggest challenge in decades. As Paris was devising a new military strategy that would sharply reduce its permanent troop presence in Africa, two of its closest allies struck a double blow. The government of Chad, considered France's most stable and loyal partner in Africa, announced on its Independence Day it was ending defense cooperation to redefine its sovereignty. And in an interview published hours later by Le Monde, Senegal's new president said it was 'obvious' that soon French soldiers wouldn't be on Senegalese soil. 'Just because the French have been here since the slavery period doesn’t mean it’s impossible to do otherwise,' President Bassirou Diomaye Faye said. The announcements came as France was making efforts to revive waning influence on the continent. Foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot was completing a visit to Chad and Ethiopia, and President Emmanuel Macronfor the first time had recognized the killing of as many as 400 West African soldiers by the French Army in 1944. French authorities stayed silent for almost 24 hours after Chad’s announcement, finally saying they were in 'close dialogue' on the future of the partnership. 'Chad’s decision marks the final nail in the coffin of France’s post-colonial military dominance in the entire Sahel region,' said Mucahid Durmaz, a senior analyst at global risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, referring to the arid region south of the Sahara. The decisions by Senegal and Chad 'are part of the wider structural transformation in the region’s engagement with France, in which Paris political and military influence continues to diminish,' Durmaz added. They follow the ousting of French forces in recent years by military-led governments in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, where local sentiments turned sour following years of French forces fighting alongside local ones in the face of stubborn Islamic extremist insurgencies. What is France’s new strategy in Africa? Jean-Marie Bockel, Macron’s personal envoy for Africa, last month presented to Macron his report on the evolution of the French military presence in Africa. It was part of the 'renewal of our partnership with African countries' that Macron announced in a 2017 speech in Burkina Faso in the early days of his presidency. The details of Bockel's report have not been made public. But three French top officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks with the concerned countries, said France aimed for a sharp reduction of its military in all its bases in Africa except the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti — where Macron is expected to travel in the coming days. The officials said it doesn’t mean France would necessarily reduce military cooperation but instead would respond to needs expressed by countries. It could mean providing more specific training in airspace surveillance or drones and other aircraft. France also could deploy troops on a temporary basis. The officials declined to confirm numbers of troop reductions but called it significant. The French army earlier this year also set up a command for Africa, similar to the U.S. AFRICOM. Newly appointed commander Pascal Ianni specializes in influence and information warfare — a need highlighted by Russia's growing presence in Africa. 'You can carry on your military cooperation like many countries do. But the idea of having permanent military bases, which then can be used as political ammunition against you and spun up in kind of a disinformation war, is maybe not the best way of going about things,' said Will Brown, a senior policy fellow at the European Center for Foreign Relations. Meanwhile, France is trying to boost its economic presence in Africa’s anglophone countries like Nigeria, analysts said. Already, its two biggest trading partners on the continent are Nigeria and South Africa. At the time of Chad’s announcement, Macron was hosting talks with Nigerian President Bola Tinubu. Where does France have troops in West Africa, and why? Since the independence of French colonies in Africa, France has maintained a policy of economic, political and military sway dubbed Françafrique, which included having thousands of permanent troops in the region. France still has 600 troops in Ivory Coast, 350 in Senegal and 350 in Gabon, as well as around 1,500 in Djibouti. It has had 1,000 troops in Chad. France's defense ministry said the role of French troops in Africa is to train local soldiers and reinforce their capacities to fight extremism, mainly in peacekeeping, intelligence and logistics. But critics say keeping boots on the ground also has allowed Paris to retain influence and protect political regimes favorable to France. 'The countries of Francophone Africa want a change in the nature of this relationship,' said Gilles Yabi, head of the West Africa Citizen Think Tank. Why are West African countries expelling French troops? Growing anti-French sentiment has led to street protests in several West and North African countries, while governments that gained power on pledges of redefining relationships with the West say ties with France have not benefited the population. They want to explore options with Russia, China, Turkey and other powers. Chad’s President Mahamat Deby 'would not have made this decision if he did not have security guarantees from another actor,' Brown said. 'We know he’s received serious support from the United Arab Emirates, who are very interested in what’s going on in neighboring Sudan and Darfur. We know that Turkey also made some outreach.' Chad borders four countries with Russian military presence. In January, Deby traveled to Moscow to reinforce relations with the 'partner country.' Military leaders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso who expelled the French military have moved closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel who have been accused of abuses against civilians. But the security situation has worsened in those countries, with increasing numbers of extremist attacks and civilian deaths from both armed groups and government forces. Over the first six months of this year, 3,064 civilians were killed, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a 25% increase over the previous six months. It is impossible to say whether the departure of French forces led to the increased violence. But it created a 'huge security vacuum,' said analyst Shaantanu Shankar with the Economist Intelligence Unit, adding that it cannot be filled by Russia.

The warm Turkish welcome for refugees is ending and Syrians are worried	GAZIANTEP, Turkey (AP) — Turkey gained renown as a haven for refugees by welcoming more than 3 million Syrians fleeing violence between forces from Bashar Assad ’s government and a patchwork of rebel groups. But the Syrian president’s ouster this month has led many in Turkey to argue that the refugees have no reason to stay, part of the global backlash against migration. Some Syrians are panicking about returning to a devastated nation. 'There’s no work, electricity, or water. There is no leader. Who will it be? I have no idea,' said Mahmut Cabuli, who fled airstrikes by Syrian government forces and violence by rebel groups in his hometown Aleppo a decade ago. 'I’m scared and don’t know what the authorities will do.' ‘My children were born here' Cabuli spent several years in a refugee camp before he found a job at a textile factory in Gaziantep, a southern Turkish city near the Syrian border. After he met another Syrian refugee, they married and had two children. 'My children were born here,' he said. 'I am working, thank God. I am happy here. I don’t want to go back now.' Many Turks baselessly accuse Syrians of taking their jobs and straining health care and other public services. Riots have damaged Syrian-owned shops, homes or cars, including one in July in the central city of Kayseri following allegations that a Syrian refugee sexually assaulted a child. The riots sparked counterprotests in northern Syria. Turkish authorities said that the alleged perpetrator was arrested and the victim placed under state protection. 'A spark between Syrians and Turkish citizens can immediately cause a big fire, a big flame,' said Umit Yılmaz, the mayor of Sehitkamil, which hosts 450,000 Syrians. 'The Syrians need to be reunited with their homeland immediately,' he said. 'I have come to a point where I am even willing to get in my own car and take them away if necessary.' Was staying in Turkey temporary or for good? In 2014, Turkish authorities gave Syrians universal access to health care, education and the right to work by granting them a legal status known as temporary protection. As a result, Turkey has taken in more Syrian refugees than any other nation — more than 3.8 million at its peak in 2022, or roughly 60% of all the Syrians logged by U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. But more recently, anti-refugee sentiment has surged as Turkey has grappled with problems including persistent inflation — particularly in food and housing — and with high youth unemployment. 'This prolonged stay under temporary protection must end,' said Azmi Mahmutoglu, spokesman for the Victory Party, a right-wing party that has opposed the presence of Syrians in Turkey and called for their repatriation. Hundreds of Syrians have gathered at border gates along Turkey’s 911-kilometer (566 mile) frontier with Syria since Assad's fall and the returns are expected to accelerate if Syria becomes stable. Metin Corabatir, director of the Ankara-based Research Centre on Asylum and Migration, said most of the departures so far appear to be Syrians checking the situation back in Syria before deciding whether to move their families back. Muhammed Nur Cuneyt, a 24-year-old Syrian who arrived in 2011 from the northern town of Azaz, was eagerly waiting at one gate on Dec. 10, saying he was grateful to Turkey for granting refuge but resented hearing anti-Syrian sentiment as his people fought Assad. 'Some were saying ‘Why are the Syrians here? Why don’t you go back and fight with your nation?’' he said. Are they voluntary returns? President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought ways to encourage the refugees’ voluntary returns — including building housing in Syria close to the Turkish border after Syrian migration helped weaken support for his Justice and Development party. Erdogan has four more years in office but the main opposition party has a slight lead in polls. One refugee who returned to Syria said that he had signed a document ending his protected refugee status under Turkish law. 'Would they be allowed to come back to Turkey? Corabatir said. 'Our hope is that it will continue.' This week, UNHCR said it does not believe that conditions to end Syrian’s refugee status have been met and it still thinks they need protection. But for Huseyin Basut, the Turkish owner of a pet shop in Gaziantep, Turkey has done all that it can for the Syrians. 'We did all we could as a country and as citizens,' said Bayut, 52. 'Since the war is over, they should return to their homes, build their homes or whatever they need to do and may God help them.' __ Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey.

Turkey and Russia engage in delicate maneuvers over Syria after Assad’s downfall	The rapid downfall of Syrian leader Bashar Assad has touched off a new round of delicate geopolitical maneuvering between Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. With the dust still settling from the stunning events in Damascus, the outcome for now seems to be favoring Ankara, which backed the victorious rebels, while Moscow suffered a bruising blow to its international clout. 'In the game of Czars vs. Sultans, this is Sultans 1 and Czars 0,' said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute. 'Far from being allies, Turkey and Russia are competitors. And in this case, Turkey has outsmarted Russia.' The Assad regime’s demise opens another chapter in the complex relationship between Putin and Erdogan, with wide-ranging implications not just for Syria but also for Ukraine and the two leaders' ties with Washington. Russia and Turkey share economic and security interests — along with an intense rivalry. The personal relationship between Putin and Erdogan often sees them both praising each other, even as they jockey for political and economic gains. 'There are currently only two leaders left in the world -- there is me and there is Vladimir Putin,' Erdogan said recently, reflecting the respect for the Kremlin leader. Putin, in turn, has often praises Erdogan’s political prowess. Conflicts and deals Russia and Turkey backed opposing sides in Syria’s civil war that started in 2011, putting them on a collision course. Tensions spiraled when a Turkish fighter jet shot down a Russian warplane near the Turkey-Syria border in November 2015, soon after Moscow launched its air campaign to support Assad. The Kremlin responded with sweeping economic sanctions that halted Turkish imports, drove Turkish companies from the lucrative Russian market and cut the flow of Russian tourists to Turkey’s resorts. Faced with massive economic damage, Erdogan apologized months later. Soon after, Putin staunchly supported him when he faced an attempted military coup in July 2016, helping to warm ties quickly. In 2018, Moscow and Ankara negotiated a ceasefire and de-escalation deal for the rebel-held Idlib province in northwestern Syria on the border with Turkey and sought to anchor the often-violated agreement with follow-up deals in the next few years. But even as they cooperated on Syria, Moscow and Ankara also vied for influence in Libya, where Russia supported forces loyal to military commander Khalifa Hifter while Turkey backed his Tripoli-based foes. Turkey also aggressively sought to increase its leverage in the former Soviet Central Asian nations competing with Russia and China. In 2020, Moscow backed off when Turkey’s ally Azerbaijan routed ethnic Armenian forces in the fighting over the breakaway region of Karabakh. Even though Armenia hosted a Russian military base, the Kremlin has engaged in a delicate balancing act, seeking to maintain warm ties with both Azerbaijan and Turkey. While their political interests often clashed, economic ties boomed, with Russia boosting natural gas exports to Turkey via a Black Sea pipeline; by building Turkey’s first nuclear plant; and by providing the NATO member with advanced air defense systems — to Washington’s dismay. Relations amid the war in Ukraine Ties with Turkey grew even more important for Putin after he invaded Ukraine in 2022, Europe’s largest conflict since World War II. The West responded with economic sanctions that barred Russia from most Western markets, restricted its access to international financial system, shut transport routes and halted exports of key technologies. Turkey, which didn’t join the sanctions, has emerged as Russia’s key gateway to global markets, strengthening Erdogan’s hand in negotiations with Putin. While Turkey backed Ukraine’s territorial integrity and supplied Kyiv with weapons, Erdogan echoed Putin in accusing the U.S. and NATO of fomenting the conflict. Putin has praised Erdogan for offering to mediate a settlement. In March 2022, Turkey hosted Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul that soon collapsed, with both Putin and Erdogan blaming the West for their failure. Later that year, Ankara pooled efforts with the United Nations to broker a deal that opened the door for Ukrainian grain exports from its Black Sea ports, an agreement that helped drive down global food prices before falling apart the following year. Turkey’s balancing act in Ukraine is driven by its dependence on the vast Russian market, supplies of natural gas and a flow of tourists. Russia’s focus on Ukraine has eroded its clout in regions where Turkey and other players have tried to take advantage of Moscow's withering influence. In September 2023, Azerbaijan reclaimed control over all of Karabakh in an one-day blitz while Russian regional peacekeepers stood back. That hurt Russia’s ties with Armenia, which has shifted increasingly toward the West. Moscow's new look at Syria Focused on Ukraine, Russia had few resources left for Syria at a time when Hezbollah similarly pulled back its fighters amid the war with Israel and Iranian support for Assad also weakened. Russia tried to sponsor talks on normalizing relations between Turkey and Syria, but Assad stonewalled them, refusing any compromise. Assad’s intransigence helped trigger the Turkey-backed opposition’s offensive in November. The underfunded and demoralized Syrian army quickly crumbled, allowing the rebels to sweep across the country and capture Damascus. Even as it has offered asylum to Assad and his family, Russia has reached out to Syria's new leaders, seeking to ensure security for its troops still there and extend leases on its naval and air bases. At his annual news conference Thursday, Putin said Russia offered Syria's new leaders to use the bases for humanitarian aid deliveries and suggested Moscow could offer other incentives. While Assad's demise dealt a heavy blow to Russia, some believe Moscow could navigate the rapidly changing environment to retain at least some clout. 'Syria’s opposition forces well understand that the country’s future is uncertain,' said Nikolay Kozhanov, a consulting fellow with Chathan House’s Russia and Eurasia program, in a commentary. 'They want Russia, if not as a friend, then a neutral party.' He noted that 'Moscow’s main goal will be to maintain at least a minimal level of influence through a military presence, for example, at its existing bases, or through contacts with other regional players, such as Turkey.' Cagaptay observed that while Turkey would like to see an end to Russia’s military presence in Syria, Ankara’s position will depend on how relations evolve with Washington. 'If we see a reset in U.S.-Turkish ties where Turkey thinks it can comfortably lean on the U.S. against Russia, I can see Erdogan adopting a kind of more boisterous tone vis a vis Putin,' he said. But if the U.S. maintains its alliance with the Kurds and stands against Turkey’s effort to push back on Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria, 'Ankara may decide that it needs to continue to play all sides as it has been doing for about a decade now,' Cagaptay said. Putin noted Russia understands Turkey's motives in securing its borders, but he also warned that the Kurds could offer strong resistance if attacked. Emre Ersen, a Russia expert at Istanbul’s Marmara University, also noted that while Assad’s fall will diminish Moscow’s influence, 'the relationship between Turkey and Russia will not be devastated by the events in Syria.' 'Obviously, they still need to reach out to each other regarding the crisis in Ukraine, but also because they have very significant economic relations,' Ersen said, adding that Erdogan could be expected to seek more concessions from Russia on energy and trade issues. ___ Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-turkey-putin-erdogan-syria-assad-afbfc5a271438c0c61142f8cb9fcb6f4	2024-12-19T20:05:50-08:00	
Rising butter prices give European consumers and bakers a bad taste	PARIS (AP) — Pastry chef Arnaud Delmontel rolls out dough for croissants and pain au chocolat that later emerge golden and fragrant from the oven in his Paris patisserie. The price for the butter so essential to the pastries has shot up in recent months, by 25% since September alone, Delmontel says. But he is refusing to follow some competitors who have started making their croissants with margarine. 'It’s a distortion of what a croissant is,' Delmontel said. 'A croissant is made with butter.' One of life’s little pleasures — butter spread onto warm bread or imbuing cakes and seared meats with its rich flavor — has gotten more expensive across Europe in the last year. After a stretch of post-pandemic inflation that the war in Ukraine worsened, the booming cost of butter is another blow for consumers with holiday treats to bake. Across the 27-member European Union, the price of butter rose 19% on average from October 2023 to October 2024, including by 49% in Slovakia, and 40% in Germany and the Czech Republic, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by the EU's executive arm. Reports from individual countries indicate the cost has continued to go up in the months since. In Germany, a 250-gram (8.8-ounce) block of butter now generally costs between 2.40 and 4 euros ($2.49-$4.15), depending on the brand and quality. The increase is the result of a global shortage of milk caused by declining production, including in the United States and New Zealand, one of the world’s largest butter exporters, according to economist Mariusz Dziwulski, a food and agricultural market analyst at PKO Bank Polski in Warsaw. European butter typically has a higher fat content than the butter sold in the United States. It also is sold by weight in standard sizes, so food producers can’t hide price hikes by reducing package sizes, something known as ' shrinkflation.' A butter shortage in France in the 19th century led to the invention of margarine, but the French remain some of the continent's heaviest consumers of butter, using the ingredient with abandon in baked goods and sauces. Butter is so important in Poland that the government keeps a stockpile of it in the country's strategic reserves, as it does national gas and COVID-19 vaccines. The government announced Tuesday that it was releasing some 1,000 tons of frozen butter to stabilize prices. The price of butter rose 11.4% between early November and early December in Poland, and 49.2% over the past year to nearly 37 Polish zlotys, or $9 per kilo (2.2 pounds) for the week ending Dec. 8, according to the National Support Center for Agriculture, a government agency. 'Every month butter gets more expensive,' Danuta Osinska, a 77-year-old Polish woman, said while shopping recently at a discount grocery chain in Warsaw. She and her husband love butter — on bread, in scrambled eggs, in creamy desserts. But they also struggle to pay for medications on their meager pensions. So the couple is eating less butter and more margarine, even though they find the taste of the substitute spread inferior. 'There is no comparison,' Osinska said. 'Things are getting harder and harder.' The cost of butter in Poland has become a political issue. With a presidential election scheduled next year, opponents of centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk are trying to blame him and his Civic Platform party. Other Poles want to blame the national bank's governor, who hails from an opposing political camp. Some consumers decide where to shop based on the price of butter, which has led to price wars between grocery chains that in some cases kept prices artificially low in the past to the detriment of dairy farmers, according to Agnieszka Maliszewska, the director of the Polish Chamber of Milk. Maliszewska thinks domestic, EU-specific and global issues explain butter inflation. She argues that the primary cause in Poland is a shortage of milk fat due to dairy farmers shutting down their enterprises because of slim profit markets and hard work. She and others also cite higher energy costs from Russia’s war in Ukraine as impacting milk production. There is some debate about the potential effect of climate change. Maliszewska doesn't see a link. Economist Dziwulski, however, thinks droughts may be a factor in reducing production. Falling milk prices last year also discouraged investments and pushed dairy producers in the EU to make more cheese, which offered better profitability, he said. An outbreak of bluetongue disease, an insect-borne viral disease that is harmless to humans but can be fatal for sheep, cows and goats, may also play a role, Dziwulski said. The U.S. saw a butter price spike in 2022, when the average price jumped 33% to $4.88 per pound over the course of the year, according to government data. Dairy farmers struggled with feed costs and hot temperatures. U.S. butter prices fell in 2023 before rising again this year, hitting a peak of $5 per pound in September. Higher grocery prices in general weighed on U.S. voters during the presidential election in November. Southern European countries, which rely far more heavily on olive oil, are less affected by the butter inflation — or they just don't consider it as important since they consume so much less. Since last year the cost of butter shot up 44% on average in Italy, according to dairy market analysis firm CLAL. Italy is Europe's seventh-largest butter producer, but olive oil is the preferred fat, even for some desserts. The price of butter therefore is not causing the same alarm there as it is in butter-addicted parts of Europe. Delmontel, the Paris pastry chef, said the rising costs put business owners like him under pressure. Along with refusing to switch out butter for margarine, he has not reduced the size of his croissants. But some other French bakers are making smaller pastries to control costs, he said. 'Or else you squeeze it out of your profit margin,' Delmontel said. ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed ahead of key US inflation data	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Friday as markets awaited U.S. personal spending data for November that are due later in the day. U.S. futures and oil prices fell. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index was unchanged at 38,810.26 after the release of November inflation data on Friday. Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, rose 2.7% year-on-year, surpassing expectations. The data followed the Bank of Japan's decision on Thursday to keep its benchmark rate at 0.25%, which pushed the dollar higher against the Japanese yen. The dollar was trading at 157.11 yen by early Friday, down from 157.43 yen but still higher than the average of 150 yen earlier this month. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.1% to 19,774.22 and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.5% at 3,388.22 after China’s central bank kept its loan prime rates unchanged on Friday. The one-year lending rate, which affects corporate and most household loans, remained at 3.1%, while the five-year rate, used as a benchmark for mortgage rates, stayed at 3.6%. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped 1.3% to 8,061.40. South Korea’s Kospi lost 1.7% to 2,393.60. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 edged 0.1% lower to 5,867.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 0.1% to 42,342.24 following Wednesday’s drop of 1,123 points, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1% to 19,372.77. This week’s struggles have taken some of the enthusiasm out of the market, which critics had been warning was overly buoyant and would need everything to go correctly for it to justify its high prices. But indexes remain near their records, and the S&amp;P 500 is still on track for one of its best years of the millennium with a gain of 23%. Traders are now expecting the Federal Reserve to deliver just one or maybe two cuts to interest rates next year, according to data from CME Group. Some are even betting on none. A month ago, the majority saw at least two cuts in 2025 as a safe bet. Wall Street loves lower interest rates because they give the economy a boost and goose prices for investments, but they can also provide fuel for inflation. Treasury yields were mixed a day after shooting higher on expectations that the Fed would deliver fewer cuts to rates in 2025. Reports on the U.S. economy came in mixed. One showed the overall economy grew at a 3.1% annualized rate during the summer, faster than earlier thought. The economy has remained remarkably resilient even though the Fed held its main interest rate at a two-decade high for a while before beginning to cut them in September. A separate report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, an indication that the job market also remains solid. But a third report said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is unexpectedly contracting again despite economists’ expectations for growth. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.57% from 4.52% late Wednesday and from less than 4.20% earlier this month. But the two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for action by the Fed in the near term, eased back to 4.31% from 4.35%. In other dealings, U.S. benchmark crude oil gave up 27 cents to $68.96 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 42 cents to $72.46 per barrel. The euro fell to $1.0359 from $1.0367. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-inflation-japan-658f48959716b4d9b0c16481ff9f11db	2024-12-19T19:43:51-08:00	
For some, the pope's big Holy Year only aggravates housing crisis as overtourism pushes out Romans	When Pope Francis left the Vatican earlier this month for his traditional Christmastime outing downtown, he acknowledged what many Romans have been complaining about for months: That his big plans for a Holy Year had turned their city into a giant construction pit, with traffic-clogging roadworks tearing up major thoroughfares, scaffolding covering prized monuments and short-term rentals gobbling up apartment blocks. Francis urged Romans to pray for their mayor — 'He has a lot to do' — but to nevertheless welcome the upcoming Jubilee as a time of spiritual repair and renewal. 'These worksites are fine, but beware: Don’t forget the worksites of the soul!' Francis said. When he formally opens the Holy Year next week, Francis will launch a dizzying 12-month calendar of events that include special Jubilee Masses for the faithful from all walks of life: artists, adolescents, migrants, teachers and prisoners. And while the Jubilee’s official start means the worst of the construction headache is ending, the arrival of a projected 32 million pilgrims in 2025 is set to only increase congestion in the Eternal City and intensify a housing crunch that has been driving residents away. Like many European art capitals, Rome has been suffering from overtourism as the Italian travel sector rebounds from COVID-19: Last year, a record high number of people visited Italy, 133.6 million, with foreign tourists pushing Italy over the EU average in growth of the travel sector, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported. Rome, with its innumerable artistic treasures, the Vatican and Italy’s busiest airport, was the top city in terms of nights booked in registered lodging, ISTAT said. And yet for all its grande bellezze, Rome is hardly a modern European metropolis. It has notoriously inadequate public transportation and garbage collection. For the past two post-pandemic summers, taxis have been so hard to come by that the city of Rome authorized 1,000 new cab licenses for 2025. Rome’s growing housing crisis has gotten so bad that vigilantes have taken to going out at night with wire cutters to snip off the keyboxes on short-term apartment rentals that are blamed for driving up rents and driving out residents. 'The market is out of control and has definitely gotten worse with touristification, with the additional load of the Jubilee,' said Roberto Viviani, a university researcher whose landlord recently refused to renew his lease in favor of turning the apartment over to an agency to run as a holiday rental. 'The surprise was that he gave the Jubilee as the justification.' All of which has set the stage for a Jubilee opening Dec. 24 that is being received as something of a mixed bag. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of the faithful making pilgrimages to Rome every 25 years to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul and receiving indulgences for the forgiveness of their sins in the process. For the city of Rome, it’s a chance to take advantage of some 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in public funds to carry out long-delayed projects to lift the city out of years of decay and neglect and bring it up to modern, European standards. But for Romans who have seen the short-term rental market take over neighborhoods like Pigneto, on the eastern flank of the capital, it's just another pressure point in a long-running battle to keep the flavor of their neighborhoods with affordable rents for ordinary Romans. 'The Jubilee has significantly worsened this phenomenon that we have seen, above all in the last months,' said Alberto Campailla, director of the association Nonna Roma, which has been slapping stickers 'Your BnB, our eviction' on Pigneto keyboxes to protest the growth of tourist rentals. Rome’s relationship with Jubilees dates to 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII inaugurated the first Holy Year in what historians say marked the definitive designation of Rome as the center of Christianity. Even then, the number of pilgrims was so significant that Dante referred to them in his 'Inferno.' Massive public works projects have long accompanied Holy Years, including the creation of the Sistine Chapel (commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV for the Jubilee of 1475) and the big Vatican garage (for the 2000 Jubilee under St. John Paul II). Some works have been controversial, such as the construction of Via della Concilliazione, the broad boulevard leading to St. Peter’s Square. An entire neighborhood was razed to make it for the 1950 Jubilee. The main public works project for the 2025 Jubilee is actually an extension of that boulevard: A pedestrian piazza along the Tiber linking Via della Conciliazione to the nearby Castel St. Angelo, with the major road that had separated them diverted to an underground tunnel. The project, at 79.5 million euros ($82.5 million) the most ambitious of the 2025 Jubilee works, ran into a predictable glitch over the summer when archaeological ruins were discovered during the dredging of the tunnel. The artifacts were transferred to the castle museum and the digging resumed, with the grand opening scheduled for Monday, the eve of the Jubilee’s start. Mayor Roberto Gualtieri has pointed to another feature of the 2025 projects that previous Jubilees have largely ignored, an emphasis on parks and 'green' initiatives, in keeping with Francis’ focus on environmental sustainability. But Francis himself has acknowledged the paradox of the Jubilee on the lives of everyday Romans. He wrote to Rome-area priests and religious orders earlier this year to ask them to 'make a courageous gesture of love' by offering up any unused housing or apartments in their increasingly empty convents and monasteries to Romans threatened with eviction. 'I want all diocesan realities that own real estate to offer their contribution to stem the housing emergency with signs of charity and solidarity to generate hope in the thousands of people in the city of Rome who are in a condition of precarious housing,' Francis wrote. Gualtieri has gone farther, demanding alongside other mayors that the national government pass the necessary norms to let them regulate the proliferation of short-term rentals, which have been blamed for reducing the available long-term rental stock and driving up prices on average 10% over the past year. 'This for us is an emergency because we need to prevent entire blocks of the center from emptying out and turning into B&amp;Bs, because the presence of residents in the center is fundamental,' Gualtieri said. But the Vatican’s point-man for the Jubilee, Monsignor Rino Fisichella, defended the Holy Year as part of Rome’s fabric and denied the influx of pilgrims was anything but a net gain for the city. 'As long as it has existed, Rome has always been called a ‘common home,’ a city that has always been open to everyone,' Fisichella said on the sidelines of a Jubilee promotional event. 'To think that Rome might reduce the presence of pilgrims or tourists would in my opinion inflict a wound that doesn’t belong to it.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Australia announces $118 million deal to enhance policing in Solomon Islands	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia announced on Friday it will pay for more police in Solomon Islands and create a police training center in the South Pacific island nation’s capital Honiara, where Chinese law enforcement instructors are already based under a bilateral security pact with Beijing. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia would spend 190 million Australian dollars ($118 million) over four years on funding and training new Royal Solomon Islands Police Force recruits with a package that would 'reduce any need for outside support.' 'My government is proud to make a significant investment in the police force of the Solomon Islands to ensure that they can continue to take primary responsibility for security in the Solomons,' Albanese told reporters in Australia's capital Canberra. Albanese and his Solomons counterpart Jeremiah Manele said in a joint statement on Friday the package would build an enduring security capability in the Solomons, 'thereby reducing its reliance on external partners over time.' Australia has been energetically pursuing new bilateral security deals with its Pacific island neighbors since Beijing and the Solomons signed a security deal in 2022 under Manele’s predecessor, Manasseh Sogavare. That deal has created fears among U.S. allies including Australia that the Chinese navy will be allowed to build a base in the strategically important Solomons. Albanese’s Labor Party, which was the opposition at the time the pact was signed, described it as Australia’s worst foreign policy failure in the Pacific since World War II. Australia has recently signed security deals with Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu and Nauru that effectively give Canberra veto powers over any security deals those countries might want to strike with third nations including China. Asked if the new deal would require the Chinese security presence to be removed from the Solomons, Albanese did not directly answer. 'The Solomon Islands of course is a sovereign nation. They have some measures in place and we expect that to continue,' Albanese said. 'As a result of this agreement, what we’ve done is make sure that Australia remains the security partner of choice,' he added. Mihai Sora, a Pacific islands expert at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based international policy think tank, said the agreement was a 'clear win for Solomon Islands, which has gained a much-needed boost to its law and justice sector.' 'But Solomon Islands has not committed to scaling back the essentially permanent rotating presence of around 14 Chinese police trainers in the country, who have been running their own parallel training program with Solomon Islands police since 2022,' Sora said in an email. 'So, the agreement falls short of a solid strategic commitment to Australia from Solomon Islands, and there’s no indication that it would derail China-Solomon Islands security ties,' Sora added. Blake Johnson, an analyst at the Australian Security Policy Institute, a Canberra-based think tank, said Chinese policing in the Pacific gives Beijing tools to control Chinese expatriates and pursue other goals. 'They can be very heavy-handed in their response sometimes. There are also concerns around data and privacy risks associated with Chinese police in the region,' Johnson said. 'Sometimes they’re providing surveillance equipment. There are concerns about what that is being used for and what it’s capturing,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-solomon-islands-police-china-bfde14238c78a99fe9559011f77af8ed	2024-12-19T17:54:30-08:00	
Shamans refuse to evacuate precarious cliff-top shacks in Bolivia despite government order	EL ALTO, Bolivia (AP) — The view is dizzying from the row of small huts that dot one of the mountainsides surrounding Bolivia’s capital. Inside the precarious structures, Aymara shamans pray to the Andean gods to protect them from the threat of collapse. In recent years, the erosion of the mountain range around La Paz has accelerated due to the effects of climate change. A month ago, a mudslide buried an entire neighborhood and killed a girl. This has created a conflict between the shamans and Bolivia’s government, which has ordered the area evacuated. 'The slope is wearing away,' said Gabriel Pari, secretary of water and sanitation for the El Alto municipality, where the huts are located. But, he added, the shamans insist 'they perform rituals to prevent this from happening and refuse to leave. The area is highly risky. They say they have been here for more than 60 years, and nothing has happened.' The site is not a rock formation but a sandy and clay-like soil, according to geological studies. The area has been sacred to the Aymara Indigenous people since pre-Hispanic times. During colonial times, the shamans performed rituals on this summit before entering the city with their llama caravan carrying agricultural products. Pari said the huts function as a workplace for the shamans, who do not live there but often spend the night in the small structures. A sign on the door of Tiburcio Condori’s hut details the services he offers: He sees the future in coca leaves and playing cards. He also cures illnesses and heartaches, makes offerings for success in business and health, and cleanses energy to heal the body and spirit. A bonfire burns outside. The air smells of incense. 'This is solid ground; it will not fall. That is what the coca leaf and Pachamama tell us,' Condori, who has worked as a shaman and spiritual guide for more than 20 years, said using the Indigenous community’s word for Mother Earth. Condori has no plans to evacuate the area, and neither does Ana Chinahuanca. She is among the 100 shamans who work on the cliff, charging around $2 for reading fortunes in coca leaves and up to 15 for energy cleansings. 'They are giving bad information,' Chinahuanca said of the danger warnings. 'This place is safe.'	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-shamans-cliff-evacuation-erosion-rain-2a75fb555e0066f4d675b015e6e92b15	2024-12-19T13:12:18-08:00	
Chinese national charged with acting as Beijing's agent in local California election	WASHINGTON (AP) — A Chinese national was arrested Thursday on charges of acting as an illegal agent for Beijing when serving as the campaign manager for an unnamed politician elected to a city council in Southern California two years ago. The arrest of Yaoning 'Mike' Sun, 64, came at a time of rising concerns that the Chinese government has cultivated a network of operatives to influence local elections in the U.S. to install politicians who are friendly to Beijing and can help promote Chinese interests. According to a complaint filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Sun is accused of conspiring with Chen Jun, who was sentenced to 20 months last month for acting as an illegal agent of the Chinese government. Chen, 71, also a Chinese national, pleaded guilty in July to using Chinese money to bribe federal agents to undermine the anti-Beijing spiritual group Falun Gong. The charge against Sun shows that Chen also conspired to interfere with local elections. It wasn't immediately clear if Sun had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. Sun was instructed by Chen to write up a report in 2023 to recount to Chinese officials how they helped the local politician get elected, according to the affidavit. Subsequent writings between the two men described the city councilperson as a 'new political star' and included a request for $80,000 to fund more pro-Beijing activities in the United States, according to the court documents. Chen asked Sun to list all the mainstream American politicians the city councilperson was familiar with and told Sun that it would be 'very effective to elevate' the status of the councilperson in China. 'This case is yet another example of a very disturbing trend: the People's Republic of China is seeking to influence foreign and domestic policy in the United States,' Martin Estrada, U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, said in a call with reporters. 'To do so, government officials in China are seeking to help get elected individuals who they see as being friendly to Chinese foreign policy.' The charges against Sun followed those against a former aide to two New York governors in September. Authorities have accused Linda Sun of acting as an illegal agent of the Chinese government and using her positions to subtly advance Beijing’s agenda in exchange for financial benefits worth millions of dollars. In California, Estrada said Yaoning Sun appeared to be ideologically invested in furthering the interests of the Chinese government in the United States, noting that he had previously served in the Chinese military. The complaint does not specify financial gains for Yaoning Sun, who probably is not related to Linda Sun because they share a common Chinese name. In the affidavit, it's alleged that Yaoning Sun, a resident of Chino Hills outside Los Angeles, also ran a media outlet called the 'U.S. News Center' with the councilperson and paid for some of the politician's travel expenses. Prosecutors say Sun worked closely with Chen, who appeared to be in regular contact with Chinese officials. Their communications included how to protest a U.S. congressperson's proposed visit to Taiwan, a self-governed island that Beijing sees as part of Chinese territory. The men discussed how to set up a meeting for the politician to meet with the top Chinese diplomat in Los Angeles and arrange travel plans for the politician to visit China. ___	https://apnews.com/article/china-election-interference-california-yaoning-mike-sun-194aaaa29afea6dda9b55e8cb1cd0c44	2024-12-19T12:08:10-08:00	
2 more Mexican soldiers killed by an improvised landmine, after 2 died earlier this week	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Two more members of Mexico’s armed forces have been killed by an improvised landmine, just days after two soldiers died in a similar blast, officials confirmed Thursday. The blasts, both in the western state of Michoacan, mark an unprecedented one-week death toll from improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, planted by drug cartels in Mexico. Carlos Torres, the interior secretary of Michoacan, said the devices, often described as powerful pipe bombs, were apparently planted around drug labs or cartel encampments. But he suggested the bombs may have been intended to ward off rival gangs, and not necessarily aimed at killing members of the armed forces. 'They place this kind of device around certain key areas, like (drug) labs or like encampments or places where organized crime exists, for their enemies or adversaries,' Torres said. The Michoacan state government said one of the victims in the most recent blast Wednesday was an army sergeant, and the other a member of the National Guard. Torres said they died while on patrol in a southern area of the state dominated by the Jalisco drug cartel. The National Guard is a militarized force that often patrols with the army and often includes active-duty soldiers in its ranks. On Monday, two soldiers were killed in a similar explosion and five others were wounded in another part of the state dominated by the United Cartels gang. Torres said more improvised mines have been located and deactivated. The Jalisco cartel has been locked in a bloody, years-long turf battle with the United Cartels — mainly made up of a gang known as the Viagras — for control of Michoacan, which is home to both labs producing synthetic drugs like methamphetamine, and Pacific coast ports used to smuggle in drugs and the precursor chemicals used to make them. The army had previously acknowledged suffering only six deaths from IEDs between 2018 and 2024. Previous attacks on law enforcement have also included the use of bomb-dropping drones, and the army did not confirm whether the six previous deaths over the last six years were from drones or roadside bombs, or both. Torres said that in the area around Buenavista, Michoacan, in the state's southern hot lands — where Wednesday's explosion occurred — the gangs had been known to use both landmines and small bombs dropped by drones. At leas t some civilians have also been killed by the devices. Defense Secretary Gen. Ricardo Trevilla said Tuesday that devices like the one that exploded Monday were 'very rustic.' But his description of the scene where the two soldiers died Monday suggested that it may have been a sort of grisly booby trap. Trevilla said the army sent out a patrol to check on reports of an encampment of armed men in a rural area. The armed forces detected an area protected by stockades that appeared to be an encampment, but when soldiers approached in vehicles, they found the trail blocked by logs, so they got out and had to approach on foot. While approaching, they spotted three dismembered bodies near the encampment, which appeared to be abandoned. But as they drew closer, a buried device exploded and struck the soldiers. In the only previous detailed report on cartel bomb attacks in August 2023, the Mexican defense department said at that time that a total of 42 soldiers, police and suspects were wounded by IEDs in the first seven and a half months of 2023, up from 16 in all of 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-explosives-soldiers-killed-ieds-bomb-michoacan-de63fe119d1d0f32154b1b47b9113a01	2024-12-19T11:18:15-08:00	
Israel and Hamas appear close to a ceasefire deal. These are the sticking points	CAIRO (AP) — Israel and Hamas appear closer than they have been in months to agreeing to a ceasefire that could wind down the 14-month war in Gaza and bring home dozens of people held hostage there. But the sides have come close before, only to have talks collapse over various disagreements. This round of negotiations also faces hurdles. The agreement would take place in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of captive Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip, according to Egyptian, Hamas and American officials. The last phase would include the release of any remaining hostages, an end to the war and talks on reconstruction. Although Israel and Hamas have expressed optimism that a deal is close, key sticking points remain over the exchange of hostages for prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, people involved in the talks say. 'They are working through the names of hostages who would come out in the first phase — the names of the prisoners that would be released as part of the exchange. And then some specific details about the disposition of Israeli forces during the ceasefire,' White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe.' Here’s a closer look at the key issues holding up a deal: Hostage release During its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, Hamas and other groups took about 250 people hostages and brought them to Gaza. A previous truce in November 2023 freed more than 100 hostages, while others have been rescued or their remains have been recovered over the past year. Israel says about 100 hostages remain in Gaza — at least a third of whom it believes were killed during the Oct. 7 attack or died in captivity. The warring sides are haggling over which hostages would be included in an initial release, according to the Egyptian and Hamas officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing ongoing negotiations. There have also been disputes about how many hostages will be included, Israeli media reported.. The first batch is expected to be made up mostly of women, older people and people with medical conditions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also is facing growing pressure from the families of hostages to secure a deal that would release all of them at once. They fear the deal could break down or that loved ones who aren't immediately released could die in captivity. Palestinian prisoners As part of the deal, Israel is expected to free hundreds of imprisoned Palestinians, including dozens who were convicted in bloody attacks. Israel has a history of lopsided prisoner releases, and hundreds were freed in the November 2023 deal. But the officials who spoke to the AP say the sides still disagree over the exact number and names of the prisoners to be freed. Hamas wants high-profile prisoners included. Netanyahu's governing coalition includes hardliners who oppose such releases, with some even pledging to quit the government if too many concessions are made. They point to a 2011 prisoner release that included the former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks who was killed by Israel in October. Israeli media have also reported that there are differences over whether the more serious prisoners who are released will be exiled to third countries. Palestinians returning home The war has displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, according to U.N. estimates, with the hard-hit northern sector of the territory largely emptied of its prewar population. During the first phase of the developing deal, Israel is expected to withdraw troops from Palestinian population centers and allow some of the displaced to return home. But the extent of the pullback and the number of people allowed to return must still be worked out, the officials say. According to the Egyptian and Hamas officials, Israel is prepared to allow people to return north to Gaza City, the territory's largest city. But it does not want people to return farther north to areas close to the Israeli border. Israeli troops remain active in these areas, battling what Israel says are pockets of insurgency. Israel appears concerned that militants could renew attacks from there if the displaced are allowed to return. But critics say Israel has other intentions. Netanyahu has considered a controversial proposal by former generals to empty the north and cut it off from humanitarian aid as part of a plan to starve out any militants who remain there. Moshe Yaalon, a former Israeli defense minister, said Israel was carrying out ethnic cleansing in those areas of northern Gaza. Netanyahu has also said Israel must maintain long-term control over a strategic strip of land along Gaza's border with Egypt, as well as the freedom for Israeli troops to operate against militants in the future. Hamas is demanding a full withdrawal as part of any ceasefire. In an interview Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. remains hopeful that a deal can be finalized before President Joe Biden leaves office on Jan. 20. 'Everyone is pushing on this,' Blinken told MSNBC. 'We want to get it over the finish line. We want to get the hostages home. We want to get a ceasefire so that people can finally have relief in Gaza.' ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Pentagon says it doubled the number of US troops in Syria before Assad's fall	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States doubled the number of its forces in Syria to fight the Islamic State group before the overthrow of President Bashar Assad’s government, the Pentagon said Thursday. The U.S. had previously said 900 troops were in Syria, but Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, announced that 2,000 were there and had been for a while. The Pentagon had been asked repeatedly in recent days and weeks about the U.S. presence in Syria and never disclosed the dramatic increase. Ryder said the additional forces had been in Syria 'at a minimum months — it’s been going on for awhile.' He told reporters the increase in forces was temporary and they are there to augment the U.S. operations against the Islamic State group. He said U.S. Army conventional and special operations forces make up the bulk of the additional troops. Rebel forces overthrew Assad two weeks ago. In the days since, Israel and Turkey have both launched military operations inside Syria's borders, including Tel Aviv's airstrikes against weapons facilities in the east that belonged to Assad's regime and Turkey's offensive in the northeast against Kurdish forces, who have partnered with the U.S. in its fight against the Islamic State. The U.S. also has significantly stepped up airstrikes against IS targets in Syria over concern that a power vacuum would allow the militant group to reconstitute itself. Until Thursday, the Pentagon had insisted there had been no change to the U.S. force numbers in Syria, even as questions arose as to whether the new instability there has put the U.S. mission in jeopardy. President-elect Donald Trump tried to withdraw forces from Syria during his first term, which drove former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign in protest, and as he prepares to return to the White House, Trump has said he does not support U.S. forces getting more involved in Syria.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-us-troops-assad-tice-israel-35ac28d9c95a568828986da011bc02f1	2024-12-19T11:14:12-08:00	
Biden expected to visit Pope Francis in final international trip of his presidency, AP sources say	WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is expected to announce soon that President Joe Biden will visit the Vatican to meet with Pope Francis next month for what would likely be the final international trip of his presidency, according to three people familiar with the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the White House deliberations. Asked about the potential Vatican visit, White House officials declined to comment. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni also declined to confirm or deny any visit, noting that Vatican policy is only to announce papal audiences with visiting heads of state a few days before they occur. Overseas visits this late in a U.S. presidency aren't typical. The last president to travel overseas in the final month of his presidency was fellow one-termer George H.W. Bush, who traveled in early January 1993 to Moscow to sign a nuclear treaty and to Paris for talks with French President François Mitterrand about the Bosnian war, according to State Department historical records. Biden, a practicing Roman Catholic, last met privately with Pope Francis earlier this year while in Italy for the Group of Seven leaders meeting. He also met with Pope Francis at the Vatican in 2021, when they had a wide-ranging conversation about climate change, poverty and the coronavirus pandemic. Their warm conversation also touched on the loss of the president’s adult son Beau, who died of cancer in 2015, and included jokes about aging well. Biden's support for abortion rights and same-sex marriage has put him at odds with many U.S. bishops, some of whom have suggested he should be denied Communion. But following the Vatican meeting in 2021, Biden said Francis called him a 'good Catholic' who should keep receiving Communion. While in Rome, Biden could take advantage of being at the Vatican during the Holy Year, which officially opens on Christmas Eve. Holy Years are generally celebrated every 25 to 50 years, and over the centuries have been used to encourage the faithful to make pilgrimages to Rome to pray at the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul and obtain an indulgence — the ancient church tradition related to the forgiveness of sins that roughly amounts to a 'get out of Purgatory free' card. Pilgrims who pass through the Holy Door of St. Peter’s Basilica can obtain the indulgence, and the Vatican is expecting some 32 million people will flock to Rome over 2025 to participate in the pilgrimage. ___ Winfield reported from Rome.

Canada's Trudeau to shuffle his Cabinet Friday amid resignation calls and rising discontent	TORONTO (AP) — Embattled Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will shuffle his Cabinet Friday, a senior official familiar with the matter said Thursday. The official confirmed the shuffle and spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Trudeau is facing rising discontent over his leadership, and the abrupt departure of his finance minister on Monday could be something he can’t recover from. A rising number of Liberal lawmakers are calling on Trudeau to resign but new Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Thursday Trudeau has 'full support of his Cabinet.' LeBlanc said he respects the views of Liberal Members of Parliament who want Trudeau to resign. 'That's a view they are expressing. The prime minister listened carefully when that view was expressed to him,' LeBlanc said. 'He listened, in some cases responded to specific things that were raised, and he said he would reflect carefully.' LeBlanc said the government will remain focused on work and addressing the threat by President-elect Donald Trump to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian products when he is inaugurated next month. Trudeau has led the country for nearly a decade, but has become widely unpopular in recent years over a wide range of issues, including the high cost of living and rising inflation. There is no mechanism for Trudeau’s party to force him out in the short-term. He could resign, or his Liberal party could be forced from power by a 'no confidence' vote in Parliament that would trigger an election that would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party. As rising numbers of Liberal lawmakers called Tuesday for Trudeau to resign, the country’s minister of natural resources, Jonathan Wilkinson, said 'we all need to give him a little time to reflect.' Concerns about Trudeau’s leadership were exacerbated Monday when Chrystia Freeland, Trudeau's finance and deputy prime minister, resigned from the Cabinet. Freeland was highly critical of Trudeau’s handling of the economy in the face of steep tariffs threatened by Trump. Shortly before Freeland announced her decision, the country’s housing minister also quit. Because Trudeau's Liberals don’t hold an outright majority in the Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the leftist New Democratic Party to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has all but vanished — the NDP’s leader has called on Trudeau to resign — and that might clear the way for Parliament to vote 'no confidence.' NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, however, would not commit to bringing down the government at the first opportunity in part because Trump could impose crippling tariffs and Parliament might need to respond with tariffs in retaliation. Parliament is now shut for the holidays until late next month, and a 'no confidence' vote could be scheduled sometime thereafter.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-cabinet-shuffle-a949a1c13aff2ccb73cf55678be4fbce	2024-12-19T09:09:26-08:00	
Syrian villagers near the Golan Heights say Israeli forces are banning them from their fields	Israeli forces have set up a position in an abandoned Syrian army base in the village of Maariyah and prevented local farmers from accessing their fields, residents said Thursday. Associated Press journalists who visited the area saw the Israeli troops from a distance and watched a local resident waving a white flag approach to speak with them. The village, on the western edge of Syria's southern Daraa province, is near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, but outside of a buffer zone in the Golan established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement between Syria and Israel. Abdel Raouf Issa, a resident of Maariyah, said the Israeli military had penetrated about 1 kilometer (two-thirds of a mile) into the village and 'is demanding that we hand over all weapons to the occupation. We told them that we have no weapons at all.' 'They prevented us from farming. They prevented us from moving,' he said. 'We call on the United Nations to remove the occupation as soon as possible.' Kamal Saleh Damara, a local official in the village, said, 'Thank God, we were happy that HTS came,' referring to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main insurgent group in the coalition that unseated Assad. 'But then Israel came, and it is preventing people from coming and going and moving.' The Israeli military said in a statement that it is 'operating within the buffer zone and in several additional locations in its proximity to ensure the security of Israel's northern border.' It declined to comment on specific locations where its troops are deployed. Israel seized a swath of southern Syria along the border with the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights shortly after Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted by rebels on Dec. 8. The capture of the buffer zone, a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized area in Syrian territory, has sparked condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating a 1974 ceasefire and exploiting the chaos in Syria in the wake of Assad’s ouster to make a land grab. Israel seized control of the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it — a move not recognized by most of the international community On Wednesday, a group of residents and dignitaries from the buffer zone in Quneitra province put out a statement complaining that the Israeli forces had forcibly displaced the residents of some villages although they 'showed restraint toward the advancing forces and did not resist them.' However, they said some residents were later allowed to return The statement called for Israeli forces to withdraw 'especially from vital facilities such as the Quneitra provincial government building, the main roads and the water wells and tanks serving the area.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israeli forces will stay there until another arrangement is in place 'that ensures Israel’s security.' Netanyahu made the comments from the summit of Mount Hermon — the highest peak in the area — inside Syria, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with Golan Heights. ———- Associated Press writers Julia Frankel in Jerusalem and Abby Sewell in Damascus contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-golan-hieghts-israel-daraa-maariyah-occupied-d3404840f0d47ff88714938f1aa8a683	2024-12-19T08:57:40-08:00	
Brady Corbet and 'The Brutalist' go for broke	NEW YORK (AP) — Brady Corbet’s 'The Brutalist' emerged less like a new film worth checking out than a movie colossus to behold. Corbet’s visionary three-and-a-half-hour postwar American epic, shot in VistaVision, has taken on the imposing aura of its architect protagonist’s style. Little about it is tailored to today’s more prescribed movie world. It even has an intermission. And yet 'The Brutalist' isn’t just one of the most acclaimed films of the year, it’s edged perilously close to the mainstream. For Corbet, the 36-year-old director, it’s a surprising turn of events. His 215-minute movie, he thought, was surely destined for cult-movie status. 'It’s a great reminder that anything can be mainstreamed,' Corbet says. 'That gives me real hope for the future of the medium. Six months ago, the powers that be, many people were telling me that the film is un-distributable.' Corbet, sitting in the offices of A24, which acquired his film out of the Venice Film Festival, smiles. 'I was definitely not so popular with people as recently as August.' Yet since its arrival at Venice in September, 'The Brutalist' has emerged as a major Oscar contender. Last week, it was nominated for seven Golden Globes. Numerous critics groups have named it the best film of the year. But Corbet and 'The Brutalist' are aiming higher than awards-season success. 'The Brutalist' is a grand bid to bring some visionary bravado back to movies. Corbet, who was an actor in films by Michael Haneke, Olivier Assayas and Lars von Trier before committing to directing, believes film is stuck in a stasis. In a movie world ruled by safe bets and streaming imperatives, 'The Brutalist' dares to go for broke. 'I struggle a lot with movies from the last 20, 30 years,' says Corbet, who has some of the candid swagger of earlier American auteurs. 'There’s many exceptions. But there aren’t as many as there should be. I just feel that they’re perfunctory — narratively perfunctory, stylistically. There are no big swings.' 'The Brutalist,' written by Corbet and his partner, the filmmaker Mona Fastvold, operatically unfolds the fictional story of László Tóth ( Adrien Brody ), a Hungarian architect who, having survived Nazi concentration camps, emigrates to Pennsylvania. He’s scraping by in a working class life when his renovation of a library for a wealthy industrialist, Harrison Lee Van Buren (Guy Pearce), propels him back into architecture. Van Buren becomes László’s benefactor, commissioning him to build a sprawling institute. Their relationship, as patron and artist, grows increasingly tense and disturbed. 'The Brutalist' evolves as a grim character study and sweeping psychodrama about the rapaciousness of American capitalism. It's also a pointed critique of Hollywood. For Corbet and Fastvold, some of the movie’s central dynamic came out of their previous film, ' Vox Lux,' which starred Natalie Portman as a pop star whose fame is born out of a school shooting. The swelling ranks of financiers, Corbet says, made him miserable. 'Our experience on ‘Vox’ was really, really difficult for a variety of reasons. It was much more inside the Hollywood process and that’s partially just because it was shot inside the States,' says Corbet. 'After I made that film, I was like: I’m never working in the United States again. I was just being harassed by the powers that be daily. I remember at one point having a driver drive me around the block so that no one could be in my ear while I was at the monitor.' Fastvold and Corbet, who live in New York with their 10-year-old daughter, shot 'The Brutalist' in Hungary. If the movie is a self-conscious stab at resurrecting some of the visionary spirit of American moviemaking, it’s also a commentary on some of the forces that constrict it today. 'This is the closest we will ever get to making a film about making movies,' says Fastvold. 'We didn’t have a Van Buren but we certainly had our fill of complicated relationships with the people who hold the purse strings.' She adds: 'In the complicated relationship between the patron and the artist, there’s this sense of: I have ownership of the project because I’m paying for it and I almost have ownership of you.' Making 'The Brutalist' wasn’t a piece of cake, either. It took some seven years in total. When Corbet, behind sunglasses, reflected on that struggle at the movie’s Venice press conference, his voice quivered with emotion. Remarkably, it was accomplished with a budget less than $10 million — considerably less than the film’s scope would suggest. 'The film was certainly designed to be outsized and imposing,' Corbet says. 'We knew the film would be long. We knew it was a big object. We also felt it had to be. The form and the content needed to be lock step with each other. The appeal of Brutalism is its commitment to both minimalism and maximalism, and all of my films are playing with that dynamic. I like those extremes.' When Fastvold and Corbet sat down to write, they resolved not to be constrained by any self-imposed limitations. They wrote big. The couple, both of whom grew up with relatives who were architects, were fascinated by the connections of Brutalism, which favors raw concrete, and the war. 'Some of these things wouldn’t exist unless they had gone through the trauma experienced during the war,' says Fastvold. 'There’s an honesty in Brutalism. Instead of covering up how the building is constructed, this is showing things the way they are. That felt connected to how you handle or process trauma, by exposing it.' For Brody, the role had obvious echoes with arguably his most defining performance. In Roman Polanski’s 2002 'The Pianist,' Brody also played a Jewish artist warped by WWII. 'The research and the immersion needed to portray someone who lived through the horrors of World War II left me with an understanding that clearly lingered and exists within me,' Brody says. The actor grants that László is in some sense a stand-in for Corbet. 'Oh definitely. I find that filmmakers often need to exorcise their circumstances,' says Brody. 'Brady is very open and unguarded as he references his own journey and hardships along the way. It’s very relatable. I understand them.' Asked why he thinks moviemaking has grown less adventurous, Corbet describes systematic failure. It's not only business limitations, he says, it's a lack of boldness. 'I find this sort of faux humility to be exactly that,' Corbet says. 'You made a movie. You raised millions of dollars. You assembled a crew of 250. Stop apologizing for it.' He cites the movies of an earlier generation of filmmakers — Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky, Larisa Shepitko, Chantal Akerman — as films 'that really demand to be wrestled with — films that announce themselves.' 'What’s funny is that I think this conservatism has been really damaging for box office as well,' Corbet says. 'Audiences are so savvy that they recognize formulas being rehashed over and over again. And I would say arthouse cinema has become as algorithmic as Marvel and DC Studios.' Corbet already sounds delighted that his next project — a '70s-set horror Western — will further test whatever popularity has come his way thanks to 'The Brutalist.' 'You have to dare to suck,' Corbet says. 'I really think it’s so important.

Elon Musk considers funding Nigel Farage's populist party, a move that could shake up UK politics	LONDON (AP) — It’s a photo that sent a tremor through British politics: Elon Musk flanked by British politician Nigel Farage and a wealthy backer, in front of a gilt-framed painting of a young Donald Trump. Taken this week at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the image suggested that Musk, a key player in the incoming U.S. administration, could soon turn his disruptive attention to the U.K. Farage, Trump’s highest-profile British champion, confirmed talks are underway about Musk making a hefty donation to Farage's party Reform U.K. The Times of London reported it could be as much as $100 million, which would be far and away the largest political donation in U.K. history. The reports have sparked calls for Britain’s rules on political donations to be tightened — quickly. 'We did discuss money,' Farage told broadcaster GB News after the meeting with Musk. 'That’s a negotiation we will go back and have again. He is not against giving us money. He hasn’t fully decided whether he will.' Britain has strict limits on how much political parties can spend on elections, but they can accept unlimited donations, as long as the donors are U.K. voters or companies registered in Britain. Musk’s social network X has a British arm, Twitter U.K. Ltd., with a registered address in London. Critics say that is a loophole that allows foreign influence in U.K. politics. The voting watchdog, the Electoral Commission, is calling for changes including limiting the amount a company can donate, so that it can't put in more money than it earns in Britain. 'It’s crucial that U.K. voters have trust in the financing of our political system,' the commission's chief executive Vijay Rangarajan told The Guardian. 'The system needs strengthening, and we have been calling for changes to the law since 2013, to protect the electoral system from foreign interference.' Britain’s center-left Labour Party pledged during the summer election campaign to tighten the rules on political donations, though legislation is not scheduled in the coming year. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman Dave Pares said Wednesday that work is already underway to 'reinforce existing safeguards' against 'impermissible proxy donations.' Both the Labour government and the right-of-center opposition Conservatives are trying to figure out how to deal with Musk, who has taken a keen interest in the U.K. – and seemingly formed a strong dislike for Starmer. Musk often posts on X about the U.K., retweeting criticism of Starmer and the hashtag TwoTierKeir – shorthand for an unsubstantiated claim that Britain has 'two-tier policing,' with far-right protesters treated more harshly than pro-Palestinian or Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Musk has compared British attempts to weed out online misinformation to the Soviet Union, and during summer anti-immigrant violence across the U.K. tweeted that 'civil war is inevitable.' Farage has echoed some of those themes in his own social media output and his party’s anti-'woke' agenda, which includes pledges to slash immigration, scrap green-energy targets and leave the European Convention on Human Rights. Founded in 2021, Reform U.K. is the latest in a string of small hard-right parties led by Farage that have had limited electoral success, but an outsized influence on British politics. Farage’s opposition to the European Union helped push the country toward voting in 2016 to leave the bloc, a seismic political and economic break with the U.K.’s nearest neighbors. Reform U.K. won just five of the 650 seats in the House of Commons in July’s election, but came second in dozens more and secured 14% of the vote. Now it is pushing for fast growth, trying to professionalize its previously ramshackle organization and holding gatherings around the U.K. to recruit new members. Farage, a strong communicator who has embraced TikTok and other platforms, aims to emulate Trump’s success in using the power of personality and social media to reach the 'bro vote' — young men who are traditionally less likely to turn out at election time. Farage told GB News that Musk has 'already given me considerable help – understanding the process from start to finish, reaching disaffected communities who frankly feel there’s no point voting for anybody.' The electoral power of social media was on show recently in Romania, where far-right candidate Călin Georgescu came from nowhere to win the first round of the presidential election in November, aided in part by a flood of TikTok videos promoting his campaign. Amid allegations that Russia had organized the social media campaign to back Georgescu, Romania’s Constitutional Court canceled the presidential election runoff two days before it was due to take place. With Britain’s Conservative Party trying to recover from its worst election result since 1832, Farage dreams of making Reform the main opposition – or even the government — after the next election, due by 2029. That’s a long shot, but Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said a big donation from Musk could have 'disruptive potential in all sorts of ways.' He said Musk’s money would give Reform 'the opportunity to try and build up a serious campaign organization, which is something that they have generally lacked.' 'It’s certainly adding a new joker to the pack of cards in British politics,' Ford said. 'We’ve had no shortage of surprising developments here in the past few years. And maybe this is the next one.' ___ A previous version of this story incorrectly gave the reported amount of the donation as 100 million pounds. It is $100 million.	https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-nigel-farage-reform-uk-donation-6eb3ea7806b31275a52d71919d6fc35f	2024-12-19T06:01:16-08:00	
In Florida, a race is on to save the Everglades and protect a key source of drinking water	EVERGLADES, Fla. (AP) — In a region of Florida known as the River of Grass, John Kominoski plops into hip-deep waters. Blobs of brown periphyton – a mishmash of algae, bacteria and other organisms – carpet the surface. The air is thick and sticky as Kominoski, a Florida International University professor, pushes a rod to secure a tube that collects timed and continuous water samples that will help his team investigate the impacts of climate change and freshwater flows in this unique, sensitive ecosystem. The Everglades ecosystem was degraded and transformed when a highway connecting Tampa and Miami was built in 1928, cutting through a mosaic of prairies, sawgrass marshes, freshwater ponds and forested uplands. Sections of the road are now being elevated to restore water flows into the Shark River Slough – a vital restoration area deep in the Everglades National Park. The highway elevation is part of a massive state-federal project, approved by Congress in 2000 with bipartisan support, that aims to undo damages wreaked upon these wetlands. 'This is the biggest, most complicated and most expensive ecosystem restoration project in the world,' said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. 'It's really important that we get it right.' More than two decades into it, there are signs of progress. Wildlife is returning to some areas, regions dominated by the invasive melaleuca tree have dropped 75%, and enthusiasm is high as significant projects are finally underway, others gain momentum and funding pours in. But there are also worries: the projects are billions of dollars over budget and questions remain about whether some will work. Once about twice the size of New Jersey, today only half of the Everglades remains. Home to endangered and threatened species, the area buffers storms and is a vital source of drinking water for millions of Floridians. Decades of engineering projects for development and agriculture partitioned and drained water that once flowed freely from the Kissimmee River to Lake Okeechobee to the Florida Bay. Invasive species have transformed the land, and pollution from agriculture – primarily phosphorus – has impoverished water quality. Efforts to repair the Everglades are projected to cost more than $23 billion and take 50 years to complete. Water quality has improved, but challenges remain and accelerating salt water intrusion, sea level rise and higher temperatures are ongoing threats. Since 2019, the South Florida Water Management District has completed, broken ground on, or celebrated other milestones on some 70 projects. This year, lawmakers earmarked $1.275 billion for the next 12 months of restoration efforts – the largest annual amount allocated. It is unclear what Donald Trump may do with restoration efforts when he takes office, but during his first presidential term he allocated funds and helped pass the Great American Outdoors Act, which secured $900 million annually in permanent funding to improve access to public lands, protect watersheds and more. Big enough reservoir? Northwest of Miami, excavators claw mounds of blasted limestone as crews replace acres of sugarcane fields in a massive project that aims to supply clean freshwater to the Everglades. When the $3.9 billion Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir Project is complete, a reservoir and wetland will store and clean polluted water from Lake Okeechobee in central Florida before it’s discharged into the southern Everglades. Considered by some the most important of the projects, the reservoir, at 10,500 acres (4,249 hectares), will have the capacity to store enough water for the equivalent of about 480,000 to 720,000 homes. Its adjacent 6,500-acre (2,630.5 hectares) wetland – or the stormwater treatment area – will clean reservoir water before it’s discharged. Combined, the project will be nearly the stretch of a marathon. 'The wildlife and the mosaic of habitats that are here rely on getting the water right, and that’s what this project is about,' said Jennifer Reynolds, the director of ecosystem restoration and capital projects for the water district. 'It’s about getting the water right for the natural habitats and also to sustain the population of people who live and recreate here.' Although both the administrations of Democratic President Joe Biden and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, have called it a 'priority,' it is also among the most controversial projects. The reservoir will be 82.5% smaller than its original plan due to insufficient land. Questions remain about whether it will work when completed. Critics worry the project will be too small and too deep to significantly clean water. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is constructing the reservoir, has itself indicated uncertainty about whether the water will meet standards. Climate and development threats On that sticky May morning, Kominoski, the FIU professor, and research specialist Rafael Travieso wanted to know the water chemistry, including phosphorus concentrations. While phosphorous levels are rising slightly with increased water flows, data shows the region’s water quality is excellent. That's good news, considering phosphorous pollution has degraded water quality in the Everglades for decades and remains a challenge. The phosphorous has altered the ecosystem, contributing to toxic algae blooms, oxygen depletion and harmed native plants and wildlife. But measurements downstream tell a different story. Salinity levels have gone up, from a few days at a time to weeks and months, Kominoski said, suggesting that sea level rise and salt water intrusion are accelerating. South Florida’s low elevation is especially vulnerable to storms and accelerating sea level rise, with some estimates of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) by 2100. Experts have also warned of sea level rise impacts and rising temperatures that will decrease water runoff and increase evaporation. In its most recent report to Congress, a committee of experts acknowledged the enormous challenge of accounting for climate change impacts in restoration efforts. They recommended several actions, including developing a set of climate scenarios that are consistently used across all planning and implementation. The Everglades' long-term survival will depend partly on whether mangroves, among its most unique and threatened native species, can keep pace with climate impacts. These salt-tolerant trees that buffer erosion and hurricanes are shifting inland as sea levels rise. While restoration efforts have helped, higher seas remain a threat. 'There are certain points where they are overwhelmed with flooding and it will restrict their ability to stay alive and recoup, and then you experience wetland loss,' said Kevin Montenegro, a student at FIU. Saltwater intrusion also poses threats to biodiversity, drinking water, and peat soils, which store planet-warming carbon. Then there are the people. Florida has undergone decades of population growth, becoming the nations’ fastest-growing state in 2022. In Homestead, south of Miami, there’s pressure to develop flood-prone, low lying farmlands between the Everglades and Biscayne national parks. 'That is a major hurdle and that’s playing out in all 16 counties that encompass the greater Everglades region,' said Samples from Friends of the Everglades. 'Population growth and development are really intense threats right now. Back at Shark River Slough, the airboat roared into action. For the next several hours, Kominoski and Travieso glided over the reflective waters, past tree islands and lily pad clusters, dodging alligators and watching birds take flight as tiger-striped dragonflies clung to their clothes. Some signs of progress Steve Davis looked down at the Tamiami Trail from the backseat of a small airplane some 2,500 feet in the air. The wetlands surrounding the highway were once drier, but restoration efforts have helped increase flows. 'To see water in the dry season, that’s a big deal,' said Davis, chief science officer for the Everglades Foundation. 'We don’t want areas to dry out completely.' As parts of the Everglades are rehydrated and habitats reemerge, so are native species such as the wood stork. Wading bird colonies have returned to the Kissimmee River floodplain. Habitats in swamps or shallow lakes called sloughs are increasing in some areas. And flamingos blown in by Hurricane Idalia have stayed in the Everglades. 'In the last 10 years, progress has ramped up significantly,' said Davis. 'It’s more than optimism. We’re starting to see the benefits.' A new plan for managing Lake Okeechobee's water levels aims to have widespread benefits for restoration efforts. It calls for sending more water south, reducing harmful discharges to the east and west coasts, and allowing more flexibility in water management decisions. Other parts of the Everglades need more help. From the air, floating mats of harmful blue-green algae are sometimes visible on Lake Okeechobee – a sign of warm temperatures and excess nutrients. In the west, sea level rise and salt water intrusion are impacting drinking water wells where the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida live, according to Betty Osceola, an environmental activist and tribe member. The tribe's ancestral tree islands have been flooded by water mismanagement, they've said, decimating plants and animals they've subsisted on. Other areas are drier and face ongoing threats from polluted water and wildfires. 'Restoration efforts are mainly to benefit Everglades National Park,' said Osceola. 'So maybe the national park sees benefits, but at the sacrifice to the tribe.' That’s why the tribe has for decades advocated for the Western Everglades Restoration Project, whose goal is to improve the quantity, quality, timing and distribution of water. The project’s first major feature broke ground in July. The Everglades' future Inside the Everglades, Michael Kennedy-Yoon looked out into the sawgrass marsh with binoculars. The New York resident spotted a soft shell turtle. Earlier he saw two alligators. But he was most excited about the birds he ticked off his list, including an anhinga, a night heron and a swallow-tailed kite. 'I think that preserving and conserving wildlife and wildlife areas is some of the best and most useful uses of our taxpayer money,' Kennedy-Yoon said, sweat glistening on his face. 'Something has to change or else we’re going to lose areas like this.' But it’s more than just restoring and protecting the Everglades for recreation and its wildlife. As Samples from Friends of the Everglades notes, it’s also about building climate resiliency in Florida. She quoted the famous words popularized by author and conservationist Marjory Stoneman Douglas: 'The Everglades is a test. If we pass it, we may get to keep the planet.' Faced with development pressures and climate change, Samples said those words are more true today than ever. ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

EU leaders insist no decisions can be taken about Ukraine without Ukraine, or behind their backs	BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union leaders insisted on Thursday that no decisions can be taken about the future of war-ravaged Ukraine without its consent or behind the backs of its partners in Europe, barely a month before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Ukraine’s position is precarious more than 1,000 days into the war. Russia continues to make gains on the battlefield, pushing the front line gradually westward despite suffering heavy casualties. Ukraine’s energy network is in tatters and military recruits are hard to find. In a show of solidarity at a summit in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, many EU leaders repeated a variation of what has become a common mantra — nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, nothing about security in Europe without Europeans. Trump returns to the White House on Jan. 20 having promised to end the war in Ukraine quickly and talked up his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Many Europeans are concerned that it might result in a poor deal for Ukraine. The other big worry is that Putin will use any interregnum to rearm and cause more strife. Rumors are swirling in Europe about possible peace talks in early 2025, and whether European peacekeepers might be needed to enforce any settlement, but the leaders are trying to keep a lid on speculation about what they are prepared to do so as not to tip their hand to Russia. The priority now, they say, must be to strengthen Ukraine’s hand, should Zelenskyy decide it’s time to negotiate. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it’s important to 'ensure long-term aid to Ukraine -– it must be clear that we are prepared to enable support as long as it is needed.' Air defense, artillery and ammunition are high on the list, he told reporters. Asked about Trump, Scholz said that his impression from talking to the president-elect 'is that good cooperation between Europe and the U.S. is possible.' He said that 'the principle is always: no decisions over Ukrainians’ heads, and that of course means over those of the European states.' Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden had a similar message. 'We need to stand with Ukraine, and every step … needs to be taken with Ukraine and in the presence of the European Union. The future of Ukraine is decided in Europe and not elsewhere,' he said. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof underlined that only Ukraine can determine the conditions for talks, 'and it is not for us to talk about that. At the moment, Ukraine has not yet indicated that they are prepared to do so.' Zelenskyy said Kyiv needs the EU and U.S. to stay united next year, saying that 'only together the United States and Europe can stop Putin and save Ukraine.' He said that the only effective security guarantee remains NATO membership. Asked for details about what options are being discussed with the Europeans, Zelenskyy said he could not comment. 'There are no decisions about it. There is some will ... political will, and understanding that Putin is dangerous, and total understanding that he will not stop on Ukraine,' he said. It’s difficult to predict what Trump might do, and whether history might be a reliable guide. Under his previous presidency, in 2020, the United States inked a deal on a military withdrawal from Afghanistan directly with the strongest player — the Taliban insurgents — mostly playing down the concerns of the Afghan government and president. The chaotic exit in 2021, finally ordered by U.S. President Joe Biden, humiliated Washington and its allies in NATO as the Afghan security forces they had trained for years and invested billions in collapsed and the Taliban swept to power. In Ukraine, the 27-nation EU has provided at least as much support — more than 180 billion euros ($187 billion) since Russia began its full-fledged invasion almost three years ago — as the United States. But while the world’s biggest trading bloc can probably continue to prop up Ukraine’s ravaged economy, the EU is almost certainly unlikely to be able provide the military backing that the country’s armed forces would require to prevail. ___ Raf Casert in Brussels, and Geir Moulson in Berlin, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-ukraine-russia-nato-trump-support-zelenskyy-276690fb0a334c769b1631a16843a2f4	2024-12-19T03:14:57-08:00	
Italy's Salvini faces verdict for blocking migrants at sea. Case weighs limits of stemming migration	MILAN (AP) — Italy’s deputy premier, Matteo Salvini, has sounded defiant ahead of Friday’s court verdict in Sicily for blocking some 100 migrants at sea on a humanitarian rescue boat in 2019 when he was interior minister. Salvini, who leads the Euroskeptic, anti-migrant League, told a rally last week that 'defending the borders, the dignity, the laws, the honor of a country cannot ever be a crime.' He has vowed to enter the court in Palermo with his 'head held high' to hear a court’s verdict on whether he is guilty of illegally detaining the migrants aboard the Open Arms rescue ship in Italy's southernmost island of Lampedusa for five days in August 2019. He is also charged with failing to fulfill his public duties. Prosecutors have demanded a six-year jail sentence. A sentence of over five years would also automatically bar him from office. Whatever Friday's sentencing, it won't have immediate effect as verdicts in Italy are only considered final once two levels of appeals are exhausted, a process that can take years. He has already said he won't resign. In August 2019, Open Arms approached Italy with 150 migrants rescued at sea, some in the Maltese rescue area, with Lampedusa the closest port. They spent 10 days in international waters and another five days within sight of Lampedusa, with those onboard growing increasingly agitated amid deteriorating hygienic conditions. Some migrants threw themselves overboard, and minors were evacuated during the stand-off. Eventually, a court ordered the remaining 89 people onboard to be allowed to disembark in Lampedusa. Open Arms' Italian lawyer, Arturo Salerni, dismissed Salvini's claim that he was defending Italy's borders, saying it was his duty as a public official to protect the human rights of people on board. 'The supreme duty, especially of those who belong to governments, is to defend international laws and conventions, and people's rights,'' said Salerni, who is representing Open Arms as an injured party in the trial. 'It cannot be that the interior minister ... can deprive anyone of freedom.' The Open Arms standoff was just one of more than 20 during Salvini's hardline stand against migration when he was interior minister from 2018-2019 during the first government of former Premier Giuseppe Conte. He closed Italian ports to humanitarian rescue ships and accused the groups that rescued migrants at sea of effectively encouraging smugglers. In another incident, a German captain, Carola Rackete, entered the Lampedusa port in June 2019 against Salvini’s orders after declaring a state of emergency on her boat, the Sea-Watch 3, which had been carrying 40 rescued people for some 16 days. She was soon arrested. Italy eventually dropped charges of aiding illegal migration against her. Now transport minister in Premier Giorgia Meloni’s far-right-led government, Salvini has the support of the premier and other ministers in the Palermo trial. He also has won the solidarity of anti-migrant lawmakers from across Europe, who appeared with him recently in Brussels wearing T-shirts with his face that read 'Guilty for having defended Italy.' Since taking power in 2022, Meloni has moved to crack down on migration, striking deals with northern African nations in a bid to prevent departures while also setting up still-dormant centers in Albania aimed to vet migrants rescued at sea in the non-EU country without setting foot in Italy. 'Salvini gets the solidarity of the entire government,'' Meloni told the Italian Senate on Wednesday, to a standing ovation from right-wing lawmakers. He also got the backing of tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has publicly supported Italy's crackdown on migration, criticizing a judge's decision that stymied Italy's plans to screen migrants in Albania. In a post on X on Thursday, Musk said that it is 'crazy that Salvini is being tried for defending Italy.' ____ AP visual journalist Paolo Santalucia contributed from Rome.	https://apnews.com/article/migration-italy-salvini-trial-blocking-migrants-at-sea-8ad5d57d6d5804347f4b906d01240d87	2024-12-19T03:10:51-08:00

Human Rights Watch says Israel's restriction of water supply in Gaza amounts to acts of genocide	NEW YORK (AP) — Human Rights Watch on Thursday accused Israel of causing the deaths of thousands of Palestinians by systematically restricting and targeting Gaza’s water supply in a campaign that amounted to 'acts of genocide.' The rights group was the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza's civilians. In Thursday's report, HRW alleged that countless infants, children and adults have died from malnutrition, dehydration and illness as a result of actions by Israeli authorities over more than a year of war to deliberately cut the flow of water and electricity to Gaza, destroy infrastructure and prevent the distribution of critical supplies. 'As a state policy, these acts constitute a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population. Israeli officials are therefore committing the crime against humanity of extermination,' the New York-based group said. The rights group said that the 'pattern of conduct' outlined in its report and statements from Israeli officials 'may indicate' genocidal intent, but it did not come down definitively on one side. Under international law, proving intent is key in concluding whether the crime of genocide has been committed. Israel, founded as a refuge for Jews in the wake of the Nazi Holocaust, strenuously denies such allegations. It says Hamas is responsible for the destruction in Gaza because the group hides and operates in schools, hospitals and residential areas. It says the October 2023 Hamas attack that triggered the war — the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust — amounts to genocide. 'Human Rights Watch is once more spreading its blood libels in order to promote its anti-Israel propaganda,' Israel's Foreign Ministry said. It claimed Israel has worked to facilitate the flow of water and humanitarian aid into Gaza throughout the war. 'Israel will continue to ensure humanitarian aid enters Gaza, in full compliance with international law,' the statement said. The new report by Human Rights Watch outlined what the organization described as an extended, methodical campaign by Israeli officials to deprive Palestinians in Gaza of water. That has drastically reduced the water supply in Gaza, from about 83 liters (21 gallons) per person each day before the war began to between two and nine liters in the months since, the human rights group says. The World Health Organization says people require 50 to 100 liters per day to meet basic needs and keep sickness in check. Human Rights Watch said Israeli forces deliberately razed the solar panels that powered four of Gaza’s six wastewater treatment plants and destroyed a key reservoir. The group alleged Israel also cut off electricity required to run desalination plants and other infrastructure and restricted fuel for backup generators. When the International Court of Justice issued orders in January that Israel provide Palestinians with basic services and assistance, officials ignored them, the group alleged. Human Rights Watch said its findings were based on interviews with more than 60 Palestinians, accounts from utility employees, doctors and other healthcare workers and aid workers, and analysis of satellite images, photos and video. 'Doctors and nurses told Human Rights Watch that they had seen numerous infants, children, and adults die from a combination of malnutrition, dehydration, and disease,' the group said. In its statement, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said it has continued the operation of four water pipelines as well as water pumping and desalination facilities, and allowed international aid groups to deliver water in tankers. Some of the allegations leveled Thursday were echoed by medical aid group Doctors Without Borders, which released its own report accusing Israel of systematically attacking Gaza’s healthcare system and restricting essential humanitarian assistance. The group, which has worked in Gaza for more than 20 years, said its staff has been subjected to more than 40 attacks since the start of the war, including airstrikes, shelling and military incursions at health facilities. As of October, it said 19 of Gaza's 36 hospitals were shut down and continual fighting prevented many residents from reaching those still functioning. 'Attacks on civilians, the dismantling of the healthcare system, the deprivation of food, water and supplies are a form of collective punishment inflicted by the Israeli authorities on the people of Gaza,' the report said. 'This must stop now.' Israel's Foreign Ministry called the report 'entirely false and misleading.' It said Israel does not target innocent health workers and tries to ensure delivery of aid, and charged the medical group with failing to acknowledge Hamas' use of hospitals as bases 'for terrorist activities and operations.' The Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas killed some 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and took 250 others hostage. Israel's 14-month offensive has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and displaced roughly 90% of Gaza's population, according to U.N. estimates, plunging the territory into a humanitarian crisis. The U.N. and international aid groups say Israel has repeatedly restricted aid shipments into Gaza and done little to provide security inside Gaza to allow deliveries to reach their destinations. They say only a fraction of the amount of aid necessary to sustain life in Gaza is reaching Palestinians. Armed gangs have also repeatedly stolen truckloads of aid. HRW's report came two weeks after Amnesty International accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Israel dismissed the allegation as as 'entirely false and based on lies.' Israel has previously refuted charges lodged by South Africa in the International Court of Justice that its forces have carried out inhumane acts in the embattled enclave. Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court is seeking the arrests of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for allegedly committing war crimes.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-genocide-human-rights-watch-0cae5c250415975ebbfcfdab6808abc4	2024-12-19T02:26:21-08:00	
Blinken will announce aid for Sudan and talks about AI risks at UN Security Council	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to announce about $230 million in new assistance for conflict-torn Sudan during his likely final trip to the United Nations while in office, U.S. officials said. With the U.N. Security Council more divided than ever, Blinken is leading two meetings of the U.N.’s most powerful body on Thursday, capping his engagements with the world body after a tumultuous four years that saw war return to Europe and multiple crises in the Middle East. But neither will focus on Russia’s war with Ukraine or the Mideast, where the U.S. has been frequently at odds with permanent members China and Russia and almost always in the minority when it comes to Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Instead, in an apparent bid to produce a modicum of consensus, Blinken is leading Security Council sessions on artificial intelligence and Sudan, where conflict has sparked a dire humanitarian crisis that aid agencies say has not received enough attention. Blinken is set to announce $200 million for humanitarian aid and $30 million to help Sudan with a transition back to democratic governance, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity before the announcement. Here’s a look at America's top diplomat at the U.N.: Why is Blinken presiding over Security Council meetings? Blinken has been appearing in person and virtually before the Security Council since March 2021, just after assuming his position as the Biden administration’s top diplomat. In addition to several one-off council meetings, including one in February 2022 shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine, Blinken has gone to New York for a week every September for the annual General Assembly gathering of world leaders. The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically every month among its 15 members. This month, it's the U.S. turn. The country holding the presidency almost always organizes several signature events on topics its government chooses. Presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers often preside at these meetings, which ministers from other council nations are invited to attend. Why is the US not highlighting the Middle East or Ukraine? Russia and China have blocked all council action condemning the invasion of Ukraine. This has led U.S. officials to believe that a session on the topic, especially as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office with a stated goal of ending the war immediately, would likely be a waste of time. On the Middle East, the U.S. has frequently vetoed council action condemning Israel for its tactics against Hamas in Gaza, leaving it virtually alone at the United Nations in supporting Israel. Why is the US focusing on Sudan? War broke out in Sudan last year between rival generals heading the military and paramilitary forces. The fighting has left tens of thousands dead, forced millions from their homes and pushed a large swath of Sudan’s population to starvation — creating an often forgotten global crisis the U.S. is seeking to spotlight. The roughly $230 million in assistance expected to be announced Thursday is significant, but it is close to half of a nearly $425 million aid package that the U.S. announced for Sudan in late September. Sudan 'is facing one of the most dire humanitarian crises on the face of the planet,' State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters Wednesday. 'And so anything we can do to continue to work with partners at the U.N. and otherwise to shed light on that, figure out what ways we can continue to unearth and solidify humanitarian corridors and continue to push for a political solution, that’s absolutely a priority for us and we will continue to use ways to elevate that,' he said. Why did the US choose AI? The U.S. leads the world in developing AI technology, according to a recently released Stanford University index, and it has been in the forefront of U.N. action on AI. In March, the first U.N. resolution on artificial intelligence was adopted by the 193-member General Assembly. Sponsored by the U.S., it gives global support to an international effort to ensure the powerful technology benefits all nations, respects human rights and is 'safe, secure and trustworthy.' Blinken said AI has the potential to do 'tremendous good' but can also pose 'tremendous threats to the international peace and security that this council is charged with upholding.' He noted that 'repressive regimes are using AI-enabled surveillance to target journalists and political dissidents' and that 'if algorithms are built into weapon systems, and if they malfunction, they could spark a conflict.' 'By setting rules of the road for AI we can minimize these risks, we can harness the exceptional promise of this technology,' he said. Will Blinken confront Russia? Blinken has represented the U.S. at the Security Council about half a dozen times at meetings ranging from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to the war in Gaza. Russia, like the U.S. and China, is a permanent veto-holding member of the 15-nation council, and both have seats at its horseshoe-shaped table. But apart from pointed disagreements during debates, there have been no confrontations or one-on-one meetings between Blinken and Russian diplomats at previous U.N. meetings — and there was none on Thursday. Blinken thanked Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia after his remarks — as is custom — even though Nebenzia accused the U.S. of imposing rules on others but not abiding by them. But the Russian envoy agreed that 'we cannot allow AI to dominate human beings and human values.' It is not unusual for Blinken or other senior U.S. officials to attend international meetings and conferences where Russian officials are present, but interactions are rare. ___ Lee reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/un-security-council-blinken-russia-middle-east-1bb12abf78571cddbfafe41b35b871df	2024-12-19T02:24:19-08:00	
Bank of England set to keep UK interest rates on hold despite paltry economic growth	LONDON (AP) — The U.K.'s central bank is set to keep interest rates on hold later Thursday as inflation has moved further above its target rate, even though the British economy is flatlining at best. The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to keep the bank's main interest rate unchanged at 4.75% in the wake of figures showing inflation rising to 2.6%, further above the target of 2%. With price pressures elevated in the crucial services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the U.K. economy, and wages strong, there are few indications that inflation will get back towards the target anytime soon. As a result, the rate-setting panel, which last cut its key rate in November, is set to take a cautious stance, as lower borrowing rates could stoke inflation. That's a disappointment for many struggling sectors in the U.K. economy that would be helped by lower interest rates in an environment of paltry growth — in fact the British economy has contracted for two months in a row. 'Persistent price pressures will prevent the Bank of England from responding to flat output and falling employment by cutting interest rates,' said Andrew Wishart, an economist at Berenberg Bank. Few economists think interest rates will drop dramatically in 2025 either. It's a similar picture in the U.S., where the Federal Reserve reined in expectations Wednesday of reductions next year after its latest rate cut. Critics argue that the new Labour government’s first budget in October has both elevated inflation pressures while also damping down on growth. A big increase in business taxes may see firms try to offset the additional costs by raising prices or cutting down on hiring. The government argues that it needed to raise taxes to shore up public finances and inject money into cash-starved public services. Still, inflation in the U.K. and across the world is far lower than it was a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-economy-interest-rates-growth-labour-4b3de36773e4ac73afa22b7c6ff8525f	2024-12-19T01:40:24-08:00	
US ambassador to Vietnam says US arms manufacturers could help Vietnam build up its armed forces	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — U.S. weapons manufacturers could work with Vietnamese counterparts to help build up Vietnam's armed forces, the U.S. ambassador to the southeast Asian country said on Thursday. 'Our goal is to ensure that Vietnam has what it needs to defend its interests at sea, in the air, on the ground and in cyberspace,' U.S. Ambassador Mark Knapper said at an international arms expo in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. Vietnam is hosting the expo that brings together 250 exhibitors including geopolitical rivals including the U.S., China, Russia, Ukraine, Israel and Iran. The expo, held at Hanoi's Gia Lam airport, continues through Sunday. U.S. exhibitors include Boeing and Textron Aviation. China is present with Norinco and Gaodu International Trade. Iran’s defense ministry pavilion isn't far from booths set up by Israeli companies Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries. A number of Russian firms are also in attendance along with Ukraine’s Motor Sich. Vietnam has been trying to increase its domestic arms manufacturing while reducing its reliance on Russia for weapon imports. In 2022, Russia made up around 60% of all of Vietnam's military purchases, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But Vietnam's longstanding efforts to diversify its imports have been accelerated by the war in Ukraine. It has also been trying to boost its own capacity to make arms and displayed indigenously-made military equipment at the expo. A key driver for Vietnam is the escalating tensions in the South China Sea, a key trade and security route. It a flashpoint in Asia and a fault line in the U.S.-China regional rivalry. Vietnam has been critical of China’s increasingly hostile actions in the disputed waters. Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries have overlapping claims in the busy sea passage. Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh called the event 'message of peace, cooperation and development.' He was later given a tour of a military plane made by U.S. firm Lockheed Martin.	https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-arms-weapons-exposition-manufacturing-0257d237db09c22a8694a1964ea96941	2024-12-19T00:38:32-08:00	
Putin opens his annual news conference, an event he uses to reinforce his authority	MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday held his marathon news conference and call-in show, an annual event he has used to reinforce his authority and demonstrate sweeping control of the country’s political scene. Putin began by boasting about Russia's economic performance, saying that it's on track to grow by nearly 4% this year. He acknowledged that consumer inflation is high at 9.3%, but noted Central Bank's efforts to bring it down and insisted that the situation in the economy remains 'stable.' The tightly choreographed session, which is broadcast live by state-controlled TV stations across Russia’s 11 time zones, has been heavily dominated by domestic issues in the past years. Most journalists and ordinary people calling the studio ask about road repairs, utility prices, house maintenance, medical services, government subsidies for families and other economic and social issues. Journalists from the country’s over 80 regions wave colorful signs and placards in the hall near the Kremlin as they try desperately to attract Putin’s attention. Russian state media reported that ordinary citizens submitted more than 2 million questions ahead of the show. Questions about Russia’s military action in Ukraine and soaring tensions with the West are expected to be an important part of the show. Putin, who has held power for nearly a quarter-century, has vowed to bring what he describes as the 'special military operation' to a victorious end and boasted about Russia’s battlefield gains this year. But just two days before Putin’s news conference, a senior Russian general was killed by a bomb outside his apartment building in Moscow. The brazen killing of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, claimed by Ukraine, brought the nearly 3-year-old conflict once again to the streets of the Russian capital. Putin has declared that last month’s strike on Ukraine with a new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile was a response to Western allies’ permission for Kyiv to use their longer-range weapons for strikes on Russia. He threatened that Moscow could launch more strikes on Ukraine with the new Oreshnik missile and warned it could also be used to target military facilities of the countries that allowed Ukraine to use their missiles for attacks deep into Russia. Putin has said that Moscow stands ready for talks on a peaceful settlement to the conflict but reaffirmed his demand that Ukraine must renounce its bid to join NATO and recognize Russia’s gains. Ukraine and the West have rejected those demands. The Russian leader’s comments on Thursday will be closely watched for any signs of shift in his bargaining position ahead of the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to negotiate a deal to end the hostilities. Putin could also comment on the downfall of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who he has offered political asylum. Assad’s demise has dealt a painful blow to Russia, which launched a military intervention in Syria nine years ago to prop up Assad’s government amid a civil war. Moscow has quickly sought to establish contacts with the victorious rebels to secure its diplomatic and military personnel in the country and try to extend the lease on its air and naval bases in the country.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-press-conference-ukraine-trump-9eab438ab3eb8f9149a6dc5b67d20d86	2024-12-19T00:14:41-08:00	
French president arrives in Mayotte to survey Cyclone Chido damage	MAMOUDZOU, Mayotte (AP) — France's President Emmanuel Macron arrived Thursday to the Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte to survey the devastation that Cyclone Chido wrought across the French territory as thousands of people tried cope without the bare essentials such as water or electricity. 'Mayotte is demolished,' an airport security agent told Macron as soon as he stepped of the plane. The security agent, Assane Haloi, said small children are without water or electricity and have nowhere to go because 'everything is demolished.' 'There’s no roof, there’s nothing. No water, no food, no electricity. We can’t even shelter, we are all wet with our children covering ourselves with whatever we have so that we can sleep,' she said, asking for emergency aid. Macron went on an helicopter for an aerial appraisal of the damage. He then headed to the hospital in Mamoudzou, Mayotte’s capital, to meet with medical staff and patients. He will then visit a destroyed neighborhood. French authorities said at least 31 people have died and more than 1,500 people were injured, more than 200 critically. But it's feared hundreds or even thousands of people have died after the strongest cyclone in nearly a century ripped through the French territory of Mayotte off the coast of Africa on Saturday. Ahamadi Mohammed said Macron's visit 'is a good thing because he’ll be able to see by himself the damage.' 'I think that we’ll then get significant aid to try and get the island back on its feet,' the 58-year-old said. A navy ship was due to arrive in Mayotte on Thursday with 180 tons of aid and equipment, according to the French military. People living in a large slum on the outskirts of Mamoudzou were some of the hardest hit from the cyclone. Many had lost their houses, some had lost friends. Nassirou Hamidouni sheltered in his house when the cyclone hit. His neighbor was killed when his house collapsed on him and his six children. Hamidouni and others dug through the rubble to reach them. The 28-year-old father of five is now trying to rebuild his own house, which was also destroyed. He believes the death toll is much higher than what’s officially being reported given the severity of what he lived through. 'The 30 deaths are too small for how the situation happened, it was very hard,' he said. Mayotte, located in the Indian Ocean between mainland Africa’s east coast and northern Madagascar, is France’s poorest territory. The cyclone devastated entire neighborhoods as many people ignored the warnings, thinking the storm wouldn’t be so extreme. ___ Corbet reported from Paris.

Pakistan denounces US sanctions on its missile program as biased and putting regional peace at risk	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan on Thursday denounced new U.S. sanctions on the country's ballistic missile program as 'discriminatory' that put the region's peace and security at risk. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement that the sanctions 'have dangerous implications for strategic stability of our region and beyond.' It also cast doubt on U.S. allegations that targeted businesses were involved in weapons proliferation because previous sanctions 'were based on mere doubts and suspicion without any evidence whatsoever.' It also accused the U.S. of 'double standards' for waiving licensing requirements for advanced military technology to other countries. The sanctions freeze any U.S. property belonging to the targeted businesses and bar Americans from doing business with them. The U.S. State Department said one such sanctioned entity, the Islamabad-based National Development Complex worked to acquire items for developing Pakistan’s long range ballistic missile program that includes the SHAHEEN series of ballistic missiles. The other sanctioned entities are Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International and Rockside Enterprise. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller posted on X platform on Wednesday that the U.S. had been 'been clear and consistent about our concerns' over such weapons proliferation and that it would 'continue to engage constructively with Pakistan on these issues.' Analysts say Pakistan's nuclear and missile program is primarily aimed at countering threats from neighboring India. Security expert Syed Muhammad Ali called the sanctions 'short sighted, destabilizing and divorced for South Asian regional strategic realities.' Pakistan became a declared nuclear power in 1998, when it conducted underground nuclear tests in response to those carried out by its rival and neighbor India. The two sides regularly test-fired their short, medium and long-range missiles. The two South Asian rivals have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir since gaining independence from Britain in 1947. The disputed Himalayan region is split between them and claimed by both in its entirety.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-sanctions-ballistic-missiles-shaheen-proliferation-66eb36c61f3d22138972e4fd07c82a2d	2024-12-18T22:48:38-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli defense minister warns Yemen's Houthi rebels	Israel’s defense minister said Thursday the country would 'not allow the continuation' of shooting from Yemen’s Houthi rebels, hours after Israel launched heavy airstrikes on rebel sites. 'I suggest the leaders of the Houthi organization to see, to understand and remember, whoever raises a hand against the state of Israel, his hand will be cut off. Whoever harms us will be harmed sevenfold,' said Israel Katz, the defense minister. Israel would 'strike with force,' Katz said, and 'not allow the continuation of this situation of shooting and threats against the state of Israel.' The statement followed a series of intense Israeli airstrikes that shook Yemen’s rebel-held capital and a port city early Thursday and killed at least nine people, officials said, shortly after a Houthi missile targeted central Israel and badly damaged a school building. The Iran-backed Houthis have staged attacks throughout the war on ships in the Red Sea corridor and launched missiles at Israel. The rebels have so far avoided the same level of intense military strikes that have targeted Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. ___ Here’s the latest: Israel strikes Yemen’s capital after Houthi missile targets central Israel DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen’s rebel-held capital and a port city early Thursday and killed at least nine people, officials said, after a Houthi missile targeted central Israel. Israel said it conducted two waves of strikes in a preplanned operation involving 14 fighter jets and targeting infrastructure at Red Sea ports and in Yemen’s rebel-held capital. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said the strikes hit targets the Iranian-backed Houthis 'have been using in ways that effectively contributed to their military action.' The strikes risk escalating conflict with the Iranian-backed Houthis, whose attacks on the Red Sea corridor have impacted global shipping. The rebels have so far avoided the same level of intense military strikes that have targeted the Palestinian Hamas militant group and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. The Houthi-controlled satellite channel al-Masirah said some of the strikes targeted power stations in the capital, as well as the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea. The channel, citing its correspondent in the port city of Hodeida, said at least seven people were killed at the nearby port of Salif, while another two were killed at Ras Isa.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-19-december-2024-4257fd6348967f08b6bc37107e3f7830	2024-12-18T22:22:37-08:00	
As Russia's threat looms, guns and defense training surge in Finland	KERAVA, Finland (AP) — Unsettled by Russia's expansionism and emboldened by its recent accession to NATO, Finland is rallying to strengthen its national self-defense beyond its traditional military capabilities. The popularity of weapons training in the Nordic country has soared in recent months. Few places tell the story of the rise in Finnish affinity for self-defense more than shooting ranges that are riding a boom of interest. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s order for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine — another big Russian neighbor — in February 2022 continues to resonate in many Finnish minds, and partially explains the ballistics binge. The Vantaa Reservist Association, which operates a gun range in a warehouse once used to make sex toys, in Kerava, north of Helsinki, has more than doubled its membership over the last two years and now counts over 2,100 members. 'They have something in the back of their head ringing that this is the skill I have to learn now,' said association chairman Antti Kettunen, standing among bullet-riddled targets. 'I think that the wind has changed, now it’s blowing from the east.' Earlier this year, the coalition government announced plans to open more than 300 new ranges — a big jump from the 670 in operation today. Authorities are encouraging citizens to take up interest in national defense in the country with a 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with Russia, where firing shots in ice hockey has been more of a pastime than shooting bullets. 'Interest in national defense is traditionally very high in Finland and especially these days with the Russian aggression on Ukraine, the interest has risen even more,' lawmaker Jukka Kopra, who chairs Finland’s defense committee, told AP earlier in December. Inspired largely by concerns over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland became the 31st member of the NATO military alliance last year. Western neighbor Sweden followed suit in March. The two countries last month announced plans to boost their civil defense strategies, without mentioning Russia by name. The surge in self-defense strategies doesn’t stop at shooting ranges. The National Defense Training Association says it has hosted a collective total of 120,000 training days this year, more than double the number three years ago. The national reservists' association, which is about 90% composed of military reservists but also some hobbyists, has grown by more than two-thirds to over 50,000 members since the invasion of Ukraine. And unlike some other European countries, Finland has kept around 50,000 Cold-War era civil defense shelters, which could accommodate roughly 85% of the population of about 5.5 million people. 'This is the new era of civil defense shelters, which is against the newest developments of war,' said Tomi Rask, of Helsinki Rescue Services, during a recent tour of one shelter in the capital. 'We know that all of our neighbors have the capability of harming us, of harming our citizens, and we think that we need to prepare.' Wearing camouflage at the range in Kerava, military reservists and firearm hobbyists bob and weave their way through an obstacle course, at times opening fire with deafening Glock handguns against human-shaped targets. 'Some people do this just for fun,' said member Miikka Kallio, a 38-year-old firefighter. 'Some (do) maybe because of our eastern neighbor: I’ve heard comments that they’ve joined the reservists because of the Russian attack (on Ukraine.)' Finland is no stranger to tensions with Russia and a big part of the country's national identity was forged battling its eastern neighbor - gaining independence from the Russian empire in 1917 and then fending off a large Soviet force with its tiny, ill-equipped army in what become known as the Winter War at the start of the Second World War. Kettunen said learning to shoot guns is a bit like learning to swim: Both require training and preparation. 'When you need to know how to shoot or swim, and you don’t, it’s too late,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/finland-russia-nato-80b96bce6bb1f04884a825770014611a	2024-12-18T22:10:16-08:00	
Two highway crashes in southeastern Afghanistan kill 50 people and injure 76	Two highway crashes in southeastern Afghanistan have killed a combined total of 50 people and injured 76, a government spokesman said Thursday. One was a collision between a passenger bus and an oil tanker on the Kabul-Kandahar highway late Wednesday, said Hafiz Omar, a spokesman for the governor of Ghazni province. The other was in a different area of the same highway, which connects the Afghan capital with the south. 'The injured have been taken to hospitals in Ghazni and authorities are in the process of handing over the bodies to families,' said Omar. Patients in a more serious condition were transferred to Kabul. Women and children are among the casualties, he added. Traffic accidents are common in Afghanistan, mainly due to poor road conditions and driver carelessness.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-highway-crash-fatalities-ghazni-7e10f075f18d9796902232a14b25e797	2024-12-18T21:32:44-08:00	
Number of dead and missing still unclear as first aid arrives in quake-hit Pacific nation of Vanuatu	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Amid the havoc wrought by a violent earthquake two days earlier, Ivan Oswald and his staff at Nambawan Cafe on an idyllic stretch of Vanuatu’s waterfront prepared on Thursday for lunchtime service. The menu for the usual lunchtime rush was replaced with defrosted sausages, readied for emergency workers who are sifting through rubble for those trapped alive or killed in flattened buildings when the massive, 7.3 jolt hit Port Vila, Vanuatu’s capital 48 hours earlier. Search crews were joined Thursday by specialists arriving in waves from Australia, New Zealand and France. Earthquakes are normal for the South Pacific nation made up of 80 islands and home to 330,000 people, but Tuesday’s terrifying shake was like nothing they had felt before. Centered 30 kilometers (19 miles) offshore, at a depth of 57 kilometers (35 miles), the quake has been followed by hundreds of rattling aftershocks. Death toll remains uncertain The death toll was still unclear and official information remained scarce. The government initially confirmed 14 deaths. On Wednesday, it said nine had been verified by the hospital -- but officials expected the number would rise. More than 200 injured people were treated, an official figure not updated in more than a day. On Thursday, telecommunications -- though piecemeal and patchy -- were more widely restored after a near total blackout following the quake. It offered residents of Vanuatu answers about the scale of the damage and about how many people were missing. As word got around that Nambawan had power and an independent internet source, rescuers, tourists and locals visited to charge devices and attempt to locate their relatives. 'We've had a few tears,' said Oswald, the cafe's owner. 'I can't help with the rescue, but I can help with this.' Damage concentrated in the capital The extent of the havoc became clearer on Thursday. The worst-hit area was Port Vila's downtown, busy with lunchtime shoppers on Tuesday. Some outlying islands and villages near the quake's epicenter have experienced landslides. Infrastructure damage was extensive — including to hospitals, roads, buildings, two major water reservoirs and gas pipes — the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late on Wednesday. Response efforts were hampered by access problems. A massive landslide has blocked the sea port, limiting the transport of essential supplies and personnel, the UN agency said. The airport was open only for humanitarian use on Thursday, but the runway has been deemed operational and the resumption of commercial flights will be considered on Friday. Fears over water and damage to buildings Aid agencies told The Associated Press on Wednesday that their biggest worries were about drinking water and shelter for those unable to return home. The main utilities provider, UNELCO, said it could take two weeks to fully restore water service, according to the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation. While the search for survivors and recovery of bodies centered on two collapsed buildings in the city center, homes and businesses throughout Port Vila need structural checks by engineers before they can be used again. Australian search experts on Thursday joined locals who had desperately dug for people yelling out from the crumpled buildings. After dramatic rescues of dust-covered survivors that lifted spirits on Tuesday and Wednesday, the mood had become bleaker about the prospects for those trapped, residents said. It was not known how many people remained in the buildings — a garage and a surf clothing store. Among the dead were two Chinese nationals, according to China’s official Xinhua News Agency, which cited Gu Zihua, an official at the Chinese embassy in Vanuatu. An economic blow Another building housing embassies for several countries — including the United States, France and New Zealand — also crumpled, but no casualties were reported. Military flights evacuated 148 Australian nationals from Vanuatu late on Wednesday. The quake at the start of the summer season in the tourism-dependent island nation threatened an economic crisis if tourists did not return, said Glen Craig, chair of the Vanuatu Business Resilience Council. 'We've had such bad luck,' said Craig, referring to the three cyclones that struck in 2023 and the collapse of Vanuatu's national airline in May. 'We were just getting back on our feet and we were really looking forward to a bumper summer.'	https://apnews.com/article/vanuatu-earthquake-pacific-port-vila-rescue-1a4ce87db29567875d148a46edbce671	2024-12-18T20:58:03-08:00	
Japanese newspaper boss who influenced the nation's postwar politics died at 98	TOKYO (AP) — Tsuneo Watanabe, the powerful head of Japan's largest newspaper who had close ties with the country's powerful conservative leaders, has died, his company said Thursday. He was 98. Watanabe, the editor-in-chief of the Yomiuri Shimbun for over 30 years, died of pneumonia at a Tokyo hospital on Thursday, the Yomiuri said. Watanabe joined the newspaper in 1950 and covered politics throughout his career, attending editorial meetings until last month. He was still checking copy in his hospital room days before his death, the newspaper said. Watanabe cultivated close ties with conservative leaders who governed the country across decades, like Yasuhiro Nakasone and Shinzo Abe, and to helped form Japan's conservative public opinion. Abe was also known as a loyal reader and once told reporters all his opinions could be found in the Yomiuri when he was asked a question about a proposed constitutional revision. Watanabe stirred controversy in 1994 when the Yomiuri published a draft revision to the pacifist constitution calling for a clear reference to the Self Defense Force, Japan's de facto military, and other changes at a time when such ideas were taboo. Born in Tokyo in May, 1926, Watanabe studied philosophy at the University of Tokyo, which was interrupted during the World War II when he was drafted into the Imperial Army, before joining the Yomiuri in 1950. Watanabe, in a number of media interviews, criticized the wartime military for its abusive treatment of soldiers and wasteful deaths. He was also known for his opposition to the inclusion of war criminals among those worshipped at Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni shrine, and criticizing conservative lawmakers who visited the shrine. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he has met Watanabe a number of times and 'learned a lot from him about the war and perspectives on Japanese wartime history.' He said he also recently reread one of Watanabe's books on the governing Liberal Democratic Party and was impressed by his insights. Ishiba, embattled and heading a minority government after his party's election loss in October, said 'Under the current political situation, I wish we could seek his advice about our party, the democracy and the future of Japan as a peace-loving nation.' Watanabe served as Washington bureau chief and head of the political news section for the paper before becoming president and editor-in-chief of the Yomiuri Shimbun in 1991. He became chairman of the company in 2004. Despite his brief affiliation with the communist party as a student, Watanabe converted to staunch anti-communism. Watanabe also owned the Yomiuri Giants, Japan’s most popular baseball team, and served on an advisory panel for sumo wrestling.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-yomiuri-newspaper-media-baseball-d5fdb01234c86953d131f3d7a790a2b6	2024-12-18T20:16:33-08:00	
Separated for decades, Assad's fall spurs hope for families split by Golan Heights buffer zone	MAJDAL SHAMS, Golan Heights (AP) — The four sisters gathered by the side of the road, craning their necks to peer far beyond the razor wire-reinforced fence snaking across the mountain. One took off her jacket and waved it slowly above her head. In the distance, a tiny white speck waved frantically from the hillside. 'We can see you!' Soha Safadi exclaimed excitedly on her cellphone. She paused briefly to wipe away tears that had begun to flow. 'Can you see us too?' The tiny speck on the hill was Soha’s sister, Sawsan. Separated by war and occupation, they hadn’t seen each other in person for 22 years. The six Safadi sisters belong to the Druze community, one of the Middle East’s most insular religious minorities. Its population is spread across Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Golan Heights, a rocky plateau that Israel seized from Syria in 1967 and annexed in 1981. The U.S. is the only country to recognize Israel's control; the rest of the world considers the Golan Heights occupied Syrian territory. Israel's seizure of the Golan Heights split families apart. Five of the six Safadi sisters and their parents live in Majdal Shams, a Druze town next to the buffer zone created between the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights and Syria. But the sixth, 49-year-old Sawsan, married a man from Jaramana, a town on the outskirts of the Syrian capital, Damascus, 27 years ago and has lived in Syria ever since. They have land in the buffer zone, where they grow olives and apples and also maintain a small house. With very few visits allowed to relatives over the years, a nearby hill was dubbed 'Shouting Hill,' where families would gather on either side of the fence and use loudspeakers to speak to each other. The practice declined as the internet made video calls widely accessible, while the Syrian war that began in 2011 made it difficult for those on the Syrian side to reach the buffer zone. But since the Dec. 8 fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime, families like the Safadis, are starting to revive the practice. They cling to hope, however faint, that regime change will herald a loosening of restrictions between the Israeli-controlled area and Syria that have kept them from their loved ones for so long. 'It was something a bit different. You see her in person. It feels like you could be there in two minutes by car,' Soha Safadi, 51, said Wednesday after seeing the speck that was her sister on the hill. 'This is much better, much better.' Since Assad’s fall, the sisters have been coming to the fence every day to see Sawsan. They make arrangements by phone for a specific time, and then make a video call while also trying to catch a glimpse of each other across the hill. 'She was very tiny, but I could see her,' Soha Safadi said. 'There were a lot of mixed feelings — sadness, joy and hope. And God willing, God willing, soon, soon, we will see her' in person. After Assad fell, the Israeli military pushed through the buffer zone and into Syria proper. It has captured Mount Hermon, Syria’s tallest mountain, known as Jabal al Sheikh in Arabic, on the slopes of which lies Majdal Shams. The buffer zone is now a hive of military and construction activity, and Sawsan can’t come close to the fence. While it is far too early to say whether years of hostile relations between the two countries will improve, the changes in Syria have sparked hope for divided families that maybe, just maybe, they might be able to meet again. 'This thing gave us a hope … that we can see each other. That all the people in the same situation can meet their families,' said another sister, 53-year-old Amira Safadi. Yet seeing Sawsan across the hill, just a short walk away, is also incredibly painful for the sisters. They wept as they waved, and cried even more when their sister put their nephew, 24-year-old Karam, on the phone. They have only met him once, during a family reunion in Jordan. He was 2 years old. 'It hurts, it hurts, it hurts in the heart,' Amira Safadi said. 'It’s so close and far at the same time. It is like she is here and we cannot reach her, we cannot hug her.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-golan-heights-druze-separated-families-59ed4baf194aec54e1209b5349c4f244	2024-12-18T20:13:01-08:00	
Stock Market Today: Asian shares track Wall Street's selloff after Fed hints at 2 rate cuts in 2025	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares skidded Thursday in Asia after U.S. stocks tumbled to one of their worst days of the year when the Federal Reserve hinted it may deliver fewer rate cuts in 2025 than earlier thought. The Fed cut its key rate by a quarter of a percentage point to between 4.25% and 4.5%, as expected. Other major central banks have stood pat this week, with the Bank of Japan opting Thursday to keep its benchmark rate at 0.25%. That decision, which also was no surprise, pushed the dollar higher against the Japanese yen. Asian markets fell, but generally by less than 2%, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225 falling 0.7% to 38,813.58. The dollar was trading at 156.44 yen, up from 154.79 yen. A weaker yen tends to push prices higher in Japan, which depends heavily on imports, and that in turn raises pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise rates. Analysts say they expect a BOJ rate hike in January, but also that the central bank is wary of big changes as it waits to see possible shocks from President-elect Donald Trump's policies on tariffs. There are 'high uncertainties' surrounding Japan's business outlook and prices and developments in foreign economies and commodity prices, the BOJ said in a statement. Chinese markets also declined. The Hang Seng index fell 0.5% to 19,760.10, while the Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.4% to 3,370.03. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed 1.7% to 8,168.20, while the Kospi in South Korea slipped 2% to 2,435.93. India's Sensex fell 1.1%. In Taiwan, the Taiex lost 1%, while Bangkok's SET fell 1.1%. On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 3%, just shy of its biggest loss for the year, to close at 5,872.16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1,123 points, or 2.6%, to 42,326.87, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 3.6% to 19,392.69. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks tumbled 4.4%. Wednesday's rate cut is the third this year after it began in September to lower rates from a two-decade high to support the job market. Wall Street loves easier interest rates, but the cut was already widely expected and investors were more focused on how much more the Fed will cut next year. A lot is riding on it, particularly after expectations for a series of cuts in 2025 helped the U.S. stock market set an all-time high 57 times so far in 2024. Fed officials released projections on Wednesday showing the median expectation among them is for two more cuts to the federal funds rate in 2025, or half a percentage point’s worth. That’s down from the four cuts expected just three months ago. 'We are in a new phase of the process,' Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. Asked why Fed officials are looking to slow their cuts, he pointed to how well the job market is performing overall and how recent inflation readings have picked up. Powell said some Fed officials, but not all, are also already trying to incorporate uncertainties inherent in a new administration coming into the White House. Worries are rising on Wall Street that President-elect Donald Trump’s preference for tariffs and other policies could further fuel inflation. 'When the path is uncertain, you go a little slower,' Powell said. It’s 'not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.' The reduced expectations for 2025 rate cuts sent Treasury yields higher, squeezing the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40% late Tuesday, which is a notable move for the bond market. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, climbed to 4.35% from 4.25%. Nvidia, the superstar stock responsible for a chunk of Wall Street’s rally to records in recent years, fell 1.1% to extend its weekslong funk. It has dropped more than 13% from its record set last month and fallen in nine of the last 10 days as its big momentum slows. In other dealings early Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gave up 46 cents to $69.56 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 42 cents to $72.97 per barrel. The euro rose to $1.0396 from $1.0355.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-japan-powell-710f79b27e09782eb68f31710c226460	2024-12-18T20:09:59-08:00	
Thousands of Syrian doctors work in Germany. It hopes they will stay after Assad's fall	BERLIN (AP) — Thousands of Syrian doctors work in Germany, and the fall of Bashar Assad is raising concern over the potential consequences for the health sector if many of them were to return home. Germany became a leading destination for Syrian refugees over the past decade, and some politicians were quick to start talking about encouraging the return of at least some after rebels took Damascus earlier this month. Others noted that the exiles include many well-qualified people and said their departure would hurt Germany — particularly that of doctors and other medical staff. 'Whole areas in the health sector would fall away if all the Syrians who work here now were to leave our country,' Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said last week. 'For us it is important that we make the offer to the Syrians who are here, who have a job, who have integrated, who are crime-free, whose children go to school, to stay here and be there for our economy.' Syrians have become a factor in a health sector that struggles to fill jobs, part of a wider problem Germany has with an aging population and a shortage of skilled labor. The head of the German Hospital Federation, Gerald Gass, says Syrians now make up the largest single group of foreign doctors, accounting for 2% to 3%. An estimated 5,000 Syrian doctors work in hospitals alone. Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, who puts the total number of Syrian doctors at over 6,000, says they are 'indispensable' to health care. Gass said the picture hospital operators are getting from Syrian doctors so far is 'very varied.' Some — particularly those with many relatives still in Syria — are considering a quick return if the situation proves stable, while others feel at ease and well-integrated in Germany and want to stay. But 'no looming mass movement toward Syria is recognizable' at present. 'It's certainly not the case that patient care would collapse in Germany if all Syrian doctors returned now,' Gass said. 'But of course we have the situation that these people often work in smaller groups at individual sites' — whose quick departure could force temporary local closures. 'We are well advised to treat these people respectfully,' Gass said. 'And yes, hospital owners are giving thought to how they could fill these jobs.' Many Syrian doctors have made Germany their home Dr. Hiba Alnayef, an assistant pediatric doctor at a hospital in Nauen, just outside Berlin, said she has been asked in the last 10 days, 'what if the Syrians all go back now?' 'I don't know — some want to, but it's very difficult and uncertain,' said Aleppo-born Alnayef, who has spent much of her life outside Syria and came to Germany from Spain in 2016. She said it's something she thinks about, 'but I have a homeland here too now.' She said she and other Syrian doctors and pharmacists would like to build cooperation between Germany and Syria. 'The Germans need specialists, Syria needs support ... renovation, everything is destroyed now,' she said. 'I think we can work well together to help both societies.' Alnayef said the German health system would have 'a big problem' if only part of its Syrian doctors decided to leave — 'we are understaffed, we are burned out, we are doing the work of several doctors.' She said Germany has offered 'a safe harbor,' but that discrimination and racism have been issues and integration is a challenge. Dr. Ayham Darouich, 40, who came from Aleppo to Germany to study medicine in 2007 and has had his own general practice in Berlin since 2021, said that 'as far as I have heard, none of my circle of friends wants to go back.' 'They have their family or their practices here, they have their society here,' Darouich said. German concerns that many might return are 'a bit exaggerated, or unjustified.' But he said Germany needs to do more to persuade medical professionals it trains to stay in the country, and that it could also do more to make itself attractive to foreigners needed to fill the gaps. 'We see that the nurses and medical professionals in hospitals earn relatively little in comparison with the U.S. or Switzerland,' Darouich said, and poorly regulated working hours and understaffed hospitals are among factors that 'drive people away.' ___ Associated Press journalist Pietro De Cristofaro in Berlin contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/germany-syria-doctors-refugees-5ca73a13c123b514fca33390acca0856	2024-12-18T20:08:29-08:00	
Gisèle Pelicot's ex-husband found guilty of rapes, sentenced to 20 years in prison in France	AVIGNON, France (AP) — A court in France on Thursday sentenced the ex-husband of Gisèle Pelicot to a maximum 20 years of imprisonment for drugging and raping her and allowing other men to rape her while she was knocked out, in abuse that lasted nearly a decade. The sentence against Dominique Pelicot was declared after he was found guilty of all charges against him. At age 72, it could mean that he spends the rest of his life in prison. The verdict was read by the lead judge of the court in Avignon, Roger Arata. Arata read out verdicts one after the other against Pelicot and 50 other men, declaring 'you are therefore declared guilty of aggravated rape on the person of Mme. Gisèle Pelicot' as he worked his way through the first names on the list. Gisèle Pelicot was seated on one side of the courtroom, facing the defendants as Arata announced one guilty verdict after another. The historic case has profoundly shaken France over the past several months. Dominique Pelicot admitted that for years he knocked his then wife of 50 years out with drugs so that he and strangers he recruited online could abuse her while he filmed the assaults. The appalling ordeal inflicted over nearly a decade on Gisèle Pelicot, now a 72-year-old grandmother, in what she thought was a loving marriage and her courage during the bruising and stunning trial have transformed the retired power company worker into a feminist hero of the nation. Stretching over more than three months, the trial galvanized campaigners against sexual violence and spurred calls for tougher measures to stamp out rape culture. Dominique Pelicot and 49 other men were tried in the southern French city of Avignon for aggravated rape and attempted rape and face up to 20 years imprisonment if convicted. Prosecutors asked that he get the maximum penalty and for sentences of 10 to 18 years for the others. They also requested a four-year prison term for another defendant who was tried for aggravated sexual assault. Of the 50 men accused of rape, just one was acquitted but was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault. The defendants were all accused of having taken part in Dominique Pelicot's sordid rape and abuse fantasies that were acted out in the couple's retirement home in the small Provence town of Mazan and elsewhere. Dominique Pelicot testified that he hid tranquilizers in food and drink that he gave his then wife, knocking her out so profoundly that he could do what he wanted to her for hours. One of the men was on trial not for assaulting Gisèle Pelicot but for drugging and raping his own wife — with the help and drugs from Dominique Pelicot, who was also tried for raping the other man's wife. The five judges voted by secret ballot in their rulings, with a majority vote required to convict and also for the sentences of those found guilty. Campaigners against sexual violence are hoping for exemplary prison terms and view the trial as a possible turning point in the fight against rape culture and the use of drugs to subdue victims. Gisèle Pelicot's courage in waiving her right to anonymity as a survivor of sexual abuse and successfully pushing for the hearings and shocking evidence — including videos — to be heard in open court have fueled conversations both on a national level in France and among families, couples and groups of friends about how to better protect women and the role that men can play in pursuing that goal. 'Men are starting to talk to women — their girlfriends, mothers and friends — in ways they hadn’t before,' said Fanny Foures, 48, who joined other women from the feminist group Les Amazones in gluing messages of support for Gisèle Pelicot on walls around Avignon before the verdict. 'It was awkward at first, but now real dialogues are happening,' she said. 'Some women are realizing, maybe for the first time, that their ex-husbands violated them, or that someone close to them committed abuse,' Foures added. 'And men are starting to reckon with their own behavior or complicity — things they’ve ignored or failed to act on. It’s heavy, but it’s creating change.' A large banner that campaigners hung on a city wall opposite the courthouse read, 'MERCI GISELE' — thank you Gisèle. Dominique Pelicot first came to the attention of police in September 2020, when a supermarket security guard caught him surreptitiously filming up women’s skirts. Police subsequently found his library of homemade images documenting years of abuse inflicted on his wife — more than 20,000 photos and videos in all, stored on computer drives and catalogued in folders marked 'abuse,' 'her rapists,' 'night alone' and other titles. The abundance of evidence led police to the other defendants. In the videos, investigators counted 72 different abusers, but weren't able to identify them all. Although some of the accused — including Dominique Pelicot — acknowledged that they were guilty of rape, many didn't, even in the face of video evidence. The hearings sparked wider debate in France about whether the country’s legal definition of rape should be expanded to include specific mention of consent. Some defendants argued that Dominique Pelicot’s consent covered his wife, too. Some sought to excuse their behavior by insisting that they hadn’t intended to rape anyone when they responded to the husband’s invitations to come to their home. Some laid blame at his door, saying he misled them into thinking they were taking part in consensual kink.	https://apnews.com/article/france-gisele-pelicot-rape-trial-verdicts-2b25791099f785fabb3c46123d30d9f9	2024-12-18T20:05:47-08:00	
South Korea's acting leader vetoes opposition-sponsored bills, deepening political strife	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s acting leader on Thursday vetoed a spate of contentious bills sponsored by the main opposition party, deepening political strife in the wake of parliament’s impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. The ruling and opposition parties have been bickering over how much authority Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country's No. 2 official, has assumed since the opposition-controlled National Assembly last Saturday voted to suspend Yoon’s presidential powers over his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law. The Constitutional Court is to determine whether to formally dismiss the conservative Yoon as president or reinstate him. Law enforcement authorities are also separately investigating whether Yoon's martial law enforcement amounted to rebellion. Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders have already been arrested over the case. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party earlier considered impeaching Han as well for failing to stop Yoon's martial law declaration, but shelved the idea after he became acting leader. Four of the six bills vetoed by Han were meant to introduce greater state financial assistance programs for the country’s agriculture and fisheries industries. The most contentious bill is the Grain Management Act, which would require the government to buy surplus rice if the price drops too sharply to protect the country’s farming industry and promote its food sovereignty. Han said the bill would cause 'immense' financial burdens on the government and eventually lead to further drops in rice prices. Another controversial bill is the National Assembly Testimony Appraisal Act, which would give lawmakers more power to request people to attend parliament hearings and submit documents. Under the proposed legislation, individuals could no longer decline such requests by citing the protection of trade secrets or personal information. The Democratic Party said the bill is necessary to determine the full details of Yoon’s martial law decree. But Han said the bill would likely infringe upon people’s privacy and that there are concerns among business leaders that key technology and company secrets could be leaked. 'I’m heavy-hearted because I’ve asked the National Assembly to discuss and act on the six bills again at a time when we desperately need cooperation among the government and the ruling and opposition parties,' Han said in televised comments at the start of a Cabinet Council meeting on Thursday. 'But the government should make a responsible decision that prioritizes the principles of the Constitution and the future of our country.' Democratic lawmaker and spokesperson Noh Jongmyun quickly criticized Han, warning him 'not to cross a line,' adding, 'We’ll immediately drag him down if he’s found to have collaborated with the rebellion.' Han’s office later sent formal documents on his vetoes to the National Assembly. To enact a bill vetoed by a president, the parliament needs support from two-thirds of its 300 lawmakers. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together hold 192 seats. Observers earlier speculated the Democratic Party would reconsider impeaching Han if he vetoed the bills. Another source of contention between the rival parties is whether Han has the right to appoint three vacant justices' seats at the Constitutional Court, as filling the vacancies could affect the court's decision on Yoon. The martial law enactment lasted only six hours, but it caused huge political turmoil in South Korea and set off alarms from its neighbors and diplomatic partners. Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the National Assembly to block its vote on his decree. But many lawmakers managed to enter a parliament hall and unanimously voted it down, forcing Yoon's Cabinet to lift it. Yoon has defended his decree as an act of governance, saying it was a warning to the Democratic Party, which he said has been using its parliamentary majority to obstruct his agenda. Meeting with foreign media on Thursday, Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer and spokesperson for Yoon’s emerging legal team, echoed Yoon’s assertion that his short-lived power grab didn’t amount to a rebellion. Seok said Yoon did not intend to paralyze the parliament and denied claims the president ordered the military to arrest his political opponents, including Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung. 'Regarding the charges of rebellion, he never even thought about it, so he cannot possibly agree to such an accusation,' Seok said. 'What kind of a rebellion is announced through a press conference broadcast to citizens, media and the whole world, as if he was saying, ‘I’m now about to commit a rebellion?'' Seok said. 'When the National Assembly followed the constitutional procedure to lift martial law after two or three hours, we abided by that procedure.' He said Yoon may appear in the Constitutional Court to directly defend his case. When asked whether Yoon would continue to ignore law enforcement’s requests to question him and search his office, Seok declined to give a specific answer, saying these matters would be handled by Yoon’s legal team, which he said is nearly assembled.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-impeachment-acting-leader-2b56a4b1c006bfe8c80742b37e11c52d	2024-12-18T19:21:28-08:00	
Macao's casino boom brings wealth but at a cost, 25 years since China's takeover	MACAO (AP) — When Portugal returned its colony Macao to China in 1999, coffee shop owner Daniel Chao was a first grader living in a different world. Since then his sleepy hometown has transformed into a bustling gaming hub lined with glittering casinos. Its once quiet streets are now jammed with tourist buses. But the growing wealth of the city dubbed the 'Las Vegas of the East' has not brought qualities of sustainable development such as economic diversity and high civic participation. 'What was once a relaxed, free place in my childhood has become a place that is crowded and highly commercialized,' said Chao. Macao will mark the 25th anniversary of its return to Chinese rule on Friday. Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting the city for three days and the city is festooned with celebratory banners and other decorations. A fireworks display is planned for next week. Since 1999, the city of 687,000 has transformed from a monopoly-driven gambling enclave into the world’s biggest gaming hub, packed with mainland Chinese tourists. Its GDP per person has more than quadrupled to $68,000, roughly on a par with Denmark and Australia and surpassing Hong Kong's of about $50,000. China rules Macao under a 'one country, two systems' arrangement similar to its governance of Hong Kong, a former British colony. Macao is the only Chinese city where casino gambling is legal and it has resorts run by affiliates of the American gaming giants MGM Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts. Since Macao opened its casino market following the handover to Beijing, its economy has grown to $46 billion in 2023 from $6.5 billion in 1999, despite economic slumps during the COVID-19 pandemic and a crackdown on the junkets that have facilitated visits by high-roller gamblers from elsewhere. The economic growth has come at a cost. Chao’s mother worked at a casino job that brought better pay and a bigger apartment, but also stress and irregular hours. He remembers doing homework at 5 a.m., after her night shift. When he was working as a teacher, his students often went to sleep late or had to rely on paid tutors because their parents also worked casino shifts. The city’s tourism boom has brought years of easy money that gave its businesses scant incentive to strive to improve their products or services and develop the resilience needed to overcome the hard times of the pandemic and competition from mainland Chinese products, Chao and some other residents said. Chao has considered leaving the city, but opted to stay. 'Leaving must come at a heavy price,' he said, adding that 'it seems Macao isn’t exactly unlivable yet.' The ruling Communist Party's agenda for Macao now holds sway, with city leaders often referring to national plans. That’s a marked shift from the past, when the city rarely felt any direct impact from Beijing, said Ieong Meng U, a professor at the government and public administration department of the University of Macao. He expects Macao to become increasingly integrated with nearby Guangdong province over the next decade, following plans to promote tourism, Chinese medicine, finance, technology and exhibitions. China has designated a special zone on Hengqin island in neighboring Zhuhai city, jointly run by Guangdong and Macao, that is planned to have about 120,000 Macao residents by 2035. The closer economic ties have coincided with more intrusive political controls, especially after huge anti-government protests in Hong Kong in 2019 that led Beijing to crack down on virtually all public dissent. A vigil commemorating China’s bloody 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests was banned. Pro-democracy figures were barred from running in Macao's 2021 legislative elections. Last year, the city toughened its national security law. In November, Macao Journalists Association expressed concerns over signs of declining press freedom, saying some local media outlets have been asked to withdraw their articles due to political pressure. Activist Jason Chao, no relation to Daniel Chao, decided to leave. After years of working to promote greater democracy, he grew frustrated by officials' lack of willingness to change and the tendency of Macao residents to rely on solving problems through seeking Beijing's help or personal connections rather than civic participation, a habit he says partly stems from the city's colonial heritage under Portuguese rule. 'I exhausted the tactics I had learned at that time,' Chao said. In 2017, Chao left to study overseas. He's now a director of a civil society organization serving Hong Kong immigrants in Britain. Some older residents believe life has improved in the past quarter century. Ka Man Chun, a retiree, likes the annual cash handouts, funded by gaming tax reserves, that the government has given residents since 2008. This year, each permanent resident received $1,240, Ka says he feels safe since he steers clear of politics. '25 years have passed, there’s nothing really bad,' he said. Macao’s public security, economy and welfare have improved significantly from the colonial era, said Anna Ng, a flower shop owner in her 60s. Though critics say Macao has failed to diversify its economy, Ng sees signs of progress in the city’s growing exhibition industry and says she's found new opportunities in cultural and creative activities. Enid Ieong said she has grown bored with the city's limited choices for careers and leisure activities and wants to join her boyfriend in Hong Kong. She dreams of living in Hong Kong's Sai Kung, an area famous for its scenic beauty and beaches. Ieong mocked the annual cash handout as compensation for what she calls the psychological damage of living in a gaming hub. 'I feel like I was born in a grand mansion, but am only responsible for sweeping the floor,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/macao-25th-anniversary-handover-casino-china-6f6bc0345cf94bd787a65c4623f7d7e8	2024-12-18T19:06:30-08:00	
Airstrikes hit Yemen's rebel-held capital and port city after Houthi attack targets Israel	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A series of intense airstrikes shook Yemen's rebel-held capital and a port city early Thursday, shortly after a Houthi missile targeted central Israel. It wasn't immediately clear who launched the strikes on Sanaa, which the Iranian-backed Houthis have held for over a decade. The Houthis also reported strikes in Hodeida as well. But initial information on the targets of the attack and the timing suggested Israel may have conducted the assault. Houthi-controlled media reported the strikes, but offered no immediate information on casualties nor damage. The Houthi-controlled satellite channel al-Masirah said that some of the strikes targeted power stations in the capital, as well as the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea. Rebel-held Hodeida, some 145 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of Sanaa, has been key for food shipments into Yemen as its decadelong war has gone on. There's also longstanding suspicion that weapons from Iran have been transferred through the port. The strikes happened just after the Israeli military said its air force intercepted a missile launched from Yemen before it entered the country’s territory. 'Rocket and missile sirens were sounded following the possibility of falling debris from the interception,' the Israeli military said. Sirens sounded near Tel Aviv and the surrounding areas, and a large explosion was heard overhead at the time. The Houthis did not immediately claim the missile attack, but said an important military statement would be issued in the coming hours, following a pattern of how they claim their assaults. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment. Israel has struck the Houthis in the past over attacks targeting Israel and in recent weeks have threatened to again attack the rebels. Israel previously struck Hodeida and its oil infrastructure in July after a Houthi drone attack killed one person and wounded 10 in Tel Aviv. American forces have also launched a series of strikes on the Houthis over nearly a year due to Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor. On Monday, the U.S. military's Central Command said it hit 'a key command-and-control facility' operated by the Houthis in Sanaa, later identified as the al-Ardi complex once home to the government's Defense Ministry. But on Thursday, a U.S. military official said the attacks weren’t carried out by the Americans, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing strikes. The Houthis have targeted some 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas' surprise attack on Israel. The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis have battled a Saudi-led coalition into a stalemate in a wider Yemen war that’s killed more than 150,000 people, including civilians. The conflict also has created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters that's believed to killed tens of thousands more.	https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-airstrikes-sanaa-israel-hamas-war-8f73755ccc47a34261cc041658403b4d	2024-12-18T16:54:11-08:00	
Researcher: North Korea can produce ballistic missiles for Russia to use against Ukraine in months	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — North Korea demonstrated this year that it could produce ballistic missiles and supply them to Russia for use against Ukraine in a matter of months, the head of a research organization that traces weapons used in the war said Wednesday. Jonah Leff told the U.N. Security Council that researchers on the ground examined remnants of four missiles from North Korea recovered in Ukraine in July and August, including one that had marks indicating it was produced in 2024. 'This is the first public evidence of missiles having been produced in North Korea and then used in Ukraine within a matter of months, not years,' he said. Leff also had briefed the Security Council in late June, telling members that the organization he heads, Conflict Armament Research, had 'irrefutably' established that ballistic missile remnants found in Ukraine early this year were from a missile manufactured in North Korea. The U.K.-based organization, which was established in 2011 to document and trace weapons used in conflicts to assist governments in countering diversion and proliferation, has worked in Ukraine since 2018. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed his country would 'invariably support' Russia’s war in Ukraine when he met Russia’s defense chief in late November, the North’s state media reported. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia objected to the second appearance of Leff at the council meeting, chaired by Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield of the United States, which holds the council’s rotating presidency this month. He claimed Leff represents NATO and the European Union, and questioned whether his organization could provide impartial assessments. And he accused Thomas-Greenfield of violating Security Council practices and transforming its meetings 'into a politicized act of buffoonery.' The U.S. ambassador retorted that Russia had vetoed a resolution that ended the monitoring of sanctions against North Korea by U.N. experts, which she said makes organizations like Conflict Armament Research and its independent, well-regarded experts all the more critical. She said its reports show why Russia was determined to block the renewal of the mandate for the U.N. experts. Russia and North Korea 'are engaging in unlawful arms transfers and training, in brazen violation of numerous council resolutions,' Thomas-Greenfield said. Leff stood by the organization's research and said its analysis highlights three observations about North Korea’s missile activities. It confirms the continued use of freshly manufactured North Korean ballistic missiles in Ukraine, he said, and the discovery of the 2024 manufacturing mark on one missile reveals the very short period between the production of these ballistic missiles, their transfer and eventual use in Ukraine. Leff also said the presence of recently produced missile components not from North Korea, some bearing 2023 production marks, 'illustrates North Korea’s robust acquisition network for its ballistic missile program, despite U.N. sanctions prohibiting the transfer of this material for military purpose.' North Korea’s U.N. Ambassador Kim Song insisted that its relationship with Russia is 'a positive contribution to international peace and security and can by no means be subject of the criticism.' He accused the United States and its allies of inciting 'confrontation and discord among nations,' by intervening militarily across the planet and providing Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid, including long-range weapons.	https://apnews.com/article/un-north-korea-ukraine-ballistic-missiles-e917b0eb55fd7489532c33d982731ff0	2024-12-18T14:20:27-08:00	
Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan chat fame and friendship	LONDON (AP) — Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan may be juggling multiple releases and busy schedules, but the bright young stars managed to reunite on Wednesday in London for a conversation at the British Film Institute. The former co-stars met on Greta Gerwig’s 2017 high school film 'Lady Bird' and were paired up again several years later in her adaptation of 'Little Women.' Though professionally their lives have taken them in different directions, they’ve remained friends and will 'dip back in every few years' to catch up, Ronan said. 'That is what is so beautiful about this point in our lives, we’re really lucky that the two of us are doing really well and our paths can continue to cross,' Ronan added, as her husband, Jack Lowden supported from the audience. Both had busy years appearing in multiple film releases that are now vying for awards recognition. Chalamet took on the role of Bob Dylan in James Mangold’s 'A Complete Unknown,' which is out Christmas day, and Ronan played a young alcoholic who tries to escape the depths of her addiction by moving home to the Orkney Islands in Scotland in 'The Outrun.' Chalamet also stepped back into the role of Paul Atreides in the epic sci-fi 'Dune: Part Two,' and Ronan starred in Steve McQueen’s 'Blitz.' The audience watched back-to-back scenes of the collaborations with Gerwig. Chalamet quipped that a 'Lady Bird scene is a lot better than I remember it being!' The conversation then shifted to their relationship with fame. Chalamet said it’s the 'most boring thing to talk about in my life.' Ronan agreed: 'I just pretended that all of that doesn’t exist.'	https://apnews.com/article/film-timothee-chalamet-saoirse-ronan-a31d362ad5f5f61691c9c81928b116b0	2024-12-18T13:57:28-08:00	
China's getting a big electric car battery swapping boost in 2025. Would that work across the globe?	Detroit (AP) — China will soon see a massive expansion of electric vehicle battery swapping, as global battery maker CATL said Wednesday it is investing heavily in stations there next year. Battery swapping is not new — but it's had a challenging journey. Adoption of electric vehicles has varied in regions across the globe over the past several years, and that doesn't always bode well for building new infrastructure. While the technology could do well in China, it's uncertain whether it could work in other countries. What is battery swapping? Battery swapping allows EV drivers to pull into a station on a low battery and receive a swapped, fully-charged battery within minutes. An EV has to be equipped with the right technology to receive a swap — and not many models around the world currently have it. Automakers have to buy into the idea, and EV adoption among consumers also has to grow, so that investing in new infrastructure seems worthwhile. Consumers also have to be comfortable not owning their battery. Why could it work in China? China is much further along in adopting EVs than other countries. Not only is it the world's largest auto market, but in July, the country hit a milestone with 50% of new sales electric — and it accounts for most of this year's global EV sales. China supports EV growth through government subsidies and mandates. So it makes more sense for companies to invest in unique EV infrastructure there because that's more likely to be needed. What other attempts at battery swapping have occurred? The most notable example might be Israeli startup Better Place, which tried its hand at swapping in 2007. But the company shut down a few years later after investing a lot of money and coming up against roadblocks with logistics. EV adoption was especially low at the time. Could it work in the United States? Europe? Startup Ample, for example, has a modular battery swapping station that it says can complete a swap in 5 minutes. That’s important as charging time remains a point of concern for prospective EV buyers. Even the fastest fast chargers could take at least 15 minutes for a decent charge. But in the U.S., pure EVs only accounted for 8% of new vehicle sales as of November. Meanwhile Nio, a rival Chinese EV brand, has about 60 swap stations in northern Europe, and the EV adoption is higher there than the U.S., but the same challenges remain. Different automakers put different batteries in their various EV models, so a station would need all of those available if the industry didn't agree to a standardized battery, and not all of those models are out yet in volume. This is something that really needs scale. Swapping could help with EV cost — currently a barrier to adoption for many — because a driver wouldn’t necessarily own the most expensive part of an EV: the battery. Greg Less, director of the University of Michigan Battery Lab, said with proper framing and education, people might like the idea of battery swapping. To him, it's not unlike buying a propane-fueled grill and purchasing a refilled tank every so often. But it would require a rethinking of car ownership. 'Where I could see it working is if we went entirely away from vehicle ownership and we went to a use-on-demand model,' Less added. 'I don’t think we’re there yet.' What vehicle uses might be b est for swapping? Battery swapping might make most sense for ride-sharing or other fleet vehicles. Drivers of buses, taxis, Uber or Lyft vehicles want to spend as much time on the road as possible, transporting customers and making money. If battery swapping can shorten the time needed to charge EVs, that makes driving one less disruptive to their business. ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

An arson attack targets a Montreal synagogue and a nearby Jewish office building is damaged	MONTREAL (AP) — A synagogue in a Montreal suburb was targeted in what police suspect was an arson attack early Wednesday, the second time the building in this Canadian city was hit by an incendiary device in little more than a year. Police said a nearby Jewish office building was apparently also targeted Wednesday, though it was unclear if the two attacks were linked. Montreal police received a 911 call shortly before 3 a.m. about a fire at the Congregation Beth Tikvah on the island suburb of Dollard-des-Ormeaux, police spokesperson Véronique Dubuc said. Firefighters extinguished the blaze and found an incendiary device at the scene, she said. A window of the synagogue was smashed and a door was damaged. 'Witnesses told us that they saw one suspect that was leaving rapidly shortly after the fire started,' she said, adding that the building was damaged by smoke but the overall consequences of the fire were minor. No injuries were reported and there have been no arrests in the case, Dubuc said, adding that police have not yet determined whether the fire was a hate crime. A few hours later, officers at the scene of the fire noticed a similarly smashed window and a damaged glass door at a nearby building belonging to the West Island office of the Federation CJA, a building frequented by the city’s Jewish community. Dubuc said no incendiary device was found at the second location. Police are investigating a possible link between the two incidents, she said. The same synagogue and the CJA building were targeted by arson in November 2023, causing minor damage to the synagogue’s front door and the back door of the CJA office. No one was injured in those attacks and police have not made arrests in that case. Jewish groups and politicians condemned the targeting of the Jewish institutions on Wednesday. 'This vile antisemitic attack against Montreal’s Jewish community is cowardly and criminal,' Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on X. Israeli President Isaac Herzog denounced the attack and called 'on the Canadian government to act decisively, and show that such hatred will not be tolerated.'	https://apnews.com/article/synagogue-arson-montreal-canada-49a8dace464e0b83def53ed21725bbe0	2024-12-18T13:21:29-08:00	
US effort to curb China's and Russia's access to advanced computer chips 'inadequate,' report finds	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Commerce Department's efforts to curb China's and Russia's access to American-made advanced computer chips have been 'inadequate' and will need more funding to stymie their ability to manufacture advanced weapons, according to a report published Wednesday by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The Biden administration imposed export controls to limit the ability of China and Russia ability to access U.S.-made chips after Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago. The agency's Bureau of Industry and Security, according to the report, does not have the resources to enforce export controls and has been too reliant on U.S. chip makers voluntarily complying with the rules. But the push for bolstering Commerce's export control enforcement comes as the incoming Trump administration says it is looking to dramatically reduce the size and scope of federal government. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new 'Department of Government Efficiency' to dismantle parts of the federal government. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. BIS’s budget, about $191 million, has remained essentially flat since 2010 when adjusted for inflation. 'While BIS’ budget has been stagnant for a decade, the bureau works diligently around the clock to meet its mission and safeguard U.S. national security,' Commerce Department spokesperson Charlie Andrews said in a statement in response to the report. Andrews added that with 'necessary resources from Congress' the agency would be 'better equipped to address the challenges that come with our evolving national security environment.' In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, chair of the subcommittee, pointed to an audit of Texas Instruments that showed the Russian military continued to acquire components from Texas Instruments through front companies in Hong Kong to illustrate how the export controls are failing as an effective tool. The committee's findings, Blumenthal said, suggest that Texas Instruments 'missed clear warning signs' that three companies in its distribution chain had been diverting products to Russia. Texas Instruments did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'While Congress must provide BIS more resources to undertake its critical mission, it is long past time for BIS to make full use of the enforcement powers Congress has conferred upon it and take aggressive steps to cut the flow of U.S. semiconductors into the Russian war machine,' Blumenthal wrote. It's not just Texas Instruments that's the issue. The subcommittee in September published a report that found aggregated exports from four major U.S. advanced chip manufacturers nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022 to Armenia and Georgia. Both of those countries are home to front companies known to assist Russia in acquiring advanced chips made in the U.S. despite export controls. China, meanwhile, has created 'vast, barely disguised smuggling networks which enable it to continue to harness U.S. technology,' the subcommittee report asserts. Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls in China, as President Joe Biden’s administration has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of chips in the U.S. But Chinese companies have found ways to evade export controls in part because of a lack of China subject matter experts and Chinese speakers assigned to Commerce's export control enforcement. The agency's current budget limits the number of international end-use checks, or physical verification overseas of distributors or companies receiving American-made chips that are the supposed end users of products. Currently, Commerce has only 11 export control officers spread around the globe to conduct such checks. The committee made several recommendations in its report, including Congress allocating more money for hiring additional personnel to enforce export controls, imposing larger fines on companies that violate controls and requiring periodic reviews of advanced chip companies’ export control plans by outside entities. ___ Boak reported from West Palm Beach, Florida.	https://apnews.com/article/china-russia-semiconductors-export-controls-advanced-chips-5b1bd1748d74a7e45dd0c91979215ef3	2024-12-18T11:02:12-08:00	
CNN says its report on a freed Syrian prisoner is not what it initially believed	CNN is acknowledging that a gripping story it aired last week depicting a Syrian man being let free from a Damascus prison after the fall of dictator Bashar Assad's regime was not what it seemed. The network said that it has since found out that the man shown in correspondent Clarissa Ward's report, which initially aired on Dec. 11, apparently gave a false identity. 'This moment captures the complexity of the situation in Syria,' CNN's Jake Tapper said on Tuesday. In the report, Ward was being escorted by a Syrian rebel through a prison that had been run by the Syrian Air Force intelligence services and emptied since the Assad government fell. That's what they thought, at least — until they came upon a padlocked door. The rebel guard shot the lock to open the door to a cell, where they found a man hiding under a blanket. Clearly bewildered and shaking, he gulped water when offered, said 'oh, God, there is light!' when led outdoors and hugged the guard when told of the change in power. He told Ward that his name was Adel Ghurbal from the Syrian city of Homs, and that he was a civilian who had been arrested three months ago and spent time in three different prisons. But a few days later, a Syrian fact-checking site, Verify-Sy, said that the man was really Salama Mohammad Salama, and that he was a former intelligence officer for the Assad government. CNN obtained a photo of Salama and, through facial recognition software, found that it was a better than 99 percent chance that was the same man from their report, the network said. Ward said Tuesday that CNN didn't know why he had been arrested. Verify-Sy reported that Salama, who had a reputation for extortion, had been thrown in prison because of a dispute with a superior officer over sharing some of the profits, she said. CNN has been unable to confirm that or locate Salama, she said. A CNN spokeswoman said that no one outside of the network knew ahead of time of the plans to visit the prison. CNN reported the scene as it unfolded, the network said. It was arresting video, and the temptation to air Ward's story was obvious. While CNN did due diligence and research in uncovering the problem after the fact, the question is whether the network could have, or should have, done more to verify the prisoner's story before it was used. 'I think we need to be humble about the challenges,' Ward said on the air Tuesday. 'It is a chaotic atmosphere, there is a huge amount of flux, and it is very difficult to verify information in real time on the ground ... Stories take unexpected turns. We have to continue to report them without fear or favor, but it is immensely challenging in this environment and I think we need to be transparent about that.' ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

Manhattan man pleads guilty to helping establish secret Chinese police station in NYC	NEW YORK (AP) — A Manhattan resident has pleaded guilty to helping establish a secret police station in New York City on behalf of the Chinese government. Chen Jinping, 60, entered the guilty plea on a single count of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government in Brooklyn federal court on Wednesday. Matthew Olsen, an assistant attorney general in the U.S. Department of Justice, said Chen admitted in court to his role in 'audaciously establishing an undeclared police station' in Manhattan and attempting to conceal the effort when approached by the FBI. 'This illegal police station was not opened in the interest of public safety, but to further the nefarious and repressive aims of the PRC in direct violation of American sovereignty,' he said in statement, referring to the People's Republic of China. Prosecutors say Chen and his co-defendant, Lu Jianwang, opened and operated a local branch of China’s Ministry of Public Security in Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood starting in early 2022. The office, which occupied an entire floor of the building, performed basic services, such as helping Chinese citizens renew their Chinese driver’s licenses, but also identified pro-democracy activists living in the U.S., according to federal authorities. The clandestine Chinese police operation was shuttered in the fall of 2022 amid an FBI investigation. But in an apparent effort to obstruct the federal probe, Chen and Lu deleted from their phones communications with a Chinese government official they reported to, prosecutors said. China is believed to be operating such secretive police outposts in North America, Europe and other places where there are Chinese communities. The country, however, has denied that they are police stations, saying that they exist mainly to provide citizen services such as renewing driver’s licenses. The arrest of Chen and Lu in April 2023 was part of a series of Justice Department prosecutions aimed at cracking down on 'transnational repression,' in which foreign governments such as China work to identify, intimidate and silence dissidents in the U.S. Lawyers for Chen and Lu declined to comment Wednesday. Chen faces up to five years in prison at his sentencing on May 30. Lu, who is due back in court in February, had a longstanding relationship with Chinese law enforcement officials, according to prosecutors. Over the years, they say, the Bronx resident, who was also known as Harry Lu, helped harass and threaten a Chinese fugitive living in the U.S. and also worked to locate a pro-democracy activist in California on behalf of China’s government. ___ Follow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.	https://apnews.com/article/chinese-government-justice-department-new-york-police-51213e1daf36cb8f615b329de06afe30	2024-12-18T10:08:47-08:00	
Egypt's prime minister briefly pauses a news conference after feeling dizzy	CAIRO (AP) — Egypt's prime minister was forced to briefly pause a televised news conference on Wednesday after experiencing some dizziness, a government spokesperson said. Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly, 58, was speaking at the new administrative capital in Cairo during his weekly Cabinet news briefing when he felt unwell, grabbed the microphone stand tightly and asked for a pause. According to Cabinet spokesperson Mohamed el-Homsani, the prime minister felt dizzy and had to pause his remarks but was soon better and resumed the briefing after a few minutes. Madbouly was speaking about President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi 's meetings at home and abroad. El-Homsani said Madbouli was exhausted, had experienced a severe cold days earlier but refused to rest and was tired after leaving the office late Tuesday. He also had several meetings on Wednesday morning, before the news conference, the spokesperson said, adding that the prime minister is taking medication, including antibiotics. Madbouly, an architect by profession, became prime minister in 2018. Egypt is hosting an eight-country economic cooperation summit in Cairo on Thursday with Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iran, Nigeria and Turkey due to attend the gathering.	https://apnews.com/article/egypt-prime-minister-mustafa-madbouly-dde9bc5a130b7f5c35a5c04ea904af88	2024-12-18T09:00:58-08:00	
China and India agree to work on solution to their border dispute in the Himalayas	BEIJING, China (AP) — China and India agreed Wednesday to work toward a solution to their long-running border dispute in the Himalayas after a military standoff that began with a deadly clash in 2020. The development follows a pact on border patrols the two Asian giants reached in October, which finally broke a stalemate that started with the clash in the Ladakh region. The clash was the first deadly confrontation between India and China since 1975 and sent tensions soaring. A statement from China’s Foreign Ministry after talks between the special representatives on border issues — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval — said the two sides would seek 'fair and reasonable' solutions and formulate a roadmap, undertaking the easier steps first and dealing with the tough ones later. The October border pact was followed days later by a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, their first in five years. Wang and Doval called for continued implementation of the border patrol agreement and said the two countries would strengthen cross-border exchanges, including the resumption of trips by Indian pilgrims to Tibet, the Chinese statement said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-india-border-dispute-d808afcdb6eb7a5deab3babea425bc6f	2024-12-18T08:10:29-08:00	
Cyclone Chido leaves Mayotte reeling. Warmer oceans fueled it	The Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte is reeling from Cyclone Chido, the most intense storm to hit the French territory in 90 years. At least 22 people have been killed since Chido made landfall on Saturday, as high winds swept away entire neighborhoods, damaged major infrastructure and uprooted trees. And while Africa's southeast coast is no stranger to devastating cyclones, climate scientists have warned in recent years that storms in the area are getting more intense and more frequent as a result of human-caused climate change. When is cyclone season in southeast Africa? Cyclone season in southeast Africa runs from December to March, when waters in the region are at their warmest. That's because warm water fuels tropical storms so they tend to happen when oceans hit their peak temperatures for the year. In recent years, devastating storms such as Cyclone Freddy in 2023, Batsirai in 2022 and Idai in 2019 all battered the southeastern coast of Africa — including swathes of Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Madagascar — during southern hemisphere summer. Cyclones are the same as hurricanes, but carry that name in the Indian Ocean and Australia. How does climate change make cyclones worse? Human-caused climate change, caused largely by the burning of coal, oil and gas, has heated up the planet: the atmosphere is now 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times. That matters because one ingredient for a cyclone, or hurricane, is warm water — at least 27 degrees Celsius (80 Fahrenheit), according to the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. With rising global temperatures, sea surface temperatures have reached all-time recorded highs. This warmer water can make the resulting storms more powerful, with stronger winds, heavier rainfall and more destructive storm surges. In 2022, a group of climate scientists found that cyclones that pummeled southeast Africa that year were made worse by climate change. Because of a lack of weather data gathered in the region, they weren't able to say by how much. Is Chido a ‘bomb cyclone'? Storm intensity is measured by central pressure — the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. A storm is considered a 'bomb' when the pressure drops rapidly, meaning the storm grows very quickly. According to NOAA, a bomb cyclone, also known as bombogenesis, occurs when the atmospheric pressure drops at least 24 millibars over a 24-hour period. It typically results in extremely strong winds and heavy precipitation, which can cause coastal flooding. Hazards can also include blizzard conditions. Bomb cyclones are more commonly associated with cold-weather systems. Cyclone Chido intensified rapidly, leading some to tag it a bomb cyclone. However, while it intensified rapidly, it would not meet the bomb cyclone criteria due to different formation processes. In a tropical region, cyclones rely primarily on warm ocean waters and atmospheric instability rather than the temperature contrasts (typically between cold and warm air masses) driving bomb cyclones. Shortage of early warning systems Much of the African continent lacks the weather data and forecasting that other countries take for granted. Figures from the World Meteorological Organization estimate that the continent has just 37 radar facilities for tracking weather, compared to Europe's 347 and North America's 291. It means that countries vulnerable to weather extremes are less prepared when deadly storms hit, so they can't evacuate on time. Death tolls of the more devastating cyclones in recent years have gone into the hundreds — and 2019's Idai saw over 1,000 people killed. In 2022, the U.N. launched a project that aims to put every person in the world in range of early weather-warning systems within five years. The WMO's secretary-general, Celeste Saulo, has made better access to weather forecasts a priority for the agency, calling adapting to climate change an 'essential necessity.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Several children killed in stampede at a holiday fair event in Nigeria, state governor says	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Several children have died during a stampede on Wednesday at a holiday funfair in southwestern Nigeria, authorities said. The incident happened at the Islamic High School in Basorun, Oyo State, near the economic hub of Lagos. Security forces attended the scene and arrested the event organizers, state governor Seyi Makinde said in a statement. 'Earlier today, an incident occurred in Islamic High School Basorun, the venue of an event organised for families. Sadly, a stampede at the venue has led to multiple loss of lives and injuries. This is a very sad day,' Makinde said. 'We sympathise with the parents whose joy has suddenly been turned to mourning due to these deaths,' he added. Nigeria's national emergency services said it has deployed a team to help provide assistance to the victims. Children injured at the venue were taken to local hospitals where parents were asked to check for missing persons. Video footage that appeared to be from the scene showed a large crowd of mostly children looking on as some children were being carried away from an open field. Local media identified the event organizers as the Women In Need Of Guidance and Support Foundation, which held a similar event for children last year. The group was preparing to host up to 5,000 young people at this year's event, the Oyo-based Agidigbo FM radio station reported on Tuesday, citing the organizers who had featured on its program. Children 'will win exciting prizes like scholarships and other bountiful gifts,' they said. An investigation has been opened into the causes of the stampede, Makinde said, adding 'anyone directly or remotely involved in this disaster will be held accountable.'	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-stampede-children-school-65ca20abe5f96771b97df60e3a1e11bc	2024-12-18T07:07:04-08:00	
Mauritius wants to rethink a deal with the UK over remote islands housing a key US base	LONDON (AP) — The British government said Wednesday it still plans to hand over a contested Indian Ocean archipelago, which is home to a strategically important military base, to Mauritius, after that country’s new leader backed away from the contentious deal. The U.K. and Mauritius announced an agreement in October to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, a chain of more than 60 islands just south of the equator off the tip of India. Under the deal, the U.K.-U.S. naval and bomber base on the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia, would remain under U.K. control for at least 99 years. When it made the announcement, Britain’s Labour Party government said it was finalizing details of a treaty with the Mauritian government. Since then, voters in Mauritius ousted the government that made the deal, replacing it with one led by Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam. Ramgoolam said he was reopening negotiations because the draft deal 'would not produce the benefits that the nation could expect from such an agreement.' He told lawmakers in Mauritius’ parliament on Tuesday that his government 'is still willing to conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom' and had submitted counterproposals. Britain's Foreign Office Minister Stephen Doughty said he was confident the deal would be finalized, and it was 'completely understandable that the new Mauritian government will want time to study the details.' 'I am confident that we have agreed a good and fair deal that is in both sides’ interests,' he told lawmakers in the House of Commons. 'It protects the base at proportionate cost. It has been supported across the national security architecture in the United States and by India.' The U.K.’s opposition Conservatives have accused the government of surrendering sovereignty over a British territory. The deal was hailed by U.S. President Joe Biden as a 'historic agreement' that secured the future of the Diego Garcia base. But supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump have slammed it. British lawmaker Nigel Farage, a Trump ally, said 'there is very deep disquiet' among incoming Trump administration officials 'as to what this may mean for the long-term future of Diego Garcia.' One of the last remnants of the British Empire, the Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814. Britain evicted as many as 2,000 people from the islands in the 1960s and 1970s so the U.S. military could build the Diego Garcia base, which has supported U.S. military operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the U.S. acknowledged it also had been used for clandestine rendition flights of terror suspects. The U.S. has described the base, which is home to about 2,500 mostly American personnel, as 'an all but indispensable platform' for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa. The displaced Chagossians fought unsuccessfully in U.K. courts for years for the right to go home. Under the deal, they and their descendants could be allowed to return to the islands, apart from Diego Garcia. Mauritius, which lies east of Madagascar in southern Africa, is around 2,100 kilometers (1,250 miles) southwest of the Chagos Islands.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-chagos-islands-mauritius-trump-a5af31a28e76fc622be48fbde7e10f3d	2024-12-18T06:46:47-08:00	
What Assad's fall has revealed about Syria's trade in the stimulant drug Captagon	BEIRUT (AP) — Since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad, industrial-scale manufacturing facilities of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon have been uncovered around the country, which experts say fed a $10 billion annual global trade in the highly addictive drug. Among the locations used for manufacturing the drug were the Mazzeh air base in Damascus, a car-trading company in Latakia and a factory that once made snack chips in the Damascus suburb of Douma. Government forces seized the factory in 2018. 'Assad’s collaborators controlled this place. After the regime fell ... I came here and found it on fire,' Firas al-Toot, the original owner of the factory, told The Associated Press. 'They came at night and lit the drugs on fire but couldn’t burn everything.' 'From here, Captagon pills emerged to kill our people,' Abu Zihab, an activist with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main group now ruling the country, said while his group gave journalists access to the site. Syria's nearly 14-year-old civil war fragmented the country, crumbled the economy and created fertile ground for the production of the drug. Militias, warlords and the Assad government transformed the production of Captagon from a small-scale operation run by criminal groups into a billion-dollar industrial revenue stream. The recent ousting of Assad has disrupted these networks and has given a closer look at its operations — revealing the workings of a war economy that sustained Assad’s power over Syria. Experts say the change in Syria might create an opportunity to dismantle the Captagon industry. How did Syria build its Captagon empire? Captagon was first developed in Germany in the 1960s as a prescription stimulant for conditions like narcolepsy. It was later outlawed due to heart issues and its addictive properties. Its amphetamine-like effects made it popular in the Middle East among both elites and fighters, as it enhanced focus and reduced fatigue. Assad's government recognized an opportunity in the cheaply manufactured drug amid Syria’s economic turmoil and the heavy sanctions imposed on it. Captagon is produced through a simple chemical process that involves mixing amphetamine derivatives with excipients to form tablets, typically in makeshift labs. The Captagon trade began industrializing around 2018-2019 as the Assad regime — and other armed groups in Syria -- invested in production facilities, warehouses and trafficking networks. This allowed Syria to emerge as the largest producer of Captagon globally, with some production also occurring in Lebanon. Most seized consignments of Captagon originated from Syria, according to data by the New Lines Captagon Trade Project, an initiative of the New Lines Institute think tank. Evidence of the Assad regime’s sponsorship of the Captagon industry is overwhelming, the report published in May said. The Security Office of the 4th Armored Division of the Syrian Arab Army, headed by Bashar al-Assad’s brother Maher oversaw operations and created a coordinated production system, the report added. Where and how was Captagon smuggled? Captagon was smuggled across borders in trucks and cargo shipments. Sometimes the drugs were concealed in food, electronics and construction materials to evade detection. The primary smuggling routes were Syria’s porous borders with Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, from which the drug was distributed throughout the region. The leading markets are wealthy Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In Lebanon, the Captagon trade has flourished, particularly near the Syrian border and in the Bekaa Valley. Lebanese authorities struggled to curb the flow of Captagon from Syria, which analysts say was facilitated by the Hezbollah militant group. Following the discovery of crates of fruit meticulously packed with bundles of the drug hidden among pomegranates and oranges, Saudi Arabia and the UAE implemented bans on Lebanese agricultural products. Captagon has also found its way as far as Southeast Asia and parts of Europe. How much revenue did it produce for the Assad regime? The annual global trade in Captagon had an estimated value of $10 billion, with the ousted Assad family's annual profit reaching around $2.4 billion, according to Caroline Rose, director of the New York-based New Lines Institute Captagon Trade Project. 'Seeing the uncovering of so many industrial-scale facilities affiliated with the regime was shocking but not surprising. There was extensive evidence linking key regime-aligned cronies and Assad family members to the trade,' said Rose, whose organization tracks all publicly recorded Captagon seizures and lab raids. The discovery of the facilities, she said, confirmed 'the concrete relationship between Captagon and the former regime.' The exact number of factories in Syria remains unclear, but experts and HTS members estimate that there are likely hundreds spread throughout the country. Captagon as a narco-diplomatic tool While neighboring countries have long sought to curb drug trafficking, their influence over Assad was limited. Saudi Arabia imposed strict penalties for Captagon trafficking and enhanced border security, collaborating with other Gulf states to monitor smuggling routes. However, these efforts faced challenges from the complex networks operating across Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. Captagon provided Assad's government with leverage to end his political isolation. In recent years, as several Arab states reestablished ties with him, stopping the Captagon trade was a key demand in talks aimed at normalizing relations. In May 2023, Syria was readmitted to the Arab League, where it had been suspended since 2011 due to Assad’s brutal crackdown on protesters. Syria pledged to clamp down on smuggling, leading to the formation of a regional security coordination committee. Shortly after the summit and in a possible sign of behind-the-scenes trade-offs, Jordan intensified surveillance along the Syrian border. Activists and experts attributed airstrikes on a known drug kingpin’s home and on a suspected Captagon factory near Daraa to Jordan, likely with Assad’s consent. The future of Captagon in post-Assad Syria Assad has turned Syria into 'the largest Captagon factory in the world,' HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa stated in a victory speech at Damascus’s Umayyad Mosque on Dec. 8. 'Today, Syria is being cleansed, thanks to the grace of Almighty God.' While Assad and his circle may have been the primary beneficiaries, there is also evidence that Syrian opposition groups were involved in drug smuggling. Rebel groups, local militias and organized crime networks manufactured and smuggled the drug to finance their operations, analysts say. 'Likely, we will see a short-term supply reduction in the trade, with a decline in the size and frequency of seizures as industrial-scale production is largely halted. However, criminal actors are innovative, likely seeking out new locations to engage in production and smuggling, particularly as demand levels remain stable,' Rose said. They may also 'seek out alternative illicit trades to engage in instead,' she said. In addition to dismantling the Captagon trade, the country's transitional government should 'establish programs for economic development that will incentivize Syrians to participate in the country’s formal, licit economic sphere,' Rose said.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-captagon-bashar-assad-97c57e94b9cbc1bdc91926b7e85dc981	2024-12-18T06:17:14-08:00	
Nigerians press for solar jobs and electricity, with little success	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — In sun-drenched Nigeria, 14 new solar farms were supposed to jumpstart a meager solar industry and generate huge amounts of power, about one-fifth as much as the country’s entire electric grid offers on a good day. 'We were very excited because we were pioneers,' said Najim Animashaun, managing director of Nova Solar Power, who was working on one of the projects in 2016. But that ambition collapsed when Nigeria's government wouldn't provide critical guarantees to developers. It's not that demand is low for clean power — the smallest solar systems for homes have exploded in popularity and created jobs — but big developers haven't been able to overcome Nigeria's reputation as a risky place to do business. It's a problem across sub-Saharan Africa, where 83% of the people in the world who lack electricity live. Despite tremendous solar potential, very little of it has been installed. 'Many of your countries face sky-high borrowing costs, runaway debt, and inadequate climate finance and investment,' said António Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, at a panel on Africa’s green transition at this year's global climate negotiations in Baku, Azerbaijan. The result, he said, is: 'your clean energy revolution held back.' Nigeria may be the problem's epicenter. More Nigerians live without electricity than citizens of any other country. Their numbers have even grown compared to a decade ago: Africa’s most populous country, with more than 220 million people, grew faster than its power sector expanded. Even those connected to the grid live with frequent outages. Millions are forced to rely on wood for cooking and noxious, noisy diesel generators for sporadic electricity. At the climate talks in Baku, at least $300 billion annually was pledged to help developing countries like Nigeria transition away from fossil fuels and cope with a warmer world and its more extreme weather. It was blasted by many developing nations as far too little. Having enough funds will be vital for Nigeria, which is facing an enormously challenging energy transition. It is an oil state, a major petroleum exporter that runs its government largely on oil revenue. It burns natural gas for most of its electricity. It is trying to simultaneously expand its economy to pull tens of millions of people out of poverty and transition to net-zero by 2060. To do so, there will need to be a flood of new renewable projects like solar and hydropower. Animashaun of Nova Solar Power said in the years before the 14 solar projects were announced, Nigeria opened its electric sector to attract more private investment and made it easier for new producers to sell power. There was strong investor backing, too. He was optimistic. 'There was a proliferation of projects and that proliferation of projects created competition among ourselves,' he said. Everybody wanted to be first to finish. But Nigeria has high interest rates and is considered a financially problematic place to do business and the deal never closed. As the solar industry matured and prices dropped, the government tried to get out of an agreement to pay what it viewed as too high a price for solar power. Developers couldn't get the guarantees they wanted from officials and international development banks. Animashaun said he knew the deal was in serious jeopardy when the government proposed a deal in local currency instead of dollars. 'The currency has lost 90% of its value since I started this project,' he said. 'So, Nigeria isn’t really bankable.' A wholly inadequate grid leads to demand for any electricity at all With the Nigerian grid providing only a fraction of the electricity that people need, some employ a solar solution that provides at least some power. Micro-solar systems that power only lights and perhaps charge a cell phone tripled from 2016 to 2023, according to GOGLA, an off-grid energy industry association. Sales of small rooftop systems that can run some appliances increased even more, although sales did fall off some when a subsidy program ended this year. Sun King is a major seller of these small devices that can replace dirty and expensive kerosene lamps or diesel generators. The micro-solar industry also requires a big workforce at a time when Nigeria's young population needs jobs. Olamide Ayo-Ogunlade is the human resources lead for West and Central Africa at Sun King. When she started four years ago, the company had 19 stores in the country, now it has 90. More than 8,000 salespeople or 'energy officers' in Nigeria sell the products, install them in homes, service them and collect customer debts. 'Most of the time we find that energy officers start off as customers,' she said. 'They buy the product themselves, see how fantastic it is, then they are exposed to the opportunity to be an entrepreneur in the energy space.' They’ll knock on doors and show up at markets, churches and mosques in new areas to make sales. Energy officers are trained, in person and online, on the company and its products and they work with mentors. That attention to training matters. Across the region, some question solar's reliability, according to Siré Diallo, an energy and climate finance expert with the United Nations Development Programme. 'Many of the installations that are being done, the consumers were not satisfied because either it was poor installation, or the equipment itself was of low quality,' he said. It has gotten better in recent years, he said, but training programs need to grow. There’s certainly demand for jobs, said Akin Olukiran, CEO of ABG-CAPS Clean Energy Generation, which installs solar systems for businesses. 'I get on average about 10, maybe 20 applications per day, unsolicited,' he said, adding many applicants have tremendous potential and he tries to help them find opportunities, but 'the jobs are not there.' Alberto Rodríguez Gómez, manager in the Africa energy program at the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute, says a planned changeover at the the largest market in Nigeria's capital city illustrates one solution that produces reliable electricity, improvements in air quality, plus employment. Solar panels paired with batteries will keep the market running on its own minigrid even during common blackouts. Up until now, sellers laboring in cramped stalls have no alternative but to turn on diesel generators during frequent outages. 'I struggle because the air is thick, the air is nasty, it is also very noisy so it is also really hard to just maintain a conversation,' Gomez said of the market when the generators run. A future with solar at the market 'is like going from hell to heaven.' A new $750 million program was approved by the World Bank last year to improve electricity access to 17.5 million Nigerians by supporting projects like microgrids or small home solar systems. Much more is needed. Animashaun believes that Nigeria is approaching a 'come to Jesus moment' on energy — there's pressure on the government to deliver at a time when living costs are rising. 'If you want to avoid social unrest, you have to do something,' he said. ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

China has expanded its nuclear force and strengthened ties to Russia, the Pentagon says	WASHINGTON (AP) — China is expanding its nuclear force, has increased military pressure against Taiwan and has strengthened its ties with Russia over the past year, according to a Pentagon report Wednesday that details actions accelerating key areas of conflict with the United States. The report, however, also notes that the recent rash of corruption allegations within China's powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees the People’s Liberation Army, is hurting Beijing’s military growth and could slow its campaign to modernize. The impact, said a senior defense official, is a bit of a mixed bag because while there has been progress in some programs, China has slid back in others. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the U.S. assessment, warned that Beijing is working toward developing a more diverse and technologically sophisticated nuclear force. While the expected number of nuclear warheads has maintained consistent growth, China is broadening its targeting abilities. Beijing is going to be able to go after more and different types of targets, do greater damage and have more options for multiple rounds of counterstrikes, the official said. The U.S. is urging China to be more transparent about its nuclear program, while also warning that America will defend its allies and take appropriate steps in response. According to the report, which provides the annual U.S. assessment of China’s military power and is required by Congress, China had more than 600 operational nuclear warheads as of May, and the U.S. expects it will have more than 1,000 by 2030. The Chinese Embassy, in response, said China has always 'firmly adhered to a nuclear strategy of self-defense,' follows the no-first-use nuclear policy and maintains its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for national security. Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman, said such annual reports by the Pentagon are 'filled with ‘Cold-War' thinking and zero-sum game mentality, which China firmly opposes.' The Biden administration has worked to maintain a balance with China, building up the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region to be ready to counter Beijing while also encouraging increased communications between the two countries at the diplomatic and military levels. That uptick in talks has coincided with a decrease in coercive and risky intercepts of U.S. aircraft since late 2023, compared with the previous two years. China still, however, does what the U.S. military considers 'unsafe' flights near American and allied forces in the region. The Pentagon’s national defense strategy is built around China being the greatest security challenge for the U.S., and the threat from Beijing influences how the U.S. military is equipped and organized for the future. The corruption within the PLA has resulted in at least 15 high-ranking officials being ousted in a major shakeup of China’s defense establishment. 'This wave of corruption touches every service in the PLA, and it may have shaken Beijing’s confidence,' the report said. In June, China announced that former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor, Wei Fenghe, were expelled from the ruling Communist Party and accused of corruption. Last month, another senior official, Miao Hua, was suspended and put under investigation, according to China's Defense Ministry. The U.S. report points to a persistent increased military presence by China around Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own. It said China's navy has been in the region more and that there have been increased crossings into the island's air defense identification zone and major military exercises in the area. Just last week, a large deployment of Chinese navy and coast guard vessels in the waters around Taiwan triggered alarm as Taiwanese officials said it looked like China was simulating a blockade. Officials have said there were as many as 90 ships involved in what Taiwan described as two walls designed to demonstrate that the waters belong to China. Taiwan split from communist China in 1949 and has rejected Beijing’s demands that it accept unification. China says it will do so by force if necessary, and leaders have said they want to be ready to do so by 2027. Beijing also has demanded that Washington not interfere with the Taiwan issue, citing that it is an internal matter. The United States is obligated under domestic law to help defend Taiwan and give it weapons and technology to deter invasion. The island democracy has been the chief source of tension between Washington and Beijing for decades and is widely seen as the most likely trigger for a potentially catastrophic U.S.-China war. More broadly, the report concluded that the PLA continued its drive to develop greater military capabilities but 'made uneven progress toward its 2027' milestone for modernization. One area of expansion, the report said, is with unmanned aerial systems, which officials said are 'quickly approaching U.S. standards.' Regarding Russia, the report said China has supported Russia's war against Ukraine and sold Russia dual-use items that Moscow's military industry relies on. Dual use items can be used for both civilian and military purposes.	https://apnews.com/article/china-military-taiwan-corruption-defense-9c1f0e145a250f2b8bd7f6f3dd4b7083	2024-12-18T06:00:54-08:00	
Teen charged in UK dance class stabbings pleads not guilty to murder	LONDON (AP) — A teen charged with killing three girls and wounding 10 other people in a stabbing rampage at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England this summer remained silent in court Wednesday as not guilty pleas were entered on his behalf. Axel Rudakubana, 18, who has refused to speak in each court appearance, was read the charges of three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and additional charges related to possessing the poison ricin and for having an al-Qaida manual. Justice Julian Goose ordered a clerk to enter the pleas in Liverpool Crown Court as Rudakubana stayed mum during a video appearance from a London prison where he is held. His trial is scheduled for Jan. 20. It was the first time in a court appearance that the teen did not pull his sweatshirt collar over his nose to obscure his face. He appeared to smile as an officer confirmed that the court proceeding could be heard at the prison. The judge noted that Rudakubana was not responding. He swayed from side to side as the charges were read and bent forward at one point. Rudakubana was charged in August with murdering three girls — Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6 — and stabbing 10 other people on July 29 in the seaside town of Southport in northern England. The attack at a small dance and yoga studio on the first day of summer vacation sparked rioting across England and Northern Ireland fueled by far-right activists that lasted a week. The violence, which injured more than 300 police officers and led to fiery attacks on hotels housing migrants, began after Rudakubana — then unnamed –- was falsely identified as an asylum seeker who had recently arrived in Britain by boat. Rudakubana was born in Wales to Rwandan immigrants. More than 1,200 people were arrested for the disorder that lasted a week and hundreds have been jailed for up to nine years in prison. A report released Wednesday was critical of police for failing to recognize the threat of violent disorder after a number of smaller incidents across the U.K. in the previous two years. The report from the Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services said there were also lapses in gathering intelligence from social media and the dark web. Rudakubana was charged in October with additional counts for production of a biological toxin, ricin, and possession of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing to commit an act of terrorism for having the manual in a document on his computer. Police have said the stabbings have not been classified as acts of terrorism because the motive is not yet known.	https://apnews.com/article/england-stabbing-attack-dance-class-terror-charge-ricin-d0a2bba2b24b2a17d6534d5367258c12	2024-12-18T05:31:59-08:00	
What's known about the brazen bombing that killed a top Russian general in Moscow	The killing of a senior Russian general in a bombing outside his apartment building in Moscow was the boldest assassination yet of a top military officer and again brought the war in Ukraine to the streets of the capital. Some things to know about the attack and who is suspected of being behind it: What happened? Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov was killed Tuesday morning by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter parked near the entrance of his apartment block in southeastern Moscow as he left for his office. Kirillov’s assistant also died in the attack. The bomb was triggered remotely, according to Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB. The explosion was caught on video from a camera mounted inside a car, showing the men walking out of the building and the fiery blast. Who were the victims? Kirillov, 54, was the chief of Russia's Radiation, Biological and Chemical Protection Forces. These special troops are tasked with protecting the military from the enemy’s use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and ensuring operations in a contaminated environment. He was under sanctions from several countries, including the U.K. and Canada, for his actions in Moscow’s war in Ukraine. On Monday, Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, opened a criminal investigation against him, accusing Kirillov of directing the use of banned chemical weapons. Russia has denied using any chemical weapons in Ukraine and has accused Kyiv of using them. Kirillov, who took his post in 2017, was one of the highest profile figures to level those accusations. He held numerous briefings to accuse the Ukrainian military of using toxic agents and planning to launch attacks with radioactive substances — claims Kyiv and its Western allies rejected as propaganda. His assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, was also killed in the attack. Who has claimed responsibility? An SBU official said Tuesday that the agency was behind the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information, described Kirillov as a 'war criminal and an entirely legitimate target.' The SBU official provided the video of the bombing. Who has been detained? The FSB said Wednesday it detained a suspect, described as a citizen of the Central Asian nation of Uzbekistan who was born in 1995. The Tass and RIA-Novosti news agencies identified him as Akhmad Kurbanov. According to the FSB, the suspect said he was recruited by Ukrainian special services. The Associated Press could not confirm the conditions under which the suspect made the statement to the security services. The FSB said the suspect said he had been promised $100,000 and resettlement to a European Union country in exchange for killing Kirillov. The agency said that acting on instructions from Ukraine, the suspect traveled to Moscow, where he obtained a homemade bomb, placed it on an e-scooter and parked it at the entrance to Kirillov's apartment building. The suspect rented a car to monitor the location and set up a camera that livestreamed the scene to his handlers in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, detonating the bomb when Kirillov left the building, the FSB said. The suspect faces a sentence of up to life imprisonment, the FSB said. Russian media reports said the FSB tracked the suspect by studying video from surveillance cameras and cellphone calls. What's still not known? The FSB has not said how the suspect was recruited. He was detained in a village in the Moscow region, Interior Ministry official Irina Volk told Tass. It is not known where he is being held or when he will appear in court. That is expected in the coming days, to hear the terms of his pre-trial detention. Under Russian law, a person may only be remanded in custody for 48 hours before a court order is made. What has Russia said about the attack? Russian officials have described the bombing as a 'terrorist act.' The Kremlin said Wednesday it was 'obvious' that Ukraine was behind Kirillov’s killing, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Kyiv 'does not shy away from terrorist methods.' While President Vladimir Putin has not publicly spoken about the attack, Peskov said he expressed his condolences on Kirillov's death. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, described the attack as an attempt by Kyiv to distract public attention from its military failures and vowed that its 'senior military-political leadership will face inevitable retribution.' Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of parliament, called Kirillov 'a professional military man, an intellectual, a Russian patriot.' He 'did a lot to increase the effectiveness of the radiation, chemical and biological defense forces, to ensure the security and sovereignty of our country,' Volodin said. —- Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-general-bomb-suspect-arrested-817ba9cd738fb09e673c261f21a4c1ff	2024-12-18T05:21:43-08:00	
Families scramble to help after deadly cyclone rips through French territory of Mayotte off Africa	MAMOUDZOU, Mayotte (AP) — Relatives of families struggling after Cyclone Chido ripped through the French island territory of Mayotte expressed helplessness Wednesday, a day before France’s president and another 180 tons of aid were expected to arrive. Some survivors and aid groups have described hasty burials, the stench of bodies and the devastation of precarious informal settlements whose population of migrants makes it even more challenging to determine the number of dead. 'A catastrophe of exceptional intensity,' French authorities said in an update Wednesday. 'The island is devastated.' It noted 31 confirmed deaths but said the Muslim practice of burial within 24 hours could mean the real toll is quite different. Mayotte, in the Indian Ocean off Africa’s east coast, is France’s poorest territory and a magnet for migrants hoping to reach Europe. Already, France's interior minister this week has proposed cracking down. The cyclone on Saturday was the deadliest storm to strike the territory in nearly a century. It devastated entire neighborhoods on the collection of islands with winds that exceeded 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service. Many people had ignored cyclone warnings, thinking the storm would not be so extreme. Now residents pick their way across a landscape in search of food as telecommunications remain tenuous and even sturdily built structures including health centers have been damaged. Driving the streets of Mayotte, AP reporters saw destroyed houses, felled trees and people lining up for water. Dozens of French military personnel set up a makeshift camp at the airport. French Prime Minister François Bayrou on Tuesday said more than 1,500 people were injured, including more than 200 critically, but authorities fear hundreds and possibly thousands of people have died. Authorities said about 100,000 lived in a 'precarious situation.' On the French island of Reunion about a three-hour flight away, loved ones were coming together to donate aid for survivors. Some said their families in Mayotte had no food or water and roofs were blown off houses. It had taken days to make contact with some. 'It is difficult because I feel helpless,' said Khayra Djoumoi Thany, 19. Anrafa Parassouramin also has family in Mayotte. 'We are also afraid of disease outbreaks, because people are drinking water from wherever they can get it, and it’s not necessarily potable water,' she said. Health Minister Geneviève Darrieussecq has raised concerns about the risk of a cholera epidemic on the archipelago which earlier this year had an outbreak of a highly drug-resistant strain of the disease. French authorities said the distribution of 23 tons of water began Wednesday. The French minister for overseas matters, François-Noël Buffet, told French radio Europe 1 that aid brought by plane has started being allocated to locations across Mayotte. The minister said the water supply system was 'working at 50%' and presented a risk of 'poor quality.' Electricity had partially resumed. Mayotte’s hospital was badly damaged. A field hospital should be operational by early next week, Buffet said. A Navy ship was due to arrive in Mayotte on Thursday with 180 tons of aid and equipment, according to the French military. But the main airport could not accept commercial flights because of damage. The road network was also widely damaged. French President Emmanuel Macron will travel to Mayotte on Thursday and visit a hospital and a destroyed neighborhood, his office said. 'Our compatriots are living through the worst just a few thousand kilometers away,' Macron said in a statement. Some residents of Mayotte have long criticized the French government of neglect. On Tuesday evening, a program on public broadcaster France 2 raised 5 million euros ($5.24 million) in aid for Mayotte through the Foundation of France charity, the channel said. ___ Corbet reported from Paris.	https://apnews.com/article/mayotte-france-cyclone-chido-aid-e073dfc2eda629af0a297e74f2f333fa	2024-12-18T05:03:03-08:00	
France’s highest court upholds corruption conviction of former President Nicolas Sarkozy	PARIS (AP) — France’s highest court has upheld an appeal court decision which had found former President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty of corruption and influence peddling while he was the country's head of state. Sarkozy, 69, faces a year in prison, but is expected to ask to be detained at home with an electronic bracelet — as is the case for any sentence of two years or less. He was found guilty of corruption and influence peddling by both a Paris court in 2021 and an appeals court in 2023 for trying to bribe a magistrate in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated. 'The convictions and sentences are therefore final,' a Court of Cassation statement on Wednesday said. Sarkozy, who was France’s president from 2007 to 2012, retired from public life in 2017 though still plays an influential role in French conservative politics. He was among the guests who attended the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral earlier this month. Sarkozy, in a statement posted on X, said 'I will assume my responsibilities and face all the consequences.' He added: 'I have no intention of complaining. But I am not prepared to accept the profound injustice done to me.' Sarkozy said he will seek to bring the case to the European Court of Human Rights, and hopes those proceedings will result in 'France being condemned.' He reiterated his 'full innocence.' 'My determination is total in this case as in all others,' he concluded. Sarkozy’s lawyer, Patrice Spinosi, said his client 'will comply' with the ruling. This means the former president will have to wear an electronic bracelet, Spinosi said. It is the first time in France’s modern history that a former president has been convicted and sentenced to a prison term for actions during his term. Sarkozy’s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money during his time as Paris mayor and was given a two-year suspended prison sentence. Sarkozy has been involved in several other legal cases. He has denied any wrongdoing. He faces another trial next month in Paris over accusations he took millions of dollars from then-Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to illegally finance his successful 2007 campaign. The corruption case that led to Wednesday's ruling focused on phone conversations that took place in February 2014. At the time, investigative judges had launched an inquiry into the financing of Sarkozy’s 2007 presidential campaign. During the inquiry, they discovered that Sarkozy and his lawyer, Thierry Herzog, were communicating via secret mobile phones registered to the alias 'Paul Bismuth.' Wiretapped conversations on those phones led prosecutors to suspect Sarkozy and Herzog of promising magistrate Gilbert Azibert a job in Monaco in exchange for leaking information about another legal case involving Sarkozy. Azibert never got the post and legal proceedings against Sarkozy have been dropped in the case he was seeking information about. Prosecutors had concluded, however, that the proposal still constitutes corruption under French law, even if the promise wasn’t fulfilled. Sarkozy vigorously denied any malicious intention in his offer to help Azibert. Azibert and Herzog have also been found guilty in the case.	https://apnews.com/article/france-court-ruling-sarkozy-corruption-715483927ad6dfc7799ca8a9f28303cf	2024-12-18T04:32:04-08:00	
China's CATL is planning a major expansion of battery swapping for electric vehicles	XIAMEN, China (AP) — The world's largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles said Wednesday it will get into battery swapping in China in a big way starting next year. The idea behind battery swapping is to refuel quickly, similar to filling a conventional car with gas. Instead of waiting for the batteries to recharge, one swaps out the old ones with a block of fresh ones at a swap station. An EV driver pulls into a swapping station, and automated technology exchanges the low battery for a fully-charged one the station has available. China-based CATL announced plans to open 1,000 swap stations next year in China, including in Hong Kong and Macao, with a long-term goal of 10,000 stations built with partners. If the company follows through, it could rival Nio, a 10-year-old Chinese electric car brand that has opened more than 2,700 stations and has plans for at least 5,000. Nothing on that scale exists elsewhere in the world, though Nio has about 60 swap stations in northern Europe. Such a large investment is possible in China, where government support has transformed the world's largest auto market into a heavily electric one and made the country a leader in EV technology. 'By 2030, battery swapping, home charging, and public charging stations will share the market,' Robin Zeng, the CEO of CATL, predicted at a splashy presentation in southeast China's Fujian province, where CATL is based. He appealed to corporate partners to work together to 'build more convenient, more economical and safer services for customers, promoting a brand-new way of life.' Battery swapping faces hurdles. It requires a standardization of the battery pack so the swap stations can handle it, and most EVs have their own configuration. An electric vehicle has to be equipped with the right technology in order to use a battery swapping station, and not many EV models around the world currently allow for swapping. Conversely, an electric car can use any charging station in China because all use a common plug, and fast-charging technology is reducing the time for a recharge. Jing Yang, a Fitch Ratings director who focuses on China’s auto and renewable energy sectors, said automakers may be concerned that adopting a standard battery pack could cede too much control of their supply chain to others. Electric car manufacturers have many changing specifications to stay on top of and invest in as the EV market evolves, making new technology a hard sell. It is difficult to get automakers to buy into less feasible infrastructure if EV adoption in a region is still relatively low. But some may want to test the waters to see if battery swapping can improve sales, and doing so with CATL or Nio could reduce the cost, she said. That's because a driver wouldn't have to own the battery, which is currently the most expensive part of an EV. China auto market analyst Lei Xing believes that swapping can complement the country's well-developed charging network. 'I don’t see it becoming mainstream, but I do see it becoming a key part of that infrastructure landscape,' he said. Michael Davidson, a renewable energy expert at the University of California, San Diego, believes that charging will dominate 'and maybe there’ll be some battery swapping options mixed in there.' The concept has proven easier to implement with fleet vehicles — taxis, buses and commercial trucks — that have a standard model and, in some cases, stick to set routes. CATL, which launched a small pilot project two years ago aimed at taxis, will start its rollout with fleets and expand to individual car owners later, said Zhang Kai, the deputy president of CATL's battery swapping subsidiary. Swapping is still faster than fast-charging. The CATL station, branded EVOGO, can change a battery pack in 100 seconds, said Yang Jun, the CEO of the subsidiary. Time is money for taxi and truck drivers, Lei said. Wang Wubing, a driver at China’s popular Didi ride-hailing service, said at an EVOGO station in the city of Xiamen that he swaps batteries to save time so he can pick up more customers. But it is more expensive than charging. In the U.S., battery swapping made headlines nearly two decades ago with the startup Better Place, which later shut down. Now, companies such as Ample have reinvented the technology, also starting with the ride-hailing market. Uber and Lyft drivers that own electric cars want to spend time on the road and earning money instead of waiting even for the fastest EV charge. Ample says its swaps take just 5 minutes. Both CATL and Nio have announced agreements with automakers to use their swap stations. The question is whether enough automakers and drivers adopt it to raise use of the stations to a profitable level. ___ Moritsugu reported from Beijing.

Middle East latest: Israel orders another Gaza evacuation ahead of an offensive	The Israeli military on Wednesday ordered Palestinians to evacuate another section of central Gaza ahead of an offensive in the built-up Bureij refugee camp, even as Israel and the Hamas appeared to inch closer to a ceasefire in the 14-month war. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he will meet Wednesday with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Mideast envoy, Adam Boehler, at home in Jerusalem. Boehler, a former aid to Jared Kushner, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week. As deadly Israeli strikes pound Gaza each day, talks to broker the ceasefire and hostage release deal have restarted after a monthslong pause. The deal on the table includes a six-week pause in fighting in which Hamas would release 30 hostages, including three of four dual Israeli-U.S. citizens. In exchange, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Trump has said he wants a quick end to the war. Israeli bombardment and offensives in Gaza have killed more than 45,000 Palestinians during the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry’s tally does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but it says more than of half the dead were women and children. Israel launched the war in retaliation for Hamas’ October 2023 attack on southern Israel in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others, around 100 of whom remain in captivity. Israel believes a third of the remaining hostages are dead. ___ Here’s the latest: Syrians recover human remains from site used by Hezbollah and other Assad allies DAMASCUS — The Syrian Civil Defense group, known as the White Helmets, uncovered at least 21 corpses as well as incomplete human remains on Wednesday in the Sayyida Zeinab suburb of the capital Damascus. The discovery was made at a site previously used by Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Iran-backed Iraqi militias, both allies of deposed President Bashar Assad during the country’s civil war. The site included a field kitchen, a drugstore and a morgue, according to Ammar al-Salmo, an official with the White Helmets, a volunteer organization that operated in areas that were controlled by the opposition. Rescue teams in white hazmat suits searched the site, located not far from the revered shrine of Sayyida Zeinab, the granddaughter of Prophet Mohammad. The remains were placed into black bags and loaded onto a truck as bystanders from the neighborhood looked on. 'Some (of the remains) are skeletons, others are incomplete, and there are bags of small bones. We cannot yet determine the number of victims,' al-Salmo said. 'Damascus has become a mass grave,' he said, pointing out the growing reports of war-related graves and burial sites in the capital and other places in Syria. Iran and Hezbollah provided Assad’s government with military, financial and logistical support during the civil war. Israeli settlers briefly crossed into Lebanon, the military says JERUSALEM — A group of Israeli settlers have briefly crossed the border into Lebanon before they were removed by troops, the military acknowledged Wednesday. The civilians who crossed the border came from the Uri Tzafon movement, a group calling for Israeli settlement of southern Lebanon. Photos posted by the group online Saturday showed a small group of activists holding signs and erecting tents inside Lebanon while Israeli soldiers were present. After first denying the reports to Israeli media, the military said Wednesday that civilians had crossed the border 'by a few meters' and were removed by troops. The military called the border breach a 'serious incident' and said it was investigating. 'Any attempt to approach or cross the border into Lebanese territory without coordination poses a life-threatening risk and interferes with the IDF’s ability to operate in the area and carry out its mission,' the military said, using the acronym for the Israel Defense Forces. The settler group Uri Tzafon, which means 'Awaken the North' in Hebrew, crossed the border in the area of the Lebanese village of Maroun Al-Ras. In the past, the movement has said the area is home to an old Hebrew settlement. Groups of settler activists also have breached the Gaza border more than once since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, at one point erecting small wooden tents before they were evacuated by troops. Daniela Weiss, the leader of the movement to resettle Gaza, claims she has entered Gaza twice since the start of the war. Israel’s settler movement has been emboldened by its current government -- the furthest-right in Israeli history -- and is now seeking to expand to parts of southern Lebanon and the north of the Gaza. UN envoy says Syria needs a credible and inclusive transition DAMASCUS, Syria — The U.N. envoy to Syria said after concluding a visit to Damascus and meeting the new administration that the country needs 'a political transition that will be credible, inclusive and include the broadest range of the Syrian society and Syrian parties.' Geir Pedersen said Wednesday that the process should take place under a U.N. resolution adopted in 2015 to help negotiate a political solution between the government of now-deposed President Bashar Assad and the opposition. 'There is a lot of hope. We can all see the beginning of a new Syria ... that in line with Security Council Resolution 2254 will adopt a new constitution that will ensure that there is a new social contract for all Syrians and that we will have free and fair elections when that time comes after a transitional period, also in line with Security Council Resolution 2254,' Pedersen said. It is not yet clear if Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, will pursue such a process. The group has set up an interim administration comprising members of its 'salvation government' that had ruled its former stronghold in northern Syria. It will oversee the country until March, but the new rulers have not made clear how the transition to a fully empowered government would take place. Pedersen also warned of ongoing violence in parts of the country, particularly in the northeast, where U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces and Turkish-backed armed groups have clashed, and called for humanitarian assistance and for starting a process to end Western sanctions on Syria. Israeli students walk out of class to call for release of hostages JERUSALEM — Hundreds of Israeli students walked out of school Wednesday to call for an immediate deal to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip as there appears to be progress in ceasefire talks. From Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, students headed for central junctions, blocking roads and holding signs with the faces of the captives remaining in Gaza after 14 months of war. There are 100 hostages in Gaza, a third of whom Israel’s government says are dead. Hamas militants dragged them to Gaza in the October 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war. At the high school in central Israel attended by hostages Naama Levy and Guy Illouz, who Israel’s military says was killed in the Oct. 7 attack, students crammed the auditorium with signs reading 'Bring them Home Now.' In Tel Aviv, high school students chanted, 'Their time is up. There’s a deal on the table.' Netanyahu takes the stand on Day 4 of corruption trials TEL AVIV, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the stand on the fourth day of testimony in his corruption trials Wednesday, saying the accusations against him are 'idiotic.' Netanyahu, the first sitting Israeli leader to take the stand as a criminal defendant, is on trial on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. Netanyahu was supposed to testify on Tuesday, but it was canceled after he requested a postponement due to 'security reasons.' Netanyahu went to the summit of Mount Hermon, part of the Syrian buffer zone that Israeli forces seized after President Bashar Assad was ousted by rebels last week. It appeared to be the first time an Israeli leader had set foot that far into Syria. The testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu’s working hours. Critics ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran. Damascus airport reopens for domestic flights DAMASCUS, Syria — The Damascus airport reopened Wednesday for the first time since the fall of the government of Bashar Assad, and the first civilian plane took off from Damascus and landed in the northern city of Aleppo. The airport is currently open only to domestic flights, but Syrian airspace is open to international traffic. Airport officials have not yet specified when international flights will resume at the Damascus airport, but Saad Khair Bec, technical supervisor, called Wednesday’s reopening 'an important day in the life of the Syrian people ... after the fall of the former shabby regime.' State institutions have been gradually returning to work in recent days, including the main port in the coastal city of Latakia. UN migration agency head says interim Syria leaders recognize challenges ahead GENEVA — The head of the U.N. migration agency said she was reassured by commitments she heard from Syria’s new caretaker government in meetings in Damascus, as the country seeks to rebuild after more than a half-century of rule under the Assad family. Amy Pope, director-general of the International Organization for Migration, said in a phone interview Wednesday that Syria’s new leaders 'recognize the job they have ahead of them is enormous and that they need the support of the international community.' IOM estimates about 100,000 people — many looking to return to their former homes — have entered Syria from neighboring countries since Dec. 8, the day former President Bashar Assad fled the country as opposition fighters swarmed into the capital. 'We are also seeing about 85,000 people come out' of Syria into Lebanon through established border crossing points, she said. 'It’s a rough figure: There’s certainly people who cross informally and so they’re not counted.' Most of those found to be leaving are Shiite Muslims, she said. The armed groups who took control of Syria are primarily from the country’s majority Sunni Muslim community, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the terrorist-designated group that led the coalition of armed opposition groups that drove Assad from power. 'There’s no question to me that at this moment in time, they are looking for ways to make this work, to be more inclusive, to build partnerships across the international community, to build partnerships with other governments,' Pope said of the caretaker government. 'It’s just going to be a question of whether they can deliver.' IOM said Pope was one of the first heads of a U.N. agency to visit Syria since Assad’s ouster, and she met with unspecified members of the caretaker government on Tuesday, as well as U.N. officials and advocacy groups. She reaffirmed the IOM's commitment to Syria. The organization has been providing assistance to people in the country since 2014 and is seeking $30 million in urgent aid funding for the next four months to try to help nearly 685,000 people in the northwest of the country.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-18-december-2024-d6751c74fd977d57204af8c2cc0f97b2	2024-12-18T01:04:59-08:00	
Animal welfare group says bacterial infection killed Sonia the elephant in Pakistan	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani veterinary surgeons found that a bacterial infection killed an elephant at a safari park in the city of Karachi earlier this month, a veterinarian with a global animal welfare organization said Wednesday. Dr. Amir Khalil with the Vienna-based Four Paws told The Associated the infection spread through 19-year-old Sonia’s body from her foot, leading to her death. 'We are very sad for Sonia,' he said, raising concerns about how Pakistani authorities handle animals. Four Paws said in a statement the autopsy was conducted last week and that Sonia's death showed neglect on part of local authorities who had earlier said a heart attack may have been the cause of death. There was no immediate comment from Pakistani officials. An African elephant's average lifespan is usually between 60 and 70 years in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, and a bit shorter in captivity. Sonia, a small adult, was brought to Pakistan in 2009 with three other elephants. One of her companions, Noor Jahan, died at a Karachi zoo last year at the age of 17. Sonia was recently reunited with her sister Madhubala, who was transferred from Karachi Zoological Garden last month to be with her family. Madhubala was separated from sisters Sonia and Malika about 15 years ago. Four Paws, which made the post-mortem available on Tuesday, said the 'microbiological results from Sonia’s autopsy revealed the presence of various bacteria. The source of the bacteria was an advanced abscess on Sonia’s foot which was just recently discovered and treated during our stay for Madhubala’s relocation'. It also said Khalil sent a 'prophylactic treatment plan' for Malika and Madhubala to authorities, urgently recommending antibiotic treatment, alongside blood tests for both elephants before and after the treatment. Khalil said he planned to visit Pakistan in February to examine the remaining elephants but Sonia's death showed that better care was needed for the animals. Pakistan has a troubled history with elephants in captivity. In 2020, Kaavan, dubbed the 'world’s loneliest elephant' after languishing alone for years in a Pakistani zoo, was sent to a Cambodian sanctuary for the much-needed company of other elephants. Efforts to transfer Kaavan from Pakistan were supported by singer and actor Cher, who campaigned for his rescue.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-elephant-autopsy-death-sonia-four-paws-52be1ff3f28cf6ef01844ac037db06cd	2024-12-17T23:55:39-08:00

UK inflation increase solidifies expectations interest rates will be kept on hold	LONDON (AP) — Inflation in the U.K. rose to its highest level in eight months during November, official figures showed Wednesday, a development that has cemented market expectations that the Bank of England will opt against cutting borrowing costs this week. The Office for National Statistics said consumer price inflation rose by 2.6% in the year to November, up from 2.3% the previous month. It said stubbornly high inflation in the crucial services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the U.K. economy, and an increase in fuel prices was largely behind the overall increase. The increase, which took inflation further away from the Bank of England's target of 2%, was in line with market expectations. This is the biggest increase since March, leading economists to rule out any prospect that the Bank of England will cut its main interest rate from 4.75% after its policy meeting on Thursday. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation economics think tank, said that the 'latest data shows the challenge Britain faces in squeezing inflation out of the economy.' Rate-setters had anticipated a pickup in inflation when the central bank last cut rates in early November as price pressures eased earlier in the year — in September, inflation had fallen to its lowest level since April 2021. Still, inflation in the U.K. and across the world is far lower than it was a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Recent developments have scaled back expectations of rapid cuts from the Bank of England. Rising wages and stubbornly high inflation in the services sector, the biggest single part of the U.K. economy, have prompted economists to scale back expectations of rapid rate cuts next year. Critics have argued that the new Labour government's first budget in October will lead to higher inflation than otherwise would have been case. The extra public spending announced in the budget will be largely funded through increased business taxes and borrowing. Economists think that the splurge, coupled with the prospect of businesses cushioning the tax hikes by raising prices, could put upward pressure on prices.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-economy-inflation-interest-rates-05d118699b71950480206efd92e112a8	2024-12-17T22:46:12-08:00	
Russia says suspect detained in killing of senior general in Moscow	MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's security service said Wednesday that it has detained a suspect in the killing of a senior general in Moscow. The suspect was described as an Uzbek citizen recruited by Ukrainian intelligence services. Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, didn't name the suspect, but said he was born in 1995. According to a statement by the FSB, the suspect said himself that he was recruited by Ukrainian special services. Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov was killed Tuesday by a bomb hidden in a scooter outside his apartment building in Moscow, a day after Ukraine’s security service leveled criminal charges against him. His assistant also died in the attack. A Ukrainian official said the service carried out the attack. The FSB said the suspect had been promised a reward of $100,000 and permission to move to a European Union country in exchange for killing Kirillov. The agency stated that, acting on instructions from Ukraine, the suspect traveled to Moscow, where he picked up a homemade explosive device. He then placed the device on an electric scooter and parked it at the entrance to the residential building where Kirillov lived. The suspect then rented a car to monitor the location and set up a camera that livestreamed footage from the scene to his handlers in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Once Kirillov was seen leaving the building, the suspect detonated the bomb. According to the FSB’s statement, the suspect faces 'a sentence of up to life imprisonment.' Kirillov, 54, was the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces and was under sanctions from several countries, including the U.K. and Canada, for his actions in Moscow's military operation in Ukraine. On Monday, Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, opened a criminal investigation against him, accusing him of directing the use of banned chemical weapons. Russia has denied using any chemical weapons in Ukraine and, in turn, has accused Kyiv of using toxic agents in combat. Kirillov, who took his current job in 2017, was one of the most high-profile figures to level those accusations. He held numerous briefings to accuse the Ukrainian military of using toxic agents and planning to launch attacks with radioactive substances — claims that Ukraine and its Western allies rejected as propaganda. The bomb used in Tuesday’s attack was triggered remotely, according to Russian news reports. Images from the scene showed shattered windows and scorched brickwork. Russia’s top state investigative agency said it’s looking into Kirillov’s death as a case of terrorism, and officials in Moscow vowed to punish Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-general-killed-suspected-arrested-32e504b029d8db0b8d52474d75efc383	2024-12-17T22:20:02-08:00	
As wars rage around them, Armenian Christians in Jerusalem's Old City feel the walls closing in	JERUSALEM (AP) — As the war in Gaza rages, Syria's government transforms, and the Israeli-occupied West Bank seethes, Armenian residents of the Old City of Jerusalem fight a different battle — one that is quieter, they say, but no less existential. One of the oldest communities in Jerusalem, the Armenians have lived in the Old City for decades without significant friction with their neighbors, centered around a convent that acts as a welfare state. Now, the small Christian community has begun to fracture under pressure from forces they say threaten them and the multifaith character of the Old City. From radical Jewish settlers who jeer at clergymen on the way to prayer, to a land deal threatening to turn a quarter of their land into a luxury hotel, residents and the church alike say the future of the community is in flux. Their struggle, playing out under the cover of many regional crises, reflects the difficulty of maintaining a non-Jewish presence in a Jerusalem where life has hardened for religious minorities in the Old City. Chasms have emerged between the Armenian Patriarchate, the traditional steward of community affairs, and the mainly secular community itself. Its members worry that the church is not equipped to protect their dwindling population and embattled convent from obsolescence and takeover. A tent in a parking lot Walk through the narrow passageways of the Armenian Quarter, past a perpetually manned guard post and into an open lot with a towering pile of shrapnel crested with the Armenian flag. You’ve arrived at the headquarters of the 'Save the Arq' movement. It’s where some residents of the Armenian Quarter have decamped, in a structure with reinforced plywood walls hung with ancient maps, to protest what they see as an illegal land grab by a controversial real estate developer. The land under threat is where the community parks their cars and holds group dinners. It also includes parts of the patriarchate itself. It’s been a receiving point for those fleeing the mass killing of some 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks, widely viewed by scholars as the first genocide of the 20th century. Turkey denies the deaths constituted genocide. The patriarchate has batted away offer after offer to sell the land. That changed in 2021, when an Armenian priest, Baret Yeretsian, signed a fraudulent deal leasing the lot for up to 98 years to a company called Xana Capital, registered just before the agreement was signed. Xana then turned over half the shares to a local businessman, George Warwar, who has been involved in various criminal offenses, according to court filings, including a 24-month prison sentence for armed robbery, and has declared bankruptcy in the past. In court documents seen by the AP, the patriarchate has admitted that Warwar bribed the priest and that the two had sustained 'various inappropriate connections' leading up to the signing of the deal. Community members were outraged when they found out, prompting the priest to flee the country. The patriarchate cancelled the deal in October, but Xana fought back, and the two are now in mediation over the contract. Xana Capital has since sent armed men to the lot, the activists say, attacking members of the community, including clergy, with pepper spray and batons. With the future of the site unclear, the activists say they appealed to the patriarchate to find out what was going on. The activists say that Warwar has the backing of a prominent settler organization seeking to expand Jewish presence in Jerusalem’s Old City. The organization, Ateret Cohanim, is behind several controversial land acquisitions in the Old City, and its leaders were photographed meeting with Warwar and Danny Rothman, the owner of Xana Capital who also uses the last name Rubinstein, in December 2023. The organization denied any connection to the land deal. 'But as soon as the deal was signed, the patriarchate went into silent mode, bunker mode,' said Setrag Balian, 27, a ceramicist. 'We decided that we have to take action and not once again be on the sidelines, watching and hoping that the patriarchy will take the right steps.' So Balian and fellow resident Hagop Djernazian collected some 300 signatures from the community and filed suit against the patriarchate in February, asking them to declare the deal void and to say, for posterity, that the land belongs to the community. In response, the patriarchate said it owns the land, not the community. Xana, meanwhile, filed a response calling the activists antisemitic squatters. The patriarchate's response and Xana's words, the activists said, leave open the chance that the land could be leased again in the future. 'It made us feel like we could not trust the institution who brought us to this day to solve this problem, to solve this conflict,' said Hagop Djernazian. The patriarchate declined to comment on the land deal for this article, saying it could impact mediation efforts underway with Xana. A single observer Inside the Armenian convent, the clergy are hushed, pathways empty. On a recent afternoon, priests in black robes rang the bell for daily prayers at the St. James Cathedral, the storied Armenian church occupying one of the highest points in the Old City. Filing into the darkened space, the men and the young seminary choir were joined only by an Israeli tour group and one Armenian woman who'd come to pray. Father Parsegh Galamterian, church sacristan, has watched prayers thin out over the years, as the Armenian population in the quarter has shrunk from about 15,000 in 1948, the founding of the state of Israel, to around 2,000. 'The future is difficult,' he says. Armenians began arriving in the Old City as early as the 4th century, inspired by the religious significance of the city to Christianity. In the early 20th century, they were joined by masses of Armenians who flocked to Jerusalem after being driven out of the Ottoman Empire. Theirs is the smallest quarter in the Old City, home to Armenians with the same status as Palestinians in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem — residents but not citizens, effectively stateless. Today, the newcomers are mainly boys who arrive from Armenia to live and study in the convent. Some stay, but many drop out of studies. Clergy say that's partially because attacks against Christians have ramped up within the walls of the Old City, leaving the Armenians – whose convent is closest to the Jewish Quarter and is tucked along a popular route to the Western Wall – vulnerable. Father Aghan Gogchyan, the patriarchate’s chancellor, said he’s regularly attacked by groups of Jewish fundamentalists. He recalled one instance, a month ago, when clergy were headed to prayer. He was intercepted by a group of settlers, who asked if they were Christians. '’You know that you don’t have a future here in the Holy Land. You’re not going to continue to live here,' he recalled one man saying. '’This is our country. We are going to eradicate you.' 'This is the word he used,' said Gogchyan. 'We are going to eradicate you from our country.' The Rossing Center, which tracks anti-Christian attacks in the Holy Land, documented about 20 attacks on Armenian observers, Armenian private property, and church properties in 2023, many involving ultranationalist Jewish settlers spitting at Armenian clergy or graffiti reading 'Death to Christians' scrawled on the quarter’s walls. 'What is being said behind closed doors is that Jerusalem is becoming a place that is no longer hospitable to Christianity,' said Daniel Seidman, a Jerusalem lawyer and peace activist. 'You can see the needle moving. The spike in hate crimes is not part of this plan, but it's part of the impact.' The incidents send a clear message to the next generation, said Gogchyan: stay away. 'The new generation doesn’t want to be in the center of the conflict,' said Gogchyan. 'They’re building their future in different countries. Despite the fractures, Armenian clergy and activists told the AP they want the same thing: a continued presence in the Old City. 'Some people feel helpless and hopeless and they want to leave,' said Balian. 'But I think the majority sees that there is a struggle going on. It gives us a meaning. It gives us a purpose. It gives us a reason to stay here.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Israel's borders have shifted throughout its history. Action in Syria may reshape them again	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, entered Syrian territory Tuesday and said Israeli troops would remain in the area indefinitely, blurring the border with its northern neighbor. Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has never had fully recognized borders. Throughout its history, the frontiers with its Arab neighbors have shifted as a result of wars, annexations, ceasefires and peace agreements. Now, the downfall of Syrian President Bashar Assad has created a situation that could once again reshape Israel’s borders. As Assad was toppled early this month, Israel quickly moved into the Syrian side of a 50-year-old demilitarized buffer zone. Netanyahu described the move as defensive and temporary, and said it was aimed at making sure that none of the groups jostling for power inside Syria threatened Israel. But in Tuesday’s visit to the Syrian side of the buffer zone, Netanyahu made clear that Israel plans on staying for some time. Speaking on the windswept summit of Mount Hermon overlooking Syria, he said Israel would remain 'until another arrangement is found that will ensure Israel’s security.' Here is a closer look at the evolution of Israel’s borders over the years. Israel’s establishment In 1947, the United Nations approved a plan to partition what was then British-controlled Mandatory Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. The contested city of Jerusalem was to be administered by the U.N. This plan, however, was never implemented. Israel declared independence in May 1948, and neighboring Arab countries declared war. That war ended with Israel in control of some 77% of the territory – with Jordan controlling the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and Egypt in control of the Gaza Strip. 1967 Mideast war During the six days of fighting of the 1967 Mideast war, Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan, Gaza and the Sinai peninsula from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from Syria. Initially celebrated by Israel, the lightning victory set the stage for decades of conflict that continue to reverberate today. Israel quickly annexed east Jerusalem – home to the city’s most sensitive Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites as well as its Palestinian population. Although Israel has never formally annexed the West Bank, it has informally incorporated much of the territory by building settlements that are now home to over 500,000 Jewish Israelis. The international community overwhelmingly considers both east Jerusalem and the West Bank occupied territory. Israel also built settlements in the Sinai, Golan and the Gaza Strip. 1979 peace agreement with Egypt Under Israel’s first peace agreement with an Arab country, Israel returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt and dismantled all settlements there. 1981 Golan annexation Israel annexed the Golan Heights, a strategic mountainous region overlooking northern Israel. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel’s control. The rest of the world still considers the area occupied Syrian territory. Netanyahu announced this week he wants to expand the Golan settler population after Assad’s downfall. 1982 invasion of Lebanon After a brief invasion of Lebanon against Palestinian militants in 1978, Israel reentered the country in 1982 in an operation that turned into an 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon. Israel withdrew in 2000 under heavy fire from the Hezbollah militia. 1993 Oslo Accords Israel and the Palestinians reached an interim peace deal granting the Palestinians autonomy in Gaza and parts of the West Bank, while leaving Israeli settlements intact. The accords were meant to pave the way for a two-state solution, but repeated rounds of peace talks ended in failure. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and Gaza for their hoped-for state, with east Jerusalem as their capital. 2005 Gaza withdrawal Then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon led a unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, uprooting all troops and 21 settlements from the territory. Two years later, Hamas militants overran Gaza and ousted the Palestinian Authority. 2023 war in Gaza and Lebanon Responding to Hamas’ Oct. 7 cross-border attack, Israel invades Gaza in an operation that continues. Israeli leaders have not laid out a clear postwar plan but have indicated they will maintain a buffer zone along Gaza’s border with Israel along with some sort of long-term military presence. Some hardliners in Netanyahu’s governing coalition have called for the re-establishment of Jewish settlements. In October, Israeli ground troops invaded southern Lebanon after a year of fighting with Hezbollah militants. Under a ceasefire, Israel has pledged to withdraw from a strip of land it is occupying by late January. The fall of Assad As opposition forces ousted Assad on Dec. 8, Israeli military forces moved into the Syrian side of the demilitarized buffer zone, established after the 1973 Mideast war. Israel now controls the zone and targets deeper inside the country. Although Israel has said the move is temporary, its open-ended presence has drawn international criticism from countries such as Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia as well as the United Nations. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged all countries with interests in Syria to 'try to make sure that we’re not sparking any additional conflicts.' The new Syrian government has already lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council about Israeli advances into Syrian territory. The leader of the largest insurgent group, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has publicly condemned Israel’s operations but said Syria is not seeking a military conflict with Israel. Carmit Valensi, an expert on Syria at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies, said she does not think the Israeli presence will morph into a longer-term occupation. She said Israel has little to gain by provoking al-Sharaa, who is also known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, and a long-term occupation would be costly economically and for Israel's war-fatigued army. 'It could take some time for Israel to withdraw. It depends how things develop in Syria,' she said. 'If we see a moderate regime emerge, in the same line Golani is trying to pave, I don't see any reason to hold those territories for the long term.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-borders-history-syria-gaza-war-golan-5fdf8fdbe2ec2cee7b9cf7f78fbb1c8c	2024-12-17T19:57:45-08:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street drifts ahead of the Federal Reserve's rate decision	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes are drifting higher Wednesday as Wall Street waits for an announcement from the Federal Reserve that could guide its direction into next year. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.2% to inch closer to its all-time high set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 173 points, or 0.4%, as of 12:56 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.2%. Jabil jumped 9.8% to help lead the market after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The electronics company also raised its forecast for revenue for its full fiscal year. Nvidia, the superstar responsible for a chunk of Wall Street’s rally to records in recent years, climbed 3.9% following a weekslong funk. It had dropped more than 12% from its record set last month and fallen in eight of the nine previous days as its big momentum slowed. On the losing side of Wall Street was General Mills, which dropped 3.2% despite reporting a stronger profit than expected. The maker of Progresso soups and Cheerios said it will increase its investments in brands to help them grow, which pushed it to cut its forecast for profit this fiscal year. Trading is likely to remain relatively quiet until the afternoon, when the expectation is for the Fed to deliver its third cut to interest rates of the year. After getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target from more than 9%, the Fed has been easing its main interest rate off a two-decade high to offer support for the slowing job market. The big question is how much more the Fed will cut in 2025, and the hope is that Fed Chair Jerome Powell may give some signals in his press conference following the announcement on interest rates. Fed officials will also unveil projections for where they see interest rates and the economy heading in upcoming years. Expectations for cuts in 2025 have been diminishing, in part because inflation has recently picked up the pace. Worries are also high that President-elect Donald Trump’s preference for tariffs and other policies could further spur inflation, along with economic growth. Treasury yields were holding relatively steady as the bond market waited for more clues on where rates are heading. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.39% from 4.40% late Tuesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, eased to 4.23% from 4.25%. In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 edged up by less than 0.1% after data showed inflation accelerated to 2.6% in November, its highest level in eight month. The Bank of England is also meeting on interest rates this week and will announce its decision on Thursday. In Japan, where the Bank of Japan will wrap up its own policy meeting on Friday, the Nikkei 225 slipped 0.7%. That was despite a 23.7% jump for Nissan Motor Corp., which said it was in talks on closer collaboration with Honda Motor Co., though no decision had been made on a possible merger. Honda Motor’s stock lost 3%. Nissan, Honda and Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. agreed in August to share components for electric vehicles like batteries and to jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry. ___ AP Writer Zimo Zhong contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-nissan-2b868351d485db56e9c80f520c97b595	2024-12-17T19:47:35-08:00	
Nissan, Honda confirm talks on closer collaboration but say there's been no decision on a merger	BANGKOK (AP) — Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. confirmed Wednesday that they are discussing closer collaboration but denied reports they have decided on a merger. Nissan’s share price soared more than 22% in Tokyo after reports citing unnamed sources said it might merge with Honda to form the world’s third-largest automaking group. Honda’s share price fell as much as 3%. The reports said that Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. was included in the talks. All three Japanese automakers announced in August that they planned to share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March. Trading in Nissan’s shares was suspended but then resumed after the companies jointly issued a statement saying they were 'considering various possibilities for future collaboration, but no decisions have been made.' A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Joining forces would help the two companies gain larger scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany’s Volkswagen AG. Nissan has an alliance with Renault SA that is under review. Last month, it said it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million). Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes. He said Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes. Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China. The ascent of Chinese automakers is shaking up the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4.2 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the biggest Japanese automaker.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-nissan-honda-merger-evs-56199be5bf5b99b0c739acfb1a9244dd	2024-12-17T18:48:38-08:00	
Japanese space startup aborts 2nd satellite launch attempt minutes after liftoff	TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese space startup said its second attempt to launch a rocket carrying satellites into orbit had been aborted minutes after liftoff Wednesday and destroyed itself again, nine months after the company's first launch attempt ended in an explosion. Space One's Kairos No. 2 rocket lifted off from a coastal site in the mountainous prefecture of Wakayama in central Japan. The company said it had aborted the flight after concluding that it was unlikely to complete its mission. 'We are very sorry that we could not achieve as far as a final stage of the mission,' Space One President Masakazu Toyoda told a news conference Wednesday. 'We don't consider this a failure because we are getting valuable data that will help our pursuit toward a next challenge.' He said he hoped to find the cause to address the problems as soon as possible to achieve a success next time. Company executive and space engineer Mamoru Endo said the abnormality in the first stage engine nozzle or its control system is likely to have caused an unstable flight of the rocket, which started spiraling in midflight and eventually destroyed itself about three minutes after liftoff, using its autonomous safety mechanism. The rocket, which rose higher than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above ground, entered space entered space before it was destroyed, officials said. Space One aims to be Japan’s first company to put a satellite into orbit, hoping to boost Japan’s lagging space industry with a small rocket for an affordable space transport business. Wednesday's flight, postponed twice from Saturday because of strong winds, came nine months after a failed debut flight in March, when the rocket was intentionally exploded five seconds after takeoff. The flight was carrying a government satellite that was intended to monitor North Korea’s missile launches and other military activities. Kairos No. 2 rocket was carrying five small satellites, including one from the Taiwanese space agency and several from Japanese startups. Space One said it had fixed the cause of the debut flight failure, which stemmed from a miscalculation of the rocket’s first-stage propulsion. Japan hopes the company can pave the way for a domestic space industry that competes with the United States. Tokyo-based Space One was set up in 2018 with investments from major Japanese companies, including Canon Electronics, IHI, Shimizu and major banks, to commercialize space delivery services at lower costs and regular flights as many as 20 times a year, compared to six currently planned by the government-led space program. Japan’s space development programs are led by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, and industry leaders such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and IHI, as they develop two main flagship rockets, the large H3 rocket and the much smaller Epsilon, to cater to the growing satellite transport business.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-space-rocket-satellite-commercial-abort-space-one-52409d53f2c187c0548188d160df03be	2024-12-17T17:30:31-08:00	
Rescuers dig for survivors of Vanuatu earthquake with no water and unclear death toll	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Vanuatu's capital was without water on Wednesday, a day after reservoirs were destroyed by a violent magnitude 7.3 earthquake that wrought havoc on the South Pacific island nation, with the number of people killed and injured expected to rise. The government's disaster management office said early Wednesday that 14 deaths were confirmed, but hours later said nine had been verified by the main hospital. The number was 'expected to increase' as people remained trapped in fallen buildings, a spokesperson said. About 200 people have been treated for injuries. Two of those killed were Chinese nationals, according to China’s official Xinhua News Agency, which cited Gu Zihua, an official at the Chinese embassy in Vanuatu. Frantic rescue efforts that began at flattened buildings after the quake hit early Tuesday afternoon continued 30 hours later, with dozens working in dust and heat with little water to seek those yelling for help inside. A few more survivors were extracted from the rubble of downtown buildings in Port Vila, also the country's largest city, while others remained trapped and some were found dead. A near-total telecommunications collapse meant people struggled to confirm their relatives' safety. Some providers began to reestablish phone service but connections were patchy. Internet service had not been restored because the submarine cable supplying it was damaged, the operator said. The earthquake hit at a depth of 57 kilometers (35 miles) and was centered 30 kilometers (19 miles) west of the capital of Vanuatu, a group of 80 islands home to about 330,000 people. A tsunami warning was called off less than two hours after the quake, but dozens of large aftershocks continued to rattle the country. The Asia-Pacific head of the International Federation of Red Cross, Katie Greenwood, speaking to The Associated Press from Fiji, said it was not clear how many people were still missing or killed. 'We have anecdotal information coming from people at the search and rescue site that are fairly confident that unfortunately those numbers will rise,' she said. The capital’s main medical facility, Vila Central Hospital, was badly damaged and patients were moved to a military camp. Clement Chipokolo, Vanuatu country director at the Christian relief agency World Vision, said health care services, already strained before the quake, were overwhelmed. No water in Port Vila While power was out in swathes of Port Vila, the biggest fear among aid agencies was the lack of water. Two large reservoirs serving the capital were totally decimated, the National Disaster Management Office said. Resident Milroy Cainton said people were joining large queues to buy water in stores, but could only purchase two or four bottles at a time. 'People are not really concerned about electricity, they're just concerned about water,' he said. UNICEF was recording a rise in diarrhea among children, a sign that they had begun to drink tainted water, said the chief of the Vanuatu office, Eric Durpaire. Officials told residents of areas where water had been restored to boil it. Some people remain trapped under the rubble At least 10 buildings sustained major damage, many in a busy downtown area full of lunchtime shoppers when the quake hit. An unknown number of people were trapped inside, and Cainton, the resident, said rescuers had been forced to target their efforts to where they believed people could be saved. Michael Thompson, who runs a tourism business in Vanuatu, was among the rescuers and posted a video on Facebook of the frenzied efforts and dust-covered survivors on gurneys along with pleas for people to bring tools and water to the site. Officials said Wednesday night that Port Vila appeared to be the worst-hit area, but some nearby villages and offshore islands had experienced landslides. Three bridges were 'at high risk of collapse' in heavy rain, the government said. Embassies are damaged A building housing a number of diplomatic missions in Port Vila — including those of the United States, Britain, France and New Zealand — was destroyed, with a section of the building cleaving off and flattening the first floor. Windows were buckled and walls crumbled. The U.S. State Department said its embassy staff were safe, but the building was no longer functional. The office opened in July as part of a push by the U.S. to expand its Pacific presence to counter China’s influence in the region. New Zealand’s foreign ministry said officials have accounted for all embassy staff. Australia’s foreign ministry said its workers were safe. All flights grounded Damage to the seaport and airport is likely to hamper aid efforts and economic recovery in a country dependent on agricultural exports and tourism. The airport was closed to commercial flights for a further 72 hours from Wednesday. But the runway was deemed functional for humanitarian flights by French engineers who arrived by helicopter. Military craft from Australia and New Zealand were due to begin arriving Wednesday night, carrying search and rescue personnel and equipment, as well as relief supplies. Dan McGarry, a journalist living in Vanuatu, said there had been a 'massive landslide' at the international shipping terminal. The government said the main wharf was closed. Vanuatu’s position on a subduction zone — where the Indo-Australian tectonic plate moves beneath the Pacific Plate — means earthquakes of greater than magnitude 6 are not uncommon, and the country’s buildings are intended to withstand quake damage. ___ Associated Press writers Mayuko Ono in Tokyo, Japan; Rod McGuirk in Melbourne, Australia; and Emily Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/vanuatu-earthquake-pacific-ocean-port-vila-magnitude-85f483b151f928cc25175038c33fb6d1	2024-12-17T17:18:56-08:00	
Ontario's premier says Trump's tariffs would be a disaster for US markets	TORONTO (AP) — The premier of Canada's most populous province said Tuesday President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose sweeping 25% tariffs on all Canadian products would be a 'disaster' that would hurt U.S. stock markets. Ontario Premier Doug Ford also said in an interview with The Associated Press that he's 'extremely worried' about Trump's plan to launch a mass deportation of millions of undocumented people. Ford said he has a plan to send hundreds of police officers to the border if they come north. Ford said tariffs won't work considering how integrated the U.S. and Canadian economies are. He noted that in the auto sector alone parts and go back and forth between Canada-U.S. border seven or eight times before being assembled in Ontario or Michigan. 'It is so integrated. I don't even know how you separate that in the supply chain. It would be a disaster,' Ford told the AP. 'It will affect the market. The market will drop and we have every CEO saying that is not the way to go.' Ford said the market consequences will get Trump's attention. 'I know he has many scorecards, but one is the stock market. It will affect the market, the market will drop,' Ford said. Brian Hughes, a Trump-Vance transition spokesperson, said in response to Ford's comments that 'President Trump has promised tariff policies that protect working Americans from the unfair practices of foreign companies and foreign markets.' Ford said he's also very worried about Trump’s mass deportation plan. Trump has talked about creating 'the largest mass deportation program in history,' calling for using the National Guard and mobilizing domestic police forces. 'I am extremely concerned,' Ford said. 'We do have a plan ready. We have hundreds of provincial police officers that are ready within hours, if not immediately, to hit the borders.' Ford said a combination of local police, provincial police and the federal government will all be working together. 'We’ll make sure that we tighten up that border like we’ve never seen before,' he said. Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if Canada and Mexico do not stem the flow of migrants and fentanyl from entering the U.S. border — even though far fewer of each crosses into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico. Ford made the comments shortly after Canada's federal government announced some more details about a billion dollar border plan that's designed to avert the tariffs. Canada's national police plans to create a new aerial intelligence task force to provide round-the-clock surveillance of Canada’s border using helicopters, drones and surveillance towers. Canada will also propose to the United States the creation of a North American 'joint strike force' to target organized crime groups that work across borders. 'We’re stepping up to keep our border strong and secure: By deploying new helicopters, drones and surveillance tools. By adding new scanners and sniffer dog teams to stop and seize fentanyl. By cracking down on the money laundering that’s funding cross-border crime,' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a post on X. Trudeau is under pressure from some of his own lawmakers to resign after his finance minister quit cabinet. Ford said it’s up to Trudeau to resign and said Canada’s provincial premiers are united in telling the Americans how important U.S-Canada trade is. Ford reiterated he would restrict electricity exports to Michigan, New York and Minnesota if the sweeping tariffs are imposed. 'I want to sell them more energy, more critical minerals, but I’m going to always keep every tool in our tool box available' Ford said. 'That’s the the last thing I want to do. We have the energy. They need the energy.' About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Ford said he spoke with the governors of Michigan and New York and they 'fully understand.' Michigan is Ontario’s top trading partner. 'We want to sit down and explain to Trump and inform him that we aren’t the enemy,' Ford said. 'And as for Mexico I want to do a bilateral trade deal directly with the U.S.' Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs at the two countries’ border are vastly different. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-us-ontario-ford-tariffs-2b8f74835456ed37d5c0b2f2e8688d7b	2024-12-17T15:30:37-08:00	
Deadly violence in Nigeria linked to breakup of United Methodist Church over LGBTQ policies	A religious schism has turned deadly in Nigeria, with a church member fatally shot and two young children killed as homes were set ablaze, according to United Methodist News Service. The news service said the reported violence on Sunday stemmed from a schism in the worldwide United Methodist Church over its decision to repeal LGBTQ bans — and the ensuing formation of the new Global Methodist Church by breakaway conservative churches. According to the news service, a United Methodist church member was shot and killed in a confrontation between both factions in Taraba, a state in northeast Nigeria. Homes were set ablaze, claiming the lives of two children, ages 2 and 4, of the overseer of a United Methodist school and nursery, the news service said. Another 10 church members were reported injured. The worldwide Global Methodist Church held its inaugural general conference earlier this year. It was created by churches breaking away from the United Methodist Church — an international denomination with a strong U.S. presence. While the UMC, at its general conference in May, lifted its longstanding bans on LGBTQ ordination and same-sex marriage, it also granted local conferences the right to set their own standards. The West Africa Central Conference, which includes Nigeria, restricts marriage to between a man and a woman and instructs its churches to follow national laws on LGBTQ issues, according to the news service. In a statement, local United Methodist bishops condemned the violence and asked that there be no retribution. 'We are outraged that such an atrocity would occur among Christians, especially brothers and sisters who were once part of the same Methodist family,' they said in a statement. 'We further urge GMC members, at all levels, to put an immediate end to the violence and refrain from disseminating misinformation that fuels fear and disdain that can lead to violence,' they said. The Assembly of Bishops of the Global Methodist Church issued a statement saying it is actively looking into the allegations and is seeking to determine what has happened. 'We mourn the loss of human life, decry the use of violence in any form, and call on both Global Methodists and United Methodists to serve as agents of peace,' it said. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Brazilian Santa swaps sleigh for Jet Ski to deliver toys — and joy — to disabled children in Rio	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Santa Claus is coming to town ... on a Jet Ski. Dozens of children with disability gathered on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach on Tuesday to receive presents — and joy — from the white-bearded man himself, a joint effort by the city's firefighters and nonprofit associations. Under 27 Celsius degrees (80 Fahrenheit), firefighter sargeant Thiago Carvalho de Paiva wore Santa Claus costumes in tropical Rio, moving through the water as beachgoers cheered. 'We wanted to find a special way for Santa Claus to arrive,' said Renato Grigorovski, a spokesman for Rio’s firefighters' department. The day began with a show of sniffing dogs displaying their skills and continued through lunch, with popcorn and refreshing acai bowls. The celebration reached its peak when Santa arrived on Jet Ski, making a grand entrance on the shores of Brazil 's postcard city. But it was not all fun and games for Santa. After delivering presents, De Paiva quickly jumped back into the water to rescue three people who appared to have trouble returning to shore. None was injured, firefighters said. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/santa-claus-jet-ski-rio-brazil-7a89ad01b77f2d845d62aa1818c1a30d	2024-12-17T13:57:53-08:00	
More world leaders from Argentina and El Salvador invited to Trump's inauguration	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — More world leaders are confirming they have been invited to President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and Argentine President Javier Milei is disclosing his plans to travel to Washington, breaking an American political tradition that kept foreign heads of state away from the transfer of power. Milei's spokesman Manuel Adorni told journalists in a text message that Trump had invited the Argentine leader, noting how it was the first time such an invitation had been extended to the president from the South American nation. And the Salvadoran ambassador to the U.S. said there had been an invitation to President Nayib Bukele and was still waiting to hear whether he would accept it. No head of state has previously made an official visit to the U.S. for the inauguration. On Monday, Trump spoke about his invitation to Chinese President Xi Jinping, revealing he had not declined it or confirmed his attendance yet. He was asked which other world leaders had been invited and whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was among them. Trump said the Ukrainian leader had not been invited, 'but if he’d like to come, I’d like to have him.' Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for information, but last week, spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Trump had invited world leaders. On Monday, Trump said world leaders were calling him when asked a question about what other heads of state he had invited. El Salvador’s ambassador to the U.S. Milena Mayorga said on a radio show that she was waiting to see if Bukele will accept the invitation saying it was still under consideration due to security reasons. Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after the election, traveling from Buenos Aires to the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago club. Milei, who describes himself as an 'anarcho-capitalist' receives praise frequently from billionaire Elon Musk and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who will helm the so-called 'Department of Government Efficiency' to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations. In his message to journalists, Milei's spokesperson Adorni said Trump is creating an entity similar to his new ministry of deregulation in Argentina. Milei brandished a chainsaw while campaigning on budget cuts, and then implemented a series of austerity measures, laying off tens of thousands of government workers, freezing public infrastructure projects and imposing wage and pension freezes below inflation. Many economists express cautious optimism that, as radical as some of the measures Milei has adopted, he is taking the right steps to rescue crisis-prone Argentina. Milei hopes good relations between the two countries could help Argentina reach a new deal with the International Monetary Fund, which would relieve pressure on the billions of dollars in debt repayments due next year. ___ Rey reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

A couple hundred North Korean troops killed, wounded in battles with Ukrainian forces	WASHINGTON (AP) — A couple hundred North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces against Ukraine have been killed or wounded during battle in the Kursk border region, a senior military official said Tuesday. The official didn't provide details on exactly how many have been killed, but said the North Korean forces don't appear to be battle-hardened, which contributes to the number of casualties they've had. The official was providing the first significant estimate of North Korean casualties, which comes several weeks after Ukraine announced that North Korea had sent 10,000 to 12,000 troops to Russia to help it in the almost 3-year war. The White House and Pentagon on Monday confirmed that the North Korean forces have been battling on the front lines in largely infantry positions. They have been fighting with Russian units and, in some cases, independently around Kursk. The casualty disclosure comes as the Biden administration is pressing to send as much military aid as possible to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes over. But a senior defense official told reporters Tuesday that the Defense Department may not be able to send all of the remaining $5.6 billion in Pentagon weapons and equipment stocks intended for Ukraine before Jan. 20, when Trump is sworn in. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide a U.S. assessment of the war. According to the Pentagon, there is about $1.2 billion remaining in longer-term funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is used to pay for weapons contracts that would not be delivered for a year or more. The official said the administration anticipates releasing all that money by the end of this year. The $5.6 billion is in presidential drawdown authority (PDA), which allows the Pentagon to take weapons off the shelves and send them quickly to Ukraine. That is a substantial amount of money, the defense official said, and while the U.S. will continue to provide weapons to Ukraine until Jan. 20, there may well be funds remaining that will be available for the incoming Trump administration to spend. Trump has talked about getting some type of negotiated settlement between Ukraine and Russia, creating some unease about whether he will provide Ukraine all the weapons funding approved by Congress. Ukrainian and Russian forces have been in a fierce battle around Kursk, and the official said Russia has been able to take back about 20% of the territory gained there by Kyiv. They said it will be possible for Ukraine to hold ground there for some time, but it will depend on how the rest of the fight is going, including the long-range strikes that Kyiv has been launching. The officials said it's not clear if Moscow has asked Pyongyang for additional forces, but acknowledged that Russia continues to lose as many as 1,200 troops a day in casualties — including both dead and wounded. But so far, Russia has been able to generate enough forces to replace them.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-ukraine-casualties-kursk-russia-a1207ba61ded5061f721ffa0f0650851	2024-12-17T13:24:11-08:00	
At least 25 are killed and dozens are missing after an overcrowded boat capsizes in Congo	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — An overcrowded boat capsized on a river in central Congo on Tuesday, killing at least 25 people, including children, and leaving dozens missing, officials and local residents said. The vessel was believed to have more than 100 passengers on board after leaving from the town of Inongo, northeast of the capital of Kinshasa. It capsized a few hundred meters (yards) into the journey along the Fimi River, the latest such tragedy to strike Congo. A search was underway for the missing hours later on Tuesday as concerns rose that the death toll could be far higher. 'There was overloading at roof level and, as far as the lifeless human bodies are concerned, at least 25 have been recovered so far,' said David Kalemba, Inongo’s river commissioner. The capsized boat was also loaded with goods, according to Alex Mbumba, a resident of the area. 'Among the dead are children, but it’s difficult to give an exact death toll at the moment as ... the boat had a lot of passengers,' said Mbumba. Tuesday's wreck was the fourth this year in the Maï-Ndombe province, a region surrounded by rivers and where many rely on river transportation. Congolese officials have often warned against overloading and vowed to punish those violating safety measures for water transportation. However, in remote areas where most passengers come from, many are unable to afford public transport for the few available roads. At least 78 people drowned in October when an overloaded boat sank in the country’s east while 80 lost their lives in a similar accident near Kinshasa in June. The latest accident prompted calls for the government to equip the province with flotation devices. 'The government must act to improve safety on the waters of our province (because) navigation conditions are dangerous,' said Mbumba. ___ McMakin reported from Dakar, Senegal, and Katumwa from Goma, Congo.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-boat-sink-mai-ndombe-389c60b793f0ce05d79fcc7d67273ad2	2024-12-17T11:58:51-08:00	
Four police officers killed in Mexico's most violent state	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Gunmen in northern Mexico attacked a police patrol and killed four officers in a shooting that also left four people wounded, authorities said Tuesday. The attack took place Monday in the north-central state of Guanajuato, which has Mexico’s highest number of homicide s. It has long been the scene of bloody turf battles between rival cartels, and the state has long been among the most deadly for police in Mexico. State prosecutors said Tuesday the attack occurred in the town of Uriangato, near the border with the neighboring state of Michoacan. Those killed in the attack included one female officer. The industrial and agricultural state of Guanajuato has for years been the scene of a bloody turf battle between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and a local gang, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-violence-four-police-officers-killed-f531a00a117bc05933318d1801793ddc	2024-12-17T11:09:56-08:00	
After Assad's fall, the task of unearthing the dead from Syria's mass graves is just beginning	NAJHA, Syria (AP) — Bones are visible here and there among the mounds of earth in a field south of Damascus, one of the mass graves around Syria believed to hold the bodies of tens of thousands of people killed under Bashar Assad’s rule. With his ouster, residents, forensic teams and international groups face what could be a yearslong task of unearthing the dead. In this site alone, by the town of Najha, several tens of thousands of bodies could have been buried, said Stephen Rapp, a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues who was visiting the site Tuesday. Some are believed buried under already existing graves of a regular cemetery nearby, he said. It's too soon to start digging, and it's unknown how many bodies remain there or if some were moved over the years. But here and there, bones were visible, including some vertebrae from a human spine and fragments of a femur. Rapp is working with two organizations that aim to help document mass graves and identify officials implicated in war crimes — the Commission for International Justice and Accountability and the Syria Emergency Task Force. They and other groups have for years been remotely gathering witness testimonies and satellite imagery to track and estimate the size of mass graves that swelled from crackdowns by Assad's feared security agencies, particularly in the early years of Syria's civil war that began in 2011. With Assad's fall 10 days ago, they are now able to see them firsthand. That gives the chance to 'really corroborate what we already know about the machinery of death that was maintained and operated by the Assad regime,' Rapp said. 'It is all so unthinkable that this is happening in the 21st Century.' More than 150,000 Syrians remain unaccounted for after disappearing into Assad's prisons and most are believed to be in mass graves around the country, said Mounir al-Mustafa, deputy director of the White Helmets, a Syrian search and rescue team. An array of prisons run by the military, intelligence and security agencies were notorious for systematic torture, mass executions and brutal conditions that killed other inmates from disease and starvation, according to human rights groups, whistle-blowers, and former detainees. The White Helmets have received reports of at least 13 mass grave sites around the country, eight of them near Damascus, including Najha, al-Mustafa said. 'We can’t open these mass graves yet. That is a massive task to document and take samples and give codes to the corpses before we can identify those people,' he said. The priority is to take stock of the unidentified bodies above ground, those in hospital morgues and in clashes, al-Mustafa said. Rapp, who arrived in Syria on Monday, visited another suspected grave site, in al-Qutayfah, 37 kilometers (23 miles) north of the capital. He plans to meet with officials from the new transitional government installed since the lightning offensive on Damascus on Dec. 8 that forced Assad to flee the country. He intends to discuss ways to secure and eventually excavate the sites, gather samples from remains for identification and preserve thousands of documents discovered in many security branches and prisons. 'There needs to be a process. That is what I will be engaging with government representatives about,' Rapp said. He said he will also see what the international community can do to assist the government in criminal prosecutions and in ensuring they meet international standards. On Monday, residents and medical teams began on their own digging up a mass grave in the village of Izraa in southern Daraa province. The remains of over 30 corpses were uncovered, and the teams estimated the total number could reach 70. Moussa Al-Zouebi, the head of the village’s health directorate, said some of the people whose remains were uncovered were executed by 'shooting in the head, in the eye, or by burning.' A local forensic team and rebel fighters handled bags of human remains as an excavator rumbled in the background, while relatives stood by. Relatives said they initially had hopes that they would find their loved ones in a prison. 'But we didn’t find anyone and it broke our hearts. They were burned alive here after being doused in fuel,' Mohammad Ghazaleh said at the mass grave site. The new authorities in Damascus have designated a hotline for people and ex-prisoners to identify locations and secret prisons used by Assad’s government to find any trace of missing persons. The insurgents have freed thousands of prisoners in Damascus and other cities, including Aleppo, Homs and Hama. 'It is understandable that the desperate family members will try to go to a site hoping that they find some sign of their relatives, some information,' Rapp said. He said the same is happening with documents found at sites. 'Although that is understandable, it can be damaging to an investigation,' he said. Rapp said the process of securing and cataloguing documents could take up to three months but identifying those buried in mass graves could take more than two years.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-mass-graves-stephen-rapp-fea6c06369a866786fa5633900e22419	2024-12-17T10:32:22-08:00	
Canada's prime minister faces calls to resign. Here's what could happen next	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces growing pressure to resign from his own Liberal Party after his top minister abruptly quit and criticized his handling of the budget. Trudeau has led the country for nearly a decade, but has become widely unpopular in recent years over a wide range of issues, including the high cost of living and rising inflation. There is no mechanism for Trudeau's party to force him out in the short-term. He could resign, or his party could be forced from power by a 'no confidence' vote in Parliament that would trigger an election that would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party. If his party were to survive a vote in Parliament — which seems increasingly unlikely — Trudeau could choose to stay on as prime minister until there is an election. As rising numbers of Liberal lawmakers called Tuesday for Trudeau to resign, the country’s minister of natural resources, Jonathan Wilkinson, said 'we all need to give him a little time to reflect.' Here's a deeper look at the possible paths for Trudeau and Canada. Trudeau could resign and allow other liberals to vie for his office If Trudeau resigns, which political analysts consider a likely scenario, the Liberals would need to choose an interim prime minister to lead the country at least until elections are held. It isn't clear yet who the most likely candidate would be for any interim role. Longer term, a person likely to seek power in the Liberal Party post-Trudeau is Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada, and later the Bank of England. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister. Another possible candidate is Trudeau’s new finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc. The former public safety minister, and a close friend of Trudeau, LeBlanc recently joined the prime minister at a dinner with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Concerns about Trudeau's leadership were exacerbated Monday when Chrystia Freeland, the former finance minister, quit his Cabinet. Freeland was highly critical of Trudeau's handling of the economy in the face of steep tariffs threatened by Trump. Shortly before Freeland announced her decision, the country's housing minister also quit. 'My guess is that if another minister or two goes, he’s toast, he will be forced to resign,' said Canadian historian Robert Bothwell. Opposition parties could vote to topple Trudeau's grip on power With voters deeply unhappy, Parliament has the authority to try to knock Trudeau's Liberal party from power by holding a 'no confidence' vote that would trigger an early election. And if a majority of Parliament votes against his government, Trudeau would then be 'erased in the election,' Bothwell said. The walls are rapidly closing in on Trudeau. Because Liberals don’t hold an outright majority in the Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the leftist New Democratic Party to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has all but vanished — the NDP's leader has called on Trudeau to resign — and that clears the way for Parliament to vote 'no confidence.' After Tuesday, Parliament will be shut for the holidays until late next month, and a 'no confidence' vote could be scheduled sometime thereafter. The Conservative Party, which has a commanding lead in the polls over the Liberals, has not publicly called for Trudeau’s resignation. And because of tactics the Liberal Party can deploy to delay a 'no confidence' vote, Conservatives might not be able to force one for a couple of months, said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. A vote of no confidence would trigger an immediate election. Trudeau could try to hang on to power The political winds are blowing heavily against Trudeau, but he could theoretically cling to power a while longer. While a growing number want him to resign, one longtime supporter, Liberal lawmaker James Maloney, said Trudeau has the support of his base in Parliament. If Trudeau’s Liberal party survives no confidence votes in the coming months — an unlikely scenario — the latest the next federal election could be held is October 20. The odds of an election much sooner than that have gone up. 'I expect an election in late spring, unless Trudeau decides to dissolves Parliament and dives into an election before then,' said Wiseman. With Liberals' grip on power fading, experts say the best they can hope for in the next election is to hold the Conservatives to a minority government that will be reliant on other parties to pass legislation. The latest polling from Nanos has the Conservatives leading the Liberals 43% to 23%, suggesting Conservatives could win a majority of the seats.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-resign-freeland-trump-f346160f062846bbbaac73dbdd597941	2024-12-17T10:13:17-08:00	
Iran pauses the process to implement a new, stricter headscarf law for women, official says	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran has paused the process of implementing a new, stricter law on women’s mandatory headscarf, or hijab, an official said — a bill that many believe could have reignited the protests that engulfed the Islamic Republic after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini. The controversial law, which was approved by the parliament in September 2023, will not be sent to the government as planned this week, according to one of the country's vice presidents. The development effectively means that Iran has halted enacting the legislation. The law levies harsher punishments for women who refuse to wear the hijab and for businesses that serve them, penalties previously rejected by Iran’s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian as he tries to restart talks with the West over sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear program. 'According to the discussions held, it was decided that this law will not be referred to the government by the parliament for now,' Shahram Dabiri, the vice president in charge of parliamentary affairs, was quoted as saying in an interview Monday with the pro-reform Ham Mihan daily. The decision to halt the legislation — at least temporarily — was reached by top executive, legislative and judiciary bodies, Dabiri also said. At the moment, it is 'not feasible to implement this bill,' he added, without elaborating. Had the bill passed to the government, Iran's president would have had little room to maneuver. By law, he’s required to endorse the bill within five days, after which it would have taken effect in 15 days. The president has no authority to veto it. Pezeshkian could try to convince Iran’s 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, to halt the bill. If the bill had been enacted, Pezeshkian could also refuse to act on it or urge police not to enforce it, setting up a potential constitutional crisis that hard-liners could try to exploit to weaken him. The president had earlier described the law as having 'many questions and ambiguities.' Amini died on Sept. 16, 2022, after her arrest by the country’s morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab to the liking of the authorities. Iran has denied being responsible for her death and disputes she was beaten. However, United Nations investigators have concluded Amini 'was subjected to physical violence that led to her death,' which they blamed on the morality police. The monthslong security crackdown that followed Amini’s death killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained. In the years since, Iranian women on the streets increasingly have ignored the existing hijab law, walking in public with their hair uncovered despite the threat of arrest or harassment. The new, 74-section law envisages fines of $800 for first offenses and $1,500 for second offenses, followed by prison terms of up to 15 years for third offenses. Also, celebrities and public figures could see the confiscation of 8% of their net worth, while businesses face the possibility of closure and fines for serving those not wearing a headscarf. Travel bans also would have been enacted for offenders. The law also would have allowed foreign nationals, including the millions of Afghans living in Iran, to work as informers reporting women not wearing the hijab. Business owners and taxi drivers would be encouraged to report on uncovered women. Otherwise, they can face cash fines. The scope of the law, which would be in place for three years, is extraordinary even for the Islamic Republic. It also includes allowing police access to private surveillance footage and even footage recorded by security forces, the Defense Ministry and the country’s civilian nuclear agency. ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-mandatory-headscarf-hijab-law-protests-26e6015d6e47b18238f0ac4c08c4d33a	2024-12-17T09:41:54-08:00	
Stellantis pledges invest $2.1 million in Italian production in 2025 during talks with government	MILAN (AP) — Carmaker Stellantis will invest 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in Italian production next year and spend another 6 billion euros ($6.3 billion) in the supply chain, the head of European operations told a government panel on Tuesday. Stellantis executives laid out prospects for Italian operations just weeks after the board forced former CEO Carlos Tavares to resign amid slumping sales. He is being replaced by an executive committee led by chairman John Elkann until a new CEO is named. Stellantis, the world’s fourth-largest carmaker, was formed from the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Peugeot. Its fiscal base is in the Netherlands, but it retains headquarters in Turin, Paris and Auburn Hills, Michigan. Stellantis European chief Jean-Philippe Imparato told the economic, labor and economic development ministers that Turin would become the headquarters of the carmakers’ European operations from January, addressing a concern among Italian officials and unions since the merger that the automaker’s center of gravity had shifted. Meeting behind closed doors, Imparato told the ministers that Stellantis’ six automaking factories in Italy will boost production from 2026 with the launch of more than a dozen new models through 2032, according to the Stellantis media office. New models include a new Fiat Pandina city car in Pomigliano d’Arco near Naples from 2028, while Mirafiori in Turin will be the basis of production for the 500 city car with both hybrid and full-electric powertrains. Melfi and Cassino in southern Italy will get new hybrid vehicles, including a new Jeep Compass and Alfa Romeo Giulia. 'I won’t hide that 2025 will be a hard year, but all of the factories in Italy will be active,' Imparato told a news conference after the meeting, which also included unions, regional officials and industry representatives. Economic Development Minister Adolfo Urso said that one reason for production lulls are new European rules that come into effect Jan. 1 that one-fifth of cars being produced must be electric vehicles, or face stiff fines. He called for the rules to be changed. Plants in Italy have been cycling through short-term layoff programs because of lagging sales, especially of electric vehicles. While unions welcomed the announcements, they remained skeptical that they would lead to a turnaround. They said the layoff schemes were likely to continue through next year. 'There are not the conditions to say that we have entered a new phase,'' said Rocco Palombella, head of the Uilm union. 'Perhaps a new phase in industrial relations, but not a new phase guaranteeing factories, or to say the situation will improve from tomorrow.'	https://apnews.com/article/italy-stellantis-production-be5847c3e34e1a4cbf792ca2d63f64bb	2024-12-17T09:33:22-08:00	
Russian opposition figure says fears of his mother's poisoning in Berlin proved false	BERLIN (AP) — A prominent Russian opposition politician freed as part of the largest East-West civilian prisoner swap since the Cold War said Tuesday that fears of his mother's poisoning in Berlin have proven false. Vladimir Kara-Murza, a dual Russian-U.K. citizen and one of the leading Russian opposition figures, said that the worries that his mother could have been poisoned or suffered a heart attack haven't been corroborated. He added that she remains in a Berlin hospital where she continues to undergo examination. 'My mom is indeed in a hospital in Berlin, but suspicions of poisoning or a heart attack haven't been confirmed, thank God,' he said on the messaging app Telegram. Kara-Murza was arrested in 2022 after criticizing the war in Ukraine that had begun weeks earlier. He was convicted in 2023 of treason and other charges, and sentenced to 25 years in prison in a case he called politically motivated. He fell ill in 2015 and 2017 from two near-fatal poisonings he blamed on the Kremlin. Kara-Murza was among 16 prisoners that Russia and its ally Belarus released in an August swap — Americans, Germans and Russian dissidents, most of whom were imprisoned on charges widely seen as politically motivated. Those freed in the historic exchange included journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan. Moscow in return got eight Russians jailed in the West for spying, hacking computers and even a brazen daylight murder. The deal took a long time to negotiate, and officials were discussing a possible swap that would involve Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny just before his sudden and unexplained death in an Arctic penal colony in February. Navalny's family and his allies blamed his death on the Kremlin, accusations it has rejected. Navalny had been jailed since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. The Kremlin vehemently denied it was behind the poisoning. Last month, Kara-Murza, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize this year, was among opposition figures who organized a march of at least 1,000 people in central Berlin who rallied against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his war in Ukraine. German police said earlier Tuesday that a German-Russian woman was taken to an isolation ward at the German capital's Charite hospital after informing medical staff that she suspected she had been poisoned. Police, which didn't identify the woman, said the woman was taken to the ward at Charite after voicing her suspicion to staff at a clinic. They said that blood tests for 'all kinds of poisonous substances' were being conducted. They said they were investigating a possible attempted killing, and that all necessary measures were being taken to find any possible suspects.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-russia-suspected-poisoning-hospital-ab768dcfa89541ae204dbf6a1b368e39	2024-12-17T09:15:25-08:00	
Pharrell Williams is named a UNESCO goodwill ambassador	PARIS (AP) — Pop star and fashion designer Pharrell Williams was named UNESCO’s goodwill ambassador for artistic education and entrepreneurship on Tuesday in Paris, continuing his cultural dominance of the French capital as Louis Vuitton menswear artistic director and performer at Notre Dame Cathedral’s reopening earlier this month. Williams said he hoped to 'deepen that sense of unity and togetherness' in work that 'evens the odds for marginalized communities.' He also spoke about his impoverished youth, adding: 'Growing up in Virginia, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be given an opportunity like this one.' The role of goodwill ambassador for the Paris-based U.N. cultural agency involves promoting its initiatives that include protecting Indigenous cultures, advancing education and health care for women, raising awareness about genocide prevention and safeguarding cultural heritage. The U.N. agency said Williams will be 'a mentor and role model for young creators, particularly in Africa, where UNESCO supports the development of cultural industries.' Williams joins a list of goodwill ambassadors that includes U.S. jazz musician Herbie Hancock, Brazilian artist Vik Muniz and Japanese filmmaker Naomi Kawase. Williams has been particularly visible in Paris this year. Shortly before the Paris Olympics, his role as Louis Vuitton menswear designer took center stage during a star-studded event at UNESCO’s headquarters. The show, celebrating the beauty of human skin, featured models wearing garments in shades representing the diverse hues of humanity. UNESCO leaders hope that Williams' global influence and deep connections to fashion and music will draw fresh attention to the agency’s work. Williams is American, and his selection as goodwill ambassador also may be highlighting the readmission of the United States to UNESCO last year. The U.S. exit under President Donald Trump cited alleged anti-Israel bias within the agency. The decision followed a 2011 decision by UNESCO to include Palestine as a member state, which led the U.S. and Israel to cease financing for the agency. The U.S. return under President Joe Biden was marked by a flag-raising ceremony attended by U.S. First Lady Jill Biden.	https://apnews.com/article/pharrell-williams-unesco-goodwill-ambassador-1f6d37964aa8aea7dd9425f62d44101e	2024-12-17T09:08:21-08:00	
Lawsuit accuses State Department of creating loopholes for Israel on military aid and human rights	WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department has carved out exceptions for close ally Israel that block a U.S. law restricting foreign military support over human rights abuses, a lawsuit from a group of Palestinians in Gaza and American relatives asserted Tuesday. Former State Department officials and crafters of the 1997 Leahy law were among those advising and backing the lawsuit. The lawsuit details the barriers that it accuses the State Department of creating on Israel's behalf to skirt enforcement and asks courts to intervene. That is after campus protests and moves by some lawmakers failed in their goal of limiting U.S. military support to Israel over civilian deaths in Gaza during the war with Hamas. 'It's really a modest set of goals here: There's a U.S. law. We'd like the federal government to adhere to U.S. law,' said Ahmed Moor, a Philadelphia-based Palestinian American who joined the lawsuit on behalf of cousins, uncles and aunts displaced and killed in the 14-month war. The law bars U.S. military assistance to foreign military units when there is credible evidence of gross human rights abuses. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has denied that the department has given Israel a pass. 'Do we have a double standard? The answer is no,' he said in April. The State and Justice departments declined to comment Tuesday. Israel says it makes every effort to limit harm to Palestinian civilians in its military operations. The Biden administration has warned Israel to do more to spare civilians in the Gaza war, holding back one known weapons shipment of 2,000-pound bombs. A State Department report in May concluded there was 'reasonable' evidence that Israel's use of U.S.-provided weapons in Gaza violated international law that protects civilians but bypassed a decision on limiting arms, saying the war itself made it impossible for U.S. officials to judge for certain. It also declined last month to hold back arms transfers as it had threatened over humanitarian aid to Gaza. Charles Blaha, a former State Department official who helped oversee reviews under the Leahy law, argued that enforcing the law for Israel would have prevented much of the harm that civilians in Gaza are suffering. 'The secretary of state has made all the decisions so far on Israel and the Leahy law, and every single decision has resulted in those units being eligible' for continued U.S. military support, Blaha said. 'And that’s not the way the normal process works.' U.S. military support to Israel in the light of Palestinian civilian deaths was a fraught issue in the presidential election. Republicans and many Democrats demanded unwavering military backing to Israel. The Biden administration's refusal to limit support cost Democrats some votes from some Arab and Muslim voters and others. Tuesday's lawsuit is part of a last push on the outgoing Biden administration by Muslim Americans and others to limit U.S. military support to Israel, which is estimated to have reached $17.9 billion in the first year of the war — over its treatment of Palestinian civilians. Two former Senate staffers, Tim Reiser and Stephen Rickard, were instrumental in crafting the law named for former Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy and said the rising death toll in Gaza warranted the court case. The nonprofit Democracy for the Arab World Now, an Arab-rights group founded by slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, helped bring the lawsuit for five Palestinians and Palestinian Americans. The plaintiffs include a former Gaza math teacher and humanitarian worker now living in a tent after losing 20 family members and being uprooted seven times. Hamas militants began the war with an Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages, some of whom are still being held. The Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death tolls, said the war has killed 45,000 Palestinians. The lawsuit was filed under the Administrative Procedures Act. Groups ranging from immigration advocates, Medicare groups, petroleum giants and fishermen have used the law in the past to try to shape how U.S. public agencies enforce laws. It accuses State Department officials under President Joe Biden of creating a series of high barriers when vetting Israel's military for Leahy law violations. Former State officials, including Blaha, have accused the U.S. of effectively exempting Israel from enforcement, and the lawsuit offers some details for the first time. It claims obstacles include setting up a multimember committee from the State and Defense departments in 2020 solely to consider possible violations by the Israeli military and uniquely requiring the deputy secretary of state to sign off on any findings of violations. The process also carves out an additional loophole for Israel, the lawsuit says, giving its government alone a chance to stave off a restriction of military support over a human rights abuses by showing it has addressed the problem. The State Department used that exception in August, saying it had decided against cutting off aid to an Israeli military unit in the West Bank over grave human rights abuses because it removed two responsible soldiers from combat and committed to special training and oversight of remaining members. The unit was accused in the death of a 79-year-old Palestinian American man it had taken into custody. On Monday, Blinken met at the State Department with the family of another American, 26-year-old Seattle resident Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, who was shot and killed after taking part in a demonstration in the West Bank in September. Blinken told the family that Israel had recently informed the U.S. it was wrapping up its investigation of her death, Miller said Monday. State officials in the 50-minute meeting 'kept repeating this frankly kind of bogus claim of it being an accident,' widower Hamid Ali said after the meeting. U.S. officials told the family they did not yet know enough details to say whether the family's demands for an independent U.S. criminal investigation were warranted, Ali said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-military-aid-gaza-us-biden-leahy-law-3fe632e1ef524656b7a201bc4c1651a2	2024-12-17T08:19:16-08:00	
The killing of a Russian general is one of several that Moscow blames on Ukraine	Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, has claimed responsibility for killing Lt. General Igor Kirillov, head of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, in a bombing Tuesday in Moscow. Kirillov, 54, was killed alongside his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, when a bomb planted on a scooter exploded outside an apartment block. An official with the SBU said the agency was behind the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information, described Kirillov as a 'war criminal and an entirely legitimate target.' On Monday, Kirillov was charged in absentia by the SBU for 'ordering the use of banned chemical weapons against Ukraine’s Defense Forces.' Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out other high-profile attacks throughout the nearly 3-year-old war. Kyiv has hinted at its involvement but Ukrainian officials have stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility. Other high-profile attacks that Russia has blamed on Ukraine: Darya Dugina TV commentator Darya Dugina, 29, was killed in August 2022 when a remote-controlled bomb planted in her SUV blew up as she drove on Moscow's outskirts. Her father, Alexander Dugin, was widely believed to be the intended target. The philosopher, writer and political theorist is an ardent supporter of the war and a prominent proponent of the ideology that emphasizes traditional values, the restoration of Russia’s power and the unity of all ethnic Russians. Ukraine denied responsibility for the attack, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying Dugina is 'not our responsibility. She is not a citizen of our country. We are not interested in her.' Russia’s Federal Security Agency, the FSB, publicly identified two suspects, Ukrainian citizens. Vladlen Tatarsky Military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky was killed in April 2023 when a bomb tore through a cafe in central St Petersburg where he had been speaking. Tatarsky, 40, supported the war in Ukraine and filed regular reports from the front for his Telegram followers. Born in the Donbas region, Ukraine’s industrial heartland, the former coal miner was convicted of bank robbery and escaped after a Russia-backed separatist rebellion engulfed the region in 2014. He joined the rebels and fought on the front line before turning to blogging. Darya Trepova, 26, was convicted of the bombing and sentenced to 27 years in prison after she was seen on camera presenting a small statue to Tatarsky that exploded shortly afterward. Trepova testified she didn’t know the gift contained a bomb. Zakhar Prilepin Nationalist Russian writer Zakhar Prilepin narrowly avoided death in a car bombing in Russia’s Nizhny Novgorod region in May 2023. His driver was killed, while Prilepin was hospitalized with broken bones, bruised lungs and other injuries. Prilepin, known for support of the war, was sanctioned by the European Union. A Ukrainian, Alexander Permyakov, was found guilty of the attack in a Russian court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Russia’s Investigative Committee accused him of working under orders from Kyiv. Stanislav Rzhitsky Former submarine commander Stanislav Rzhitsky was gunned down in July 2023 while jogging in Krasnodar, Russia. Ukrainian media reported that Rzhitsky was one of six submarine commanders able to launch the long-range missiles that hit Vinnytsia, Ukraine, a year earlier, killing 23 people and wounding over 100. When he died, Rzhitsky was deputy head of a military mobilization office in Krasnodar. Russian media outlets reported that the 42-year-old regularly used a fitness app that could have been used to track his movements, Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate, denied Kyiv's involvement in the death. However, the agency also released details about the killing, including the time of the attack and the number of shots fired. A 64-year-old Ukrainian-born man, Sergei Denisenko, was later arrested. Illia Kyva Illia Kyva, a Ukrainian lawmaker who fled to Russia shortly after the full-scale invasion, was found dead near Moscow in December 2023 with a gunshot wound to the head. A controversial political figure in Ukraine before the war, Kyva, 46, often appeared on pro-Kremlin TV talk shows and discussions. A month before his death, a Ukrainian court found him guilty in absentia of treason and sentenced him to 14 years in prison. Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, said after Kyva’s death that 'the same fate will befall other traitors of Ukraine.' He did not say who was behind the killing. Russia’s state Investigative Committee opened a probe, but no charges have been made. Sergei Yevsyukov Sergei Yevsyukov, the former head of a prison that housed Ukrainian POWs, was killed Dec. 9 after a bomb exploded under a car in the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk, Ukrainian media reported. One other person was injured in the blast. Yevsyukov had run the Olenivka Prison, where dozens of POWs died in a missile strike in July 2022. He later was charged in absentia by Ukrainian authorities with 'mass torture.' Russian authorities said Saturday they had detained a suspect in the attack. Mikhail Shatsky Ukrainian media reported Dec. 12 that Russian missile designer Mikhail Shatsky was gunned down in a suburban Moscow park. Shatsky worked at the Moscow Experimental Design Bureau Mars, where he reportedly oversaw the modernization of cruise missiles. Several Ukrainian media outlets reported that Shatsky had been shot while walking in the Kuzminsky forest, near his home. Russian news media reported on a disturbance in the same area on the day of Shatsky’s reported death, but did not elaborate.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-killings-bomb-shooting-f456551684132c9ccee1420df8b9b282	2024-12-17T08:15:48-08:00	
Netanyahu says Israeli troops will occupy a buffer zone inside Syria for the foreseeable future	JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israeli forces will stay in a buffer zone on the Syrian border, seized after the ouster of Syria's President Bashar Assad, until another arrangement is in place 'that ensures Israel's security.' Netanyahu made the comments from the summit of Mount Hermon — the highest peak in the area — inside Syria, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with the Israel-held Golan Heights. It appeared to be the first time a sitting Israeli leader had set foot that far into Syria. Netanyahu said he had been on the same mountaintop 53 years ago as a soldier, but the summit’s importance to Israel’s security has only increased given recent events. Israel seized a swath of southern Syria along the border with the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights days after Assad was ousted by rebels last week. Israel’s capture of the buffer zone, a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized area in Syrian territory, has sparked condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating a 1974 ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria in the wake of Assad's ouster to make a land grab. 'We will stay ... until another arrangement is found that ensures Israel’s security,' said Netanyahu who had traveled to the buffer zone on Tuesday with Defense Minister Israel Katz. Katz said he instructed the Israeli military to quickly establish a presence, including fortifications, in anticipation of what could be an extended stay in the area. 'The summit of the Hermon is the eyes of the state of Israel to identify our enemies who are nearby and far away,' he said. An Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said there is no plan to evacuate the Syrians living in villages within the buffer zone. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. A U.N. force of about 1,100 troops had patrolled the area since then. A U.N. spokesman said Tuesday that the advance of Israeli troops, however long it lasts, violates the 1974 deal that set up the buffer zone. That agreement 'needs to be respected, and occupation is occupation, whether it lasts a week, a month or a year, it remains occupation,' spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. There was no immediate comment from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the insurgent group that led the ouster of Assad, or from Arab states. Israel still controls the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed — a move not recognized by most of the international community. Mount Hermon's summit is divided between the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, Lebanon, and Syria. Only the United States recognizes Israel’s control of the Golan Heights. With Assad gone, a top U.N. official said Tuesday that militant leaders who have taken over Syria have committed to 'an ambitious scaling-up of vital humanitarian support' for millions in desperate need of food and other aid. The leader of the insurgent HTS — Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Mohammed al-Golani — and the country's caretaker prime minister, Mohammed al-Bashir, pledged to support the movement of aid from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and other neighboring countries 'for as long as humanitarian operations are required,' said Tom Fletcher. Fletcher, who heads the the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, spoke to the U.N. Security Council members from Damascus via a video link. Germany said Tuesday that its diplomats had also met with insurgent leaders to discuss Syria's political transition and 'our expectations regarding the protection of minorities and women’s rights.' German officials, who have noted the rebel group's history of links to al-Qaida, said they will measure the group and the new government based on its actions. The United States has previously said that its officials have been in direct contact with HTS insurgents who ousted Assad. In other developments, bodies of more than 30 Syrians who vanished under Assad's rule were uncovered in a mass grave on Monday. Forensic teams and rebels worked together to unearth the remains in the village of Izraa, north of the city of Daraa, as families of the missing stood by. The relatives said they had initially hoped to find their loved ones in prison. 'But we didn’t find anyone and it broke our hearts. They were burned alive here after being doused in fuel,' said Mohammad Ghazaleh, who was waiting at the mass grave site. Some of the bodies recovered showed evidence that they had been shot in the head or burned, said Moussa Al-Zouebi, head of Izraa’s health directorate. Syria's new authorities have set up a hotline for reporting missing persons and secret detention sites. In the Syrian capital of Damascus, Qatar officially reopened its embassy on Tuesday — nearly 13 years after it severed diplomatic relations with Assad's government. Qatar had reaffirmed its 'categorical rejection of the regime’s repressive policies against the Syrian people' in a statement earlier. Most foreign embassies in Syria have been shut down since after the country’s civil war erupted in 2011. The French Embassy in Damascus raised its flag Tuesday in a 'symbolic gesture' to show support for the Syrian people during the transition. It's reopening is pending ongoing evaluation of political and security conditions, French Foreign Minister French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said. The Turkish Embassy in Damascus also recently reopened. ___ Associated Press writer Edith M.

Filipina who won a last-minute reprieve from the Indonesian firing squad in 2015 is to return home	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian authorities were set to return a Filipina woman to the Philippines after midnight, who was on death row in Indonesia and was nearly executed by firing squad in 2015, under an arrangement between the two countries. Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso — who spent almost 15 years in an Indonesian prison for drug trafficking — won a last-minute reprieve that will lead to her testimony exposing how a criminal syndicate duped her into being an unwitting accomplice and drug courier. Veloso was moved late Sunday to a female prison in Indonesia’s capital of Jakarta, from where she has been flown back to the Philippines. She was escorted to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport on Tuesday night for a flight to Manila. Her repatriation was made possible by a 'practical arrangement' for the transfer of prisoners signed between the two countries on Dec. 6, after a longstanding request from Manila. Veloso told a group of reporters outside the Pondok Bambu female prison in eastern Jakarta, that she was overwhelmed by a variety of emotions, before getting into the car that took her to the airport. She thanked Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and his government for sending her back home to serve her sentence in her country, 'So, I can be closer to my children and family.' 'Thank you, Indonesia, I love Indonesia,' Veloso said. She said that she brought many souvenirs given by her Indonesian fellow inmates and friends, including a guitar, books, knittings and rosaries. Veloso, who will turn 40 next month, was arrested in 2010 at an airport in the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, where officials discovered about 2.6 kilograms (5.7 pounds) of heroin hidden in her luggage. The single mother of two sons was convicted and sentenced to death. Her case caused a public outcry in the Philippines. She traveled to Indonesia in 2010, where her recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio, reportedly told her a job as a domestic worker awaited her. Sergio also allegedly provided the suitcase where the drugs were found. In 2015, Indonesia moved Veloso to an island prison where she and eight other drug convicts were scheduled to be executed by firing squad despite objections from their home countries Australia, Brazil, France, Ghana and Nigeria. Indonesia executed the eight but Veloso was granted a stay of execution because Sergio was arrested in the Philippines, just two days earlier. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population. Indonesia’s last executions of one of its citizens and three foreigners were carried out in July 2016. About 530 people are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including 96 foreigners, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections’ data showed last month. Five Australians who spent almost 20 years in Indonesian prisons for heroin trafficking returned to Australia Sunday under a deal struck between the Indonesian and Australian governments. ___ Associated Press journalist Achmad Ibrahim in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-philippines-mary-jane-veloso-prison-transfer-b39862f49d73c51b31153717950ffcf5	2024-12-17T06:31:28-08:00	
Russian lawmakers approve a bill that could remove the terrorist designation for the Taliban	MOSCOW (AP) — The lower house of Russia's parliament on Tuesday approved a bill that would set the stage for Moscow to remove the designation of the Taliban in Afghanistan as a terrorist group. Under the bill passed by the State Duma in the second and third readings, the official terrorist designation of an organization could be suspended by a court. The legislation still needs to be approved by the upper house and signed by President Vladimir Putin to become law. The Taliban were put on Russia’s list of terrorist organizations in 2003, and any contact with such groups is punishable under Russian law. At the same time, Taliban delegations attended various forums hosted by Moscow. Russian officials have shrugged off questions about the seeming contradiction by emphasizing the need to engage the Taliban to help stabilize Afghanistan. The Soviet Union fought a 10-year war in Afghanistan that ended with Moscow withdrawing its troops in 1989. Since then, Moscow has made a diplomatic comeback as a power broker, hosting talks on Afghanistan involving senior representatives of the Taliban and neighboring nations. There is a deepening divide in the international community on how to deal with the Taliban, who have been in power for three years and face no internal or external opposition. Afghanistan’s rulers have pursued bilateral ties with major regional powers.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-taliban-parliament-bill-afghanistan-extremism-82938ed13e0930f81f7be95512e25ce0	2024-12-17T05:43:07-08:00	
Bluey' is bound for the big screen with a feature film coming in 2027	NEW YORK (AP) — 'Bluey' is heading to the big screen. The Walt Disney Co. and BBC Studios announced Tuesday that a film based on the hit Australian animated series will arrive in theaters in 2027. The movie will be written and directed by series creator Joe Brumm, with a voice cast led by the series' regulars, including Melanie Zanetti and David McCormack. According to the companies, the CGI-animated film will 'continue the adventures of Bluey, a lovable, inexhaustible, blue heeler dog, who lives with her Mum, Dad and her little sister, Bingo.' 'I’ve always thought ‘Bluey’ deserved a theatrical movie,' Brumm said in a statement. 'I want this to be an experiential event for the whole family to enjoy together.' After Brumm launched the Australian production in 2018, the series has grown into a worldwide sensation and was the most-watched series globally on Disney+ in 2024. 'Since its debut on Disney Jr. and Disney+, Bluey has become a global phenomenon, uniting families everywhere with its heartfelt stories of play, imagination and connection,' said Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, Disney Entertainment co-chairs.	https://apnews.com/article/bluey-movie-disney-ff83a5a48aa29a7a5f6270b4cb45ca5e	2024-12-17T05:41:57-08:00	
Germany's election contenders set out contrasting plans to revive the economy, reduce migration	BERLIN (AP) — Leading contenders in Germany's upcoming election presented their programs on Tuesday, setting out contrasting visions of how to put new vigor into Europe's biggest economy and tackle other issues such as migration. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a center-left Social Democrat, will seek a second term in the parliamentary election expected on Feb. 23 — more than three months after his unpopular three-party coalition collapsed in a dispute about how to revive the stagnant economy. He hopes for a come-from-behind victory against center-right challenger Friedrich Merz, whose Union bloc leads all recent polls. Also seeking the top job are Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, Scholz's remaining coalition partner; and Alice Weidel of the far-right Alternative for Germany, which is polling strongly but has no realistic chance of governing because other parties refuse to work with it. The Social Democrats, Union and Greens all hope to implement as much as they can of their programs presented Tuesday, but any new government will almost certainly be a coalition and require extensive compromises. It's the economy ... The Union is pledging tax cuts for individuals and companies and wants to raise the level at which the highest level of income tax, 42%, kicks in. It wants to make working overtime more financially attractive. It also wants to abolish a tax once paid by everyone to finance the costs of integrating the former East Germany, now levied only on higher earners. It hopes to free up money by reforming the benefit system for the long-term unemployed and getting more people into jobs. It also wants to cut the value-added tax rate on dining out. Scholz's Social Democrats pledge a lower income tax burden for 95% of earners. They want to reduce value-added tax on groceries. The Social Democrats and Greens want to increase the national minimum wage, which will be 12.82 euros ($13.47) per hour on election day, to 15 euros — reprising an issue both parties campaigned on in 2021. Scholz's party wants a 'made in Germany bonus' to encourage investment in new plants and equipment. It also wants to set up a 'Germany fund' to invest public and private money in energy networks, innovative companies and building new homes. The Greens propose something similar to finance spending on infrastructure and want the 'super-rich' to make a bigger contribution, for example to help finance education. All the contenders have proposals to reduce electricity prices. To borrow or not to borrow The Social Democrats and Greens want to reform Germany's self-imposed restrictions on borrowing — the 'debt brake,' introduced more than a decade ago, which allows new borrowing to the tune of only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product, though it can be suspended for emergencies that are out of the state's control. The two center-left parties, which are vague about how exactly they would modify it, argue that it has become a barrier to investment. The 'debt brake' played a part in the collapse of Scholz's coalition in November. The chancellor's former coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats, insisted on upholding it strictly. The Union wants to hang on to it, arguing that it already has proven its flexibility in times of crisis and prevents Germany from burdening future generations with debt. But Merz has signaled that he might eventually be open to a future reform. Migration The Union wants Germany to turn back at its border migrants trying to enter from other countries in Europe's free travel zone and seek asylum. It wants to increase deportations of migrants who aren't entitled to stay and designate more 'safe countries of origin,' allowing authorities to speed up asylum proceedings. It is pledging to reverse legislation approved under Scholz that eased the rules on gaining citizenship and ended restrictions on holding dual citizenship. The Social Democrats argue that measures the government has taken, including border controls, are already reducing irregular migration significantly. The Greens want a 'fair' and 'binding' distribution of asylum-seekers in Europe. And what about Ukraine? Germany is Ukraine's top military supplier in Europe and its biggest after the United States. All three leading contenders pledge continued aid, but there are differences of emphasis. Scholz says he wants Germany to remain the biggest supplier in Europe but is touting his 'prudence' in ensuring that the war doesn't expand into a conflict between Russia and NATO and underlining his insistence that he won't supply long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv. The Union and the Greens have been more open to sending the long-range missiles. The Union wants to set up a 'contact group' with France, Poland and the U.K. to consult with the United States on a strategy to support Ukraine and provide 'credible security guarantees.' Current polls suggest it's likely that at least two of the Union, Social Democrats and Greens will end up having to govern together. 'We want to become so strong in this election ... that others have to ask themselves whether they are prepared to work together with us, and we aren't the ones who have to adapt to others and run after them,' Merz said Tuesday.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-election-scholz-merz-habeck-programs-69a8ab1bdef26764f4f10789b081ef39	2024-12-17T05:32:27-08:00	
Father and stepmother sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a 10-year-old girl in England	LONDON (AP) — The father and stepmother of a severely abused 10-year-old girl found dead in her home in England were sentenced Tuesday to life in prison for murder. Urfan Sharif, 42, and Beinash Batool, 30, were convicted of murder last week in her death in what prosecutors called a 'campaign of abuse.' The girl's uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, was found guilty of causing or allowing the girl’s death. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. After the girl died, the three fled to Pakistan, where Urfan Sharif phoned U.K. police to say he 'legally punished her, and she died,' prosecutors said. He said he 'beat her up too much' but didn't intend to kill her. Police in London then went to the family's home and discovered Sara’s body under a blanket in a bunk bed on Aug. 10, 2023. The three returned to Britain more than a month after they fled and were arrested on suspicion of murder. The trial in the Central Criminal Court exposed horrific details of abuse that included more than 70 fresh injuries and many older ones, including bruising, burns, fractures and bite marks and raised questions about failures by social services and authorities to intervene and protect her. 'Sara’s death was the culmination of years of neglect, frequent assaults and what can only be described as the torture of this small child,' Justice John Cavanagh said. 'The degree of cruelty is almost inconceivable. ... None of you have shown a shred of true remorse.' Politicians and other officials have called for a review of what went wrong and urged reforms to prevent a repeat of such cases. 'Her death is a heartbreaking reminder of the profound weaknesses in our child protection system that, as a country, we have failed time and time again to correct,' Rachel de Souza, children’s commissioner for England, said in a statement after the trial. 'We have been here before — and each time we have said ‘never again.’' Following the trial, family court records were released showing that Urfan Sharif and his former wife, Olga Sharif, had been on the social services' radar three years before Sara Sharif was born. The father and stepmother got custody of Sara and her older brother after reports that their mother abused them. Despite accusations that Urfan Sharif was physically abusing his children, the accusations were never tested in court. Surrey County Council, which raised repeated concerns that Sara was likely to be physically and emotionally abused by her parents, plans to review the circumstances of her death. Child services had investigated after her school reported Sara was bruised but the agency took no further action. Her father later took her out of school to prevent authorities from discovering the abuse, the judge said. She was not schooled at home. Olga Sharif called her daughter’s killers cowards, sadists and executioners, in a statement read by a prosecutor. 'I can’t understand how someone can be such a sadist to a child,' she said. 'She is now an angel who looks down on us from heaven, she is no longer experiencing violence.' During the trial, Sharif initially blamed Batool for Sara’s death but later told jurors he took 'full responsibility.' He admitted throttling her with his hands and battering her with a cricket bat and other objects. The prosecution said the violence became so normalized that no one reacted when she appeared with bruises at a family barbecue. Her parents made her wear a hijab — not for religious reasons but to 'cover up the bruises that were all over Sara’s body,' Cavanagh said. Sara was described as feisty and dreamed of being a fairy tale princess. Her spirit came across in a video taken two days before her death showing her dancing at home, despite multiple broken bones and iron burns on her bottom. 'Despite everything, she smiled at the camera,' the judge noted.	https://apnews.com/article/sara-sharif-uk-pakistan-murder-ccae590bef7cb52f4f4d658a2527a110	2024-12-17T04:08:45-08:00	
Anti-whaling activist Paul Watson is released after 5 months in a Greenland prison	LONDON (AP) — Anti-whaling activist Paul Watson was freed from prison in Greenland on Tuesday and will not be extradited to Japan after five months in custody. He is planning to return home to be reunited with his family during the festive season, he told The Associated Press upon his release. 'I’m certainly quite relieved,' Watson, 74, said during a video interview from Nuuk, Greenland's capital. 'This gives me an opportunity to return home to my two children before Christmas.' Japan had asked Denmark to extradite Watson, who had been in custody in Greenland since his arrest under a Japanese warrant. There was no immediate comment from the Japanese Embassy in Copenhagen. Watson's foundation said he faced a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison in Japan, which does not have an extradition treaty with Denmark. On his way back to France, where he has settled, Watson said he will be careful not to be caught again. 'I have to make sure that I don’t land in Iceland or another country where Interpol might try to have me arrested again,' he said. 'Apparently, the red notice is still there,' he added, in a reference to the system which flags people deemed fugitives to law enforcement worldwide and is one of the crime-fighting organization's most important tools. The Canadian-American citizen is a former head of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, whose high seas confrontations with whaling vessels have drawn support from celebrities and featured in the reality television series 'Whale Wars.' Japan’s coast guard had sought his arrest over an encounter with a Japanese whaling research ship in 2010 when he was accused of obstructing the crew’s official duties by ordering the captain of his ship to throw explosives at the whaling ship. Watson denied the accusation. 'Well, it’s a total fabrication. We never used explosives. Ever. We did use stink bombs, which are quite harmless,' he said. Watson was subject to an Interpol red notice, and the captain — a New Zealand citizen — was convicted of assault and given a suspended prison term, which allowed him to leave Japan. Watson was arrested on July 21 when his ship docked in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital. Japan had asked Denmark to hand over Watson so he could be tried in Japan. Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark. 'I think it all backfired on Japan, because this has put enormous focus on Japan’s continued illegal whaling operations,' Watson said. 'So my time here for five months has actually served a purpose. It’s been an opportunity to continue to expose Japan’s illegal whaling activities.' The Danish Justice Ministry said in a statement that the conditions for extradition were met, but it had not received adequate guarantees from Japanese authorities that the time Watson had already served in custody would be counted against any sentence he would receive in Japan. Watson left Sea Shepherd in 2022 to set up his foundation, which alleged at the time of his arrest that the action was politically motivated — and called for his release. He was detained in Germany in 2012 on a Costa Rican extradition warrant but skipped bail after learning that he was also sought for extradition by Japan, which has accused him of endangering whalers’ lives during his operations in the Antarctic Ocean. He has since lived in countries including France and the United States. He pledged to continue fighting. 'I’ve had five months of not really doing much, so I’m not really tired,' he said. 'But we have a ship, being prepared, to oppose Icelandic whaling operations in June next year. And we have a ship in Australia that is ready to intervene against Japan if they return to the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary. So we’re prepared to take action when we need to.' Japan's says whale meat is part of its food culture and that it supports sustainable use of whales. Japan withdrew from the International Whaling Commission in 2019 and has since resumed commercial whaling within its exclusive economic zone. 'Whaling only continues to exist in Japan through massive subsidies,' Watson claimed. 'In fact, $30 million from the tsunami relief fund was channeled into the whaling industry after 2011. So, you know, this does not benefit the Japanese people at all in any way, shape or form. In fact, what it is is an embarrassment to the Japanese people.' ___ Associated Press Writers Jamey Keaten and David Keyton contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/denmark-paul-watson-extradition-release-7e84fd63fb5cbfcdff21f6e575d9ba5f	2024-12-17T03:25:57-08:00	
From water destruction to deadly heat, Associated Press photographers capture climate change in 2024	After heat records were smashed and a torrent of extreme weather events rocked countless countries in 2023, some climate scientists believed that the waning of the El Nino weather pattern could mean 2024 would be slightly cooler. It didn’t happen that way. This year is expected to break 2023’s global average temperature record and the effects of the warming — more powerful hurricanes, floods, wildfires and suffocating heat — have upended lives and livelihoods. All year, Associated Press photographers around the globe have captured moments, from the brutality unleashed during extreme weather events to human resilience in the face of hardship, that tell the story of a changing Earth. January: Experiencing a changing world As seas rise, salty ocean water of the Pacific encroaches on Vietnam’s Mekong Delta, hurting agriculture and the farmers and sellers who rely on it. Life for those on the Mekong now – paddling across markets and working and sleeping from houseboats – is quickly being altered. In Tahiti, the arrival of the Paris Olympics this year meant giant structures were built on one of their most precious reefs. The reefs sustain the life of sea creatures and in turn, the people of the island. February: Farming against tougher odds In many parts of the world, there were impacts when agriculture intersected with climate change. In Spain and other European countries, farmers were upset over increasing energy and fertilizer costs, cheaper farm imports entering the European Union and pesticide regulations, arguing all these changes could force them out of business. In Kenya, access to water continued to be a struggle for many, while fishers off the Indian coast of Mumbai had to contend with a rapidly warming Arabian Sea. There were bright spots, however, such as the increasing use of natural farming techniques that are more resistant to climate shocks. March: Struggling to get water More than 2 billion people around the world don’t have access to safely managed drinking water, according to the United Nations, a grim reality experienced in so many places. In Brazil, some residents collected water as it came down a mountain, while in India others filled up jugs from a street drain. Drinking from such sources can lead to many waterborne illnesses. April: Fighting to thrive For the Ojibwe tribe in the United States, spearfishing is an important tradition, one they maintained this year in the face of climate change. At the same time, in other parts of the world the impact of climate change was so severe that simply surviving was the best hope. Such was the case in Kenya, where floods took lives and forced many to evacuate, and in an Indian village where flooding is so constant that residents are constantly displaced. May: Getting forced from home When heavy rains led to massive flooding in Uruguay and Brazil, residents were forced from their homes. In both of these places, most people likely returned and were able to rebuild their lives. In other places, there was no going back. Such was the case for Quinault Indian Nation in the U.S., in the process of being relocated inland as coastal erosion threaten their homes. The Gardi Sugdub island off the coast of Panama faced a similar fate — hundreds of families are relocating to the mainland as sea levels rise. June: Suffering from heat From Mexico to Pakistan and beyond, high temperatures hit people hard. Unable to find relief, some sweated profusely while others ended up hospitalized. Many would die, such as in Saudi Arabia, where heat related illnesses killed more than 1,300 during the annual hajj pilgrimage. The heat didn't just impact people, but also oceans and animals, putting at risk some of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, such as Ecuador's Galapagos Islands. July: California burning Rising temperatures and prolonged droughts create conditions for more and longer burning wildfires. One of the places that is consistently hard hit is the U.S. state of California. This year was no exception. Wildfires burned more than 1 million acres, chewed through hundreds of homes and led thousands of people to evacuate. As happens in every fire, countless animals also perished or were forced from their habitats. August: Mother nature shining through For all the destruction that climate change caused in 2024, mother nature showed off its beauty. That was on display at Churchill, Manitoba, a northern Canadian town that revels in its unofficial title as polar bear capital of the world. Like every year, tourists enjoyed stunning views of the Hudson Bay, watched beluga whales swim and, of course, came into contact with polar bears. September: Raging waters Water is central for humans and animals, but it can also take lives and leave a path of destruction. It did both in 2024. The scenes were shocking: students in India using rope to cross a flooded street, a little girl in Cuba floating in a container and Nigerians wading through floodwaters after a dam collapsed in the wake of heavy rains. October: Experiencing extremes Throughout the year, there was way too much water in some places and not enough in others, increasingly common as climate change alters natural weather patterns. In the Sahara Desert in Morocco, heavy rain left sand dunes with pools of water. By contrast, the Amazon region in South America, normally lush as a largely tropical area, experienced severe drought. November: Astonishing destruction Around the world, numerous storms unleashed powerful winds and dumped large amounts of water. The result: buildings and homes that looked like they had been hit with a wrecking ball, clothes and other household goods caked in mud and scattered on the ground, and residents walking through floodwaters. December: Looking to 2025 As the end of 2024 approached, the arrival of winter in the Northern Hemisphere meant relief from the heat in the form of cold temperatures and idyllic scenes like snow-frosted trees. But there were also reminders that global warming had already altered Earth so much that climate-driven disasters, such as raging wildfires even during winter months, are never far off.

TikTok being investigated after suspected meddling in Romania's presidential election	LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators said Tuesday they're investigating whether TikTok breached the bloc's digital rulebook by failing to deal with risks to Romania's presidential election, which has been thrown into turmoil over allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling. The European Commission is escalating its scrutiny of the popular video-sharing platform after Romania's top court canceled results of the first round of voting that resulted in an unknown far-right candidate becoming the front-runner. The court made its unprecedented decision after authorities in the European Union and NATO member country declassified documents alleging Moscow organized a sprawling social media campaign to promote a long shot candidate, Calin Georgescu. 'Following serious indications that foreign actors interfered in the Romanian presidential elections by using TikTok, we are now thoroughly investigating whether TikTok has violated the Digital Services Act by failing to tackle such risks,' European Commission president Ursula on der Leyen said in a press release. 'It should be crystal clear that in the EU, all online platforms, including TikTok, must be held accountable.' The European Commission is the 27-nation EU's executive arm and enforces the bloc's Digital Services Act, a sweeping set of regulations intended to clean up social media platforms and protect users from illegal content. It ordered TikTok earlier this month to retain all information related to the election. In the preliminary round of voting on Nov. 24 Georgescu was an outsider among the 13 candidates but ended up topping the polls. He was due to face a pro-EU reformist rival in a runoff before the court canceled the results. The declassified files alleged that there was an 'aggressive promotion campaign' to boost Georgescu's popularity, including payments worth a total of $381,000 to TikTok influencers to promote him on the platform. TikTok said it has 'protected the integrity' of its platform over 150 elections around the world and is continuing to address these 'industry-wide challenges.' 'TikTok has provided the European Commission with extensive information regarding these efforts, and we have transparently and publicly detailed our robust actions,' it said in a statement. The commission said its investigation will focus on TikTok's content recommendation systems, especially on risks related to 'coordinated inauthentic manipulation or automated exploitation.' It's also looking at TikTok's policies on political advertisements and 'paid-for political content.' TikTok said it doesn't accept paid political ads and 'proactively' removes content for violating policies on misinformation. The investigation could result in TikTok making changes to fix any problems, or in fines worth up to 6% of the company's total global revenue.	https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-romania-european-union-election-0638e90cb3898fc61619e8aed4731a53	2024-12-17T02:49:36-08:00	
Authorities impose overnight curfew in cyclone-ravaged Mayotte as France rushes in aid	SAINT-DENIS, Reunion (AP) — An overnight curfew goes into force Tuesday evening as authorities try to stabilize Mayotte in the aftermath of Cyclone Chido, the most intense storm to hit the French Indian Ocean archipelago in 90 years. The French military said it is sending four to five planes a day with up to 50 tons of assistance, including food, water and medicine. Hundreds of military personnel have arrived in Mayotte since the weekend. The official death toll from Saturday's cyclone rose to 22, with more than 1,400 people injured including 48 critically, according to the latest report from Mayotte Hospital quoted by Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, the mayor of the capital, Mamoudzou. However, authorities fear hundreds and possibly thousands of people have died. 'The priority today is water and food,' Soumaila told RFI radio, adding that 'there are people who have unfortunately died where the bodies are starting to decompose that can create a sanitary problem. The curfew requires people to stay in their homes between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. each night as authorities try to prevent looting of damaged buildings. 'We don’t have electricity. When night falls, there are people who take advantage of that situation,' Soumaila said. Speaking on France Inter radio Tuesday morning, Mayotte lawmaker Estelle Youssouffa described the challenges in accounting for victims, especially among undocumented migrants. 'The real toll of those swept away by the mud, winds and tin from shanty towns will never be known,' Youssouffa said. 'This population, by definition undocumented migrants, are the main victims of this tragedy because they feared going to shelters.' Youssouffa shared a harrowing account from an imam she spoke to on Monday, who reported burying more than 30 people in a single day in La Vigie, a makeshift settlement. 'I don’t even know if these figures are included in the official count,' Youssouffa said. Soumaila, Mamoudzou’s mayor, said he planned to visit areas hit hardest by the cyclone on Tuesday, where survivors are still reeling from the destruction. Nearly 70% of Mayotte’s population has been gravely affected, with entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble. Aid efforts continue, with French military aircraft delivering water and food daily. However, power outages and communication disruptions persist, leaving many without basic necessities. The island’s main hospital remains severely damaged, and a field hospital is expected to arrive Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to visit Mayotte soon and to declare a national mourning period. Meanwhile, an initial 655,000 euros ($687,000) was released by a government decree to finance urgent needs on the island. Cyclone Chido is the deadliest storm to strike the territory in nearly a century, underscoring the vulnerability of the island’s impoverished population. The hurricane is also threatening to deepen the political crisis on the French mainland. Less than a week after taking office, newly appointed Prime Minister François Bayrou has come under heavy criticism from across the political spectrum for his perceived mishandling of the emergency. Bayrou did not travel to Mayotte and did not attend in person a crisis meeting, opting instead to chair a town hall meeting in the city of Pau, where he is the mayor. Bayrou took part in the crisis meeting via video. Bayrou responded that the interior minister was in Mayotte and that the two were taking decisions together. He insisted he is busy trying to form a government. Bayrou was appointed prime minister by Macron last week after a historic parliamentary vote toppled the previous government. —— Nouvian reported from Paris. —— AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mayotte-france-cyclone-chido-50f0478e0dc3d402245941330b2fbd65	2024-12-17T02:15:50-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strike in Gaza kills at least 8 from the same family, Palestinians say	An Israeli strike in Gaza killed at least eight people from the same family, most of them women and children, Palestinian medics said Tuesday. The strike late Monday hit a house in Gaza City’s central neighborhood of Daraj, according to the Health Ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. Among the bodies recovered from the rubble were a father and his three children, and the children’s grandmother, according to a casualty list obtained by The Associated Press. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike. Israeli bombardment and offensives in Gaza have killed more than 45,000 Palestinians over the past 14 months, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry’s tally does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but it says more than of half the dead were women and children. Israel launched its campaign in retaliation for Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others, around 100 of whom remain in captivity. ___ Here's the latest: UN investigators want to to preserve evidence of atrocities in Syria GENEVA — A U.N.-backed team investigating years of crimes in war-torn Syria says it has reached out to its new government and hopes to deploy to help gather and preserve evidence on the ground -- in hopes of bringing torturers, killers and other war criminals to justice one day. Robert Petit, head of the international, impartial and independent mechanism on Syria, said its team has reason to believe that mass graves exist across Syria, but exhumation, DNA collection and tests for cause of death require 'a lot of resources.' He provided no further details about any such mass graves. Petit said the government of former President Bashar Assad, who fled Syria on Dec. 8, didn’t cooperate with his team, and the change of authority offers a chance to establish the fates of 'tens of thousands of people' who died and suffered under his rule. The investigators, following Assad’s downfall, have told Syrian authorities of 'our willingness to engage and to go to Syria to fulfill our mandate,' he said. 'We are awaiting a response. And as soon as that response is forthcoming, we will deploy.' A 'monitoring cell' on the U.N.-backed team has collected recent images from social media, he said, while its sources on the ground have been able to collect new evidence and testimonies in the wake of Assad’s ouster. The mechanism was created in 2016 by the U.N. General Assembly to collect, preserve, consolidate and analyze evidence of 'serious crimes' committed in Syria since the civil war erupted in March 2011, Petit said. A U.N.-backed Commission of Inquiry is doing similar work. EU plans to reopen its office in Damascus BRUSSELS — The European Union plans to reopen its office in Damascus following 'constructive first contacts' between an envoy and Syria’s new representatives, the bloc’s top diplomat said on Tuesday. 'We are ready to reopen our delegation, which is the European embassy, and we want this to be fully operational,' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told EU lawmakers. A diplomat from Beirut was dispatched to Damascus on Monday for talks with representatives of the new leadership and civil society in Syria. Kallas described it as 'a very important step' that would allow for 'really constructive engagement and to have the input and information from the ground as well.' After talks in Turkey with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU also wants to 'enhance our engagement in early recovery, including basic services like electricity and water and infrastructure.' British diplomats meet leader of militant group that toppled Assad LONDON — British diplomats have met the leader of the militant group that toppled Syrian leader Bashar Assad. Photographs posted by the group on social media showed senior officials, including the U.K. special representative for Syria, Ann Snow, meeting Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Mohammed al-Golani, in Damascus on Monday. Foreign Secretary David Lammy confirmed Monday that Britain had sent 'a delegation of senior U.K. officials to Damascus this week for meetings with the new Syrian authorities and members of civil society groups.' Britain, along with the U.S. and other countries, classifies HTS, a former al-Qaida affiliate, as a terrorist organization. U.K. officials have suggested they may reconsider that designation, but have not given a timeline. They say British officials can still talk to HST in the meantime. In an interview with the Times of London newspaper, Al-Sharaa urged the West to lift sanctions and said Israel should stop its strikes on Syria. 'We do not want any conflict whether with Israel or anyone else and we will not let Syria be used as a launchpad for attacks,' he was quoted as saying. 'The Syrian people need a break, and the strikes must end and Israel has to pull back to its previous positions.' An Israeli strike in Gaza kills at least 8 from same family, Palestinians say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike in Gaza killed at least eight people from the same family, most of them women and children, Palestinian medics said Tuesday. The strike late Monday hit a house in Gaza City’s central neighborhood of Daraj, according to the Health Ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. Rescuers recovered the bodies of eight people including two women and four children from under the rubble, it said. Among the dead were a father and his three children, and the children’s grandmother, according to a casualty list obtained by The Associated Press. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike. German diplomats will hold their first talks with the new Syrian government BERLIN — Germany says its diplomats will hold their first talks on Tuesday with the new Syrian government installed by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS. The Foreign Ministry in Berlin said the talks will center on an 'inclusive transition process' in Syria and the protection of minorities. The German delegation also plans to sound out the possibility of a German diplomatic presence in Damascus, and will meet representatives of Christian communities among others. The ministry said in a statement that 'we know where HTS comes from and know its origins in al-Qaida ideology,' and said that Germany is watching the activities of the group and the interim government closely. 'As far as can be said at all at this point, they are acting prudently so far,' it added. 'Like our international partners, we will measure them by their actions. Any cooperation requires that ethnic and religious minorities be protected and women’s rights respected.' The U.S. has already said that its officials have been in direct contact with HTS. Germany has been a leading destination for Syrian refugees over the past decade. Mediation efforts in northern Syria fail to reach a permanent truce, US-backed force says DAMASCUS, Syria — A U.S.-backed force in Syria says U.S.-led mediation efforts have failed to reach a permanent truce in Syria's north between the force's fighters and Turkish-backed gunmen. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said the failure to end the fighting in the northern areas of Manbij and Kobani were unsuccessful due to Turkey’s unwillingness to accept key points. 'Despite U.S. efforts to stop the war, Turkey and its mercenary militias have continued to escalate over the last period,' the SDF said. The failure of the mediation is expected to lead to a new round of fighting between the SDF and the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army in the areas of Kobani. US military says it bombed a Houthi military facility in Yemen’s capital CAIRO — The U.S. military on Tuesday said it bombed a Houthi military facility in Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, the latest U.S.-led attack on the Iranian-backed rebels. The Houthi media office said the strike hit part of the sprawling complex that houses the rebels’ Defense Ministry. There were no immediate reports of casualties. U.S. Central Command said the strike late Monday targeted a key command and control facility that was 'a hub for coordinating Houthi operations,' including attacks on U.S. Navy and merchant vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza started in October last year. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign, which has killed four sailors. The rebels have maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. Monday’s U.S. strike came hours after the Houthis said they fired a hypersonic ballistic missile toward Israel. The Houthi missile triggered sirens across the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. The Israeli military said it intercepted the missile outside Israel’s borders. However, shrapnel that the military said was likely from an Israeli interceptor missile fell on the roof of a home in east Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-17-december-2024-3df6c0a90a0d58efc30e4b5f7143c96f	2024-12-16T22:37:54-08:00

Political strife erupts over South Korean court as it is set to determine the fate of impeached Yoon	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s acting leader vowed Tuesday to convey to the world that things are back to normal following parliament’s impeachment of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, but rival parties began squabbling over the mechanics of a court ruling to determine whether to formally unseat or reinstate him. The country’s liberal opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach Yoon last Saturday over his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law imposition, suspending his presidential powers until the Constitutional Court determines whether to uphold or overturn the decision. If Yoon is dismissed, a national election must be held to pick his successor within two months. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became acting leader, has taken steps to reassure the U.S. and other countries and stabilize markets. Presiding over a Cabinet Council meeting on Tuesday, Han said he will 'continuously do my utmost to inform the international society that Republic of Korea is fast regaining stability and maintain confidence with partners.' But the country’s intense political strife appears to be far from over, as the rival parties began bickering over whether to fill three vacant justices’ seats at the Constitutional Court. To formally end Yoon’s presidency, the nine-member court panel needs support from at least six justices. But since three seats remain vacant following retirements, a unanimous decision in favor of Yoon's impeachment is required to throw him out of office for good. Three of the court’s nine justices are directly appointed by the president. Three others are nominated by the Supreme Court head and another three by the National Assembly, and their formal appointments by the president has widely been a formality. The three seats that are currently open are to be nominated by the National Assembly — two by the Democratic Party and the other by Yoon’s ruling People Power Party. The court can rule on Yoon’s case only with the current six justices. But the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which led the impeachment efforts against Yoon, has said it would speed up the process of restoring the court’s nine-justice system to promote fairness and public confidence in its ruling. But PPP floor leader Kweon Seong-dong, a Yoon loyalist, created a stir Tuesday as he voiced his objection to a Democratic Party push to fill the three vacancies. He said it would be inappropriate for Han, the acting leader, to appoint justices nominated by parliament, saying such authorities solely rest with the president. 'An acting president can appoint Constitutional Court justices when there is a presidential vacancy, but not when the president’s duties are just suspended,' Kweon said. Many observers say the court’s current six-member configuration is advantageous for Yoon’s chances to return to office, as it would only require a single justice rejecting the parliament impeachment. They note Cheong Hyungsik, one of the six justices, is a clear conservative who was directly appointed by Yoon. The Democratic Party quickly dismissed Kweon’s argument as 'absurd and utterly nonsensical' and urged PPP to abide by a November agreement between the rival parties to nominate the three Constitutional Court justices. Party lawmaker and spokesperson Jo Seoung-lae said PPP has 'blatantly revealed their true intention to obstruct the constitutional trial.' There was no immediate response from Han, who during the Cabinet meeting stressed that the government will cooperate with the ruling and opposition parties to stabilize the economy. There is no clear definition about what an acting president can and cannot do over the appointments of court justices. The Democratic party accuses PPP of trying to drag out the impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court, which has up to 180 days to determine Yoon's fate. Time is a crucial issue for Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who is favored by polls to win a presidential by-election in the event of Yoon’s ouster but grapples with his own legal troubles. Lee could possibly be prohibited from running for president if the appellate and Supreme courts uphold his lower court conviction for election law violation in November. Yoon faces allegations of rebellion and abuse of power over his martial law introduction. Investigative authorities want him to appear for questioning later this week, but officials at Yoon's office and residence on Monday refused to receive requests for his appearance. The martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, drew hundreds of troops who tried to encircle parliament and prevent lawmakers from voting on the decree. Many lawmakers still managed to get inside a National Assembly chamber and voted to overturn Yoon's decree unanimously, forcing Yoon's Cabinet to lift it. Yoon's decree, which harkened back to an era of past military-backed dictatorships, has sparked massive street protests calling for his ouster and resulted in his approval rating plummeting. Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have been arrested over their roles in the martial law enforcement. Supporters of Yoon worry that his early exit would severely hamper the country's conservatives and cause them to likely lose a presidential by-election to the liberals, like they did in 2017, when then-impeached conservative President Park Geun-hye was ousted and arrested over a corruption scandal.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-constitutional-court-2917db5da7c461ef3eb732e17f938114	2024-12-16T21:02:53-08:00	
Militants attack police post in northwest Pakistan, killing 2 officers and wounding 3	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Militants on a motorcycle opened fire Tuesday at a police post in restive northwest Pakistan, killing at least two officers and wounding three others before fleeing the scene, officials said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in Shangla, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan. Local police officer Nasir Khan said the wounded officers were transported to a nearby hospital. In a statement, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack and offered his condolences to the families of the slain officers. He said 'khwarij' — a term used for Pakistani Taliban — were behind the attack. Naqvi gave no further details. Pakistan in recent months has witnessed a surge in militant attacks, most blamed on separatists in the southwest Balochistan province and Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP. While the TTP is an ally of the Afghan Taliban who seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, it's a separate group. In November, a suicide bomber killed 12 security personnel and wounded several others after detonating an explosive-laden vehicle at a security post in Bannu, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-militant-attack-police-post-restive-northwest-bf94bbd80b1b69238cf9d16709afb61c	2024-12-16T20:32:06-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed after Nasdaq sets a record ahead of Fed meeting	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares were mixed in Asia on Tuesday after the Nasdaq set a record ahead of a meeting by the Federal Reserve later this week that could set the direction for markets in the new year. U.S. futures were higher and oil prices fell. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index gained 0.2% to 39,528.23, helped by gains in technology shares including SoftBank Group Corp., whose CEO Masayoshi Son joined President-elect Donald Trump in announcing plans Monday by the Japanese technology and telecoms giant to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. SoftBank's U.S. listed shares closed 0.6% higher. Chinese markets slid further, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index losing 0.4% to 19,725.08. The Shanghai Composite index shed 0.6% to 3,366.89. Investors have appeared disappointed over Beijing's latest announcements about policies aimed at buttressing economic growth and encouraging more consumer demand. 'In China, recent disappointing data continues to pressure domestic policymakers to intensify their policy stimulus to invigorate domestic demand,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. South Korea's Kospi sank 1% to 2,465.76 as authorities were pushing to summon impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree of last week. The country's Constitutional Court began its first meeting Monday on Yoon’s case to determine whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.8% to 8,314.10, while the Taiex in Taiwan was up 0.2%. In Bangkok, the SET edged 0.2% lower. On Monday, U.S. stock indexes drifted amid mixed trading. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% to 6,074.08 and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2% to a record close of 20,173.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, giving up 0.3% to 43,717.48. Broadcom leaped 11.2% to help lead the S&amp;P 500 for a second straight day after delivering a profit report last week that beat analysts’ expectations thanks to the wave of enthusiasm about its artificial-intelligence offerings. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will announce its last move on interest rates for the year. The widespread expectation is that it will cut its main rate for a third straight time, as it tries to boost the slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%. The question is how much more it will cut rates next year, and Fed officials will release projections for where they see the federal funds rate ending 2025, along with other economic indicators, once their meeting concludes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions in a press conference following the meeting. Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&amp;P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times so far this year and is heading for one of its best years of the millennium. The economy has held up better than many feared, continuing to grow even after the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to a two-decade high in hopes of grinding down on inflation, which topped 9% two summers ago. On Wall Street, MicroStrategy jumped as much as 7% during the day as it continues to benefit from the surging price for bitcoin, which set another all-time high on Monday of over $107,000, according to CoinDesk. It was trading at $106,870 early Tuesday. Bitcoin’s price has catapulted from roughly $44,000 at the start of the year on expectations that Trump will favor digital currencies. Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.39% on Monday from 4.40% late Friday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, eased to 4.24% from 4.25%. In other dealings early Tuesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 12 cents to $70.59 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 4 cents to $73.48 per barrel. The U.S. dollar fell to 154.05 Japanese yen from 154.14 yen. The euro was nearly unchanged at $1.0514. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-fed-softbank-017d11af3f82972d2ae80e8d229fe3e3	2024-12-16T19:12:51-08:00	
Australian state proposes ban on protests at places of worship to fight rising antisemitism	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An Australian state government on Tuesday proposed new restrictions on protesters in response to rising antisemitism, including a ban on demonstrations outside places of worship. Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan proposed the new laws after arsonists damaged a Melbourne synagogue this month and protestors kept fearful worshippers trapped inside a Sydney synagogue for three hours a week earlier. 'That’s not peaceful protest. It’s menacing behavior,' Allan said. 'Antisemitism is a cancer and we must leave no stone unturned to fight the evil of antisemitism, to fight the evil of this racism in all of its forms and also to continue to work to help heal our multicultural community, to help build on that social cohesion and continue to support our strong, united Victoria,' she added. The new laws would protect the right of people to 'gather and pray free from fear, harassment and intimidation,' her office said in a statement. The proposed laws, which will be voted on by the state legislature early next year, would establish safe access areas around places of worship and prohibit disturbances of religious gatherings. The laws would also ban protesters flying flags and displaying symbols of groups listed by Australia as terrorist organizations. Face masks used by protesters to conceal their identities and protect against capsicum spray would also be banned. The arson attack on Adass Israel Synagogue on Dec. 6 marked an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and the militant Hamas group started over a year ago in the Gaza Strip. Authorities have declared it a terrorist act, which increases resources available to investigators. A federal law passed in January banned the Nazi salute and the public display of Nazi symbols in response to growing antisemitism, and the government appointed special envoys this year to combat antisemitism and Islamophobia. Australia is an increasingly multicultural society. The latest census in 2021 found that Australians born overseas or with a parent born overseas formed a majority for the first time.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-antisemitism-law-places-worship-0df991f4df85c68a4b9cc49d8ec2c6d2	2024-12-16T17:56:35-08:00	
Magnitude 7.3 earthquake hits Pacific island nation of Vanuatu	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck Tuesday just off the coast of Vanuatu in the South Pacific Ocean, the USGS said. The quake occurred at a depth of 57 kilometers (35 miles) and was centered 30 kilometers (10 miles) west of Port Vila, the largest city in the island nation. The jolt was followed by a magnitude 5.5 aftershock near the same location. It was not immediately clear whether it caused any damage, but Vanuatu government websites were offline in the aftermath of the quake and phone numbers for the police and other public agencies did not connect. The USGS warned of tsunami waves for some coasts on Vanuatu, a group of 80 islands that is home to about 330,000 people. Waves could reach 0.3 meters to 1 meter (1 to 3 feet) above the tide level, the agency said. Some islands in the low-lying atoll nation are 3 feet above sea level. The USGS also warned of tsunami waves registering less than 0.3 meters (1 foot) above the tide level for a number of nearby Pacific islands including Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Solomon Islands.	https://apnews.com/article/vanuatu-pacific-earthquake-ocean-3e4cc1e02bc0ec62d5931b00286688ed	2024-12-16T17:42:06-08:00	
Trump says it was 'stupid' for Biden to let Ukraine use US weapons to strike deeper into Russia	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he may reverse President Joe Biden's recent decision to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory. Trump called the decision made by Biden last month 'stupid.' He also expressed anger that his incoming administration was not consulted before Biden made the move. With the loosening of the restrictions, Biden gave Ukraine long-sought permission to use the Army Tactical Missile System provided by the U.S. to strike Russian positions hundreds miles from its border. 'I don’t think that should have been allowed, not when there’s a possibility — certainly not just weeks before I take over,' Trump said during at a wide-ranging news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort. 'Why would they do that without asking me what I thought? I wouldn’t have had him do that. I think it was a big mistake.' Trump's withering criticism of the Biden administration's move comes as the Democratic administration aims to push every last dollar already designated for Ukraine out the door to help repel Russia's invasion before Trump takes office on Jan. 20, with future aid uncertain. But even as Biden tries to surge weaponry and other aid to Ukraine in his final five weeks in office, the moment underscored that it's Trump who holds the most significant influence over how Ukraine can use its U.S.-provided arsenal in the long run. It’s a critical piece of leverage he could use to try to follow through on his campaign pledge to bring about a swift end to the conflict. Asked if he would consider reversing the Biden administration decision, Trump responded: 'I might. I think it was a very stupid thing to do.' The White House pushed back on Trump’s criticism, noting that the decision was made after months of deliberations that started before last month’s election. 'All I can assure you is that in the conversations we’ve had with them since the election, and we’ve had at various levels, we have articulated to them the logic behind it, the thinking behind it, why we were doing it,' White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said of the current administration's coordination with the outgoing administration. Trump's relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. Trump publicly sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence officials on whether Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to help him, and Trump has praised the Russian leader and even called him 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine. Vice President-elect JD Vance has said that while the U.S. has differences with Russia, it was counterproductive to approach Moscow as an enemy. Trump on Monday reiterated his call on both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war, calling the death and despair caused by the conflict 'carnage.' But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that finding an immediate endgame to the war — something he has previously said he could get done within 24 hours of taking office — could be difficult. 'I think the Middle East will be in a good place,' Trump said, referring to the conflict in Gaza and an unsettled Syria following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad. 'I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation.' Trump declined to say whether he has spoken with Putin since the election. Zelenskyy met with Trump in Paris earlier this month, while the president-elect was visiting France for the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials have been making a forceful effort to get Trump to maintain support for Ukraine. But the situation on the ground in Ukraine continues to remain complicated as both sides wrestle for a battlefield advantage that will give them leverage in any negotiations to end the nearly three-year war. The Pentagon last week unveiled U.S. intelligence that predicts Russia could again launch its lethal new intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine soon. Putin deployed the missile for the first time last month days after Biden loosened the restrictions on Ukraine. Putin warned the West that Russia's next use could be against Ukraine’s NATO allies who allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Biden agreed to loosen the restrictions after Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters had pressed Biden for months. They argued that the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids. The outgoing president ultimately made the decision last month amid concerns about Russia deploying thousands of North Korean troops to help it claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-atacms-f3ca80252ea2812b6ab4f6844f7ecd23	2024-12-16T14:58:16-08:00	
Two charged in connection with Iran-backed drone strike that killed 3 US troops in the Middle East	BOSTON (AP) — Two men, including a dual Iranian American citizen, have been charged with conspiring to export sensitive technology to Iran that was used in a drone attack in Jordan that killed three American troops early this year and injured dozens of other service members, the Justice Department said Monday. The pair were arrested after FBI specialists who analyzed the drone traced its navigation system to an Iranian company operated by one of the defendants, who relied on parts and technology funneled into the country by his alleged co-conspirator, prosecutors said. 'We often cite hypothetical risk when we talk about the dangers of American technology getting into dangerous hands,' U.S. Attorney Joshua Levy, the top federal prosecutor in Massachusetts, said at a news conference announcing the charges. 'Unfortunately, in this situation, we are not speculating.' The defendants were identified as Mahdi Mohammad Sadeghi, who prosecutors say works at a Massachusetts-based semiconductor company, and Mohammad Abedininajafabadi, who was arrested Monday in Italy as the Justice Department seeks his extradition to Massachusetts. Prosecutors allege that Abedininajafabadi, who was also called Adedini in court documents, has deep connections to the Iranian government. They say his Tehran-based company manufactures navigation systems for the military drone program of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and that he conspired with Sadeghi to circumvent American export control laws, including through the creation of a front company in Switzerland, and procure sensitive technology into Iran. Sadeghi, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested Monday in Massachusetts and was ordered to remain detained following a court appearance. His lawyer did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Both men are charged with export control violations, and Abedini separately faces charges of conspiring to provide material support to Iran. Three Georgia soldiers — Sgt. William Jerome Rivers of Carrollton, Sgt. Breonna Moffett of Savannah and Sgt. Kennedy Sanders of Waycross — were killed in the Jan. 28 drone attack on a U.S. outpost in northeastern Jordan called Tower 22. U.S. officials have blamed it on the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias that includes Kataib Hezbollah. In the attack, the one-way attack drone may have been mistaken for a U.S. drone that was expected to return back to the logistics base about the same time and was not shot down. Instead, it crashed into living quarters, killing the three soldiers and injuring more than 40. 'To the people who were injured by this attack, to the loved ones and family members of the people who lost their lives, as the son of a combat veteran I humbly hope that today’s charges bring some measure of justice and accountability,' Levy said. Tower 22 held about 350 U.S. military personnel at the time. It is strategically located between Jordan and Syria, only 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Iraqi border, and in the months just after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and Israel’s blistering response in Gaza, Iranian-backed militias intensified their attacks on U.S. military locations in the region. Following the attack, the U.S. launched a huge counterstrike against 85 sites in Iraq and Syria used by Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Iranian-backed militia and bolstered Tower 22’s defenses. ____ Tucker and Copp reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-jordan-drone-justice-department-georgia-8b5a0d927c93998ec84909a252de52d6	2024-12-16T13:50:40-08:00	
Bolivian prosecutors seek the arrest of former President Morales in sexual abuse case	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Prosecutors in Bolivia on Monday sought the arrest of former President Evo Morales in connection to a sexual abuse investigation involving his alleged fathering of a child with a 15-year-old girl. The arrest warrant, which still must be approved by a judge, was issued after Morales defied an order to testify in the case. Morales, a former coca grower who ruled Bolivia for 13 years until 2019, has been holed up in the rural area of Chapare, ringed by loyal supporters, since talk of his arrest first surfaced in September. Morales, 65, is alleged to have had a child with a teenage girl in 2016 — a sexual relationship that would have constituted statutory rape under Bolivian law. Morales hasn't commented yet on the arrest order but previously denied any wrongdoing and accused his handpicked successor, fellow leftist Luis Arce, of conspiring with his enemies to prevent him from running in next year's presidential election. 'It's a dark plan to eliminate me politically and physically,' Morales said previously. On Monday, police were repelled in a standoff with Morales supporters, who accused the authorities of acting violently. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-evo-morales-arrest-order-5f0931c989431172642a1559dffbc01a	2024-12-16T13:37:53-08:00	
Negotiators say Israel and Hamas are inching toward a ceasefire deal. This is what it may look like	After months of deadlock, Israel and Hamas appear to be moving closer toward a ceasefire to end their 14-month war. Top officials from the U.S., Qatar and Egypt have resumed their mediation efforts in recent weeks and reported greater willingness by the warring sides to wrap up a deal. In a key concession, Hamas officials say they are prepared to show more 'flexibility' on the timing of an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza, and Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, said Monday that a deal is closer than ever. Officials on all sides have cautioned that key details must still be worked out. But there is a general sense of optimism that has been lacking for many months. The changing sentiment appears to be the result of several factors. Israel has inflicted heavy damage on Hamas over the course of the war. The group is more isolated after Hezbollah’s ceasefire with Israel, and Iran, a key backer of both militant groups, has suffered a number of setbacks, highlighted by the downfall of its close ally, Syria’s Bashar Assad. In the U.S., both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump have signaled they want a deal completed before the Jan. 20 inauguration. According to Egyptian and Hamas officials, the agreement would take place in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of captive Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. Israel says Hamas is holding 100 hostages — over one-third of whom are believed to be dead. Here is a closer look at the emerging deal, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing closed negotiations. Preliminary ceasefire The first phase would last from six to eight weeks. During that time, Hamas would release some 30 hostages – roughly half of those believed alive. They include three or four dual U.S.-Israeli citizens. Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including as many as 100 who are serving long sentences for alleged involvement in bloody attacks. Increased aid The deal calls for a massive increase in aid to Gaza, which has plunged into a humanitarian crisis during the 14-month war. An estimated 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced, in many cases multiple times, and aid workers report severe hunger across the territory. This is expected to include a reopening of the territory’s Rafah crossing with Egypt, which has been closed since Israeli ground troops invaded the southern border town in May. The crossing is especially important because it is the primary exit point for Palestinians in Gaza who want to travel abroad, and the only one not controlled by Israel. Mediators say they are considering a return to a 2005 agreement that allowed the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority to operate the crossing with European Union observers. That agreement collapsed when Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 and expelled the Palestinian Authority forces. Israeli troop withdrawals During the first phase, Israeli troops would withdraw from some Palestinian population centers, allowing many Palestinians to begin returning home. But Israeli troops wouldn't leave Gaza altogether at this stage. They would remain along the Philadelphi corridor – a strategic strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Ending the war During the initial ceasefire, the sides would continue negotiations on a permanent agreement, to include an end to the war, full withdrawal of Israeli troops, and release of remaining hostages and bodies held by Hamas. Talks would begin on final arrangements for Gaza, including who would govern the territory and plans for rebuilding the destruction.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-ceasefire-egypt-qatar-264087c7a547031a9433ecbbdcd920d2	2024-12-16T13:13:45-08:00

26 people arrested in crackdown on illegal deforestation along Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina border	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Paraguayan authorities arrested 26 people in a crackdown on suspected illegal deforestation along the country's border with Brazil and Argentina, Interpol announced Monday. Fourteen different agencies collaborated in the mid-October sweep, which relied on border inspections, waterway surveillance and aerial monitoring of forests. Some 1,000 logs were seized, including some quebracho wood, prized for its density and high tannin content, Interpol said. Interpol said 12 companies were involved in the alleged deforestation and trafficking of native tree species, and that it identified two criminal networks. A spokesman said alleged crimes include illegal logging of various tree species, illicit trafficking of timber, use of fake documents to traffic in illegal wood, and various acts of deforestation. He said the delay in announcing the arrests was in part to allow for follow-up investigation. 'Illegal deforestation encompasses a broad spectrum of criminal activities, from document fraud to money laundering and corruption,' said Kat Henn, Interpol’s assistant director of environmental security. 'This operation highlights the urgent need for continued multi-agency and sustained cross-border cooperation to tackle the criminal networks devastating our environment for profit.' Interpol has been boosting its presence in what's called the Tri-Border area for years. The agency has said the area — with two rivers separating the states and creating many entry points — is 'conducive to a wide range of illegal activities.' ' Organized crime is increasingly making forested areas their hub of operations — not just for the cover but to illegally extract flora, fauna and mineral resources,' Gimena Sanchez, a human rights advocate at the Washington Office on Latin America, told The Associated Press. Fighting deforestation in South America 'means fighting sophisticated transnational organized crime networks,' she added. Deforestation typically results from land being converted to raise cattle or soybeans, as well as logging or mining. It leads to a slew of negative environmental impacts, including erosion, biodiversity loss, and increased risk of flooding, as well as the loss of a valuable carbon sink. Though some progress has been made in recent years to slow deforestation, especially in Brazil and Colombia, Latin America lost 138 million hectares (about 341 million acres) of forest between 1990 and 2020, according to a United Nations report. Gabriel Funari, head of the Amazon Observatory of Illicit Economies for Global Initiative, said they are seeing large transnational criminal groups that have grown through drug trafficking revenue, such as one of Brazil’s largest crime gangs, Primeiro Comando da Capital — commonly known as PCC — increasingly diversifying their investment portfolios into various illicit markets with goods that pass through the Tri-Border, like firearms, timber, wildlife and gold. In Latin America, the direct environmental harms caused by drug trafficking are much smaller than those from perceived legal industries like cattle ranching and industrial agriculture, says Bram Ebus, a consultant for Crisis Group in Latin America. 'Nevertheless, it is the drug money that is laundered through these economic activities that finances and accelerates deforestation,' he said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Palestinian security forces launch a rare crackdown on militants in the West Bank	JENIN, West Bank (AP) — Palestinian security forces have launched a rare crackdown against local militant groups in the northern West Bank, sending in armored cars and engaging in fierce gunbattles that have killed at least two people in the volatile area. The raid marks an unusual step for the Palestinian Authority, the governing body for semi-autonomous pockets in the occupied West Bank that is internationally recognized but has largely lost control of militant strongholds such as Jenin, where forces operated through the weekend and into Monday. Israeli troops have stepped into the vacuum in recent years, particularly since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militant attack that triggered the ongoing war in Gaza. Palestinian health officials say 811 Palestinians have been killed since then in the West Bank, most by Israeli raids into Palestinian cities and towns. Israel says most of the dead have been militants. On Saturday, Palestinian security forces said they had begun the operation in the Jenin refugee camp, a longtime militant stronghold. The operation was continuing Monday, with AP reporters hearing heavy gunfire and spotting at least two Palestinian armored vehicles roaming the outskirts of the camp. The U.N. humanitarian office said that security forces took over part of a hospital in Jenin, using it as a base and shooting from inside. Forces detained at least eight men, pulling one out of the hospital on a stretcher, the U.N. said. The main U.N. agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, suspended its services, including schooling. The militant groups Islamic Jihad and Hamas operate freely across Jenin, and its streets are regularly lined with posters depicting slain fighters as martyrs to the Palestinian struggle. Young men carrying walkie-talkies patrol the alleys. Israel says the militant groups are part of the Iranian 'axis of resistance.' Both groups receive funding and other support from Iran, but they are deeply rooted in Palestinian society. The security forces are 'operating according to a clear political vision' from Palestinian leadership 'on the importance of imposing order, establishing the rule of law, restoring civil peace and societal security,' spokesman Brig. Gen. Anwar Rajab said. The troops were focused on 'eradicating' Iran-backed groups that were trying to incite 'chaos and anarchy,' he added. Palestinian security forces have reported the deaths of two men in the crackdown: a 19-year-old civilian, Rabhi Shalabi, shot riding a motorcycle, and an Islamic Jihad militant, Yazi Jaayseh. Security forces, which initially denied killing Shalabi before admitting it in a statement Friday, have not said why they targeted the young man. His 15-year-old cousin, who was also on the motorcycle, was shot in the head and wounded. U.N. officials, citing local video footage, have said the pair were unarmed and delivering food from a family restaurant when they were shot, and that Shalabi raised both in the air hands before he was killed. It was not immediately clear why the Palestinian Authority decided to launch the crackdown now. Such actions are unpopular with the Palestinian public, where many accuse the Palestinian security forces of collaborating with Israel. The Israeli military said it was not involved in the operation and did not comment further. Hamas senior official Mahmoud Mardawi slammed the Palestinian Authority operating in Jenin as an 'attempt to end the resistance.' In comments released by Hamas late Monday, he urged the Palestinian Authority to immediately stop its 'unpatriotic behavior that serves the occupation.' The U.S. has sought to strengthen the Palestinian Authority, hoping it will help run the Gaza Strip after the war. White House officials declined to comment publicly on their position on the Jenin operation. Officials at the U.S. National Security Council also declined to comment. Overall, since the start of the war, the U.N. says that at least seven Palestinians have been killed by Palestinian security forces, and at least 24 Israelis have also been killed by Palestinian attackers in the West Bank.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-authority-jenin-hamas-islamic-jihad-131b0b0d82608142d979919330ab96c5	2024-12-16T11:01:38-08:00	
UN announces initiative to overcome political deadlock in Libya	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The top U.N. official in Libya announced a new initiative Monday to overcome a three-year deadlock and move the divided oil-rich North African nation toward a national election. The U.N. deputy special envoy for Libya, Stephanie Koury, told the U.N. Security Council that as a first step, the U.N. political mission in Libya known as UNSMIL intends to establish an advisory committee, with a deadline to develop options to resolve outstanding electoral issues and a road map for holding an election. 'The committee will be composed of experts and respected personalities, who are reflective of the spectrum of Libyan political forces, social, cultural and geographical components,' she said. Koury stressed that the committee isn't 'a dialogue group to take decisions,' but to generate options for follow-on action by Libyan decision-makers. Libya plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The country split, with rival administrations in the east and west backed by rogue militias and foreign governments. The country’s political crisis stems from the failure to hold an election on Dec. 24, 2021, and the refusal of Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah — who led a transitional government in the capital of Tripoli in the west — to step down. In response, Libya’s parliament based in the east appointed a rival prime minister who was replaced, while the powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter continues to hold sway in the east. Koury said the polarization and unresolved electoral issues are threatening Libya’s national unity and territorial integrity, crumbling the country's transitional architecture. And she said competition between armed groups for control of territory and access to Libya’s resources threatens stability. Over the past several weeks, Koury said that she shared the initiative's broad framework with key Libyan actors and regional and international partners. On Sunday night, she presented UNSMIL’s plan to overcome political deadlock to the Libyan people. The key objectives are stability, pursuing 'Libyan ownership,' helping unify and strengthen Libyan institutions, and promoting the inclusivity of Libyan political forces and cultural groups. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, this month’s council president, said that a new political process is needed in Libya and otherwise it will face deeper divisions, a further erosion of sovereignty and a return to violence. 'We continue to believe the U.N. is the best-placed international actor to lead that process,' she said. 'We call on the entire international community to stand behind these U.N.-led efforts.'	https://apnews.com/article/un-libya-election-deadlock-initiative-road-map-eca3b6af8c3525a769d0366db3afd46c	2024-12-16T10:49:29-08:00	
Joy and wonder: Between the bumps of the world, exuberance shone through in 2024	She jumps, her eyes closed, and she grins — this little girl surrounded by gang violence in her own neighborhood in Haiti. The jump rope game she is playing brings out an exuberance in her that the conditions around her cannot squelch. Around the planet, so many human beings — in so many circumstances — could use this kind of joy. But in a world that offered so much heartache and cataclysm in 2024, those kinds of feelings can be hard to find and recognize. Life rushes by, leaving its marks. Moments of joy and wonder, it seems, sometimes must be extracted and pointed out before they disappear. This collection of images by AP photojournalists does exactly that. For every disruptive news story in the world, perhaps there is an equal moment of joy or wonder. But because news is, by definition, things that are out of the ordinary, sometimes everyday moments get lost in the rush of events. These photos, taken together, make a conscious choice to grab at that joy and wonder, and to distill it and recapture it in a concentrated burst — reminding us that even in dark days, it is still out there. Some, like the little Haiti girl and the image of displaced Palestinian youths playing, demonstrate that even while traveling hard roads, people can find respite. Some, like the photo of a coca vendor at a legal market in Bolivia, demonstrate that smiles can burst forth at any part of the day. Some, like the young people performing a street dance in a Rio de Janeiro favela, or slum, show that exuberance knows no boundaries and will inevitably poke through. And some show the literal joyful footprints of humanity — as with the footprints on a snow-covered rugby field in Chile that took pains to walk in the shape of a heart. Patterns, blown kisses, celebrations of equality, ice skaters, the unself-conscious playing of children, a motorcycle riding against a dramatic sunrise, even a partier reveling in being immersed in a pool of squashed tomatoes — these images, gathered from all around the world, offer an antidote for much of the rest of 2024. They tell us that happiness and exuberance are possible in multiple conditions, even some of the worst ones. And in doing so, they also hint that, at any moment, those good feelings might be possible for us, too. ___ Ted Anthony, director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation at The Associated Press, writes frequently about photography.

Atlanta and Seattle to play first WNBA regular season game in Canada in August	The WNBA will stage its first regular season game outside the U.S. when Atlanta and Seattle play in Vancouver on Aug. 15, the league announced Monday. The league has had two exhibition games in Canada, including one played by Seattle in Edmonton this past season. The Toronto Tempo will begin play in 2026 as the first international team in league history. 'The WNBA Canada Game has been a tremendous opportunity to grow our league’s footprint, and we look forward to hosting the first-ever international regular season game with the Seattle Storm’s return to Canada to face the Atlanta Dream,' WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said. 'As we prepare to establish permanent roots in Canada with a Toronto franchise, this game and our year-round engagement efforts are a nod to the incredible momentum around women’s basketball in Canada.' The Dream participated in the first preseason WNBA game in Europe when they beat the British national team in 2011. 'This is a monumental moment for the WNBA, and we are honored that the league chose the Dream to participate in the first regular-season game outside the U.S,' Atlanta Dream president and COO Morgan Shaw Parker said. 'We look forward to showcasing our amazing athletes on a global stage in Vancouver. Members of our team have competed internationally, and now they will be doing so wearing Dream colors and representing the city of Atlanta.' This will mark the fifth WNBA game played outside the U.S., with a previous contest played in Mexico in 2004 to go along with the Canada and England games. Viewership in Canada was up 175% last season from the previous year and the league set new highs in the country across digital platforms, including WNBA League Pass and social media. 'The WNBA Canada Game is an opportunity to showcase the WNBA and its talent to more fans. The Storm is honored to be a part of this international celebration of basketball,' Seattle CEO and president Alisha Valavanis said. 'Playing in front of fans in Edmonton in 2024 was a highlight of the season and we’re looking forward to bringing the Storm energy back to Canada in 2025.' ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball	https://apnews.com/article/wnba-canada-dream-storm-13a42f29d66937220724c80afdcc073d	2024-12-16T09:29:31-08:00	
Who is the alleged Chinese spy with close ties to Britain's Prince Andrew?	LONDON (AP) — An alleged Chinese spy who cultivated close ties with Prince Andrew said Monday he has done 'nothing wrong or unlawful' as Britain's government faced questions about what it is doing to thwart security threats from China. British authorities allege businessman Yang Tengbo — known only as 'H6' until a High Court judge lifted an anonymity order Monday — was working on behalf of the United Front Work Department, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party that is used to influence foreign entities. It's the most high-profile case in a series of espionage scandals in recent years that involved suspected or confirmed Chinese intelligence-gathering in Britain's establishment, including in Parliament. Here's a look at Yang's case: Who is Yang Tengbo? Yang, 50, also known as Chris Yang, is listed as a director of Hampton Group International, a business consultancy advising U.K.-based companies on their operations in China. He has been photographed with senior U.K. politicians, including former Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May, at events. Yang is reportedly a key member of Pitch@Palace China, an initiative by Prince Andrew to support entrepreneurs. Yang worked as a junior civil servant in China before arriving in the U.K. in 2002 to study. He earned a master’s degree in public administration and public policy at the University of York before starting his business. He was granted the right to live and work in the U.K. for an indefinite period in 2013. Yang told authorities he has spent regular time in Britain and considered it his second home. What happened with Prince Andrew? Details about Yang's case emerged last week at a special immigration tribunal, which upheld a decision by British authorities to ban Yang from entering the U.K. in 2023. The Home Office said he was believed to have carried out 'covert and deceptive activity' for the Chinese Communist Party. Judges agreed with MI5, Britain's domestic intelligence, that Yang 'represented a risk to the national security' and dismissed his appeal. The tribunal heard that in 2021, authorities found documents that showed how close Yang was to Prince Andrew, King Charles III's younger brother. One letter from a senior adviser to Andrew told Yang he should 'never underestimate the strength' of his relationship with the royal. 'Outside of his closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on,' the adviser wrote. The tribunal said that when Yang was interviewed by immigration authorities he failed to give a full account of his relationship with the prince, which it said had a 'covert and clandestine' element. Authorities have not made public what information Yang allegedly obtained or was seeking to obtain. But the tribunal cited a 2022 statement by the MI5 director that described the United Front Work Department's aims as buying and exerting influence, amplifying pro-China voices and silencing those critical of the Chinese government's authority. Andrew has been repeatedly criticized for his links to wealthy foreigners and prompted critics to suggest that those individuals were trying to buy access to the royal family. What has been said about the allegations? Yang strongly denied the espionage claims and said he was a victim of a changing political climate that had seen a rise in tensions between Britain and China. 'I have done nothing wrong or unlawful,' he said in a statement. 'The widespread description of me as a ‘spy’ is entirely untrue.' Andrew's office said the royal met Yang 'through official channels' and nothing of a sensitive nature was ever discussed. What is the U.K.'s relationship with China? Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he is concerned about the challenge posed by China, but stood by his government's strategy of engagement and cooperation with Beijing. Starmer, who took office this summer, has sought to repair frayed ties and in November became the first British leader to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping since 2018. Opposition lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith, a leading critic of Beijing, said that glosses over the clear threat China poses. Yang was already a known member of China's United Front Work Department, he told Parliament, and should not have been able to gain access to the royal family without scrutiny. 'The reality is that there are many, many more involved in exactly this kind of espionage that’s taking place,' he said. In 2022 British intelligence officials warned politicians that Christine Lee, a British-Chinese lawyer, had been seeking to improperly influence members of Parliament for years. A parliamentary researcher was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of providing sensitive information to China. ___ Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-andrew-china-businessman-prince-df7354a1cf404a203e809ce36c4754d5	2024-12-16T09:19:59-08:00	
As he prepares to leave leadership, McConnell challenges Trump on foreign policy	WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is challenging President-elect Donald Trump to reject the isolationist voices within their party and build his foreign policy around military strength, arguing that if the U.S. retreats from global engagement, 'its enemies will be only too happy to fill the void.' In an essay published Monday in Foreign Affairs, McConnell took the rare step of warning Trump directly as he plans to step down from his post in the coming weeks. The Kentucky Republican plans to stay in the Senate and has made clear that his top priority will be pushing for the United States to maintain and improve its global strength. 'The time to restore American hard power is now,' McConnell wrote, arguing that military readiness should override 'both left-wing faith in hollow internationalism and right-wing flirtation with isolation and decline.' McConnell has long pushed back against the growing isolationist wing in his party, making an aggressive, ultimately successful push this year to pass aid to Ukraine when many in his party in Congress were openly opposed to it. But the essay is his most direct warning yet to Trump and his allies and advisers, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, an Ohio senator who was one of the loudest voices in opposition to the Ukraine aid. Trump has railed against 'forever wars' since before his first term in office and long spoken favorably of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He made clear during his campaign that he would move to end the war in Ukraine quickly and has called on Putin to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine. He has also said he would be open to reducing military aid to Ukraine and pulling the United States out of NATO. McConnell wrote that Trump 'deserves credit' for reversing some Obama-era limitations on assistance to Ukraine in his first term and authorizing a transfer of lethal weapons to Kyiv. But he writes that the former and future president 'sometimes undermined these tough policies through his words and deeds,' including his relationship with Putin. 'He courted Putin, he treated allies and alliance commitments erratically and sometimes with hostility, and in 2019 he withheld $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine,' McConnell wrote. 'These public episodes raised doubts about whether the United States was committed to standing up to Russian aggression, even when it actually did so.' Trump should 'commit to a significant and sustained increase in defense spending,' McConnell recommended, as well as investments in the defense industry and access to new military capabilities. McConnell’s essay comes after years of an intensely complicated relationship with Trump, aligning with him when it served his purposes in the Senate while criticizing him behind his back and, to a lesser extent, in public. He did not speak to Trump for more than three years after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump’s supporters, but endorsed him earlier this year after it became clear that he would be the GOP presidential nominee. The essay also comes as there is speculation about McConnell’s new role as a rank-and-file member, whether he will oppose some of Trump’s nominees and otherwise challenge him publicly now that he is freed from the responsibilities of leadership. However that may play out, McConnell has made clear that he wants to cement his legacy by pushing the party to embrace the U.S. role as a global leader. He writes that Trump will 'no doubt hear from some that he should prioritize a single theater and downgrade U.S. interests and commitments elsewhere,' including by elevating Asia at the expense of interests in Europe and the Middle East. But if 'the United States continues to retreat, its enemies will be only too happy to fill the void.' 'A Russian victory would not only damage the United States’ interest in European security and increase U.S. military requirements in Europe; it would also compound the threats from China, Iran, and North Korea,' McConnell writes.	https://apnews.com/article/mcconnell-trump-isolationism-foreign-affairs-dcad297fa82e1794612fa2582e21162f	2024-12-16T09:10:29-08:00	
Russian presence in Syria remains. But it's unclear for how long	HMEIMIM, Syria (AP) — A convoy of Russian military vehicles rolled down the highway towards the Syrian city of Tartus on Monday as soldiers stood guard. Planes periodically descended and rose from Russia’s Hmeimim air base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia while smoke rose from the base. It was unclear what was burning. In the streets of Hmeimim, a town dotted with orange groves, many of the shops bear signs in Russian, a nod to the significance of the Russian military presence. But whether and how long that presence will last after the fall of former Syrian leader Bashar Assad is now an open question. Russia’s scorched-earth intervention on behalf of its ally, Assad, once turned the tide of the Syrian civil war. In 2017, Assad’s government signed a deal with Russia that offered it a free lease of the Hmeimim air base and the Tartus naval base for 49 years. But opposition forces in the country’s northwest launched a shock offensive last month that again threatened Assad’s rule. This time, Moscow largely stood aside — although it has granted asylum to the former president and his family. On Monday, in his first public statement since his ouster, Assad said he had left Damascus for the Hmeimim air base on Dec. 8 after insurgents stormed the capital, but hadn't planned to flee the country. He said that after the base came under attack by drones, the Russians decided to evacuate him to Russia. Since Assad's departure, there have been no clashes between Russian troops and the former insurgents who have suddenly become the de facto security forces for all of Syria. That's despite the fact that many of the fighters are from areas of northern Syria that came under frequent Russian bombardment and have little love for Moscow. A fighter guarding the shuttered civilian airport next to the Hmeimim base said Monday, 'The Russians are preparing to withdraw from Syria, God willing.' He gave only his nickname, Abu Saif, because he wasn't authorized to comment publicly. Russian forces have pulled out of some areas of Syria. Russian forces and military vehicles were seen withdrawing from southern Syria on Friday toward their primary base in the city of Latakia. On Thursday, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Russian forces were leaving bases in Ain Issa and Tel Al-Samn in the Al-Raqqah countryside. Satellite images released by Maxar Technologies on Friday show what appear to be cargo planes at a Russian military airfield in Syria with their nose cones opened to receive heavy equipment, along with helicopters being dismantled and prepared for transport. Moscow has reached out to the new Syrian authorities to try to ensure the security of its bases and extend its forces' stay. The three-starred flag of the Syrian revolution was quickly hoisted at the Syrian Embassy in Moscow in place of the old government's two-starred flag. In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Obeida Arnaout, spokesman for the political department of the new transitional government, called on Russia to 'reconsider its presence' in Syria, as well as its interests. But he didn't rule out the possibility that Russian forces could remain. 'Their interests were linked to the criminal Assad regime. They can reconsider and take the initiatives to reach out to the new administration to show that they have no animosity toward the Syrian people, and that the era of Assad regime is finally over,' Arnaout said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a call with reporters Monday that Moscow was discussing the issue with the new authorities. 'We are in contact with representatives of the forces that are currently in control of the situation in the country, and all of this will be determined in the course of dialogue,' Peskov said. ___ Sarah El Deeb contributed to this report from Damascus, Syria.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-russia-latakia-hmeimim-tartous-c29f7a33912753c133f20c44ea7160be	2024-12-16T07:46:02-08:00	
Prince Andrew's Chinese spy drama again pushes King Charles III to rein in scandal-prone brother	LONDON (AP) — How do you solve a problem like Prince Andrew? That’s the question facing King Charles III as the drama surrounding his 64-year-old brother roils Britain and the monarchy once again. In the latest episode, a Chinese businessman has been barred from the U.K. because of concerns he cultivated links with Andrew in an alleged effort to influence British elites on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. The man, identified Monday as Yang Tengbo, said he wasn't involved in espionage and had 'done nothing wrong or unlawful.' The allegations represent the most high-profile example to date of a threat intelligence officials have repeatedly warned about: China’s increasing efforts to secretly influence politicians and other members of the British establishment to support the country’s expansionist policies. But the story also made news because it involves Andrew, once second-in-line to the British throne but now a constant source of tabloid fodder because of his money woes and links to questionable characters, including the late American financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Queen Elizabeth II stripped Andrew of his royal duties and charity roles, but the unflattering headlines kept coming. More recently, Charles has tried to persuade his brother to cut his expenses by leaving the sprawling royal estate he occupies west of London and moving to a cottage inside the security perimeter of Windsor Castle. But Andrew remains ensconced at the 30-room Royal Lodge. The king needs to take more aggressive action to keep Andrew out of the public eye, such as barring him from processions and other royal events, said Ed Owens, author of 'After Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?’’ While Andrew said in a statement that nothing sensitive was ever discussed and that he ceased contact with the Chinese businessman as soon as concerns were raised, his constant brushes with scandal tarnish the work of the royal family, Owens said. 'Andrew is toxic and he is very much damaged goods,' he added. 'He can only, through his behavior, further undermine the reputation of the monarchy. It’s in the king’s best interest, it’s in the best interests of the future of the monarchy, for Andrew to take a step back.' Scandal fuels anti-monarchy criticism Britain’s most prominent anti-monarchy group used the latest scandal to call for a parliamentary inquiry into alleged royal corruption. 'When a Chinese spy befriends a royal, they want access to the British state. We must know if the royals have given them what they want,' said Graham Smith, leader of Republic, which seeks to replace the monarchy with an elected head of state. Andrew has become a cautionary tale about the temptations and pitfalls of modern royalty. When Andrew was born he was second in line to the throne, the proverbial spare who was there to step in if disaster struck the heir, his brother Charles. But after Charles married, Andrew’s position dropped with every new child and grandchild. He now stands at eighth place in the royal pecking order. The Epstein scandal costs Andrew his job While other senior royals spend much of their time opening recreation centers and meeting community leaders on behalf of their more exalted relations, Andrew initially took on bigger tasks. After 22 years in the Royal Navy, including combat operations as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, Andrew was named Britain’s special representative for international trade and investment in 2001. But he was forced to step down in 2011 amid growing concern about his friendship with Epstein, who had been sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution. Andrew had also been criticized for meeting with the son of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and the son-in-law of ousted Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Even before that, some members of Parliament had raised concerns about the sale of Andrew’s former home, Sunninghill Park, to a son-in-law of former Kazakh ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2007. The buyer allegedly paid 15 million pounds ($19 million) — 3 million pounds more than the asking price. But Andrew’s links to Epstein have been his biggest problem. The disastrous BBC interview Questions about the relationship resurfaced after Epstein was again arrested on sex trafficking charges in 2019. In an effort to silence criticism, Andrew gave a disastrous interview to the BBC’s Newsnight program in which he tried to explain away his contacts with Epstein and failed to show empathy for victims. Amid the backlash, Andrew announced on Nov. 20, 2019, that he was stepping away from royal duties 'for the foreseeable future.' In a statement, he called his association with Epstein 'a major disruption to my family’s work.' But that didn’t end the scandal. In August 2021, one of Epstein’s victims sued Andrew in a New York cour t, alleging that the prince had sex with her when she was underage. Andrew denied the allegations, but he was stripped of all military affiliations and royal charity work as the case moved through the legal process. Netflix film brings a global audience Andrew ultimately settled the case for an undisclosed sum, with a joint statement indicating the prince would make a 'substantial donation' to a victims’ rights charity. British newspapers reported amounts for the settlement ranged from $6 million to $16 million. Even now, Andrew’s interview haunts the prince and the royal family. It resurfaced earlier this year in the Netflix movie 'Scoop,' reminding a worldwide audience of his missteps. 'He has consistently used his privileged position and his power to cozy up to convicted sex offenders, Chinese spies — in pursuit of his own interests, whether it’s about expanding his own influence or indeed extending his own business interests,’’ Owens said. 'That’s the problem here, that he’s used the position given to him by birth to seek out these opportunities.'	https://apnews.com/article/prince-andrew-yang-tengbo-chinese-spy-b3aeebcf4f7d73eaac3dae37b4b3760e	2024-12-16T06:50:56-08:00	
Syria's ousted leader Assad says he wanted to keep fighting but Russian allies evacuated him	DAMASCUS (AP) — Ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad said Monday he wanted to stay in the country after rebels captured the capital, but the Russian military evacuated him from their base in western Syria after it came under attack. They were Assad's first public comments since he was overthrown by insurgent groups just over a week ago following a swift offensive that has shaken up the country's alliances and led to celebrations in a nation long stifled by civil war. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the new transitional government told The Associated Press that the new Syria will be inclusive and open to the world. Assad said on Facebook that he left Damascus on the morning of Dec. 8, hours after insurgents stormed the capital. He said he left in coordination with Russian allies to their Hmeimim air base in the coastal province of Latakia, where he had planned to keep fighting. But after the Russian base came under attack by drones, he said, the Russians decided to move him that night to Russia. 'At no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge nor was such proposal made by any individual or party,' Assad said in the English text of his statement. 'The only course of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught.' In Damascus, residents dismissed Assda's comments and some said he had abandoned Syria's people long ago. 'Is he going to run away from us? He still won’t be able to run away from God,' said one resident, Moataz al-Ahmed, as children stepped on a fallen statue of Assad's father, Hafez, who had begun the family's half-century rule. The spokesman for the transitional government's political department said in an interview Monday that 'the Assad regime is finished with no return' and Russia 'should reconsider its presence on Syrian territory as well as its interests.' The spokesman, Obeida Arnaout, told the AP that Syria has entered a new phase that will be open to the world, and the new government is looking to build good relations with its neighbors and beyond. He also called on the U.S. and other countries to reconsider the designation of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — the main rebel group and a former al-Qaida affiliate — as a terrorist organization, calling it 'not right and not accurate' designation. Already, the U.S. has said its officials have been in direct contact with the group. Syria is home to multiple ethnic and religious communities, often pitted against each other by Assad’s state and years of war. Many of them fear the possibility that Sunni Islamist extremists will take over. The new leadership also has been in contact with the U.S. to return American citizen Travis Timmerman, who was among the prisoners released from government detention centers when Assad fell, Arnaout said. 'There are political contacts at the highest levels in a way that benefits the Syrian people and that strengthen the current administration,' he said. Asked whether the new government's security forces would cooperate with the U.S. to combat remaining militants with the Islamic State group, Arnaout said Syrian factions have ousted and rejected IS and the group no longer has a significant presence in the country. U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces in northeast Syria have been the main U.S. ally in fighting IS and oversee detention centers housing IS militants. However, the future of the Kurds and the semi-autonomous region they control is unclear in the country's new post-Assad order. Clashes over territory have taken place in some areas between Kurdish forces and the armed groups that overthrew Assad. Arnaout said the Kurds are part of the Syrian people and their rights will be protected. However, he said the new government will not accept that any part of Syria be outside of Damascus' control. 'Kurds are one of the components of the Syrian people and we are very keen that this group has its rights protected,' he said. 'The social fabric in Syria is a source of strength and not weakness. But we affirm that we don’t any part of Syria to be separated.' The U.N. envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said Monday he met with HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa and was briefed on the challenges and priorities of the Syrian people going forward. Pederson has called for the lifting of international sanctions on Syria to allow for faster rebuilding. Meanwhile, a U.K.-based war monitor said Israeli airstrikes early Monday hit missile warehouses on the Syrian coast and called it the 'most violent strikes' in that part of Syria since 2012. Israel has been pounding with hundreds of airstrikes what it says are military sites in Syria after the dramatic collapse of Assad’s rule, wiping out air defenses and most of the arsenal of the former Syrian army. Israeli troops have also seized a border buffer zone, sparking condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating the 1974 ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria for a land grab.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-war-assad-russia-news-16-december-2024-72a8e44f762da2ff78434ff76faeb633	2024-12-16T06:30:06-08:00	
Canada's finance minister resigns as unpopular Trudeau faces biggest test of his political career	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced the biggest test of his political career after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long his most powerful and loyal minister, announced Monday she was resigning from the Cabinet. It was a move that stunned the country and raised questions about how much longer the unpopular Trudeau can stay in his job. Freeland, who was also deputy prime minister, said that Trudeau had told her Friday that he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister and that he offered her another role in the Cabinet. But she said in her resignation letter to the prime minister that the only 'honest and viable path' was to leave the Cabinet. 'For the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,' Freeland said. Freeland and Trudeau disagreed about a two-month sales tax holiday and $250 Canadian ($175) checks to Canadians that were recently announced. Freeland said that Canada is dealing with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose sweeping 25% tariffs and should eschew 'costly political gimmicks' it can 'ill afford.' 'Our country is facing a grave challenge,' Freeland said in the letter. 'That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.' The resignation comes as Freeland, who chaired a Cabinet committee on U.S. relations, was set to deliver the fall economic statement and likely announce border security measures designed to help Canada avoid Trump's tariffs. The U.S. president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the numbers of migrants and drugs. Trudeau has said that he plans on leading the Liberal Party into the next election, but there are some party members who don't want him to run for a fourth term. It wasn’t immediately clear what Freeland's resignation from the Cabinet means for Trudeau’s immediate future. 'This news has hit me really hard,' a shocked Transport Minister Anita Anand said. She added that she needed to digest it before commenting further. Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said that the government is losing control at the worst possible time. 'Justin Trudeau has lost control, but he's hanging onto power,' Poilievre said. 'All this chaos, all this division, all this weakness is happening as our largest neighbor and closet ally is imposing 25% tariffs under a recently elected Trump with a strong mandate, a man who knows how to identify weakness.' No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms. The federal election has to be held before October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament, because they don’t hold an outright majority themselves. If the opposition New Democratic Party, or NDP, pulls support, an election can be held at any time. Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015, when he reasserted the country’s liberal identity after almost a decade of Conservative Party rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in big trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the rising cost of living and other issues like immigration increases following the country’s emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. Trudeau’s legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax intended to fight climate change. Freeland said in the resignation letter that Canadians 'know when we are working for them, and they equally know when we are focused on ourselves. Inevitably, our time in government will come to an end.' Freeland's resignation comes as Trudeau has been trying to recruit Mark Carney to join his government. Carney is the former head of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada. He was so well regarded after helping Canada dodge the worst of the global economic crisis that the U.K. named him the first foreigner to serve as governor of the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. It wasn't immediately clear if Carney has agreed to join Trudeau's Cabinet. 'This is quite a bombshell,' said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. 'Freeland was not only finance minister but also deputy prime minister and, until a couple of years ago, was seen as Trudeau’s heir as Liberal leader and prime minister.' Wiseman said that leaks from the prime minister’s office suggest that she was a poor communicator and made Freeland’s status questionable. 'There was talk about her becoming foreign minister again and that would have been a good fit for her, but the stab in the back from the prime minister's office cast the die,' Wiseman said. Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, also called it a political earthquake and not just because Freeland was the second most powerful official in government. 'Also because of how she resigned: by publishing a letter on social media that clearly criticizes the prime minister only hours before she was supposed to present the government’s fall economic statement,' Béland said. 'This is clearly a minority government on life support but, until now, the (opposition) NDP has rejected calls to pull the plug on it. It’s hard to know whether this resignation will force the NDP to rethink its strategy.' NDP leader Jagmeet Singh released a statement, but didn't say whether his party would vote to topple the government. 'While the Liberals fight with each other, I believe we should be fighting for Canadians jobs at risk from Donald Trump's tariffs,' Singh said in a statement. 'People deserve a government that fights for you for a change.'	https://apnews.com/article/finance-minister-chrystia-freeland-resigns-trudeau-a8355a62870edd962fee8138dc6bfc77	2024-12-16T05:42:53-08:00	
EU slaps sanctions on dozens more Russian officials and targets its shadow oil and gas fleet	BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Monday imposed fresh sanctions on dozens of officials linked to Russia’s war on Ukraine, including two top North Korean defense officials, a military unit blamed for an attack on a Kyiv children’s hospital and the heads of companies in the energy sector. Russia’s vast shadow fleet of ships that Moscow is exploiting to skirt restrictions on transporting oil and gas, or carrying stolen Ukrainian grain, was also targeted. Fifty-two vessels were added to a growing list of ships banned from European ports and deprived of services. 'This package of sanctions is part of our response to weaken Russia’s war machine and those who are enabling this war, also including Chinese companies,' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said. 'We will stand by the Ukrainian people on all fronts: humanitarian, economic, political, diplomatic and military.' In all, EU foreign ministers froze the assets of 54 people and 30 'entities,' which are usually companies, ministries, government agencies or other organizations. Travel bans were also imposed on officials. The EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 2022. More than 2,300 officials and entities have now been impacted. North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol was targeted for being directly involved in the military cooperation, including sending thousands of troops to Russia. Deputy Chief of the armed force's General Staff, Kim Yong Bok, was also hit for going to Russia to supervise their deployment. Several companies were also targeted this time, including Russian defense firms, a chemical plant and a civil Russian airline providing logistical support to the armed forces. Measures were also imposed on Chinese nationals accused of supplying drone parts and electronic equipment. Interests in China, India, Iran, Serbia and the United Arab Emirates accused of helping Russia to circumvent EU sanctions or trade restrictions on the movement of sensitive items that Moscow uses on drones and missiles were also hit.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-sanctions-russia-ukraine-korea-drones-ships-e21dc29c798b27bc4791c992a09fcfb8	2024-12-16T04:29:24-08:00	
Syrian rebel force deploys to a village near Damascus to stop looters	HUSSEINIYEH, Syria (AP) — A rebel force deployed to a village in southeastern Damascus to stop looters who swarmed a residential complex and set some apartments on fire. The raid by the rebel force comes a week after the fighters marched on the Syrian capital in their lightening offensive that forced Syrian President Bashar Assad to flee, ending five decades of his family rule. The rebel fighters have prioritized security in Damascus, where there was limited looting of private properties and attacks on security and government buildings. On Sunday, a rebel force arrived at the village of Husseiniyeh after looters, including women and children, emptied a residential complex, walking away with furniture, windows, food, copper wires and anything they can get their hands on. 'Our things were all looted. My house of 25 years is all looted. If they are not looting, they are burning. Everything. As you see. They started today with copper wires,' one resident said. He then stopped a child walking away with a box containing metal cables. Another resident, a school principal, said her house was looted and she was unable to stop it. She scolded the rebel force, and a fighter told her they will set up a checkpoint in the area to prevent the looters, who largely come from a nearby village. At times, looters fired grenades at apartments, setting them on fire. The residential complex houses former military officers and soldiers. The rebels opened fire, shooting at the wheels of looters' cars and next to the crowd to disperse it. No injuries were reported. They also called on looters still inside the buildings to hand themselves in. Some looters fled, still hanging on to their booty, while the rebels detained about a dozen. ___ Follow the AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-rebels-looters-8b188ee618e4ce1a0ab8fec63cda0c07	2024-12-16T03:17:12-08:00	
Ukraine claims North Korean troops were killed as they fought alongside Russian forces	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s military intelligence agency claimed Monday that around 30 North Korean troops were killed or wounded in fighting against the Ukrainian army at the weekend in Russia’s Kursk border region. This is the first reported casualties since the Pentagon and Ukraine announced North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia to help it in the almost 3-year war. The casualties occurred around three villages in Kursk, where Russia has for four months been trying to quash a Ukrainian incursion, the agency, known by its acronym GUR, said in a public post on the Telegram messaging app. At least three North Korean servicemen went missing around another Kursk village, GUR said. It was not possible to independently verify the Ukrainian claims. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred related questions to the Russian Defense Ministry, which didn’t immediately comment. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has pledged unwavering support for Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor under a mutual defense pact. The alliance gave a jolt to international relations, and Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that the planned deployment of U.S. intermediate-range missiles to Europe and Asia has brought new threats. 'In view of rising geopolitical tensions, we must take additional measures to ensure the security of Russia and our allies,' Putin told a meeting with top military brass. 'We are doing it accurately and in a balanced way to avoid being drawn into a full-scale arms race.' However, military analysts say the language barrier has bedeviled combat coordination between Russian and North Korean troops. 'The poor integration and ongoing communication problems between Russian and North Korean forces will likely continue to cause friction in Russian military operations in Kursk … in the near term,' the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said late Sunday. On Nov. 5, Ukrainian officials said that their forces had for the first time engaged with North Korean units that had been recently deployed to help Russia. Ukraine seized land in Russia’s Kursk border region last August in what was the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II. The operation embarrassed the Kremlin and aimed to counter unceasingly glum news from the front line. The incursion hasn’t significantly changed the war’s dynamics. Over the past year, Russia has been on the front foot, with the exception of Kursk, and has been grinding deeper into eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region despite heavy losses. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said Monday the military has been making steady gains in Ukraine, claiming that they have accelerated recently, with Russian forces capturing about 30 square kilometers (11.5 square miles) of territory a day. — Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-north-korea-troops-33bf427736c5802fb97df41fdbf61396	2024-12-16T02:50:22-08:00

Prosecutors summon Kosovo's prime minister in a move his supporters say is politically motivated	PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Kosovo's Special Prosecutor’s Office has summoned Prime Minister Albin Kurti Monday to testify in a case that remains unclear, with his supporters saying it’s a politically driven move as the country gears up for election. According to Liridona Kozmaqi, the spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office, Kurti was on a trip abroad and that another date would be set for the summons. She declined to give details on the nature of the case. However, Kurti’s spokesman, Perparim Kryeziu, said in a Facebook post last week the premier was called to testify in a case under Article 414 of the Criminal Code, which regulates offenses related to 'abuse of official post or authority.' Kryeziu accused the summons of being politically motivated and 'an attempt to influence the outcome of the 2025 elections.' Kosovo will hold a parliamentary election on Feb. 9, a vote expected to be a key test for Kurti whose governing left-wing Self-Determination Movement Party won by a landslide in 2021. The main contenders for the coming election are the Democratic Party of Kosovo, whose main leaders are at The Hague tribunal accused of war crimes, and the Democratic League of Kosovo, the oldest party in the country that has lost much support after the death of its leader Ibrahim Rugova. Local polls show that Kurti’s party is the front-runner. The main issue overshadowing the election remains the stalled normalization talks with Serbia, which the European Union has facilitated since 2011, but with little progress. The talks are decisive toward the two countries’ membership in the bloc. Kosovo was a former Serbian province until a 78-day NATO bombing campaign in 1999 ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which left about 13,000 dead, mainly ethnic Albanians, and pushed Serbian forces out.

Rescuers in Italy working to free cave explorer trapped underground	MILAN (AP) — A major rescue operation was underway Monday in a cave northeast of the Italian city of Bergamo to free a woman who was injured in a fall and became trapped while exploring with eight other people. Ottavia Piana, 32, remained blocked deep inside the Bueno Fonteno cave, where the temperatures were ranging from 7 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius (44-46 degrees Fahrenheit) in high humidity. Piana, considered an expert cave explorer, was injured after falling some 5 meters (16 feet) Saturday evening during an expedition to map a kilometer (half a mile) of an uncharted branch of the cave, but rescuers said she is alert and responsive. She suffered multiple traumas, including to the face, ribs and knee, rescuers said. Members of her team reported her missing after reaching the surface Saturday evening, and rescuers reached her late Sunday. They are using small explosives in an attempt to breach the last 100 meters (yards) to reach her. A spokesman for rescue operation, Mauro Guiducci, said it was impossible to foresee how long it would take to free Piana. 'One thing is certain, these kinds of operations are very long,’’ Guiducci said, adding that a team of 20 technicians were operating inside the cave and dozens more were assisting above ground.	https://apnews.com/article/cave-rescue-spelunker-trapped-italy-ef44fbb290d811af56c8457fdc6ba5e7	2024-12-16T01:15:25-08:00	
Sri Lanka's president holds talks with Modi in India in first overseas visit	NEW DELHI (AP) — Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake was hosted Monday by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his first overseas visit since assuming office that focused on shoring up ties as concerns grew over China's influence in the region. Modi said India and Sri Lanka will establish electricity grid connectivity and a multi-product petroleum pipeline that will further boost investment and commercial links between the nations. The Sri Lankan leader arrived in New Delhi on Sunday on his first overseas trip since becoming president in September. He held meetings with India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. At a press briefing attended by both leaders, Dissanayake said he would not allow Sri Lanka to be used in 'a manner that is detrimental to the interest of India.' 'The cooperation with India will certainly flourish and I want to reassure our continued support for India,' he said. India has been expanding its economic and defense ties with Sri Lanka amid concerns over China’s growing hold in the island nation. Beijing was once widely seen as having an upper hand with free-flowing loans and infrastructure investments in Sri Lanka. Even though China remains Sri Lanka’s largest bilateral lender, Colombo’s economic collapse in 2022 provided an opportunity for India, as New Delhi stepped in with massive financial and material assistance including food, fuel and medicines. The support of the two regional rivals is crucial for Sri Lanka to emerge from its worst economic crisis in decades, which led to a political upheaval and finally paved the way for Dissanayake’s party to win power.	https://apnews.com/article/india-sri-lanka-modi-dissanayake-e795365d1e38c8014691639b92ebeedc	2024-12-16T00:48:26-08:00	
Death toll in Gaza Strip from Israel-Hamas war tops 45,000, Palestinians say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 14-month war between Israel and Hamas militants has topped 45,000 people, Palestinian health officials said Monday, with 52 dead arriving at hospitals across the bombed-out strip over the past 24 hours. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. With the death toll mounting ever higher, efforts to reach a ceasefire have picked up in recent weeks after repeatedly faltering. Qatar, Egypt and the United States have renewed their efforts to broker a deal at senior levels in recent days. Mediators have said there appears to be more willingness from both sides to conclude a ceasefire. The Health Ministry said 45,028 people have been killed and 106,962 have been wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are still buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The latest war has been by far the deadliest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas, with the death toll now amounting to roughly 2% of Gaza’s entire prewar population of about 2.3 million. A family is among the dead as another airstrike hits a shelter Among the dead reported in the overall toll were 10 people, including a family of four, who were killed in an overnight Israeli strike in Gaza City, Palestinian medics said. The strike late Sunday hit a house in Gaza City’s eastern Shijaiyah neighborhood, according to the Health Ministry’s emergency service. Rescuers recovered the bodies of 10 people from under the rubble, including those of two parents and their two children, it said. Israel claims Hamas is responsible for the civilian death toll because it operates from within civilian areas in the densely populated Gaza Strip. Rights groups and Palestinians say Israel has failed to take sufficient precautions to avoid civilian deaths. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel responded by heavy bombardment and a ground incursion into the Palestinian enclave. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. A separate strike on a school on Sunday in the southern city of Khan Younis killed at least 13 people, including six children and two women, according to Nasser Hospital where the bodies were taken. The hospital initially reported the strike had killed 16 people, but it later revised the death toll as the three other bodies had been from a separate strike that hit a house. Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, the United Nations relief agency for Palestinians, said she met with children injured in Sunday’s strike on the the school turned shelter. They included a 17-year-old girl who suffered a severe leg injury and shrapnel wounds. She survived along with her twin sister and three other sisters, Wateridge said. Their mother died and Wateridge said one of the sisters described 'how their mother’s bones were crushed under the rubble. There was nothing they could do to save her.' Wateridge also met with two siblings aged 2 and 5 at Nasser Hospital where the casualties were taken. Both children have severe head and body injuries, with 2-year-old Julia losing sight in her eye. 'There is nothing we can do. We are already waiting for the next attack,' Wateridge quoted a doctor as telling her. The Israeli military said it had 'conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists who were operating inside a command and control center embedded within a compound' that had served as a school in Khan Younis. It did not provide evidence. A Palestinian journalist killed in an airstrike is mourned In central Gaza's Nuseirat urban refugee camp, mourners gathered for the funeral of a Palestinian journalist working for the Qatari-based Al Jazeera TV network who was killed Sunday in a strike on a point for Gaza's civil defense agency. They carried his body through the street from the hospital, his blue bulletproof vest resting atop. The strike also killed three civil defense workers, including the local head of the agency, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The civil defense is Gaza’s main rescue agency and operates under the Hamas-run government. Al Jazeera said Ahmad Baker Al-Louh, 39, had been covering rescue operations of a family wounded in an earlier bombing when he was killed. The International Federation of Journalists said last week that 104 journalists and media workers have been killed so far in 2024, with more than half of them perishing during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The group said that since the Oct. 7, 2023, start of the war, at least 138 had been killed, including 55 Palestinian media professionals in the calendar year. The Israeli military said its strike had targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants 'who were operating in a command and control center embedded in the offices of the ‘Civil Defense’ organization in Nuseirat.' It accused the journalist of having been a member of Islamic Jihad, an accusation his colleagues in Gaza denied. Gaza's civil defense also rejected the claims that militants had been operating from the site. 'We were stunned by the Israeli occupation statement,' Mahmoud al-Lawh, the journalist’s cousin, told The Associated Press. 'These claims are lies and misleading to cover up this crime.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-12-16-2024-9f7c8f0df71dc4c97a6b31aed6e13304	2024-12-16T00:30:28-08:00	
France rushes help to Mayotte, where hundreds or even thousands died in Cyclone Chido	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — France was rushing help by ship and military aircraft to its poor overseas territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean on Monday after the island was shattered by its worst storm in nearly a century. Authorities in Mayotte fear hundreds and possibly thousands of people have died in Cyclone Chido, although the official death toll on Monday morning stood at 14. Rescue teams and medical personnel have been sent to the island off the east coast of Africa from France and from the nearby French territory of Reunion, as well as tons of supplies. French television station TF1 reported Monday morning that Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau had arrived in Mamoudzou, the capital of Mayotte. 'It will take days and days to establish the human toll,' he told French media. French authorities said more than 800 more personnel were expected to arrive in the coming days as rescuers comb through the devastation caused by Chido when it hit the densely populated archipelago of around 300,000 people on Saturday. Mayotte Prefect François-Xavier Bieuville, the top French government official in Mayotte, told local TV station Mayotte la 1ere on Sunday that the death toll was several hundred people and could even be in the thousands. He said Mayotte’s poor slums of metal shacks and other informal structures had suffered terrible damage and authorities were struggling to get an accurate count of the dead and injured after the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte since the 1930s. Entire neighborhoods have been flattened, while public infrastructure like the main airport and hospital have been badly damaged and the electricity supply has been knocked out, French authorities said. The damage to the airport control tower means only military aircraft can fly into Mayotte, complicating the response. Mayotte is France’s poorest department and is regarded as the poorest territory in the European Union, but it is a target for economic migration from even poorer countries like nearby Comoros and even Somalia because of a better standard of living and the French welfare system. Bieuville, the Mayotte prefect, said it would be extremely hard to count all the dead and many might never be recorded, partly due to the Muslim tradition of burying people within 24 hours of their deaths and also because of many undocumented migrants living on the island. Chido ripped through the southwestern Indian Ocean on Friday and Saturday, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in the cyclone’s path, though, and took the brunt. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale. It made landfall in Mozambique on the African mainland late Sunday, where authorities and aid agencies have said more than 2 million people may be impacted in another poor country where health facilities are already limited. Mozambique media reported three people had died in the north of the country where the cyclone made landfall, but said that was a very early toll. Further inland, Malawi and Zimbabwe have also made preparations for possible evacuations because of flooding as Chido continues its eastern trajectory, although the cyclone has weakened as it passes over land. December through to March is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries in the Indian Ocean and southern Africa last year. —— AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mayotte-cyclone-chido-climate-weather-43890b2cee0d90e67b6263f278782334	2024-12-16T00:21:45-08:00	
Middle East latest: Death toll from Israel-Hamas war tops 45,000. Israel strikes Syrian targets	Palestinian health officials said Monday the death toll from the Israel-Hamas war, now in its 14th month, topped 45,000 people. This comes as 52 dead arrived at hospitals across the bombed-out strip over the past 24 hours, including a family of four, in Gaza City overnight, according to Palestinian medics. The Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7 last year when Hamas militants stormed southern Israel, killing some 1, 200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Israel responded with heavy bombardment and a ground incursion into the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, a UK-based war monitor says Israeli airstrikes early Monday hit missile warehouses in Syria and called it the 'most violent strikes' since 2012. Israel has been pounding what it says are military sites in Syria after the dramatic collapse of President Bashar Assad’s rule, wiping out air defenses and most of the arsenal of the former Syrian army. Israeli troops have also seized a border buffer zone, sparking condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating the 1974 ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria for a land grab. The Assad family’s rule, which lasted more than half a century, collapsed just over a week ago following a stunning rebel advance. The new Syrian administration, led by the former insurgents who toppled Assad, has complained to the U.N. Security Council about the Israeli bombardment and incursions into Syrian territory in the Golan Heights. However, it has also said it does not want a military confrontation with Israel. Here is the latest: Assad says he wanted to keep fighting but Russians evacuated him DAMASCUS, Syria — Ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad says he had no plans to leave the country after the fall of Damascus a week ago but the Russian military evacuated him after their base in western Syria came under attack. The comments are the first by Assad since he was overthrown by insurgent groups. Assad said in a statement on his Facebook page that he left Damascus on the morning of Dec. 8, hours after insurgents stormed the capital. He said he left in coordination with Russian allies to the Russian base in the coastal province of Latakia, where he planned to keep fighting. Assad said that after the Russian base came under attack by drones, the Russians decided to move him on the night of Dec. 8 to Russia. 'I did not leave the country as part of a plan as it was reported earlier,' Assad said. Death toll from Israel-Hamas war tops 45,000 Health officials in the Gaza Strip say the death toll from the 14-month war between Israel and Hamas militants has reached 45,028 people. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. It said more than half of the fatalities were women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The Health Ministry also said 106,962 have been wounded since the start of the war. Turkey condemns Israeli plan to expand settlements in the occupied Golan Heights ANKARA, Turkey — A Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said Monday the decision marked a 'new stage in Israel’s goal of expanding its borders through occupation,' adding that Ankara was concerned that the move would harm efforts to establish peace and stability in Syria. 'The international community must show the necessary reaction to Israel and ensure that the illegal activities of (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu’s government come to an end,' the statement read. Qatar also condemned the decision, calling it 'a new episode in a series of Israeli aggressions on Syrian territories and a blatant violation of international law.' The Israeli government approved Netanyahu’s plan on Sunday with the aim to encourage population growth in the area. Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it, though the international community except for the U.S. regards it as occupied. Israeli figures show the remote territory is home to about 50,000 people, about half of them Jewish Israelis and the other half Arab Druze, many of whom still consider themselves Syrians. Mourners in Gaza gather for funeral of Al Jazeera journalist DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — In central Gaza’s Nuseirat urban refugee camp, mourners carried Monday the body of Ahmad Baker Al-Louh, 39, a Palestinian journalist working for Al Jazeera, from the hospital through the streets. His blue bulletproof vest rested atop him. Al-Louh was killed the day before in a strike on a point for Gaza’s civil defense agency and Al Jazeera said had been covering rescue operations of a family wounded in an earlier bombing when he was killed. Sunday’s strike also killed three civil defense workers, including the local head of the agency, according to al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The civil defense is Gaza’s main rescue agency and operates under the Hamas-run government. Israeli strike kills 10 in Gaza City DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — The 10 included a family of four, Palestinian medics said Monday, as the Israel-Hamas war raged on for the 14th month in the Gaza Strip. The strike late Sunday hit a house in Gaza City’s eastern Shijaiyah neighborhood, according to the Health Ministry’s ambulance and emergency service. Rescuers recovered the bodies of 10 people from under the rubble, including those of two parents and their two children, it said. US embassy advises Americans to leave Syria DAMASCUS, Syria — The U.S. embassy in Damascus advised Americans to leave Syria, saying the security situation there continues to be volatile and unpredictable with armed conflict and 'terrorism throughout the country.' The embassy, which has been closed since 2012, posted a statement on X, warning U.S. citizens who were unable to leave the country to prepare 'contingency plans for emergency situations.' It didn't give further details. The statement also said that the U.S. government is unable to provide any routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens and those who need 'emergency assistance to depart should contact the U.S. Embassy in the country they plan to enter.' Sleeper cells of the Islamic State group have claimed responsibility for deadly attacks over the past months in different parts of Syria. Despite their defeat in March 2019, the extremists still pose a threat in the war-torn country. War monitor says Israel targets missile warehouses DAMASCUS, Syria — The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, reported early Monday that Israeli airstrikes pounded missile warehouses and other former Syrian army sites along Syria’s coast in the 'most violent strikes in the Syrian coast region since the beginning of the (Israeli) strikes in 2012.' The Israeli military declined to comment on the strikes. The observatory said that 'violent explosions' were heard in the coastal city of Tartous 'as a result of the successive strikes and the flying of ground-to-ground missiles from the warehouses.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-16-december-2024-4ed0ec24506a1b78f0561ed0cc8f0994	2024-12-15T22:57:46-08:00	
For the first time in 8 years, a US Navy ship makes a port call in Cambodia, a top Chinese ally	SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) — A U.S. Navy warship arrived Monday in Cambodia, the first such visit in eight years to a nation that is China’s close ally in Southeast Asia. Cambodia's government has suggested the port call reflects an upgrade in often-strained relations. The USS Savannah docked at the port of Sihanoukville on the Gulf of Thailand for a five-day visit. The Savannah, classed as a Littoral Combat Ship, carries a crew of 103. 'It’s great to be back, returning U.S. presence to here after eight years,' the ship’s commanding officer, Daniel A. Sledz, said in brief remarks to reporters. He was given a bouquet of flowers by a Cambodian officer and shook hands with a line of her colleagues. The United States for many years has had rocky relations with Cambodia, criticizing its government for political repression and human rights violations. There is particular concern about its close ties with China, which Washington fears may get exclusive access to a Cambodian naval base on the Gulf of Thailand, not far from where the Savannah docked. Recently, there seem to have been moves to patch up relations. Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defense said last week that the visit was scheduled after a U.S. request for a port call, and would 'strengthen and expand the bonds of friendship as well as promote bilateral cooperation' between the two nations. Two days before that, Cambodia’s foreign ministry noted 'positive momentum of bilateral ties and cooperation' and 'the reinvigoration of military-to-military cooperation' between Cambodia and the U.S. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visited Cambodia in early June, where he held talks with Prime Minister Hun Manet and other senior officials. He also met with Cambodian alumni of U.S. military training programs. Hun Manet himself is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The U.S. Defense Department said at the time that Austin's discussions concerned 'opportunities to strengthen the U.S.-Cambodia bilateral defense relationship in support of regional peace and security,' and other matters. But Washington remains concerned that the upgrading of Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base near Sihanoukville will serve Beijing’s strategic interests in the region. The U.S. and others suggest China’s navy is establishing a permanent base at Ream, which would give it easier access to the Malacca Strait, a critical shipping route between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean. Controversy over the Chinese activity at Ream initially arose in 2019 when The Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of an agreement seen by U.S. officials would allow China 30-year use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships. Cambodia’s government has denied such an agreement or any intention to grant China special privileges at the base, though Beijing has funded its expansion. In September, Cambodia’s Defense Ministry said that China is giving its navy two warships of the type it has had docked there for months. China is set to hand over two newly built Type 56 corvettes — smaller vessels typically used for coastal patrols — next year at the earliest, after Cambodia requested China’s support. Cambodia’s defense ministry said the Savannah’s port call will include 'a working meeting with the commander of the Ream Naval Base,' as well as meetings with provincial officials and 'a friendship sports competition between the crews of the U.S. Navy and the Cambodian Navy.' Cambodian Navy Capt. Mean Savoeun, deputy commander of the Ream Naval Base, was among those dockside welcoming the Savannah to Sihanoukville. He said he was happy to see the good relationship between Cambodia and the U.S., especially their navies, and believed the visit will bring closer diplomatic cooperation.	https://apnews.com/article/china-ream-navy-base-sihanoukville-6057b6416c9d6622e5beebd7f22b8a70	2024-12-15T22:42:59-08:00	
Pakistan begins last anti-polio vaccination campaign of the year after a surge in cases	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan began on Monday its last nationwide vaccination campaign for the year to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases hampered efforts to stop the disease, officials said. According to the World Health Organization, Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only two countries where the potentially fatal, paralyzing virus hasn’t been stopped, Pakistan has reported 63 confirmed cases since January. Ayesha Raza Farooq, the prime minister’s adviser for the polio eradication program, said the anti-polio drive will continue until December 22. 'As a mother, I am appealing to you to open your doors for health workers,' she said. Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns despite violence affecting medical personnel who oversee the vaccinations and security forces escorting them. Militants falsely claim that vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Authorities deployed thousands of police officers to protect the health workers following intelligence reports that insurgents could target them. However, gunmen opened fire Monday on police escorting polio workers in Karak, a city in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing a police officer and wounding a health worker, local police official Ayaz Khan said. More than 200 polio workers and police assigned for their protection have been killed since the 1990s, according to health officials and authorities. The latest anti-polio drive campaign began a day after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with medical staff and vowed that Pakistan would win the war against polio. Afghanistan reported at least 23 confirmed cases in 2024, according to data from the World Health Organization. In September, the Afghan Taliban suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign in Afghanistan, a devastating setback for polio eradication as the virus is one of the world’s most infectious and any unvaccinated groups of children where the virus is spreading could undo years of progress.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-polio-vaccination-campaign-surge-cases-78b8313185c8ee69e7713af11d5beb73	2024-12-15T22:07:22-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares fall as China reports lackluster data, while bitcoin hits new highs	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares retreated Monday in Asia after China reported lackluster economic indicators for November, while bitcoin surged to fresh highs, topping $106,000. Oil prices fell and U.S. futures were little changed. Bitcoin was trading at $104,948 early Monday, up 3.4% but down from an earlier high of $106,495. The price of the cryptocurrency has surged since the election in November given U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's bitcoin-friendly stance. Trump signaled a lighter regulatory approach to digital currencies with his choice of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin was trading below $70,000 before the Nov. 5 election. A report Monday showed Chinese retail sales slowed in November, while growth in factory output was flat and home sales declined. The report said the economy and employment were stable, but noted a complicated 'external environment,' reflecting unease over the outlook in coming months once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office, potentially delivering on promises to sharply hike tariffs on imports from China. Japan's Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1% lower, to 39,438.74, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.8% to 19,821.24. The Shanghai Composite index was almost unchanged, at 3,390.91. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.3% to 2,486.47 as South Korean law enforcement authorities were pushing to summon impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree and the Constitutional Court met to discuss whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. Taiwan's Taiex edged 0.1% higher, while the Sensex in India fell 0.4%. Thailand's SET dropped 0.9%. On Friday, major stock indexes on Wall Street drifted to a mixed finish Friday, capping a rare bumpy week for the market. The S&amp;P 500 ended essentially flat, down less than 0.1% at 6,051.09. The benchmark index posted a loss for the week, its first after three straight weekly gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2% to 43,828.06, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1% to 19,926.72, ending just below the record high it set on Wednesday. There were more than twice as many decliners than gainers on the New York Stock Exchange. Gains in technology stocks helped temper losses in communication services, financials and other sectors of the market. Broadcom surged 24.4% for the biggest gain in the S&amp;P 500 after the semiconductor company beat Wall Street’s profit targets and gave a glowing forecast, highlighting its artificial intelligence products. The company also raised its dividend. But some tech stocks were a drag on the market. Nvidia fell 2.2%, Meta Platforms dropped 1.7% and Google parent Alphabet slid 1.1%. Among the market's other decliners were Airbnb, which fell 4.7% for the biggest loss in the S&amp;P 500, and Charles Schwab, which closed 4% lower. Furniture and housewares company RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, surged 17% after raising its forecast for revenue growth for the year. Wall Street's rally stalled this week amid mixed economic reports and ahead of the Federal Reserve's last meeting of the year. The central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates for a third time since September when it meets this week. Expectations of a series of rate cuts has driven the S&amp;P 500 to 57 all-time highs so far this year. The Fed has been lowering its benchmark interest rate after aggressively hiking rates to tame inflation. It raised rates from near-zero in early 2022 to a two-decade high by the middle of 2023. Inflation eased under pressure from higher interest rates, nearly to the central bank's 2% target. The economy, including consumer spending and employment, held strong despite the squeeze from inflation and high borrowing costs. A slowing job market, though, has helped push a long-awaited reversal of the Fed's policy. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 47 cents to $70.82 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 36 cents to $74.13 per barrel. The U.S. dollar fell to 153.62 Japanese yen from 153.71 yen. The euro rose to $1.0516 from $1.0491.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-bitcoin-rates-744e69dbc29cc0836d2b2401a4c2bcda	2024-12-15T21:16:20-08:00	
China retail sales slow as consumers hold back, while home prices fall	BANGKOK (AP) — Chinese retail sales slowed in November and housing prices fell, the government said Monday, with demand still lackluster despite a flurry of stimulus measures over the past few months. The report came just a few days after top leaders ended an annual planning meeting in Beijing that produced no major new policy initiatives but included promises to do more to encourage people and businesses to spend more more. Analysts said ruling Communist Party leaders were leaving room to do more if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promises to raise tariffs on imports from China once he takes office. The National Bureau of Statistics reported that the economy was stable, with the unemployment remaining at 5%. 'However, we must also see that the external environment is more complicated, domestic demand is insufficient, some enterprises are facing difficulties in production and operation, and the foundation for the sustained recovery of the economy still needs to be consolidated,' Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters. Retail sales rose 3% from a year earlier, down from October's 4.8% increase and below the 3.5% annual rate in January-November. Consumers held back on spending on non-essentials like cosmetics, alcohol and clothing, though purchases of appliances and vehicles surged thanks to a government program to pay subsidies to entice people to replace older appliances and cars with newer, energy efficient versions and electric vehicles. Auto sales rose 6.6% in November over a year earlier, but have fallen 0.7% year-on-year so far this year. Sales of appliances jumped more than 22%, and have climbed 9.6% so far this year. The cash-for-clunkers and appliance recycling programs have helped keep factories humming, as has President Xi Jinping's emphasis on building up high-tech industries for 'high-quality' development. That has supported manufacturing: growth in factory output ticked up to 5.4% year-on-year from 5.3% in October. Chinese leaders pledged to take a more proactive approach in pepping up the economy after their two-day planning meeting last week, but gave no details on stimulus measures. Also Monday, the government announced a plan to upgrade the entire retail system in the coming five years, saying projects to revamp retail outlets would be rolled out across the country, providing 'business landmarks' including shopping, food and entertainment venues. The plans as outlined in state media make no mention of the key factors that economists say are leading many Chinese families to scrimp and save rather than spend: insecurity about jobs, weaker prices for property and other assets and low incomes. 'Ultimately, consumption will be driven by income growth and the propensity to save,' Oxford Economics said in a report. 'The outlook for the former is cautious and savings are being driven by concerns about the economic outlook.' Investment in fixed assets like factories and in housing construction slowed in November. Property prices fell and home sales also declined in most cities, the statistics bureau said, as China endures a downturn in its real estate market after regulators cracked down on excessive borrowing by developers that plunged the whole industry into crisis. The disruptions to jobs and businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic have further weighed on the world's second-largest economy. 'China’s economy appears to have slowed last month, despite tailwinds from recent policy easing,' Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. 'Growth still looks on course to pick up this quarter, but the disappointing November data underscores the challenge policymakers face in engineering a sustained rebound in growth.' Chinese stocks had climbed recently on renewed hopes for a stronger dose of stimulus to help counter the weak consumer sentiment that has kept the economy growing this year at a rate slightly slower than the government’s official target of about 5%. On Monday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1% while the Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.2%. The Hang Seng property index fell 1.3%. Evans-Pritchard said the impacts of a raft of policies to ease credit and support the economy would likely pick up in coming months. 'But we doubt that stimulus can deliver anything more than a short-lived improvement, not least because the current strength of export demand is unlikely to last once President Trump starts to put some of his tariff threats into action.' ___ Associated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-trump-tariffs-057555a36a1616e3e819d51c9a2a0383	2024-12-15T20:16:23-08:00	
Germany's Scholz faces a confidence vote. It's expected to lead to an election in February	BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Olaf Scholz faces a confidence vote in the German parliament on Monday that he's expected to lose, paving the way for the European Union's most populous member and biggest economy to hold an early election in February. Scholz's notoriously rancorous three-party government collapsed on Nov. 6 when the chancellor fired his finance minister in a long-running dispute over how to revitalize Germany’s stagnant economy, and the minister's pro-business party quit the coalition. That left the remaining two center-left partners without a majority in parliament. Leaders of several major parties then agreed that a parliamentary election should be held on Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally planned. Post-World War II Germany's constitution doesn't allow parliament's lower house, or Bundestag, to dissolve itself — so a confidence vote is needed to set in motion the early election. What is likely to happen? Scholz's Social Democrats hold 207 seats in the Bundestag and are expected to vote for the chancellor. Their remaining coalition partners, the environmentalist Greens, have 117 and plan to abstain. That should mean Scholz gets nowhere near the majority of 367 in the 733-seat chamber needed to win the confidence vote. If Scholz loses, it will up to up to President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve the Bundestag. Steinmeier, who said last month that 'this country needs stable majorities and a government that is capable of acting,' has 21 days to make that decision. Once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. In practice, the campaign is already well underway. Who is in the race? As he formally requested the confidence vote on Wednesday, Scholz said that voters will 'decide in the election how we answer the big questions that we face.' Those, he said, include whether Germany decides to 'invest strongly in our future,' secure jobs and modernize its industry, keep pension levels stable and 'come closer to a just peace in Ukraine without Germany being drawn into the war.' Germany has become Ukraine’s biggest military supplier in Europe, but Scholz also has refused to supply long-range Taurus cruise missiles over concerns of escalating the war with Russia. Center-right challenger Friedrich Merz on Saturday predicted 'one of the hardest election campaigns' in modern German history, as Scholz's Social Democrats 'have their backs to the wall.' He said that it's crucial to make the economy more competitive, because 'the competitiveness of our economy is the precondition for everything else.' Polls show Scholz’s party trailing behind Merz's main opposition Union bloc. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, whose Greens are further back, is also bidding for the top job. The far-right Alternative for Germany, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it. Confidence votes are rare in Germany, a country of 83 million people that prizes stability. This is only the sixth time in its postwar history that a chancellor has called one. The last was in 2005, when then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder engineered an early election that was narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-confidence-vote-parliament-election-87c6c0c64726eefaa95d9c46dae611dc	2024-12-15T20:01:44-08:00	
As Trump threatens mass deportations, Central America braces for an influx of vulnerable migrants	SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP) — As dozens of deported migrants pack into a sweltering airport facility in San Pedro Sula, Norma sits under fluorescent lights clutching a foam cup of coffee and a small plate of eggs – all that was waiting for her in Honduras. The 69-year-old Honduran mother had never imagined leaving her Central American country. But then came the anonymous death threats to her and her children and the armed men who showed up at her doorstep threatening to kill her, just like they had killed one of her relatives days earlier. Norma, who requested anonymity out of concern for her safety, spent her life savings of $10,000 on a one-way trip north at the end of October with her daughter and granddaughter. But after her asylum petitions to the U.S. were rejected, they were loaded onto a deportation flight. Now, she's back in Honduras within reach of the same gang, stuck in a cycle of violence and economic precarity that haunts deportees like her. 'They can find us in every corner of Honduras,' she said in the migrant processing facility. 'We’re praying for God’s protection, because we don’t expect anything from the government.' Now, as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office in January with a promise of carrying out mass deportations, Honduras and other Central American countries people have fled for generations are bracing for a potential influx of vulnerable migrants — a situation they are ill-prepared to handle. ‘We don’t have the capacity' Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, which have the largest number of people living illegally in the U.S., after Mexico, could be among the first and most heavily impacted by mass deportations, said Jason Houser, former Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement chief of staff in the Biden administration. Because countries like Venezuela refuse to accept deportation flights from the U.S., Houser suggests that the Trump administration may prioritize the deportation of 'the most vulnerable' migrants from those countries who have removal orders but no criminal record, in an effort to rapidly increase deportation numbers. 'Hondurans, Guatemalans, Salvadorans need to be very, very nervous because (Trump officials) are going to press the bounds of the law,' said Houser. Migrants and networks aiding deportees in those Northern Triangle countries worry their return could thrust them into even deeper economic and humanitarian crises, fueling migration down the line. 'We don’t have the capacity' to take so many people, said Antonio García, Honduras' deputy foreign minister. 'There’s very little here for deportees.' People who return, he said, 'are the last to be taken care of.' Making their way back to the US Since 2015, Honduras has received around half a million deportees. They climb down from planes and buses to be greeted with coffee, small plates of food and bags of toothpaste and deodorant. While some breathe a sigh of relief, free from harsh conditions in U.S. detention facilities, others cry, gripped with panic. 'We don’t know what we’ll do, what comes next,' said one woman in a cluster of deportees waiting for their names to be called by a man clacking at a keyboard. Approximately 560,000 Hondurans, about 5% of the country's population, live in the U.S. without legal status, according to U.S. government figures. Of those, migration experts estimate about 150,000 can be tracked down and rapidly expelled. While García said the government offers services to help returnees, most are released with little aid into a country gripped by gangs. They have few options for work to pay off crippling debts. Others like Norma have nowhere to go, unable to return home because of the gang members circling her home. Norma said she’s unsure of why they were targeted, but she believes it was because the relative who was killed had problems with a gang. Despite the crackdown, García estimates up to 40% of Honduran deportees make their way back to the U.S. A looming humanitarian crisis Larissa Martínez, 31, is among those who have struggled to reintegrate into Honduran society after being deported from the U.S. in 2021 with her three children. Driven by economic desperation and the absence of her husband, who had migrated and left her for another woman, the single mother sought a better life in the U.S. Since her return to Honduras, Martínez has spent the past three years searching for a job, not just to support her kids, but also to pay off the $5,000 she owes to relatives for the trip north. Her efforts have been unsuccessful. She built a wobbly wooden home tucked away in the hilly fringes of San Pedro Sula, where she sells meat and cheese to get by, but sales have been slim and tropical rains have eaten away at the flimsy walls where they sleep. So she's begun to repeat a chant in her head: 'If I don’t find work in December, I’ll leave in January.' César Muñoz, a leader at Mennonite Social Action Commission, said Honduran authorities have abandoned deportees like Martínez, leaving organizations like his to step in. But with three deportation flights arriving weekly, aid networks are already stretched thin. A significant uptick could leave aid networks, migrants and their families reeling. Meanwhile, countries like Honduras, heavily reliant on remittances from the U.S., could face severe economic consequences as this vital lifeline is cut. 'We’re at the brink of a new humanitarian crisis,' Muñoz said. Trump’s return has been met with a range of reactions by Latin American nations connected to the U.S. through migration and trade. Guatemala, a country with more than 750,000 citizens living unauthorized in the U.S. , announced in November it was working on a strategy to take on potential mass deportations. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico is already beefing up legal services in its U.S. consulates and that she would ask Trump to deport non-Mexicans directly to their countries of origin. Honduras’ Deputy Foreign Minister García expressed skepticism about Trump’s threat, citing the economic benefits immigrants provide to the U.S. economy and the logistical challenges of mass deportations. Aid leaders like Muñoz say Honduras isn’t sufficiently preparing for a potential surge in deportations. Even with a crackdown by Trump it would be 'impossible' to stop people from migrating, García said. Driven by poverty, violence and the hope for a better life, clusters of deportees climb aboard buses on their way back to the U.S. As deportations by both U.S. and Mexican authorities spike, smugglers are offering migrants packages in which they get three tries to make it north. If migrants get captured on their journey and sent back home, they still have two chances to get to the U.S. Freshly returned to Honduras, 26-year-old Kimberly Orellana said she spent three months detained in a Texas facility before being sent back to San Pedro Sula, where she waited in a bus station for her mother to pick her up. Yet, she was already planning to return, saying she had no choice: her 4-year-old daughter Marcelle was waiting for her, cared for by a friend in North Carolina. The two were separated by smugglers crossing the Rio Grande, in hopes to increase their chances of successfully crossing over. Orellana vowed to her daughter that they would be reunited. 'Mami, are you sure you’re coming?' Marcelle asks her over the phone. 'Now, being here it’s difficult to know if I’ll ever be able to follow through with that promise,' Orellana said, clinging to her Honduran passport. 'I have to try again. … My daughter is all I have.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/honduras-trump-mass-deportations-central-america-immigration-c28e71c590a9f3df2d607df13b956656	2024-12-15T19:17:21-08:00	
Zakir Hussain, one of India's most accomplished classical musicians, dies at 73	NEW DELHI (AP) — Zakir Hussain, one of India's most accomplished classical musicians who defied genres and introduced tabla to global audiences, died on Sunday. He was 73. The Indian classical music icon died from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic lung disease, at a hospital in San Francisco, his family said in a statement. 'His prolific work as a teacher, mentor and educator has left an indelible mark on countless musicians. He hoped to inspire the next generation to go further. He leaves behind an unparalleled legacy as a cultural ambassador and one of the greatest musicians of all time,' the statement read. Hussain was the most recognizable exponent of tabla, a pair of hand drums that is the main percussion instrument in Indian classical music. Considered the greatest tabla player of his generation, Hussain had a career that spanned six decades in which he collaborated with the likes of singer-songwriter George Harrison, jazz saxophonist Charles Lloyd, drummer Mickey Hart and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. The son of legendary tabla artist Alla Rakha, Hussain was born in 1951 in Mumbai and was taught how to play the instrument by his father at the age of 7. A child prodigy, he was touring by age 12 and performing alongside India’s classical music legends during his teens. In an interview that was shared widely on social media in India, Hussain says his father welcomed him into the world after he was born by speaking tabla rhythms into his ears. 'I was brought home, handed over to my dad in his arms. The tradition was that the father is supposed to recite a prayer in the baby’s ear ... So he takes me in his arms, puts his lips to my ear and recites the tabla rhythms into my ears,' Hussain says in the interview, verbally imitating the rhythmic pattern of the instrument. Both Alla Rakha and Hussain were given the honorific 'Ustad,' an Urdu word that means master. In 1973, Hussain formed the Indian jazz fusion band 'Shakti' with jazz guitarist John McLaughlin. The band played acoustic fusion music that combined Indian music with elements of jazz, introducing a new sound to Western audiences. In 2024, Hussain became the first musician from India to win three Grammy awards in the same year. Hussain’s 'Shakti' won Best Global Music Album, and his collaboration with Edgar Meyer, Béla Fleck and flutist Rakesh Chaurasia won Best Global Music Performance and Best Contemporary Instrumental Album. He had earlier won a Grammy in 2009. In 2023, Hussain received the Padma Vibhushan, India’s second-highest civilian award. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Hussain a 'true genius who revolutionized the world of Indian classical music' and 'an icon of cultural unity.' 'He also brought the tabla to the global stage, captivating millions with his unparalleled rhythm,' Modi wrote in a post on social platform X. Hussain is survived by his wife and two daughters.	https://apnews.com/article/india-zakir-hussain-tabla-musician-obituary-4e6b09e2a85a35e417d486188c433fe2	2024-12-15T19:12:45-08:00	
Filipino woman who was on death row in Indonesia will return home after almost 15 years in prison	YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A Filipino woman who was on death row in Indonesia — and was nearly executed by firing squad in 2015 — was moved late Sunday to a female prison in Indonesia’s capital, from where she will be flown back to her home country. Mary Jane Veloso, who spent almost 15 years in an Indonesian prison for drug trafficking, was allowed to return home after Indonesia and the Philippines signed a 'practical arrangement' deal on Dec. 6, after a decade of pleading from Manila. In a tearful interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday, Veloso described the decision as being 'like a miracle when I have lost all hope.' 'For almost 15 years I was separated from my children and parents, and I could not see my children grow up,' she said. 'I wish to be given an opportunity to take care of my children and to be close to my parents.' Veloso, who will turn 40 next month, was arrested in 2010 at an airport in the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, where officials discovered about 2.6 kilograms (5.7 pounds) of heroin hidden in her luggage. The single mother of two sons was convicted and sentenced to death. Veloso has maintained her innocence throughout her 14 years of incarceration. She has spent her time in prison designing Indonesian batik clothing, painting, tailoring and learning other skills. Just before midnight on Sunday, she was escorted through a crush of reporters outside a female prison in Yogyakarta into a waiting van that took her to Jakarta, about 460 kilometers (285 miles) away. Wearing a black T-shirt and dark pants, she made only a brief comment to reporters, saying, 'I’m so happy... Thank you so much and Merry Christmas!' from behind the vehicle's window. Veloso’s case caused a public outcry in the Philippines. She traveled to Indonesia in 2010 where her recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio, reportedly told her a job as a domestic worker awaited her. Sergio also allegedly provided the suitcase where the drugs were found. In 2015, Indonesia moved Veloso to an island prison where she and eight other drug convicts were scheduled to be executed by firing squad despite objections from Australia, Brazil, France, Ghana and Nigeria. Indonesia executed the eight other convicts, and Veloso was granted a stay of execution because Sergio was arrested in the Philippines just two days ahead of her scheduled execution. The reprieve provided an opportunity for Veloso’s testimony to expose how a criminal syndicate duped her into being an unwitting accomplice and courier in drug trafficking. Yogyakarta female prison’s chief warden, Evi Loliancy, said Veloso was involved in various prison activities arranged by correctional officers, including organizing fashion shows featuring designs by inmates and learning how to dance. 'Mary Jane loves helping her fellow inmates, and she is able to motivate them to be creative,' Loliancy said. 'She will miss us so much and so do we here.' She said Veloso was very happy when she learned that she would be reunited with her family, but also a bit nervous and sad when she was about to leave. 'But we all cheered her on and wish all the best for her,' Loliancy said. Veloso will need to stay for a few days at the Pondok Bambu female prison in Jakarta while waiting for her flight tickets and travel documents, said Sohibur Rachman, an official at the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections. Rachman said his ministry was coordinating with the Philippine Embassy in Jakarta on repatriating Veloso. He has not said when her return will take place but unconfirmed reports said her flight to Manila is scheduled for early Wednesday. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population. Indonesia’s last executions were carried out in July 2016, when an Indonesian and three foreigners were shot by firing squad. About 530 people are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including 96 foreigners, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections’ data showed as of last month. Five Australians who spent almost 20 years in Indonesian prisons for heroin trafficking returned to Australia on Sunday under a deal struck between the Indonesian and Australian governments. Indonesia recently agreed in principle to return a French national to his home country. ___ Karmini reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.

South Korean investigators push to summon impeached President Yoon, as court set determine his fate	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean law enforcement authorities are pushing to summon impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree as the Constitutional Court began its first meeting Monday on Yoon’s case to determine whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. A joint investigative team involving police, an anti-corruption agency and the Defense Ministry said it plans to convey a request to Yoon’s office that he appear for questioning on Wednesday, as they expand a probe into whether his ill-conceived power grab amounted to rebellion. Son Yeong-jo, an investigator with the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, said the team plans to question Yoon on charges of rebellion and abuse of power. He declined to provide specifics when asked how investigators would respond if Yoon refuses to appear. Son said the team tried to deliver the summons request to the presidential office but was rerouted to Yoon’s personal residence after presidential secretarial staff claimed they were unsure whether conveying the request to the impeached president was part of their duties. Yoon was impeached by the opposition-controlled National Assembly on Saturday over his Dec. 3 martial law decree. His presidential powers will be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him. If Yoon is dismissed, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days. Yoon has justified his martial law enforcement as a necessary act of governance against the main liberal opposition Democratic Party that he described as 'anti-state forces' bogging down his agendas and vowed to 'fight to the end' against efforts to remove him from office. Hundreds of thousands of protesters have poured onto the streets of the country’s capital, Seoul, in recent days, calling for Yoon’s ouster and arrest. It remains unclear whether Yoon will grant the request by investigators for an interview. South Korean prosecutors, who are pushing a separate investigation into the incident, also reportedly asked Yoon to appear at a prosecution office for questioning on Sunday but he refused to do so. Repeated calls to a prosecutors’ office in Seoul were unanswered. Yoon’s presidential security service has also resisted a police attempt to search Yoon's office for evidence. The request came before the Constitutional Court met Monday to discuss the case. The court has up to 180 days to rule. But observers say that a court ruling could come faster. In the case of parliamentary impeachments of past presidents — Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 and Park Geun-hye in 2016 — the court spent 63 days and 91 days respectively before determining to reinstate Roh and dismiss Park. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became the country’s acting leader after Yoon's impeachment, and other government officials have sought to reassure allies and markets after Yoon’s surprise stunt paralyzed politics, halted high-level diplomacy and complicated efforts to revive a faltering economy. Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung urged the Constitutional Court to rule swiftly on Yoon’s impeachment and proposed a special council for policy cooperation between the government and parliament. Lee, a firebrand lawmaker who drove a political offensive against Yoon’s government, is seen as the frontrunner to replace him. He lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon by a razor-thin margin. Kweon Seong-dong, floor leader of Yoon’s conservative People Power Party, separately criticized Lee’s proposal for the special council, saying that it’s 'not right' for the opposition party to act like the ruling party. Yoon’s impeachment, which was endorsed in parliament by some of his ruling People Power Party lawmakers, has created a deep rift within the party between Yoon’s loyalists and his opponents. On Monday, PPP chair Han Dong-hun, a strong critic of Yoon's martial law, announced his resignation. 'If martial law had not been lifted that night, a bloody incident could have erupted that morning between the citizens who would have taken to the streets and our young soldiers,' Han told a news conference. Yoon’s Dec. 3 imposition of martial law, the first of its kind in more than four decades, harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders the country has not seen since the 1980s. Yoon was forced to lift his decree hours later after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it. Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament in an effort to stop the vote, but they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred. Opposition parties have accused Yoon of rebellion, saying a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and would have no right to suspend parliament’s operations even in those cases.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-investigation-constitutional-court-8ec38d61f0ea5c48b3bd1f683b5e9c8d	2024-12-15T15:39:12-08:00	
Referee briefly stops French league match between PSG and Lyon after homophobic chants	A French league soccer match between Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon was briefly interrupted Sunday because of homophobic chanting by PSG fans. Referee Benoît Bastien stopped play in the 53rd minute at the Parc des Princes with host PSG leading 2-1 after the chants were heard. PSG captain Achraf Hakimi approached fans in the Auteuil stand behind one of the goals to ask them to stop. A message reminding fans that discriminatory chants are forbidden was then displayed on the stadium's giant screens. 'The match could be stopped or even lost for the club,' the message read. Play eventually resumed after a few minutes. The chants in Paris were just the latest in a long series of similar incidents as French soccer authorities struggle to tackle the issue. France’s Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau suggested earlier this year that matches should be halted when fans chant homophobic slurs in stadiums. Earlier this month, a French campaign group renewed calls for authorities to take action against homophobic chanting by soccer fans, saying Marseille supporters belted out anti-gay slurs 'with complete impunity' during a home game against Monaco. Homophobic insults often heard at Ligue 1 matches have been tolerated for a long time by club officials, and soccer authorities have struggled to find appropriate ways of tackling the issue. In 2019, following a match at the Parc des Princes between PSG and Marseille during which home fans used homophobic insults, the league launched an action plan allowing spectators to report sexist, homophobic or racist incidents they witness. The abuse has not stopped, though, even intensifying in recent months. French clubs have been sanctioned with fines, and the league’s disciplinary commission also ordered the closure of stands for similar cases in recent years. Also, French law provides for up to one year imprisonment and a 45,000 euro ($47,600) fine when anti-gay insults are made in public. Last season, some PSG players received a one-match suspended sentence by the league disciplinary committee for offensive chants aimed at Marseille after a home league match. Ousmane Dembélé, Hakimi, Randal Kolo Muani and Layvin Kurzawa were filmed using insults while celebrating at the end of a 4-0 win against Marseille. The four players issued apologies. That match was also marred by homophobic chanting by sections of PSG fans targeting Marseille players. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/psg-homophobic-chants-soccer-french-league-0a08eebb6aef5e0d9007cb7d2d10b301	2024-12-15T13:51:49-08:00	
West Africa regional bloc sets up court for crimes under dictatorship in Gambia	SERREKUNDA, Gambia (AP) — West Africa's regional bloc ECOWAS on Sunday approved setting up a special court to try crimes committed in Gambia during its military dictatorship. The landmark decision was announced at the summit of regional heads of state in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. The court will cover alleged crimes committed under military dictator Yahya Jammeh, whose rule from 1996 to 2017 was marked by arbitrary detention, sexual abuse and extrajudicial killings. Jammeh lost a presidential election in 2016 and went into exile in Equatorial Guinea a year later after initially refusing to step down. Calls for justice for the victims of the dictatorship had been growing for years in Gambia, a country surrounded by Senegal except for a small Atlantic coastline. In 2021, a truth commission in the country wrapped up its hearings with strong recommendations, urging the government to try perpetrators. In May, Jammeh's former interior minister was sentenced to 20 years in jail by a Swiss court for this crimes against humanity. In November, a German court convicted a Gambian man, Bai Lowe, of murder and crimes against humanity for involvement in the killing of government critics in Gambia. The man was a driver for a military unit deployed against opponents of Jammeh. Gambia’s Justice Ministry described the move as a 'historic development' that 'marks a significant step forward for Gambia, the region, and international community' in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/gambia-jammeh-court-ecowas-33f48f01de800ad437db15f0a91f3a2f	2024-12-15T13:18:31-08:00	
Four men arrested in North Macedonia during anti-terror operation, interior minister says	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — Four men suspected of planning terrorist attacks were arrested Sunday in western North Macedonia, authorities said. Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski said the arrests were made during raids on several locations in the western towns of Struga and Gostivar. The four men are suspected of being 'part of terrorist organizations (and) have been under surveillance for a long time.' All are Macedonian nationals and were expected to face an investigating magistrate Sunday. Toshkovski did not specify what terrorist organizations the suspects were connected with. 'We have reasonable suspicion that they are connected to groups supporting certain extremist and religious organizations,' he said. 'Their goal (was) to indoctrinate other people from the Balkans who would act accordingly towards the realization of their plans,' Toshkovski added. The suspects face up to eight years in prison if convicted of planned terrorism charges. In December 2020, North Macedonia police arrested eight men on suspicion of planning terrorist attacks on individuals and public buildings in the name of the Islamic State group.	https://apnews.com/article/north-macedonia-arrests-terrorism-eb62bf25df9812bdd86d5eb7aa7e184f	2024-12-15T08:58:34-08:00	
Violent scenes in Glasgow city center ahead of Scottish League Cup final between Celtic and Rangers	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — Police said missiles were thrown at officers during violent scenes in Glasgow on Sunday ahead of the Scottish League Cup final between rivals Celtic and Rangers. Police said there were also reports of broken windows and that officers would use stop and search powers to 'prevent disorder and serious violence.' Videos shared on social media appeared to show flares let off in Glasgow city center and gangs of masked people running through the streets. Some shoppers could be seen taking cover in a store entrance as people charged past. 'We have dealt with a number of incidents in Glasgow city center today involving individuals engaging in disorder and violence across the city,' chief superintendent Stevie Dolan said in a statement. 'The use of weapons or violence will not be tolerated and officers will take action where necessary to ensure safety. 'It impacts other members of the public and the vast majority of football supporters who want to enjoy the cup final event safely.' Celtic and Rangers are both based in Glasgow and have one of the fiercest rivalries in British soccer.

French police detain man and seize firearms after 5 people shot dead near Dunkirk	DUNKIRK, France (AP) — French police are investigating the deaths of five people who were fatally shot in the Dunkirk area, in northern France, on Saturday. A 22-year-old man later turned himself in to police, according to authorities and local media. An unnamed company owner in Wormhout, located south of Dunkirk, was killed first, followed by two private security agents and two migrants in Loon-Plage, located just west of Dunkirk, according to the Interior Ministry. Dunkirk's prosecutor said the suspect gave himself up to the gendarmerie brigade in Ghyvelde, east of Dunkirk, at about 5:20 p.m. and said he had killed five people.

Israel will close its Ireland embassy over Gaza tensions as Palestinian death toll nears 45,000	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel said Sunday it will close its embassy in Ireland as relations deteriorated over the war in Gaza, where Palestinian medical officials said new Israeli airstrikes killed over 30 people including several children. The decision to close the embassy came in response to what Israel’s foreign minister has described as Ireland’s 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' In May, Israel recalled its ambassador to Dublin after Ireland announced, along with Norway, Spain and Slovenia, it would recognize a Palestinian state. The Irish cabinet last week decided to formally intervene in South Africa’s case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, which accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Israel denies it. 'We are concerned that a very narrow interpretation of what constitutes genocide leads to a culture of impunity in which the protection of civilians is minimized,' Ireland’s deputy premier and foreign affairs minister, Micheal Martin, said in a statement. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar's statement on the embassy closure said that 'Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel.' Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris called the decision to close the embassy 'deeply regrettable.' He added on X: 'I utterly reject the assertion that Ireland is anti-Israel. Ireland is pro-peace, pro-human rights and pro-international law.' Israeli strikes in Gaza kill a journalist and children Israeli forces continued Sunday to pound largely isolated northern Gaza, as the Palestinian death toll in the war approached 45,000. One airstrike hit the Khalil Aweida school in the town of Beit Hanoun and killed at least 15 people, according to nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital where casualties were taken. The dead included two parents and their daughter and a father and his son, the hospital said. In Gaza City, at least 17 people including six women and five children were killed in three airstrikes that hit houses sheltering displaced people, according to Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital. 'We woke up to the strike. I woke up with the rubble on top of me,' said a bandaged Yahia al-Yazji, who grieved for his wife and daughter. 'I found my wife with her head and skull visible, and my daughter’s intestines were gone. My wife was three months pregnant.' His hand rested on a body wrapped in a blanket on the floor. Israel's military in a statement said it struck a 'terrorist cell' in Gaza City and a 'terrorist meeting point' in the Beit Hanoun area. Another Israeli airstrike killed a Palestinian journalist working for Al Jazeera, Ahmed al-Lawh, in central Gaza, a hospital and the Qatari-based TV station said. The strike hit a point for Gaza’s civil defense agency in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp, Al-Awda Hospital said. Also killed were three civil defense workers including the head of the agency in Nuseirat, according to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital. The civil defense is Gaza's main rescue agency and operates under the Hamas-run government. The war in Gaza began after Hamas and other militants from Gaza stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking well over 200 hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed almost 45,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry’s count does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but it says over half of the dead have been women and children. ___ Melzer reported from Nahariya, Israel.

Brazilian President Lula discharged from hospital after surgery to stop brain bleed	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was discharged from the hospital Sunday after undergoing surgery to stop a brain bleed. The 79-year-old president spoke alongside doctors in a press conference on Sunday morning in a show that he was doing well following the head surgery. 'I’m here alive, well, with the urge to work. And I’ll tell you something I used to say during the campaign. I’m 79 years old, I have the energy of 30 and the enthusiasm of 20 to build this country,' Lula said. Lula's medical team said the surgery went well and that Lula would be able to walk and hold meetings as he rests in his home in the city of Sao Paulo until Thursday. The leader's doctors said international travel would be out of the question until further notice, but that he'd be able to travel to the country's capital, Brasilia, if all goes well in a medical exam. The president also offered his first comments on Saturday's arrest of Gen. Walter Braga Netto, a former member of President Jair Bolsonaro’s government and his 2022 running mate, in connection with investigations into an alleged coup plot. Lula has largely avoided commenting on the case because of ongoing investigations. 'It is not possible for us to accept disrespect for democracy, disrespect for the constitution. And it is not possible for us to accept that in a generous country like Brazil we have people of high military rank plotting the death of a president, his vice president and a presiding judge of the supreme electoral court,' said Lula. Braga Netto was indicted in November, along with Bolsonaro and 35 others, on charges of plotting a coup to keep Bolsonaro in office after his failed 2022 reelection bid. Prosecutors have not yet filed formal charges against Braga Netto. His arrest was related to allegations of obstructing the collection of evidence, the Federal Police said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-surgery-628cff2dc0c07ccaf003093c4c5e7218	2024-12-15T06:17:33-08:00	
Ukrainian drone hits Russia's Chechnya as Kyiv continues pushback after Moscow bombardment	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone struck a campus belonging to Russia’s National Guard Sunday in the Russian region of Chechnya, as Kyiv continues to strike back after a mass air attack from Moscow. Footage on social media showed a drone swooping low over the Chechen capital, Grozny, some 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of the front line in Ukraine, before exploding. No casualties were reported. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov confirmed that the drone had hit a site belonging to the Akhmat Grozny riot police battalion, and said that two other drones had been shot down by air defenses. Kadyrov pledged revenge on Ukrainian forces and said he had ordered a missile strike against military facilities in Kharkiv in retaliation for the attack. The claim could not be independently verified. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that it had shot down 15 Ukrainian drones overnight in the country’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, as well as over the Black Sea. It did not mention the Grozny attack. An official in Ukraine’s security service also told the AP on Sunday that Ukrainian intelligence services had conducted a special operation to sever Russia’s logistic fuel supply routes from Ukraine’s annexed Crimea to occupied Zaporizhzhia. The operation, which took place Saturday, destroyed a locomotive and 40 tanker cars, the security official said. A sabotage operation reportedly blew up railway tracks while the train was moving, before HIMARS rocket launch systems joined the attack. 'As a result, a key railway branch used to supply Russian troops was put out of service for an extended period,' said the official, who asked to remain anonymous in order to share sensitive information. Kyiv’s strikes on Russia over the weekend, which also set fire to a major oil terminal on Saturday, follow a mass bombardment across Ukraine by Moscow Friday. Russia fired 93 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 drones at its neighbor, battering Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Russia’s troops also continue to slowly advance in eastern Ukraine. Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War reported Sunday that geolocated footage placed Russian forces inside the settlement of Kurakhove, which Moscow’s troops had besieged for weeks after surrounding it on three sides. The push compounds further uncertainty as to how the war might unfold next year, with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, sparking doubt as to whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue. In an interview published in TIME magazine Thursday, Trump said that he was against allowing Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil using U.S.-provided weapons. Meanwhile, Russia launched 108 drones across Ukraine overnight into Sunday, the Ukrainian air force said. It said that 56 were shot down by air defenses, while another 49 disappeared from radar after failing to reach their targets. Three more drones returned to Russia, officials said. Gov. Vitalii Kim said that two people were injured in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv as a result of the attack, which also damaged local infrastructure. —— Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-grozny-drone-attack-7655bcd300e3e11e28f571a613d59ef0	2024-12-15T05:44:10-08:00	
Tis the season for roasting chestnuts. But in the US, native ones are almost gone	It's been a very long time since vendors sold the American chestnut on city sidewalks. It's no longer the variety whose smell some people associate with Christmastime as it wafts from street carts. Because it's virtually extinct. But memories of the American chestnut's legacy keep resurfacing for the researchers who want to bring it back. They describe its wood that paneled the homes and schoolrooms of their grandparents, or the photographs of men on the street corners of old Baltimore, with hot bags of nuts cooked on charcoal. 'You can feel that connection to a place, and that connection to utility, and the connection to the importance that this tree played in virtually every aspect of the lives of people,' said Sara Fern Fitzsimmons, chief conservation officer with The American Chestnut Foundation, which is working to restore the tree to flourish as it once did. Fitzsimmons said that will likely take a lot longer than many chestnut enthusiasts had hoped. Researchers have hit roadblocks with attempts to breed or genetically modify a version that can withstand the invasive blight that has hammered the species since the early 1900s. If and when they do find the right variety, they'll need to figure out how to plant it and help it thrive in forests that are under pressure from climate change, globalization and development. Once a hallmark of forests from Georgia to New England, American chestnuts now exist mostly as a vast network of root systems underground, sending up shoots. They grow for a time, but the fungal blight takes hold when the trees start maturing. East Asian varieties, like those that introduced the blight in the first place, are immune to the blight, and produce most of the edible chestnuts for fall and winter snacking. Still, American chestnut trees are better suited for timber, they're culturally loved by people all over North America and they used to be an important species for the ecological health of forests, providing a reliable source of nutritious food and shelter for wildlife and humans alike. 'It was really a pretty significant species to lose,' said Amy Brunner, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who works on the tree's genetics. 'The more diversity you lose, the less resilient that forest ecosystem is.' The American Chestnut Foundation, among others, has been trying for decades to breed a hybrid that is mostly American in genetics but with the fungus-fighting traits of the Chinese type. Fitzsimmons said breeders have learned just how difficult that is — blight resistance involves several different genes and it has proven hard to separate them from the traits that distinguish Chinese chestnuts. To speed the process, some scientists have been working on genetically modifying American chestnuts to see if they can boost their immunity that way instead. But progress was delayed by a recent mix-up involving two versions of a genetically modified American chestnut that scientists at State University of New York had hoped could get through the regulatory process as soon as this year. 'It kind of stinks that it happened because now it’s taking a little bit longer than we had hoped,' said Linda McGuigan, a research support specialist at the university. But scientists there and elsewhere are continuing to pursue many avenues. 'I don’t think you will get there, to all you desire, without both,' Brunner said, referring to the two main methods of breeding and genetic modification. Breeding is vital for achieving enough genetic diversity for trees to adapt to a changing world, she said, but added that she thinks some genetic manipulation will be needed to get to enough blight resistance for American chestnuts to stand a chance. Meanwhile, other scientists are working on projects to tackle another big challenge ahead for chestnuts: where to plant them. If a successful tree is cobbled together with genes taken from trees from Tennessee to New York, where would it have the best chance at surviving, given how a warming planet is changing habitat around the world? A team at Virginia Tech published a paper this summer to try to answer that question. They looked at 32 climate variables and compared them to projected future climates, then calculated the shortest distance that regionally specific American chestnuts would have to move to offset warming. The idea was to one day help them survive a new climate while keeping them as close as possible to where they once thrived. 'I don’t think it’s hyperbolic to say it’s revolutionary' for teams at The American Chestnut Foundation, said Fitzsimmons, who contributed data to the project. She said the project will help them better figure out where to collect genes from the immature trees that remain across the country. Tom Kimmerer, a forest scientist who taught at the University of Kentucky, is working on a book about trees including the American chestnut. Kimmerer, who was not involved in the research, called it 'robust and well supported' and 'critically important to the success of the chestnut.' Stacy Clark, a research forester at the U.S. Forest Service, said the findings are useful, but added that they need to be backed up with real-world experiments. 'I think with advancements in genetics, they can probably get pretty fast data off of those field trials. But still, all of that takes time and effort, right?' For now, forest scientists know their work might not pay off in their lifetimes. It's a lesson that became clear for the community when pioneering chestnut restoration experts Bill Powell and Chuck Maynard both died in the past 13 months. McGuigan supported both of their research for years as lab manager at SUNY's college of environmental science and forestry. 'The project moves on, lives on. And we honor their memory,' McGuigan said. 'I want to do something good for the future, for my children.' ___ Follow Melina Walling on X @MelinaWalling and Bluesky @melinawalling.bsky.social. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Russia launches a rescue operation after a storm damages 2 oil tankers in the Kerch Strait	MOSCOW (AP) — Two Russian oil tankers have taken heavy damage amid a storm in the Kerch Strait, spilling oil and sparking an emergency rescue operation, Russian officials told state news outlets Sunday. The Volgoneft-212 tanker, which was carrying a crew of 13 and a cargo of fuel oil, ran aground and had its bow torn away, said Russian state news agency TASS, citing the country’s Emergency Situations Ministry. The damage was caused by severe weather conditions, officials said. A second tanker, the Volgoneft 239, was also damaged in the storm and left drifting in the same area with 14 crewmembers on board, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. The Kerch Strait separates the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula from Russia and is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to illegally seize control of the area. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-kerch-strait-oil-shipping-transport-storm-4eed65f6d8d999b5451d36d414af2e8e	2024-12-15T03:00:48-08:00	
Christians in Syria mark country's transformation with tears as UN envoy urges an end to sanctions	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — In churches across long-stifled Syria, Christians marked the first Sunday services since Bashar Assad's ouster in an air of transformation. Some worshippers were in tears. Others clasped their hands in prayer. 'They are promising us that government will be formed soon and, God willing, things will become better because we got rid of the tyrant,' said one worshipper, Jihad Raffoul. 'Today, our prayers are for a new page in Syria’s future,' said another, Suzan Barakat. To help those efforts, the U.N. envoy for Syria called for a quick end to Western sanctions as the country’s new leaders and regional and global powers discuss the way forward. Syria has been under sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others for years as a result of Assad’s brutal response to what began as peaceful anti-government protests in 2011 and spiraled into civil war. The rebel alliance that ousted Assad and sent him into exile in Russia a week ago faces a nation deeply isolated by the sanctions, which compounded Syria’s economic troubles. But other challenges also complicate rebuilding. The new transitional leadership has not laid out a clear vision of how the country will be governed, and the main group behind the offensive remains designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., which nevertheless has begun making direct contact with it. The U.N. envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, told reporters in Damascus that the rebels' stunningly fast offensive should be followed by a rapid international response. 'We can hopefully see a quick end to the sanctions so that we can see really a rallying around building of Syria,' he said. Parts of Syria’s biggest cities are damaged or destroyed by years of fighting. Reconstruction has been stymied largely by the sanctions that aimed to prevent rebuilding of infrastructure and property in government-held areas in the absence of a political solution. The U.N. envoy was meeting with officials from the new interim government set up by the former opposition forces who toppled Assad, led by the Islamic militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Officials in Washington have indicated that the Biden administration is considering removing the group's terror designation. Over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended an emergency meeting in Jordan with 12 foreign ministers from the Arab League, Turkey and top officials from the European Union and United Nations on how Syria should be run after a half-century of Assad family rule. They agreed that the new government should respect the rights of minorities and women, prevent terror groups from taking hold, ensure humanitarian aid reaches those in need and secure and destroy any remaining Assad-era chemical weapons. Syria's interim government is set to rule until March, but it has not made clear the process under which a new permanent administration would replace it. Arab foreign ministers have called for U.N.-supervised elections based on a new constitution approved by Syrians. 'We need to get the political process underway that is inclusive of all Syrians,' Pedersen said. 'That process obviously needs to be led by the Syrians themselves.' He also called for ' justice and accountability for crimes' committed during the war, as some families continued to search for the tens of thousands of people that Assad's government had placed in prisons and detention facilities. Many Syrian Christians, who made up 10% of the population before Syria’s civil war, had either fled the country or supported Assad out of fear of Islamist insurgents. Last Sunday's church services were canceled. 'We were scared of the events taking place,' said Ibrahim Shahin, a Catholic church supervisor. But this Sunday, doors reopened and bells rang out. In another sign of Syrians’ yearning for normalcy after the whirlwind of events, schools in Damascus reopened Sunday for the first time since the insurgents marched in the capital. At Nahla Zaidan school in the Mezzah neighborhood, teachers hoisted the three-starred revolutionary flag in place of the former government’s two-starred one. 'Although I think some of them are afraid, they came to build Syria and to live the victories of this country,' said Maysoun Al-Ali, the school director. 'God willing, there will be more development, more security and more construction in this beloved country.' ___ Associated Press writers Abdulrahman Shaheen and Sally Abou AlJoud contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-sanctions-un-3f0031108d7e58c2343bd6a8fd42254c	2024-12-15T01:30:14-08:00	
At least 11 dead in the French territory of Mayotte as Cyclone Chido causes devastating damage	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — At least 11 people have died after Cyclone Chido caused devastating damage in the French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, France's Interior Ministry said Sunday. The intense tropical cyclone has now made landfall on the east coast of Africa, where aid agencies are warning of more loss of life and severe damage in northern Mozambique. The ministry said it was proving difficult to get a precise tally of the dead and injured in Mayotte amid fears the death toll will increase. A local hospital reported that nine people were in critical condition there and 246 others were injured. The tropical cyclone blew through the southeastern Indian Ocean, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in its path and suffered extensive damage on Saturday, officials said. The local prefect said it was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Saturday night after an emergency meeting in Paris that there were fears that the death toll in Mayotte 'will be high' and the island had been largely devastated. Prime Minister François Bayrou, who took office on Friday, said public infrastructure on Mayotte had been severely damaged or destroyed, including the main hospital and the airport. He said many people living in precarious shacks in slum areas have faced very serious risks. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale. Mayotte has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands about 800 kilometers (500 miles) off Africa’s east coast. It is France's poorest island and the European Union's poorest territory. In some parts, entire neighborhoods were flattened, while local residents reported many trees had been uprooted and boats had been flipped or sunk. The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to 'help the population and prevent potential looting.' More than 100 rescuers and firefighters have been deployed in Mayotte from France and the nearby territory of Reunion, and an additional reinforcement of 140 people was due to be sent on Sunday. Supplies were being rushed in on military aircraft and ships. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was closely monitoring the situation, while Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims of the cyclone while on a visit Sunday to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica. Chido continued its eastern trajectory and made landfall early Sunday in Mozambique on the African mainland, where emergency officials had warned that 2.5 million people could be impacted in two northern provinces, Cabo Delgado and Nampula. Landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe are also preparing to be affected, with both countries warning they might have to evacuate people from low-lying areas because of flooding. In Mozambique, the United Nations Children's Fund said Cabo Delgado province, home to around 2 million people, had been hit hard. 'Many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed and we are working closely with government to ensure continuity of essential basic services,' UNICEF said. 'While we are doing everything we can, additional support is urgently needed.' UNICEF Mozambique spokesman Guy Taylor said in a video posted by the group from Cabo Delgado's regional capital that alongside the immediate impact of the cyclone, communities now face the prospect of being cut off from schools and health facilities for weeks. December through to March is cyclone season in the southeastern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries last year. The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne disease cholera as well as dengue fever and malaria. Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in southern Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global warming, having to deal with large humanitarian crises, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impact of climate change. —— Corbet reported from Paris. —— AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/cyclone-chido-mayotte-deaths-weather-climate-2b49b97217a47e2013dc9021d9324eb5	2024-12-15T01:24:09-08:00	
Pope Francis makes 1st papal visit to France's Corsica awash in expressions of popular piety	AJACCIO, Corsica (AP) — Pope Francis on the first papal visit ever to the French island of Corsica on Sunday called for a dynamic form of laicism, promoting the kind of popular piety that distinguishes the Mediterranean island from secular France as a bridge between religious and civic society. Francis appeared relaxed and energized during the one-day visit, just two days before his 88th birthday, still displaying a faded bruise from a fall a week ago. He frequently deviated from his prepared homily during Mass at the outdoor La Place d’Austerlitz, remarking at one point that he had never seen so many children as in Corsica — except, he added, in East Timor on his recent Asian tour. 'Make children,″ he implored. 'They will be your joy and your consolation in the future.' Earlier, at the close of a Mediterranean conference on popular piety, Papa Francescu, as he is called in Corsican, described a concept of secularity 'that is not static and fixed, but evolving and dynamic,' that can adapt to 'unforeseen situations' and promote cooperation 'between civil and ecclesial authorities.' The pontiff said that expressions of popular piety, including processions and communal prayer of the Holy Rosary 'can nurture constructive citizenship' on the part of Christians. At the same time, he warned against such manifestations being seen only in terms of folklore, or even superstition. The visit to Corsica’s capital Ajaccio, the birthplace of Napoleon, is one of the briefest of his papacy beyond Italy’s borders, just about nine hours on the ground, including a 40-minute visit with French President Emmanuel Macron. Francis met privately with Macron at the airport before flying back to Rome. Francis was joined on the dais by the bishop of Ajaccio, Cardinal Francois-Xavier Bustillo, who organized the conference that brought together some 400 participants from Spain, Sicily, Sardinia and southern France. The two-day meeting examined expressions of faith that often occur outside formal liturgies, such as processions and pilgrimages. Often specific to the places where they are practiced, popular piety in Corsica includes the cult of the Virgin Mary, known locally as the 'Madunnuccia,' which protected the island from the plague in 1656 when it was still under Genoa. Corsica stands out from the rest of secularized France as a particularly devout region, with 92 confraternities, or lay associations dedicated to works of charity or piety, with over 4,000 members. 'It means that there is a beautiful, mature, adult and responsible collaboration between civil authorities, mayors, deputies, senators, officials and religious authorities,’’ Bustillo told The Associated Press ahead of the visit. 'There is no hostility between the two. And that is a very positive aspect because in Corsica there is no ideological hostility.' The visit was awash in signs of popular piety. The pope was greeted by children in traditional garb and was continually serenaded by bands, choruses and singing troupes that are central to Corsican culture from the airport, to the motorcade route, convention center and cathedral. Thousands stood along the roadside to greet the pontiff and more waved from windows. Renè Colombani traveled with 2,000 others by ship from northern Corsica to Ajaccio, on the western coast, to see the pope. 'It is an event that we will not see again in several years. It may be the only time that the pope will come to Corsica. And since we wanted to be a part of it, we have come a long way″ Colombani said. The island, which Genoa ceded to France in 1768, is located closer to the Italian mainland than France. From the conference, the pope traveled to the 17th-century cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta to meet with clergy, stopping along the way at the statue of the Madunnuccia where he lit a devotional candle. The pope celebrated Mass beneath a looming statue of Napoleon Bonaparte, the French emperor whose armies in 1808 annexed the papal states and imprisoned two of Francis’ predecessors — Popes Pius VI and VII — before being excommunicated and eventually defeated on the battlefield. Thousands packed the esplanade where Napoleon is said to have played as a child. Francis met with Macron at the airport before departing for the 50-minute flight back to Rome. They discussed Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Middle East and security issues in Africa's Sahel and Great Lakes regions, Haiti and Sudan, Macron's office said in a statement. Macron welcomed the pope's 'calls for peace, non-violence and respect for human rights,' the statement said. Both Macron and Francis expressed their 'deep concern' regarding the situation in Gaza and called for 'an immediate and lasting ceasefire' and 'the massive delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid,' according to Macron's office. On Syria, they reiterated their wish to see a 'fair and inclusive political transition,' the statement said. Macron presented the pope with two books about Notre Dame Cathedral. The pontiff pointedly did not make the trip to Paris earlier this month for the pomp surrounding the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral following the devastating 2019 fire. The visit to Corsica seems far more suited to Francis’ priorities than a grand cathedral reopening, emphasizing the 'church of the peripheries.' It was Francis’ third trip to France, each time avoiding Paris and the protocols that a state visit entails. He visited the port of Marseille in 2023, on an overnight visit to participate in an annual summit of Mediterranean bishops, and went to Strasbourg in 2014 to address the European Parliament and Council of Europe. Corsica is home to more than 340,000 people and has been part of France since 1768. But the island has also seen pro-independence violence and has an influential nationalist movement. Last year, Macron proposed granting it limited autonomy. Given the short flight back to Rome, Francis didn’t hold an airborne press conference en route home, the first time he has skipped the traditional briefing in 47 foreign trips as pope. Francis did come to the back of the plane though to greet reporters and receive a pretend birthday cake. __ Associated Press writers Colleen Barry in Milan and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report. __ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Bolivia holds a divisive popular vote for its top judges, offering lessons for the region	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Campaigning for Sunday's judicial election may be strictly forbidden, but look closer on the streets of Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, and you’ll find that some candidates have sneakily plastered their faces on packs of corn puffs and others have slipped subtle slogans into official voting manuals. After all, it’s a popular vote, and even a bit of PR can work wonders when voters know nothing about the dozens of names on their sprawling ballot papers. Bolivia is the only country in the world that holds elections for top judicial posts. Soon Mexico will, too, after former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador pushed through a highly contentious overhaul of the justice system in the face of mass protests. As Bolivia's ex-President Evo Morales did when remaking the judiciary in 2009, López Obrador has championed the overhaul as a way to purge the corrupt elite and boost democracy. But apathetic Bolivian voters say the elections have had the opposite effect, turning their courts from neutral arbiters into political prizes. 'I’ll flip a coin,' said 25-year-old architecture student Marisol Nogales when asked how she would vote on Sunday. It’s never easy to find supporters of Bolivia’s system of electing judges, which, over a decade ago, replaced a nomination system rooted in qualifications and training. Across the world, academics, investors and judges have warned that judicial elections can cement the dominance of the ruling party and gut checks and balances. And across Latin America, from El Salvador to Honduras, experts have characterized politicized judiciaries as profound threats to democracy. In Bolivia, even senior judicial officials struggle to sound positive when asked to defend the election. 'It should be a calm, easy and simple process, but it has become very litigious, very controversial,' Francisco Vargas, the vice president of Bolivia’s electoral tribunal, told The Associated Press from the court in central La Paz. This year in Bolivia, experts find it even harder than usual to praise the system. With the posts up for grabs every six years, Sunday’s vote was supposed to take place in late 2023. But as the deadline approached last year, the Constitutional Court — packed with allies of President Luis Arce — suddenly intervened to push the vote back a year, escalating his power struggle with his former mentor and current rival, Morales, over who will lead their long-dominant leftist party into Bolivia’s 2025 presidential election. Both understand that whoever wins over the Constitutional Court ensures their own political survival. Arce cited the paralysis of their divided party in justifying the vote's delay. Morales' loyalists, who hold a majority in Congress and would have determined the shortlist of judicial candidates, accused Arce of illegally extending the mandates of friendly judges for fear of losing influence over the courts. 'What happened was disorder, the kind that can lead us to a greater conflict,' said Iván Lima, the former Minister of Justice. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights criticized the postponement of elections, raising alarm about its 'potential to undermine the effective functioning of the Bolivian justice system.' Now, after many attempts to derail and further delay the vote, it is finally moving ahead Sunday. But there’s a wrinkle: It's a partial election. Only four out of nine seats on the powerful Constitutional Court are up for grabs. The other five — the majority of sitting judges, as it happens — will stay in their posts. 'The judges have turned the Constitutional Court into a sort of super power,' said Bolivian political analyst Paul Coca. Sunday marks the third time that Bolivia has held judicial elections. If the past two rounds under then-President Morales, in 2011 and 2017, are any indication, turnout will be low. Both times, the majority of Bolivians, outraged or simply baffled by the notion of endorsing unknown judges pre-selected by Morales’ allies with little transparency, voted null or blank. Critics questioned the legitimacy of the elected judges. But they nonetheless shaped the evolution of Bolivian democracy. In 2016, Morales asked Bolivians in a legally binding referendum to decide whether to let him run for a fourth term, in defiance of a two-term limit established in the 2009 Constitution he had backed. When he didn’t get the answer he wanted — a slim majority voted 'no' — his party found a workaround through the pliant Constitutional Court, where judges ruled that to deny Morales another term as president would be to violate his human rights. 'This was his major mistake,' said Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a former chief justice of the Supreme Court. It was Morales’ decision to run again in 2019 that brought a precipitous end to his remarkable 14-year tenure and ushered in a surreal parade of crises. As allegations of electoral fraud sent angry crowds into the streets, Morales resigned under pressure from the military and went into exile. Five years after coming under fire for allegedly manipulating the courts, Morales now finds himself on the receiving end of the judiciary he overhauled. 'First Evo’s party used the court to challenge the referendum’s results to promote another candidacy. Then Arce’s administration colluded with the same Constitutional Court to delay and reduce judicial elections to favor the self-prorogated judges, who run politics through judicial review,' Veltzé said. Last year, the Constitutional Court endorsed a controversial resolution from the northeastern province of Beni that the government insists blocks Morales from running for president in 2025. Last October, a prosecutor in Bolivia’s southern province of Tarija issued an arrest warrant for Morales after reviving a 2016 statutory rape case against him. And earlier this week, the country’s top criminal court swiftly extradited Morales’ former anti-drug chief to stand trial in the United Staes on charges of cocaine trafficking, despite criticism from legal experts unsatisfied by the court's review of evidence. 'They've been trying to destroy me morally, legally and politically,' Morales told the AP about the legal cases against him. Vargas, the tribunal’s vice president, is quick to insist that Bolivia is not some kind of strange outlier for electing judges by popular vote. The U.S., Switzerland and Japan also hold judicial elections. But, he conceded, not in such a sweeping way as Bolivia does, or as Mexico will. Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, bracing for fallout from the overhaul she inherited, is keen to see how Bolivia’s vote plays out. The National Electoral Institute, the Mexican voting authority, sent a delegation to observe the process in La Paz this weekend, Vargas said. When asked whether he would recommend that Mexico follow Bolivia’s example, Vargas let out a sharp laugh. 'If you want me to tell you my personal opinion,' he said, 'it might cause me some problems.'	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-judicial-elections-morales-mexico-overhaul-constitution-beba1908c766b982dd90532723062e38	2024-12-14T21:00:51-08:00	
One week into a new Syria, rebels aim for normalcy and Syrians vow not to be silent again	DAMASCUS (AP) — At Damascus’ international airport, the new head of security — one of the rebels who marched across Syria to the capital — arrived with his team. The few maintenance workers who showed up for work huddled around Maj Hamza al-Ahmed, eager to learn what will happen next. They quickly unloaded all the complaints they had been too afraid to express during the rule of President Bashar Assad, which now, inconceivably, is over. They told the bearded fighter they were denied promotions and perks in favor of pro-Assad favorites, and that bosses threatened them with prison for working too slowly. They warned of hardcore Assad supporters among airport staff, ready to return whenever the facility reopens. As Al-Ahmed tried to reassure them, Osama Najm, an engineer, announced: 'This is the first time we talk.' This was the first week of Syria’s transformation after Assad’s unexpected fall. Rebels, suddenly in charge, met a population bursting with emotions: excitement at new freedoms; grief over years of repression; and hopes, expectations and worries about the future. Some were overwhelmed to the point of tears. The transition has been surprisingly smooth. Reports of reprisals, revenge killings and sectarian violence have been minimal. Looting and destruction have been quickly contained, insurgent fighters disciplined. On Saturday, people went about their lives as usual in the capital, Damascus. Only a single van of fighters was seen. There are a million ways it could go wrong. The country is broken and isolated after five decades of Assad family rule. Families have been torn apart by war, former prisoners are traumatized by the brutalities they suffered, tens of thousands of detainees remain missing. The economy is wrecked, poverty is widespread, inflation and unemployment are high. Corruption seeps through daily life. But in this moment of flux, many are ready to feel out the way ahead. At the airport, al-Ahmed told the staffers: 'The new path will have challenges, but that is why we have said Syria is for all and we all have to cooperate.' The rebels have so far said all the right things, Najm said. 'But we will not be silent about anything wrong again.' Idlib comes to Damascus At a torched police station, pictures of Assad were torn down and files destroyed after insurgents entered the city Dec. 8. All Assad-era police and security personnel have vanished. On Saturday, the building was staffed by 10 men serving in the police force of the rebels’ de facto 'salvation government,' which for years governed the rebel enclave of Idlib in Syria's northwest. The rebel policemen watch over the station, dealing with reports of petty thefts and street scuffles. One woman complains that her neighbors sabotaged her power supply. A policeman tells her to wait for courts to start operating again. 'It will take a year to solve problems' he mumbled. The rebels sought to bring order in Damascus by replicating the structure of its governance in Idlib. But there is a problem of scale. One of the policemen estimates the number of rebel police at only around 4,000; half are based in Idlib and the rest are tasked with maintaining security in Damascus and elsewhere. Some experts estimate the insurgents' total fighting force at around 20,000. Right now, the fighters and the public are learning about each other. The fighters drive large SUVs and newer models of vehicles that are out of reach for most residents in Damascus, where they cost 10 times as much because of custom duties and bribes. The fighters carry Turkish lira, long forbidden in government-held areas, rather than the plunging Syrian pound. Most of the bearded fighters hail from conservative, provincial areas. Many are hardline Islamists. The main insurgent force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has renounced its al-Qaida past, and its leaders are working to reassure Syria’s religious and ethnic communities that the future will be pluralist and tolerant. But many Syrians remain suspicious. Some fighters sport ribbons with Islamist slogans on their uniforms and not all of them belong to HTS, the most organized group. 'The people we see on the streets, they don’t represent us,' said Hani Zia, a Damascus resident from the southern city of Daraa, where the 2011 anti-Assad uprising began. He was concerned by reports of attacks on minorities and revenge killings. 'We should be fearful,' he said, adding that he worries some insurgents feel superior to other Syrians because of their years of fighting. 'With all due respect to those who sacrificed, we all sacrificed.' Still, fear is not prevalent in Damascus, where many insist they will no longer let themselves be oppressed. Some restaurants have resumed openly serving alcohol, others more discretely to test the mood. At a sidewalk café in the historic Old City's Christian quarter, men were drinking beer when a fighter patrol passed by. The men turned to each other, uncertain, but the fighters did nothing. When a man waving a gun harassed a liquor store elsewhere in the Old City, the rebel police arrested him, one policeman said. Salem Hajjo, a theater teacher who participated in the 2011 protests, said he doesn't agree with the rebels' Islamist views, but is impressed at their experience in running their own affairs. And he expects to have a voice in the new Syria. 'We have never been this at ease,' he said. 'The fear is gone. The rest is up to us.' The fighters make a concerted effort to reassure On the night after Assad’s fall, gunmen roamed the streets, celebrating victory with deafening gunfire. Some security agency buildings were torched. People ransacked the airport's duty free, smashing all the bottles of liquor. The rebels blamed some of this on fleeing government loyalists. The public stayed indoors, peeking out at the newcomers. Shops shut down. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham moved to impose order, ordering a nighttime curfew for three days. It banned celebratory gunfire and moved fighters to protect properties. After a day, people began to emerge. For tens of thousands, their first destination was Assad’s prisons, particularly Saydnaya on the capital’s outskirts, to search for loved ones who disappeared years ago. Few have found any traces. It was wrenching but also unifying. Rebels, some of them also searching, mingled with relatives of the missing in the dark halls of prisons that all had feared for years. During celebrations in the street, gunmen invited children to hop up on their armored vehicles. Insurgents posed for photos with women, some with their hair uncovered. Pro-revolution songs blared from cars. Suddenly shops and walls everywhere are plastered with revolutionary flags and posters of activists killed by Assad’s state. TV stations didn’t miss a beat, flipping from praising Assad to playing revolutionary songs. State media aired the flurry of declarations issued by the new insurgent-led transitional government. The new administration called on people to go back to work and urged Syrian refugees around the world to return to help rebuild. It announced plans to rehabilitate and vet the security forces to prevent the return of 'those with blood on their hands.' Fighters reassured airport staffers — many of them government loyalists — that their homes won’t be attacked, one employee said. But Syria's woes are far from being resolved. While produce prices plunged after Assad’s fall, because merchants no longer needed to pay hefty customs fees and bribes, fuel distribution was badly disrupted, jacking up transportation costs and causing widespread and lengthy blackouts. Officials say they want to reopen the airport as soon as possible and this week maintenance crews inspected a handful of planes on the tarmac. Cleaners removed trash, wrecked furniture and merchandise. One cleaner, who identified himself only as Murad, said he earns the equivalent of $15 a month and has six children to feed, including one with a disability. He dreams of getting a mobile phone. 'We need a long time to clean this up,' he said. ___ Associated Press writer Ghaith Alsayed contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-week-one-transitional-government-c06673aa3317a194619710948264cdf1	2024-12-14T20:04:09-08:00	
Activists release images of foxes at Finnish fur farms to push EU to ban the trade	GENEVA (AP) — A red fox frantically scratches the wires of its small cage. An Arctic fox meanders lazily with a bloody tail. Other furry creatures, some with teary eyes, stare blankly into a light on an activist's video camera. Finnish advocacy group Oikeutta Elaimille, or Justice for Animals, and Humane Society International have released images taken from an 'undercover investigation' at three fur farms in western Finland in late October to highlight the behind-the-scenes realities of the trade. The activists’ incursion came as the European Union, which counts Finland as a member, is awaiting advice in March from the EU agency that oversees animal welfare before deciding in March 2026 whether it should propose a ban on fur farming altogether. FIFUR, a Finnish fur-breeders group, blasted the 'covert filming' of the farms, accusing the intruders of 'breaching strict biosecurity requirements' on farms where operations are 'strictly controlled by national laws and regulations' and where veterinarians monitor animal welfare. Some viewers might ache over the conditions of the cuddly-looking creatures; others might wonder what the big deal is: The industry is — at least for now — legal and regulated. Aside from the animals’ captivity in small cages — with sometimes more than one in a single cage — none of the images shows abuse in progress. No explanation was given for the bright red blood on what looked like an open gash and exposed bone in a single Arctic fox’s tail area. 'These pictures and these intrusions ... it creates a false image of normal lab animal welfare and animal keeping in the farms,' said FIFUR spokesman Olli-Pekka Nissinen, adding that his group believed the initiative to ban fur farming will be rejected. The breeders' group said the fur sector has among the highest welfare standards of any form of animal husbandry, and Nissinen suggested that farmers have little incentive to mistreat them. 'Animal welfare first shows in the animals’ fur and it’s very important for farmers to take care of the animals so that they can have decent incomes.' FIFUR says most of its 442 member farms — as of December last year — are run by family businesses, and nearly all the farms are in the Ostrobothnia region along the Baltic Sea. Finland is the world's largest producer of certified fox pelts, the industry group said. Oikeutta Eläimille spokesman Kristo Muurimaa says the operation involved entering the farms to observe and document the conditions in which the animals are kept and that the photos were taken in compliance with Finnish law. Neither side has announced plans for any legal action. 'Fur has been used by people for a long time, since the Stone Ages basically,' Muurimaa said. 'However, a practice where animals are kept in very small barren cages is not that old. It is a product of modern times where animals are seen just as products.' 'This kind of treatment of animals doesn’t belong to this day. Times have moved on and now it’s time to leave this kind of cruelty behind,' he added. 'Nobody needs fur in modern times. Fur is mostly used as a status symbol by the rich elite in countries like China and Russia.' The 27-country EU, according to its most recent figures, estimates about 1,000 fur farms with roughly 7.7 million animals — including mink, fox and raccoon dogs — are active in the bloc. In neighboring Switzerland, which is not an EU member, a three-month public consultation ended last month on a government proposal to ban the import and sale of furs drawn from the 'mistreatment' of animals. The measure would allow authorities to seize such furs. Activists want the Swiss government to go further, seeking a broader definition of 'mistreatment' and wider range of fur farms affected. The issue, currently low on Switzerland's full referendum calendar, could be put to a public vote in late 2026 at the earliest. Humane Society International, in a statement last month, said tens of millions of animals suffer and die each year in the global fur trade and the 'vast majority of animals killed for their fur are kept in barren battery cages on fur farms.' Finland, the advocacy group said, is one of the last European countries where farming such animals for their fur remains legal — and finger-pointed a number of retail brands that use fox fur from Finland. China is the world's most important export market for furs, followed by South Korea and the Western Europe-North American market, said FIFUR, which counts hundreds of farms in Finland as members. In Europe, as of 2023, Poland and Greece were the biggest producers — almost entirely from mink — while Finland is third, according to a report by the industry association this year. Bird flu and coronavirus outbreaks hit the fur industry hard, notably in Denmark, since 2020, but the trend line in supply has been declining for many years. FIFUR's report showed supply volumes of mink pelts plunged by roughly three-quarters since 2010 — to 12,285 last year — a similar percentage decline to that for mink pelts, which totaled 2,440 in 2023.	https://apnews.com/article/finland-switzerland-fox-fur-trade-european-union-fefd7700d8e416111f6d7e6d49917943	2024-12-14T19:01:12-08:00	
South Korean leaders seek calm after Yoon is impeached	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s opposition leader offered Sunday to work with the government to ease the political tumult as officials sought to reassure allies and markets, a day after the opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol over a short-lived attempt to impose martial law. Liberal Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, whose party holds a majority in the National Assembly, urged the Constitutional Court to rule swiftly on Yoon's impeachment and proposed a special council for policy cooperation between the government and parliament. Yoon's powers have been suspended until the court decides whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. If Yoon is dismissed, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days. Lee, who has led a fierce political offensive against Yoon's embattled government, is seen as the frontrunner to replace him. He lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon by a razor-thin margin. He told a televised news conference that a swift court ruling would be the only way to 'minimize national confusion and the suffering of people.' The court will meet to discuss the case Monday, and has up to 180 days to rule. But observers say that a court ruling could come faster. In the case of parliamentary impeachments of past presidents — Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 and Park Geun-hye in 2016 — the court spent 63 days and 91 days respectively before determining to reinstate Roh and dismiss Park. Lee also proposed a national council where the government and the National Assembly would work together to stabilize state affairs, and said his party won't seek to impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, a Yoon appointee who's now serving as acting president. 'The Democratic Party will actively cooperate with all parties to stabilize state affairs and restore international trust,' Lee said. 'The National Assembly and government will work together to quickly resolve the crisis that has swept across the Republic of Korea.' It's unclear if Lee's proposed council will be realized. In a meeting with the parliament speaker, who touched upon Lee's idea, Han said he will closely cooperate and communicate with the National Assembly but didn't specifically say whether the government intends to join the council. Kweon Seong-dong, floor leader of the ruling People Power Party, separately criticized Lee's proposal, saying that it’s 'not right' for the opposition party acting like the ruling party. Kweon, a Yoon loyalist, said that his party will use existing PPP-government dialogue channels 'to continue to assume responsibility as the governing party until the end of President Yoon’s term.' The Democratic Party has already used its parliamentary majority to impeach the justice minister and the chief of the national police over the martial law decree, and had previously said it was also considering impeaching the prime minister. Upon assuming his role as acting leader, Han ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations. He also asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies will remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy from the political turmoil. On Sunday, Han had a phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden, discussing the political situation in South Korea and regional security challenges including North Korea’s nuclear program. Biden expressed his appreciation for the resiliency of democracy in South Korea and reaffirmed 'the ironclad commitment' of the United States, according to both governments. Yoon’s Dec. 3 imposition of martial law, the first of its kind in more than four decades, lasted only six hours, but has caused massive political tumult, halted diplomatic activities and rattled financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it. Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament in an effort to stop the vote, but they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred. Opposition parties have accused Yoon of rebellion, saying a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and would have no right to suspend parliament’s operations even in those cases. Yoon has rejected the charges and vowed to 'fight to the end.' He said the deployment of troops to parliament was aimed at issuing a warning to the Democratic Party, which he called an 'anti-state force' that abused its control of parliament by holding up the government’s budget bill for next year and repeatedly pushing to impeach top officials. Law enforcement institutions are investigating Yoon and others involved in the martial law case over possible rebellion and other allegations. They've arrested Yoon's defense minister and police chief and two other high-level figures. Yoon has immunity from most criminal prosecution as president, but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. He's been banned from leaving South Korea, but observers doubt that authorities will detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. South Korean media reported that prosecutors asked Yoon to appear at a prosecution office for questioning on Sunday but he refused to do so. The reports said prosecutors plan to ask him to appear again. Repeated calls to a prosecutors’ office in Seoul were unanswered. Lee called for authorities to speed up their probes and said that an independent investigation by a special prosecutor should be launched as soon as possible. Last week, the National Assembly passed a law calling for such an investigation.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-lee-impeachment-ca583315453be30766372702120f94e7	2024-12-14T17:35:44-08:00	
Trump appoints longtime foreign policy adviser Richard Grenell to serve as special missions envoy	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he's picked longtime foreign policy adviser Richard Grenell to serve as an envoy for special missions, tasking him with helping the incoming administration deal with some of the toughest foreign policy challenges. Grenell served as ambassador to Germany during Trump’s first administration, special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and did a stint as acting director of national intelligence. He was also a contender to serve as secretary of state, but Trump opted to nominate Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. 'Ric will work in some of the hottest spots around the World, including Venezuela and North Korea,' Trump said in a posting on his social media platform, Truth Social, announcing the appointment. Grenell during Trump's first term developed a reputation for employing a sometimes contentious approach to diplomacy that rankled allies and the foreign policy establishment in Washington. But his style was appreciated by the president-elect who sees value in blunt talk with allies. Grenell remained close to Trump after he left office in 2021, serving at times as a key adviser on foreign policy. He was in the room when Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in September. Grenell has advocated for a peace deal that would preserve Ukraine’s territory while still allowing for 'autonomous regions' where Russia could remain in control. He’s also advised against expanding NATO to include Ukraine, saying — as Trump has — that the alliance shouldn’t grow until current members meet the alliance's defense spending targets. Members of the transatlantic alliance have committed for years to spending 2% of their GDP on defense, but several countries still fall short of the target. He was an early supporter of Trump’s 2024 campaign and held multiple events for the Republican nominee focused on economics and national security. Speaking at the Republican National Convention, Grenell echoed Trump’s mantra that 'it’s time to put America first' on the global stage and argued that China and Russia saw President Joe Biden's administration as weak. Trump raised concerns among some allies during the 2024 campaign when he said he would not defend NATO members that failed to meet defense spending targets, and warned he would 'encourage' Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' to alliance countries that he considered 'delinquent.' Grenell has downplayed Trump's criticisms of NATO and said the only talk of leaving the alliance altogether 'was really from the media.' 'What we’re saying is, don’t come to the wedding without a gift,' Grenell said. Grenell was part of the Trump campaign's outreach to Arab American voters in Michigan, where the president-elect made gains with a traditionally Democratic constituency despite his history of banning immigration from several majority-Muslim countries. Grenell orchestrated pro-Trump events with Arab American voters, including a May meeting held in Troy, Michigan. A U.S. spokesman at the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration, Grenell, like many other Republicans, has his own history of criticizing Trump before embracing him. Once an adviser to GOP moderates like 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney and a supporter of gay marriage, Grenell, who is openly gay, deleted social media posts blasting Trump as 'reckless' and 'dangerous' once the former reality TV star became the Republican nominee in 2016. Trump also announced Saturday that he’s appointing Devin Nunes, the chief executive officer of the president-elect's Truth Social platform, to head a presidential advisory board that will keep tabs on the U.S. intelligence community. Nunes will continue leading Trump Media &amp; Technology Group. Trump is the company’s largest shareholder. The former California lawmaker chaired the House Intelligence Committee and was one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress during the president-elect's first term. ___ Kinnard reported from Columbia, South Carolina.	https://apnews.com/article/richard-grenell-secretary-of-state-trump-5e7410edd659870307a5eba762f8136c	2024-12-14T16:57:03-08:00	
Fighting in eastern Congo between army and rebels intensifies ahead of peace talks Sunday	GOMA, Congo (AP) — Fighting between the Congolese army and the M23 rebel group intensified in eastern Congo in recent days ahead of much anticipated peace talks on Sunday, the army said. Congo's army accused the M23 of killing 12 civilians earlier this week in villages of the Lubero territory in the eastern province of North-Kivu in a statement on Friday. An M23 spokesperson told The Associated Press it denied the accusation, discrediting it as 'propaganda' from Congo's government. M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced. Congo and the United Nations accuse Rwanda of backing M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. Last month, Congo and Rwanda’s foreign ministers agreed on the terms and conditions of the disengagement of Rwandan forces in eastern Congo. In July, Congo signed a ceasefire with M23 that came into effect in August, but fighting has resumed since. Earlier this month, the United States said it was 'gravely concerned' by ceasefire violations by M23 rebels. The intensification of fighting comes as Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame are set to meet Sunday in Angola, which has been mediating the conflict. It will be their first official meeting since last year. Aline Kasereka, a mother of six living in Lubero, a town 50 kilometers (30 miles) away from the villages where the fighting took place earlier this week, said the peace talks are urgently needed. 'We are tired of the war, every day we move, we do not know in which country we are anymore,' Kasereka told the AP. 'Our authorities have to sit on the negotiation table and find a solution because we want to return to our normal life,' she added. Henry Pacifique, analyst for the Kivu Security Barometer research project, says he remains pessimistic about the outcome of the summit. 'It seems like Angola is trying to force Congo and Rwanda to participate, while both parties continue to make the other the scapegoat to justify future violations of the agreement,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-rwanda-m23-ceasefire-angola-d97ae3918051df70d2dd85fd36f729c0	2024-12-14T10:28:54-08:00	
Isak Andic, founder of Spanish fashion brand Mango, dies in accident, aged 71	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Isak Andic, the founder of Spanish fashion brand Mango, has died after suffering an accident, the company said on Saturday. He was 71. 'It is with deep regret that we announce the unexpected death of Isak Andic, our non-executive chairman and founder of Mango, in an accident that occurred this Saturday,' Mango CEO Toni Ruiz said in a statement, without providing details. Spanish news agency EFE and other media outlets, including La Vanguardia newspaper, said Andic died following a fall while hiking near Barcelona. Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez paid tribute to Andic on social media, lauding his 'hard work and business vision that transformed a Spanish brand into a global fashion leader.' Andic’s family moved from Turkey to Spain when he was young. He opened Mango’s first store in Barcelona in 1984 and over the following decades helped Mango grow into one of Europe’s leading fast fashion makers. Mango has 2,700 stores in 120 markets around the world. It set a company record of 3.1 billion euros ($3.2 billion) in sales in 2023. It is currently expanding in the U.S. and plans to have 65 stores there by the end of 2025.	https://apnews.com/article/mango-founder-isak-andic-dies-bcf47f71f136d574527b7c4e09e30a9f	2024-12-14T10:16:14-08:00	
YouTube singer arrested in Iran after performing an online concert while not wearing a hijab	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian authorities have arrested a female singer who performed a virtual concert on YouTube, a lawyer said. Milad Panahipour, an Iranian lawyer, said Parastoo Ahmady, 27, was arrested in Sari City, capital of the northern province of Mazandaran, on Saturday. On Thursday, the judiciary had filed a case regarding Ahmady’s concert performance, in which she performed wearing a long black sleeveless and collarless dress, but no hijab. She was accompanied by four male musicians. Ahmady had posted her concert on YouTube the day before, saying: 'I am Parastoo, a girl who wants to sing for the people I love. This is a right I could not ignore; singing for the land I love passionately.' The online concert has been viewed more than 1.4 million times. Panahipour told The Associated Press: 'Unfortunately, we do not know the charges against Ms. Ahmady, who arrested her, or her place of detention, but we will follow up on the matter through legal authorities.' He also said two musicians in Ahmady's band — Soheil Faghih Nasiri and Ehsan Beiraghdar — were arrested in Tehran on Saturday. Following the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, women were banned at first from singing altogether, then from singing or dancing solo before mixed-gender audiences. Female vocalists could perform for male audiences only as a part of a chorus. But they are allowed to sing in a hall for female-only audiences. Also based on Iranian and Islamic law, women are not allowed to appear without a hijab in front of men who are not related. In Iran, the hijab — and the all-encompassing black chador worn by some — has long been a political symbol as well, particularly after becoming mandatory in the years following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. For observant Muslim women, the head covering is a sign of piety before God and modesty in front of men outside their families. There were protests across Iran in 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, after her arrest by the country’s morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab. While police became hesitant to strictly enforce the Islamic dress code — possibly to avoid even wider demonstrations and displays of defiance — in recent weeks the authorities' tone has changed.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-female-singer-youtube-arrest-f862c9ef4fc37cd574ec8c71fd4c74f9	2024-12-14T10:13:34-08:00	
Pelosi has hip replacement surgery at a US military hospital in Germany after a fall	WASHINGTON (AP) — Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had hip replacement surgery Saturday at a U.S. military hospital in Germany after falling while at an event in Luxembourg with other members of Congress. Pelosi, 84, 'is well on the mend,' said Ian Krager, a spokesman for the California Democrat, in a statement. Pelosi thanked the staff at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center and the hospital in Luxembourg, where she was also treated, for 'their excellent care and kindness.' She was in Europe with a bipartisan congressional delegation to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. Pelosi tripped and fell while at an event and fractured her hip, according to people familiar with her injury who were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. Among those on the trip was Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who posted on social media Friday that he was 'praying for a speedy recovery,' for Pelosi. The two lawmakers were captured holding hands in a group photo that day at the U.S. Embassy in Luxembourg. Pelosi was first elected in 1987. She served as speaker twice, stepped down from her leadership post two years ago but remained in Congress and was reelected to represent her San Francisco district in November. ___ Associated Press writer Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/pelosi-hip-replacement-surgery-fall-germany-b01379d1f1124dcd3cf41c789dae4a58	2024-12-14T09:00:47-08:00	
Women's right activists rally in France ahead of Gisèle Pelicot's rape trial verdict	AVIGNON, France (AP) — Hundreds of people gathered Saturday in the southern French town of Avignon ahead of the verdict in a trial in which dozens of men are accused of raping Gisèle Pelicot while she was drugged and rendered unconscious by her husband. The court is expected to deliver its verdicts by Dec. 20 in the trial of 51 defendants. Last month, prosecutors asked the panel of judges for the maximum possible penalty for aggravated rape — 20 years — against the victim’s now ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, 72. Gisèle Pelicot, 71, has become an icon for those fighting against sexual violence. She testified during the proceedings about the harrowing events, which have sparked widespread public attention. Outside the courth, demonstrators held placards with messages such as, 'Victims, we believe you, rapists we see you,' and, 'Shame changes sides.' One large banner displayed on a wall read: 'Rape has no nationality.' Elsewhere, activists posted notes with 'Gentle words for Gisèle' on a fence. Activist Marine Thebaud, who is a member of the Family Planning association, said: 'We hope that justice will be up to the acts committed against Gisèle, that impunity will end and that people will be punished. We’re here to show support for all victims of patriarchal violence.' Alain Souberan said he joined the gathering because his partner 'is a convinced feminist who sings in the Avignon feminist choir.' 'Personally, I really support this movement. I think men have their place as supporters too,' he said. The trial, which started in September, has drawn attention beyond France, with Pelicot’s courage in facing her accusers transforming her into a symbol for victims of sexual violence.	https://apnews.com/article/gisele-pelicot-france-rape-trial-protest-646e49f2349f6a82ffc7d93b16858432	2024-12-14T08:46:10-08:00	
Filipino woman on Indonesia death row recalls a stunning last minute reprieve and 'miracle' transfer	YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Filipino death row inmate Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso knelt to pray when officers came to take her to an execution site in May 2015, just a few feet away from her isolation cell on an Indonesian prison island, where a 13-member firing squad was waiting. While she prayed, the Philippines government was wrapping up a lengthy legal battle over her fate. Veloso’s life was ultimately spared — temporarily — by Indonesia’s Attorney General's Office, which issued a stay of execution shortly before Veloso was to be executed with eight other death row inmates. 'Lord, many people there believe that I am guilty, but many people out there believe that I am innocent. Lord, You are the One who knows everything, You knew that I am innocent, so I beg You, please prove that by saving me,' Veloso recalled praying in a tearful interview with The Associated Press at a female prison in Yogyakarta on Tuesday. Duped into becoming a drug courier The reprieve aimed to provide an opportunity for Veloso's testimony to expose how a criminal syndicate duped her into being an unwitting accomplice and courier in drug trafficking. Shock washed over Veloso as a group of officials from the attorney general's office informed her of the stay just as she was being led out to the execution site on Nusakambangan prison island. In tears, she remembered a cocoon she saw the previous night hanging from a tree branch near her cell. 'In the Philippines we believe that if there is a cocoon, there will be a new life,' Veloso said. 'That means I will not be executed because God will give me a new life.' Veloso, now 39, was arrested in 2010 at the airport in the Indonesian ancient city of Yogyakarta, where officials discovered about 2.6 kilograms (5.7 pounds) of heroin hidden in her luggage. The single mother of two sons was convicted and sentenced to death. Veloso has maintained her innocence throughout her 14 years of incarceration. She has spent her time in prison designing Indonesian batik clothing, painting, tailoring and learning interior design and other skills. Veloso was granted a stay of execution because her alleged boss was arrested in the Philippines, and the authorities there requested Indonesian assistance in pursuing a case against her. The woman, who allegedly recruited Veloso to work in Kuala Lumpur, Maria Kristina Sergio, surrendered to police in the Philippines just two days ahead of her scheduled execution. The dramatic turn of events began last month, when in an unusual last-ditch effort to delay Veloso’s death, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced that a deal had been reached for Indonesia to send Veloso home after a decade of pleading from Manila. 'Mary Jane Veloso is coming home,' Marcos said in a statement. 'Arrested in 2010 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to death, Mary Jane’s case has been a long and difficult journey.' A practical arrangement A 'practical arrangement' between Indonesia and the Philippines was signed on Dec. 6, to send Veloso home, which is expected before Christmas. Although there is no treaty between the countries, Indonesia and the Philippines are both members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the transfer of convicts in the ASEAN region is in accordance with the bloc’s Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, said Raul Vasquez, the undersecretary at the Department of Justice of the Philippines, after the signing ceremony. Indonesia’s Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Indonesia’s coordinating minister for law, human rights, immigration and corrections, lauded the transfer agreement as a 'historic milestone' between Indonesia and the Philippines, and part of the new administration of President Prabowo Subianto’s 'good neighbor' policy. Once repatriated, Mahendra said, if the Philippines want to pardon Veloso or grant clemency, 'that is entirely their authority in which we must also respect,' the minister added. The Philippines, Asia’s largest Roman Catholic nation, has abolished the death penalty. ‘Like a miracle’ Veloso described the decision as being 'like a miracle when I have lost all hope.' 'For almost 15 years I was separated from my children and parents, and I could not see my children grow up,' she said, her eyes filled with tears. 'I wish to be given an opportunity to take care of my children and to be close to my parents.' Born in Cabanatuan, a city in Nueva Ecija province, Veloso was the youngest of five siblings of a family who lived in extreme poverty. Her father worked as a seasonal agricultural worker on a sugar cane plantation and her mother collected discarded bottles and plastic to sell to junk shops. Veloso dropped out of school in her first year of high school and married her husband when she was just 16 years old. The couple later separated and she became a single mother to two young sons, forcing her to emigrate to Dubai in 2009 to work as maid. She returned to the Philippines before the end of her two-year contract after an attempted rape by her employer. A year later, Veloso was recruited by Sergio to be employed as a domestic servant in Malaysia but later was shifted to Indonesia. Major drug smuggling hub The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population. Indonesia's last executions were carried out in July 2016, when an Indonesian and three foreigners were shot by firing squad. There are about 530 people on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including 96 foreigners, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections' data showed as of last month. The Indonesian government recently agreed in principle to return five Australian nationals and a French national to their home countries. 'I was not a good Catholic before, and prison has changed my life into a skilled person who has become closer to God,' Veloso said. 'I am ready to build a new life, like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon.' ___ Associated Press writer Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-philippines-veloso-interview-prisoner-transfer-0a18931e2d0ef52c1ff8953a07cd5f64	2024-12-14T08:36:48-08:00	
Charles Dickens' characters come alive in a Dutch town enamored with the English author	DEVENTER, Netherlands (AP) — The Dutch city of Deventer transformed Saturday into a pocket of 19th-century England, with 950 people in costumes bringing characters from Charles Dickens’ books to life. Oliver Twist, Ebenezer Scrooge and Miss Havisham were among the characters at hand, mingling with chimney sweepers, livestock and Christmas carol singers in Deventer’s historic center. Onlookers bowed when Queen Victoria passed through. Merchants peddle antiques and gingerbread, while people portraying pickpockets try to avoid being tossed in a mock Marshalsea Prison. The town's link to Dickens is Emmy Strik, who started the weekend-long festival to protest rules against keeping her antique shop open on Sunday. Strik and other shopowners dressed up in the 19th-century England costumes and walked out on the streets. The protest evolved into an annual festival and Strik, now 84, has collected more than 1,000 Dickensian costumes for the event. Organizers enforce the dress code strictly — no clothes or accessories from after the 1800s. Sandra Nieland, playing the queen, described her costume to The Associated Press: 'In her younger years, she was, of course, a beautiful queen. And in her older years, she was mourning her husband, Albert and, well, she was always in black and not (wearing) too much stuff. Just her rings. ... She always wore a lot of rings.' It’s the 32nd edition of the festival, which attracts some 100,000 visitors each year from around the Netherlands and abroad, according to the town organizers. That means big crowds, who line up to enter the narrow streets. Amateur street actor Stef Jongbloed reveled in the festive energy. In addition to specific characters, he said, 'you also have so many people that just dress up just for fun and just walk around here the entire day. Also doing it together is what makes it so amazing.'	https://apnews.com/article/charles-dickens-festival-netherlands-cf900102dffb73f722ae70e99b209360	2024-12-14T08:20:55-08:00	
US officials have been in direct contact with the Syrian rebel group that ousted Assad, Blinken says	AQABA, Jordan (AP) — American officials have been in direct contact with the terrorist-designated rebel group that led the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday. Blinken, speaking at a news conference in Jordan, was the first U.S. official to publicly confirm contacts between the Biden administration and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led a coalition of armed opposition groups that drove Assad from power and into asylum in Russia last weekend. Along with counterparts from eight Arab nations and Turkey and senior officials from the European Union and United Nations, Blinken signed off on a set of principles meant to guide Syria’s transition to a peaceful, nonsectarian and inclusive country. Blinken would not discuss details of the direct contacts with HTS but said it was important for the U.S. to convey messages to the group about its conduct and how it intends to govern in a transition period. 'Yes, we have been in contact with HTS and with other parties,' Blinken said in the port city of Aqaba. He added that 'our message to the Syrian people is this: We want them to succeed and we’re prepared to help them do so.' HTS, once an affiliate of al-Qaida, has been designed as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department since 2018. That designation carries severe sanctions, including a ban on the provision of any 'material support' to the group or its members. The sanctions do not, however, legally bar U.S. officials from communicating with designated groups. In an interview Saturday on Syrian television, the group’s leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, did not address any direct contact with the United States, but said the new authorities in Damascus are in touch with Western embassies. He also said that 'we don’t intend to enter any conflict because there is general exhaustion in Syria.' HTS has worked to establish security and start a political transition after seizing Damascus and has tried to reassure a public both stunned by Assad’s fall and concerned about extremist jihadis among the rebels. Insurgent leaders say the group has broken with its extremist past. Blinken also stressed that 'the success that we’ve had in ending the territorial caliphate' of the Islamic State group remains 'a critical mission.' And citing the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish fighters who in recent years drove IS out of large areas of Syria, he called it 'very important at this moment that they continue that role because this is a moment of instability' in which IS 'will seek to regroup and take advantage of.' A joint statement after the meeting of foreign ministers urged all parties to cease hostilities in Syria and expressed support for a locally led transitional political process. It called for preventing the reemergence of extremist groups and ensuring the security and safe destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles. 'We don’t want Syria to fall into chaos,' Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, told journalists. A separate statement by Arab foreign ministers called for U.N.-supervised elections based on a new constitution approved by Syrians. Their statement condemned Israel’s incursion into the buffer zone with Syria and adjacent sites over the past week as a 'heinous occupation' and demanded the withdrawal of Israeli forces. U.S. officials say al-Sharaa has been making welcomed comments about protecting minority and women’s rights but they remain skeptical that he will follow through on them in the long run. On Friday, the rebels and Syria’s unarmed opposition worked to safely turn over to U.S. officials an American man who had been imprisoned by Assad. U.S. officials are continuing their search for Austin Tice, an American journalist who disappeared 12 years ago near Damascus. 'We have impressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,' Blinken said. In other developments: —Turkey reopened its embassy in Damascus, becoming the first country to do so since the end of Assad’s rule. The embassy suspended operations 12 years ago due to insecurity during Syria's civil war. —Al-Sharaa said in the TV interview that 'the pretexts that Israel uses have ended' for its airstrikes that have destroyed much of the Syrian army's assets in recent days. He said 'the Israelis have crossed the rules of engagement' but that the insurgent group is not about to enter a conflict with Israel. —The leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants said the group has lost its military supply line through Syria but that the new authority there might reinstate the route. —A Syrian war monitor and a citizen journalist said gunmen attacked members of a Syrian insurgent group, Failaq al-Sham, in the country’s coastal region, killing or wounding 15 of them on Saturday. That region is home to many members of Assad’s minority Alawite sect. ___ Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/blinken-syria-assad-hts-transition-mideast-5fcff887a74dc9ec36e483c0b601a8c2	2024-12-14T06:44:36-08:00	
Ukrainian drones strike Russia as Kyiv reels from consecutive massive air attacks	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drone strikes on southern Russia killed a 9-year-old boy and set fire to a major oil terminal, officials said Saturday, the day after Moscow launched a massive aerial attack on its neighbor that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was one of the heaviest bombardments of the country’s energy sector in the nearly three-year war. The boy died when a drone struck his family’s home outside Belgorod, a Russian city near the border with Ukraine, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported on Saturday morning on the Telegram messaging app. His mother and 7-month-old sister were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said. He posted photos of what he said was the aftermath of the attack, showing a low-rise house with gaping holes in its roof and front wall flanked by mounds of rubble. Elsewhere in southern Russia, Ukrainian drones overnight hit a major oil terminal in the Oryol region, sparking a blaze, Ukraine’s General Staff reported. Photos published by the General Staff and on Russian Telegram news channels showed huge plumes of smoke engulfing the facility, backlit by an orange glow. Oryol Gov. Andrey Klychkov confirmed that a Ukrainian drone strike set fire to a fuel depot. He said later the blaze had been contained and that there were no casualties. Russia’s Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces shot down 37 Ukrainian drones over the country’s south and west the previous night. Russia pummels Ukrainian energy targets The Ukrainian strikes came a day after Russia fired 93 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 drones at its neighbor, further battering Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, around half of which has been destroyed during the war. Rolling electricity blackouts are common and widespread, and Zelenskyy charged Friday that Moscow is 'terrorizing millions of people' with such assaults. According to Ukraine’s air force, Russia kept up its drone attacks on Saturday, launching 132 across Ukrainian territory. Fifty-eight drones were shot down and a further 72 veered off course, likely due to electronic jamming, it said. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces used long-range precision missiles and drones on 'critically important fuel and energy facilities in Ukraine that ensure the functioning of the military industrial complex.' The strike was in retaliation for Wednesday’s Ukrainian attack using U.S.-supplied the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, on a Russian air base, it said. Kyiv’s Western allies have provided Ukraine with air defense systems to help it protect critical infrastructure, but Russia has sought to overwhelm the air defenses with combined strikes involving large numbers of missiles and drones called 'swarms.' Russia has held the initiative this year as its military has steadily rammed through Ukrainian defenses in the east in a series of slow but steady offensives. But uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue. North Koreans reportedly in combat in Kursk Zelenskyy said Saturday that a 'significant number' of North Korean troops were being deployed by Moscow in assaults in Russia’s southern Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have held on following a stunning cross-border incursion this summer. In a televised address, Zelenskyy said that North Korean soldiers have so far not entered the fight on Ukrainian soil, but claimed they are already taking 'noticeable' losses. Elsewhere, Ukrainian officials reported that Russian shelling on Friday and overnight killed at least two civilians and wounded 14 others in front-line areas Ukraine’s south and northeast. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-strike-attack-b4968f78072239d0d114423337cefd88	2024-12-14T05:09:05-08:00	
Middle East latest: Top diplomats from US, Arab League and Turkey discuss Syria's transition	Top diplomats from the United States, the Arab League and Turkey met in Jordan on Saturday to discuss how to assist Syria ’s transition after the fall of Bashar Assad's government a week ago. No Syrian representatives attended. The collapse of the Assad family’s more than half-century of rule has sparked new fears of instability in a region already shaken by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and hostilities between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah despite a tenuous ceasefire. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said American officials have been in direct contact with the Syrian insurgent group that led the overthrow of Assad’s government, but the group continues to be designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and others. The insurgent leader in an interview with Syrian TV didn't mention contact with the U.S., but he warned Israel about the hundreds of airstrikes it has carried out in Syria in the past week. The U.S. is also making a renewed push for a ceasefire in Gaza, where the war has plunged more than 2 million Palestinians into a severe humanitarian crisis. Here's the latest: Gunmen loyal to Assad attack members of a Syrian insurgent group BEIRUT — A Syrian war monitor and a citizen journalist say gunmen attacked members of a Syrian insurgent group in the country’s coastal region, killing or wounding 15 of them Saturday. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said loyalists to former President Bashar Assad killed and wounded members of the Failaq al-Sham group, which took part in the attacks that led to the overthrow of Assad a week ago. The coastal region is home to many members of Assad’s minority Alawite sect. Citizen journalist Taher al-Omar said Failaq al-Sham members were ambushed near the town of Jableh by 'sectarian gunmen.' He said several were killed, without giving details. More Israeli airstrikes in Gaza kill at least 11 DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Witnesses and medical officials are reporting more Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Four people were killed late Saturday in an airstrike on a tent in the central city of Deir al-Balah, according to an Associated Press journalist who counted the bodies at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Elsewhere, Palestinian medical officials said an airstrike killed at least seven people, including a woman and her baby, in Gaza City. The strike hit the Majda Wasilla school, which shelters many displaced families, according to Al-Ahli Hospital, which received the bodies. Ataf Saadat, a woman sheltering in the school, said the baby killed was two days old. 'There were those who were burned, and those who were cut up, and the rubble was on top of them,' Saadat said. Israel’s military said it struck Hamas fighters at a command center in a compound previously used as a school. Syria meeting's statement calls for peace, supports political transition A joint statement after a ministerial meeting on Syria's future is calling for all parties to cease hostilities there and expresses support for a locally led transitional political process. The statement was issued Saturday after a meeting in Jordan by several Arab nations, the United States, Turkey, the European Union and others. It called for preventing the reemergence of extremist groups in Syria and ensuring the security and safe destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles. It also expressed full support for Syria’s territorial integrity. A separate statement issued by Arab foreign ministers called for U.N.-supervised elections based on a new constitution approved by Syrians. That statement also condemned Israel’s incursion into the buffer zone with Syria and adjacent sites over the past week as a 'heinous occupation' and demands the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Hezbollah leader says main supply line via Syria has been cut BEIRUT — The leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants says the fall of Bashar Assad in Syria has cut a main supply line for the group but it can find other ways to bring in weapons. Hezbollah was a main backer of Assad and sent thousands of fighters to Syria over the past decade. And for decades, Hezbollah relied on Syria as a channel for weapons from the militant group's main backer, Iran. In his first public comments in the week since Assad’s fall, Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem in a televised speech Saturday said Hezbollah has lost the military supply line through Syria but the new authority there might reinstate the route. Otherwise, he said, 'we might find other ways.' Kassem also said Hezbollah hopes the new authority in Syria will consider Israel an enemy. Head of Syrian insurgents warns Israel about airstrikes but doesn't seek conflict DAMASCUS, Syria — The head of the Syrian insurgent group that led the overthrow of Bashar Assad's government says they are not about to enter a conflict with Israel. But Ahmad al-Sharaa in his first public comments on Israel in the week since Assad's fall said 'the pretexts that Israel uses have ended' for its airstrikes inside Syria in recent days. Al-Sharaa said 'the Israelis have crossed the rules of engagement' in his interview with Syrian TV on Saturday. About 400 Israeli airstrikes in the past days have destroyed much of the Syrian army's assets. Al-Sharaa leads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. The excerpts released from his interview did not address contact with the United States, which on Saturday said had been in direct communication with HTS, which it designated a foreign terrorist organization years ago. The HTS leader did say the new authorities in Damascus are in contact with Western embassies, and that authorities have a plan to start reconstruction and development in Syria. He did not give details. He added that the authorities have given Russia — a key backer of Assad — an opportunity to reconsider relations with the Syrian people, and that authorities are not hostile to the people of Iran, another Assad backer. Blinken says U.S. has had direct contact with Syrian rebel group AQABA, Jordan — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says American officials have been in direct contact with the Syrian rebel group that led the overthrow of President Bashar Assad’s government a week ago, but the group continues to be designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and others. Blinken is the first U.S. official to publicly confirm contacts between the Biden administration and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which ousted Assad. Speaking at a news conference in Jordan, Blinken would not discuss details of the contacts but said it was important for the U.S. to convey messages to the group about its conduct and how it intends to govern in a transition period. Medical officials say Israeli airstrike kills 10 in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say at least 10 people were killed Saturday in an Israeli airstrike that apparently targeted a municipal meeting in central Gaza. The officials said the strike hit the municipality complex for Deir al-Balah city as officials from central and southern Gaza met to coordinate how to receive vehicles provided by the United Arab Emirates. The complex includes a building used by the Hamas-run interior ministry and is surrounded by a public market, which was crowded when the strike occurred. Among the dead were a mother and her 5-year-old daughter, according to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital and an AP journalist at the morgue. The dead also include Diab al-Garu, head of the Deir al-Balah municipality, the hospital said. The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas fighter in a compound it said was used to plan attacks. Turkey reopens its embassy in Syria ISTANBUL — Turkey reopened its embassy in Syria on Saturday, becoming the first country to do so since the end of Bashar Assad’s rule last weekend. The Syrian insurgents who overthrew Assad had received vital help from Turkey. The Turkish flag was raised above the compound in Damascus for the first time since diplomatic ties were cut in 2012. The embassy suspended operations 12 years ago due to insecurity during the Syrian civil war. Several countries maintained diplomatic ties with Assad's government during the 13-year conflict, while others reopened their diplomatic missions in recent years as they sought to normalize relations. US Secretary of State Blinken wrapping up regional tour in Jordan AQABA, Jordan — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says broad consensus exists among regional partners that Syria’s new government must be inclusive, must respect women and minority rights, reject terrorism and secure and destroy suspected Assad-era chemical weapons stockpiles. Blinken is wrapping up a three-country regional tour in Aqaba after visiting Iraq, Turkey and Jordan once already this week. Earlier Saturday in a meeting with U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pederson, Blinken said he expected to talk about the challenges ahead for Syria and 'our determination to work together to support a Syrian-led transition where the United Nations plays a critical role, particularly when it comes to the provision of assistance, to the protection of minorities.' Pederson agreed, saying: 'What is so critical in Syria is that we see a credible and inclusive political process that brings together all communities in Syria. And the second point is that we need to make sure that state institutions do not collapse, and that we get in humanitarian assistance as quickly as possible. And if we can achieve that, perhaps there is a new opportunity for the Syrian people.' In announcing Saturday’s meetings, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said the ministers would 'discuss ways to support a comprehensive political process led by Syrians to achieve a transitional process,' which 'ensures the reconstruction of Syrian state institutions, and preserves Syria’s unity, territorial integrity, sovereignty, security, stability, and the rights of all its citizens.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-14-december-2024-9679866cce4bde8077accd753b0130cd	2024-12-14T03:29:07-08:00	
AP Photos: K-pop light sticks take over protests that fueled impeachment of South Korea's president	Seoul (AP) — K-pop light sticks, Christmas lights and even Santa Claus outfits have taken over daily protests demanding the ouster of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol following his shocking martial law declaration this month. On Saturday, the country’s parliament voted to impeach Yoon to suspend his powers. The Constitutional Court will determine whether to remove him from office or restore his presidential powers. Yoon's short-lived Dec. 3 order has sparked massive protests, drawing attention to their unique protest culture. Young demonstrators have taken over the streets with their K-pop light sticks, traditionally reserved for music concerts, to voice their dissent and in turn start a new trend in political protesting. The sea of light could be seen outside Seoul’s National Assembly, transforming the usually banker-filled financial district of Yeouido into a sea of lights. Many, seemingly in their 20s and 30s, adorned their clothing with Christmas decorations, Santa Outfit, colorful light sticks, and LED candles. Labor unions and political parties, with politicians and representatives at the front of the rally giving speeches and leading the group, have led the demonstrations. But unlike previous protests, the forefront was left to the young with their light sticks and K-pop songs.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-protesters-photo-gallery-yoon-b17f96063a2635ebc87f35ed9ab5ac5b	2024-12-14T00:58:54-08:00	
PEN America condemns the arrest of Iranian activist Reza Khandan	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — PEN America condemned the arrest of Reza Khandan, Iranian activist and husband of leading human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, and demanded his immediate release. Karin Deutsch Karlekar, Director of Writers at Risk at the literary and human rights organization said in a statement Friday: 'We are appalled at the arrest of Reza Khandan and urge Iranian authorities to release him immediately. The pro-reform Shagh Daily cited Mahmoud Behzadi Rad, an Iranian lawyer, as saying Khandan was sentenced in 2019 over spreading 'propaganda against the system' and 'collusion against national security' and that authorities arrested him Friday to carry out the sentencing. PEN American said Khandan was sentenced to six years in prison 'for making and distributing buttons protesting Iran’s compulsory hijab laws in January 2019.' Khandan, also a lawyer, was summoned to prison in Feb. 2023, but the order was not enforced at the time, the organization. His wife, Sotoudeh, is renowned for defending activists, opposition politicians and women prosecuted for removing their headscarves. In March 2019, she was sentenced to a total of 38 years and 148 lashes on a range of charges. Since 2023, she has been out on bail. According to PEN America’s 2023 Freedom To Write Index, at least 49 Iranian writers were arrested for their work last year, making Iran the second-highest jailer of writers in the world after China. Iran is also the world’s top jailer of female writers.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-activist-sotoudeh-khandan-pen-america-883f854be8c760e8784e7781f4ab1014	2024-12-13T23:50:59-08:00	
Popular actor in southern India is freed on bail after spending a night in jail in a stampede case	NEW DELHI (AP) — A popular actor in southern India was released from jail on bail on Saturday, a day after he was arrested by police in connection with a stampede that led to the death of a woman at the premiere of his movie earlier this month. A 35-year-old woman died and her 8-year-old son was critically injured in the stampede, which occurred during the screening of Allu Arjun’s release for 'Pushpa 2: The Rule' in southern Telangana state's Hyderabad city on Dec. 4. Arjun was arrested after the woman’s husband filed a case against him, his security team and the theater's management for not informing police of the actor’s plan to attend the screening, which resulted in a larger-than-expected crowd. Police charged the actor, his security team and the theater’s management staff with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Police have already arrested the theater’s owner and two of his employees in connection with the case. A local court on Friday ordered the actor to spend 14 days in jail, but within hours the Telangana High Court granted him bail. However, the actor had to spend the night in jail because prison authorities did not receive a copy of the bail until late Friday, the Press Trust of India reported. The accident happened after the 41-year-old actor made a surprise appearance at a local theater where the movie was being screened. As his fans surged toward the venue, the theater’s main gate collapsed, resulting in the stampede. The actor did not comment on the police charges or his arrest. But shortly after the accident, Arjun wrote on the social platform X that he was 'heartbroken by the tragic incident.' He later announced financial assistance of $29,000 for the woman’s family and promised to take care of the medical expenses for her injured son. Deadly stampedes are relatively common in India, where large crowds gather in small areas with shoddy infrastructure and few crowd safety measures.	https://apnews.com/article/india-actor-jail-bail-stampede-accident-47aca28ba5b9d123e42547d78553c8da	2024-12-13T21:45:17-08:00	
UN talks fail to reach agreement on dealing with rising risk of global drought	BENGALURU, India (AP) — Despite two weeks of U.N.-sponsored talks in Saudi Arabia’s Riyadh, the participating 197 nations failed to agree early Saturday on a plan to deal with global droughts, made longer and more severe by a warming climate. The biennial talks, known as COP 16 and organized by a UN body that deals with combating desertification and droughts, attempted to create strong global mandates to legally bind and require nations to fund early warning systems and build resilient infrastructure in poorer countries, particularly Africa, which is worst affected by the changes. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification released a report earlier this week warning that if global warming trends continue, nearly five billion people — including in most of Europe, parts of the western U.S., Brazil, eastern Asia and central Africa — will be affected by the drying of Earth’s lands by the end of the century, up from a quarter of the world’s population today. The report also said farming was particularly at risk, which can lead to food insecurity for communities worldwide. This is the fourth time UN talks aimed at getting countries to agree to make more headway on tackling biodiversity loss, climate change and plastic pollution have either failed to reach a consensus or delivered disappointing results this year, worrying many nations, particularly the most vulnerable. Nations participating in the Riyadh discussions decided to push the can down the road to the 2026 talks, hosted by Mongolia. 'Parties need more time to agree on what’s the best way forward to address the critical issue of drought,' said Ibrahim Thiaw, the UNCCD chief, speaking at the end of the Riyadh talks. Thiaw said the conference was 'like no other' in the talks' 30-year history. 'We have elevated the land and drought agenda beyond sector-specific discussions, establishing it as a cornerstone of global efforts to address inter-connected challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, migration and global security.' Longer-lasting solutions to drought — such as the curbing of climate change — were not a talking point. Host Saudi Arabia has been criticized in the past for stalling progress on curbing emissions from fossil fuels at other negotiations. The Gulf nation is one of the world’s largest oil producers and exporters with the second-largest global oil reserves. Earlier in the conference, hosts Saudi Arabia, a few other countries and international banks pledged $2.15 billion for drought resilience. And the Arab Coordination Group, made up of 10 development banks based in the Middle East, committed $10 billion by 2030 to address degrading land, desertification and drought. The funds are expected to support 80 of the most vulnerable countries prepare for worsening drought conditions. But the U.N. estimates that between 2007 and 2017, droughts will cost $125 billion worldwide. Erika Gomez, lead negotiator from Panama said while a decision on dealing with drought was not reached, significant progress was made in other key issues. 'We have achieved several key milestones, particularly in the growing traction of civil society engagement and the gender decision,' Gomez said. 'Until the very end, parties could not agree on whether or not the new instrument to respond to drought should be legally binding or not,' said Jes Weigelt of European climate think-tank TMG Research who has been tracking the talks. 'I fear, the UNCCD COP 16 has suffered the same fate as the biodiversity and climate COPs this year. It failed to deliver,' he said. ___ Follow Sibi Arasu on X at @sibi123 ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Thai police detain 2 suspects after a bomb in a border province killed 3 and injured scores	BANGKOK (AP) — Thai police on Saturday said two suspects were in custody as authorities investigated a bombing in the north that killed at least three people and injured dozens of others. An explosive device was thrown into a crowd during an outdoor performance at an annual festival in Umphang town in Tak province, which borders Myanmar, on Friday just before midnight, according to the Association of the Umphang Rescue Groups. Local police said at least 48 people were injured and that police have not yet pressed charges against the suspects as the investigation is ongoing. Thanathip Sawangsang, a spokesperson for the Defense Ministry, told The Associated Press that local police said there was a fight between rival groups of men before the explosion and that there was no wider security threat. He said the forensic evidence showed that the explosive device was a homemade bomb. Tak province has a heavy military presence in its border areas, including in Umphang. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed her condolences to the victims and their families, and ordered security personnel and relevant agencies in the area to investigate and help those who have been affected, said government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsap.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-bomb-tak-suspects-detained-02cdc92a955d9dfe3c425593182738cf	2024-12-13T20:23:54-08:00	
Ex-soccer player Kavelashvili becomes Georgia's president in a blow to country's EU aspirations	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia. Kavelashvili, 53, who was the only candidate on the ballot, easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures. Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. The party has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to 'reset' ties with Russia. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have boycotted the post-election parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot. In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held. Georgian Dream's decision last month to suspend talks on their country's bid to join the European Union added to the opposition's outrage and galvanized protests. Who is the outgoing president? Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia's top diplomat in 2004. Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream's support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her. 'I remain your president — there is no legitimate parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,' she has declared on the social network X. 'My mandate continues.' Zourabichvili rejects government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence. 'We are not demanding a revolution,' she told The Associated Press. 'We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again. 'Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen.' Zourabichvili said Saturday’s vote was a 'provocation' and 'a parody' while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional. Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is 'the only legitimate source of power.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said Kavelashvili’s win 'will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.' 'The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,' said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream. Who's the ruling party presidential candidate? Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia's opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi's Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls. Kavelashvili was a striker in the English Premier League for Manchester City and played for several soccer clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric. Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the 'foreign influence' law. How did opposition protests unfold? Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28. Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard. Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries. Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies. The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials. French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, in a video statement in support of the protests, said Georgia’s 'European dream must not be extinguished.' 'Europe does not seek to sow chaos, Europe does not seek to destabilize or subjugate its neighbors,' he said. 'The voice of Georgians must be listened to and respected.' ″(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us. He is controlled by a puppet government, by Bidzina Ivanishvili, by Putin,' protester Sandro Samkharadze said outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building. Another protester waved a sign saying 'We are children of Europe.' Demonstrators vowed the rallies would continue. 'If (the government) wants to go to Russia, they can go to Russia, because we are not going anywhere. We are staying here,' said protester Kato Kalatozishvili. —- Associated Press writer Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-president-zourabichvili-russia-kavelashvili-protests-3a7f5018879c77b6c596d312a163b79c	2024-12-13T20:23:30-08:00	
A diminished Hezbollah is made even weaker by the toppling of Assad in Syria	BEIRUT (AP) — A severely hobbled Hezbollah was in no position to help defend former Syrian President Bashar Assad, a longtime ally, from the lightning-fast insurgency that toppled him. With Assad gone, the militant group based in Lebanon is even weaker. Hezbollah was dealt a major blow during 14 months of war with Israel. The toppling of Assad, who had strong ties to Iran, has now crippled its ability to bounce back by cutting off a vital weapons-smuggling route through Syria. Hezbollah officials are deeply concerned but defiant. 'What is happening in Syria is a major, dangerous and new change, and to know why this happened needs evaluation,' Hassan Fadlallah, a Lebanese lawmaker who represents Hezbollah's political wing, said during a speech at a funeral for militants killed by Israel. 'Whatever is happening in Syria, despite its dangers, will not weaken us.' Analysts say the diminishment of Hezbollah will have big consequences for Lebanon, where for decades it has been a major political player — and for Iran, which has relied on the group as one of several proxy forces projecting power across the Middle East. It is also a game-changer for Israel, whose nemesis on its northern border is now at its most vulnerable point in decades. Ties to Syria influenced the rise and fall of Hezbollah's power The Assad dynasty, which ruled Syria for half a century with an iron fist, played a crucial role in empowering Hezbollah, which was founded in the early 1980s by Iranian advisers who came through Syria. In addition to being a conduit for Iranian weapons, Syria also was a place where Hezbollah trained fighters and manufactured its own weapons. As Hezbollah grew more powerful, it became a force Assad could rely on for protection in times of crisis. Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters to bolster Assad's forces when a civil war broke out in 2011. As insurgents swept across Syria in early December and took the city of Homs — a stone’s throw from a Syrian border town where Hezbollah had a presence — many expected the militants to put up a fierce fight. After all, they did just that in 2013, preventing Assad's opponents from advancing into Damascus. This time, Hezbollah was in disarray. Many of its top officials, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, were killed in Israeli airstrikes. And months of Israeli bombardment destroyed much of its military infrastructure. With Syria's key international allies, Russia and Iran, on the sidelines, Hezbollah withdrew, and Assad was ousted quickly. 'The fall of the regime marks the end of Iran’s arms in Syria and Lebanon,' said Lt. Col. Fares al-Bayoush, a Syrian army defector who fought in the civil war against Assad's forces and Hezbollah until 2017, when he moved to Turkey. Lebanon begins to grapple with Hezbollah's ‘new reality’ In Lebanon, the sapping of Hezbollah's strength has given the army the opportunity to reassert control it had ceded, especially along its southern border. A U.S.-brokered ceasefire between the militant group and Israel states that Hezbollah should have no armed presence along that border and it has led to growing calls within Lebanon for the group's disarmament. 'To Hezbollah, it’s game over,' Samir Geagea, who leads the Christian Lebanese Forces Party, said in a statement on Sunday, hours after insurgents took Damascus. 'Sit with the Lebanese military to end your status as an armed group, and transform yourselves into a political party.' But Hezbollah’s longtime sway in the political arena in Lebanon also faces a major challenge. Many in Lebanon are angry with the group. Critics say Hezbollah violated its promise to use its weapons only to defend Lebanon when it began firing rockets into Israel last year, the day after Hamas — another Iranian-backed group — attacked Israel. Nearly than 4,000 people were killed in Lebanon during the war with Israel, according to the country's health ministry. Entire towns and villages where Hezbollah militants and their supporters lived have been flattened. More than 1 million people have been displaced, and the country's economy — which was in bad shape before the war — is in a deep hole. 'With the (Syrian) regime gone, Hezbollah in Lebanon faces an entirely new reality,' said Firas Maksad, of the Middle East Institute. Maksad said many Lebanese leaders have yet to grasp the magnitude of the change that has taken place. Even some onetime allies of Hezbollah in parliament have begun distancing themselves from the group. Gebran Bassil, a lawmaker who represents the Free Patriotic Movement, Lebanon’s other major Christian party, said Hezbollah's loss of a weapons pipeline from Iran could help Lebanon extract itself from regional conflict. 'Hezbollah should focus on internal affairs and not the wider region,' Bassil, a former ally of Hezbollah, said. It may have no choice but to narrow its ambitions. With the fall of Assad, Iran has lost control of a corridor of land that stretched through Iraq and Syria all the way to the Mediterranean, and which gave it an unimpeded route to supply Hezbollah. 'They can maybe fly in some things and smuggle some things, but that’s not gonna be on the same scale, not even close,' said Aron Lund, a Syria expert with Century International, a New York-based think tank. For Israel, breaking Iran’s regional network has been a major goal, though it is wary over Islamic militants among the insurgents who toppled Assad. Israel on Sunday moved troops into a demilitarized buffer zone with Syria by the Israel-held Golan Heights in what it called a temporary security measure. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Assad’s fall a 'historic day,' saying it was 'the direct result of our forceful action against Hezbollah and Iran, Assad’s main supporters.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-iran-hezbollah-assad-hts-israel-fadc4fa97f2036a24f821f51e4eb6634	2024-12-13T20:05:49-08:00	
The Detroit area's many Syrians are celebrating Assad's overthrow and planning long-delayed visits	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Nizam Abazid is gleefully planning his first trip in decades to Syria, where he grew up. Rama Alhoussaini was only 6 years old when her family moved to the U.S., but she's excited about the prospect of introducing her three kids to relatives they've never met in person. They are among thousands of Detroit-area Syrian Americans who are celebrating the unexpected overthrow of the Syrian government, which crushed dissent and imprisoned political enemies with impunity during the more than 50-year reign of ousted President Bashar Assad and his father before him. 'As of Saturday night, the Assad regime is no longer in power,' Alhoussaini, 31, said through tears Tuesday at one of the Detroit-area school and day care facilities her family operates. 'And it’s such a surreal moment to even say that out loud, because I never thought that I would see this day.' It may be some time before either visits Syria. Though happy to see Assad go, many Western countries are waiting for the dust to settle before committing to a Syria strategy, including whether it’s safe for the millions who fled the country’s civil war to return. Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the insurgency that toppled Assad after an astonishing advance that took less than two weeks, has disavowed his group's former ties to al-Qaida and cast himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. But the U.S. still labels him a terrorist and warns against any travel to Syria, where the U.S. hasn't had an embassy since 2012, the year after the war started. But for Syrians in the U.S. who have been unable to visit, the overthrow of the Assad government has given them hope that they can safely return, either for good or to visit. 'The end of the regime is the hope for all the Syrian people,' Abazid said this week, days after Assad and his family fled to Russia. Abazid said he could go to Syria whenever, since he holds dual U.S. and Syrian citizenship, but that he'll wait a few months for things there to settle down. Although European leaders have said it's not safe enough yet to allow war-displaced refugees to return to Syria, Abazid said he and his brother aren't concerned. 'When Assad’s forces were in power, my fate would’ve been in jail or beheaded,' Abazid said. 'But now, I will not be worried about that anymore.' Many Syrians who immigrated to the U.S. settled in the Detroit area. Michigan has the largest concentration of Arab Americans of any state and is home to the country's largest Arab-majority city, Dearborn. It also has more than 310,000 residents who are of Middle Eastern or North African descent. As rebel forces seized control of Syria, capping a lightning-quick advance that few thought possible even a month ago, Syrians in and around Detroit — like their counterparts all over the world — followed along in disbelief as reports poured in about one city after another slipping from Assad's grip. When news broke that Assad's government had fallen, celebrations erupted. Abazid, who owns a cellphone business in Dearborn, was born in Daraa, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) south of the Syrian capital, Damascus. He moved to the U.S. in 1984 at age 18, and although he's gone back a few times, he hasn't visited since 1998 because of what he described as 'harassment' by Syrian intelligence. That trip had to be heavily coordinated with U.S. authorities, as he said Syrian authorities took him into custody and detained him for more than six months during a 1990 visit. 'When I was kidnapped from the airport, my family didn’t even know ... what it was about,' he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'I still don’t know the reason. I have no idea why I was kidnapped.' Abazid, 59, said his parents have died since that 1998 trip, but his five sisters still live in Syria. Each of his four brothers left Syria during the 1970s and 1980s, including one who hasn't been back since emigrating 53 years ago, shortly after Bashar Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad, rose to power. Alhoussaini, who lives in West Bloomfield Township, said she was born in Damascus and moved to the Detroit area as a young girl, 'mainly because there was nothing left for us in Syria.' She said under the Assad family's rule, her grandfather's land was taken. Authorities detained him for almost a month. Her father was also detained before the family left. 'There never needed to be a reason,' Alhoussaini said. 'My dad was able to return one time, in 2010. And he has not been able to go back to his home country since, mainly because we spoke up against the Assad regime when the revolution started in 2011. And we attended many protests here. We were vocal on social media about it, did many interviews.' But with Bashar Assad gone and Syria in the hands of the rebels, 'We don’t have to be afraid anymore to visit our country,' she said. Her father, 61, is considering making a trip to Syria to see his siblings and visit his parents' graves. Alhoussaini said she and her husband, who is from the northern city of Aleppo, want to take their kids over to visit with family and friends. Alhoussaini’s three sisters, ages 40, 34 and 29, were also born in Syria. But none of them have been back. Now, there is hope and amazement that people in Syria can celebrate in the streets, she said. Alhoussaini said she thinks people who were born and raised in the U.S. won't be able to fully relate, because Americans enjoy a freedom of expression that people in Syria have never had. 'You can say what you want. You can go out into the street and protest whoever you want,' she said. 'You will not be detained for it. You will not be killed for it.'	https://apnews.com/article/detroit-syria-dearborn-assad-6c3777579a708024e703fca3458623e9	2024-12-13T20:05:04-08:00	
Once taboo, more Japanese women are brewing sake	OKAYA, Japan (AP) — Not long after dawn, Japanese sake brewer Mie Takahashi checks the temperature of the mixture fermenting at her family’s 150-year-old sake brewery, Koten, nestled in the foothills of the Japanese Alps. She stands on an uneven narrow wooden platform over a massive tank containing more than 3,000 liters (800 gallons) of a bubbling soup of steamed rice, water and a rice mold known as koji, and gives it a good mix with a long paddle. 'The morning hours are crucial in sake making,' said Takahashi, 43. Her brewery is in Nagano prefecture, a region known for its sake making. Takahashi is one of a small group of female toji, or master sake brewers. Only 33 female toji are registered in Japan’s Toji Guild Association out of more than a thousand breweries nationwide. That’s more than several decades ago. Women were largely excluded from sake production until after World War II. Sake making has a history of more than a thousand years, with strong roots in Japan's traditional Shinto religion. But when the liquor began to be mass produced during the Edo period, from 1603 until 1868, an unspoken rule barred women from breweries. The reasons behind the ban remain obscure. One theory is that women were considered impure because of menstruation and were therefore excluded from sacred spaces, said Yasuyuki Kishi, vice director of the Sakeology Center at Niigata University. 'Another theory is that as sake became mass produced, a lot of heavy labor and dangerous tasks were involved,' he said. 'So the job was seen as inappropriate for women.' But the gradual breakdown of gender barriers, coupled with a shrinking workforce caused by Japan's fast-aging population, has created space for more women to work in sake production. 'It’s still mostly a male-dominated industry. But I think now people focus on whether someone has the passion to do it, regardless of gender,' Takahashi said. She believes mechanization in the brewery is also helping to narrow the gender gap. At Koten, a crane lifts hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of steamed rice in batches and places it onto a cooling conveyor, after which the rice is sucked through a hose and transported to a separate room dedicated to cultivating koji. 'In the past, all of this would have been done by hand,' Takahashi said. 'With the help of machines, more tasks are accessible for women.' Sake, or nihonshu, is made by fermenting steamed rice with koji mold, which converts starch into sugar. The ancient brewing technique was recognized under UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage earlier this month. As a child, Takahashi was not allowed to enter her family-owned brewery. But when she turned 15, she was given a tour of the brewery for the first time and was captivated by the fermentation process. 'I saw it bubbling up. It was fascinating to learn that those bubbles were the work of microorganisms that you can’t even see,' said Takahashi, who couldn't drink alcohol at the time because she was underage. 'It smelled really good. I thought it was amazing that this wonderful fragrant sake could be made from just rice and water. So I thought I’d like to try making it myself.' She pursued a degree in fermentation science at the Tokyo University of Agriculture. After graduation, she decided to return home to become a master brewer. She trained for 10 years under the guidance of her predecessor, and at the age of 34 became a toji at her family brewery. As the brewery enters the winter peak season, Takahashi oversees a team of seasonal workers and production ramps up. It’s labor-intensive work, hauling and turning large amounts of heavy steamed rice, and mixing thousands of liters (hundreds of gallons) of brew. The master brewer must have the knowledge and skill to carefully control optimal koji mold growth, which needs round-the-clock monitoring. Despite the intensity, Takahashi manages to encourage camaraderie in the brewery, catching up with the team as they hand-mix koji rice side by side in a hot humid room. 'I was taught that the most important thing is to get along with your team,' Takahashi said. 'A common saying is that if the atmosphere in the brewery is tense, the sake will turn out harsh, but if things are going well in the brewery, the sake will turn out smooth.' The inclusion of women plays an important role in the survival of the Japanese sake industry, which has seen a steady decline since its peak in the 1970s. Domestic alcoholic consumption has dropped, while many smaller breweries struggle to find new master brewers. According to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association, today’s total production volume is about a quarter of what it was 50 years ago. To remain competitive, Koten is among many Japanese breweries trying to find a wider market both domestically and abroad. 'Our main product has always been dry sake, which local people continue to drink regularly,' said Takahashi's older brother, Isao Takahashi, who is in charge of the business side of the family operation. 'We’re now exploring making higher value sake as well.' He supports his sister's experiments –- every year she creates a limited-edition series, Mie Special, that's meant to branch out from their signature dry product. 'My sister would say she wants to try to make low alcohol content, or she wants to try new yeasts -– all kinds of new techniques are coming in through her,' he said. 'I want my sister to make the sake she wants, and I want to do my best to sell it.'	https://apnews.com/article/japan-sake-women-brewers-84906e38b2be31eac5365ac343c05a0b	2024-12-13T17:20:52-08:00	
South Korean parliament will vote on impeachment motion against President Yoon over martial law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean lawmakers are set to vote on an opposition-led impeachment motion against President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday, two days after Yoon defended his controversial martial law decree and vowed to resist mounting calls for his ouster. It’ll be the second time for the National Assembly to hold a vote on Yoon’s impeachment motion over his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law introduction. Last Saturday, Yoon survived an impeachment vote after most ruling party lawmakers boycotted a floor vote. It’s not clear if those People Power Party lawmakers would do the same again. Public protests against Yoon have since intensified and his approval rating has plummeted. The country’s six opposition parties control the 300-member unicameral parliament with a combined 192 seats, but they are eight seats shy of the two-thirds majority needed to pass Yoon’s impeachment motion. Tens of thousands of people poured onto the streets of capital Seoul in the past two weeks, calling for Yoon to be removed from office and arrested. Smaller groups of Yoon's conservative supporters — still in the thousands — gathered in Seoul's Gwanghwamun boulevard, claiming the opposition's impeachment push was 'unconstitutional' and 'false propaganda.' Yoon’s martial law imposition, the first of kind in more than four decades in South Korea, lasted only six hours, but has caused political tumult, halted diplomatic activities and rattled financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it. After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree before they withdrew after the parliament rejected it. No major violence occurred. Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law clause that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that by law a president in South Korea is allowed to declare marital law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no rights to suspend parliament’s operations even under martial law. Law enforcement authorities are investigating whether Yoon and others involved in the martial law declaration committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes. If convicted, the leader of a rebellion plot can face the death penalty or life imprisonment. On the night of Dec. 3, Yoon also sent soldiers and police officers to the National Election Commission, in what he called a bid to check vulnerabilities in its computer systems that could raise questions on the results of elections. This has spawned speculation that he acted on unfounded rumors or conspiracy theories that the outcome of April’s parliamentary elections, in which the ruling party suffered a massive defeat, was rigged. The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon 'committed rebellion that hurts peace on the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.' It said Yoon’s mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the Constitution. In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon defended his martial law order as an act of governance and denied rebellion charges. He claimed the troops’ deployment to the National Assembly was designed to maintain order, not dissolve or paralyze it. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it 'a monster' and 'anti-state forces' that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials, undermined the government’s budget bill for next year and sympathized with North Korea. 'I will fight to the end to prevent the forces and criminal groups that have been responsible for paralyzing the country’s government and disrupting the nation’s constitutional order from threatening the future of the Republic of Korea,' Yoon said. Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon’s speech a 'mad declaration of war' against his own people. If the National Assembly passes Yoon’s impeachment motion, his presidential powers and duties will be suspended until the Constitutional Court determines whether to dismiss him as president or restore his powers. If he’s thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days. Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul’s metropolitan police agency have been arrested or detained over their roles in the martial law case. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations. Ex-Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who resigned on Dec. 5, is considered a central figure in Yoon’s martial law enforcement. The opposition parties alleged he proposed martial law to Yoon, and the president said Thursday he discussed imposing marital law only with Kim before informing other top officials just before declaring it. Kim attempted to kill himself while in detention before correctional officers stopped him and he was in stable condition, according to the Justice Ministry. Yoon has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-impeach-6432768aafc8b55be26215667e3c19d0	2024-12-13T16:44:38-08:00	
A magnitude 6.4 earthquake shakes Chile but there are no reports of damage	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — A 6.4 magnitude earthquake shook central Chile on Friday but there were no immediate reports of damage and a tsunami was ruled out. The United States Geological Survey said the quake occurred at 7:38 p.m. local time (23:38 GMT) at a depth of 110 kilometers. Its epicenter was 41 kilometers (25 miles) east-southeast of the town of Molina. The quake was felt in the central and northern regions of Chile, including in the capital Santiago. The Chilean National System for Disaster Prevention and Response said there were no reports of damages or emergencies. Chile’s oceanographic service said the quake did 'not meet the conditions necessary to generate a tsunami' on the coasts of the South American country. Chile is located in the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a region that has among the greatest seismic and volcanic activity in the world.	https://apnews.com/article/chile-earthquake-magnitude-64-04b40ccb06e08be39fbc5857e2e4a667	2024-12-13T15:55:22-08:00	
Saudi Arabia banned film for 35 years. The Red Sea festival is just one sign of the industry's rise	JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — 'My Driver and I' was supposed to be made in 2016, but was scuttled amid Saudi Arabia's decades-long cinema ban. Eight years later, the landscape for film in the kingdom looks much different — and the star of 'My Driver and I' now has an award. Roula Dakheelallah was named the winner of the Chopard Emerging Saudi Talent award at the Red Sea International Film Festival on Thursday. The award — and the glitzy festival itself — is a sign of Saudi Arabia's commitment to shaping a new film industry. 'My heart is attached to cinema and art; I have always dreamed of a moment like this,' Dakheelallah, who still works a 9-5 job, told The Associated Press before the awards ceremony. 'I used to work in voluntary films and help my friends in the field, but this is my first big role in a film.' The reopening of cinemas in 2018 marked a cultural turning point for Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy that had instituted the ban 35 years before, under the influence of ultraconservative religious authorities. It has since invested heavily in a native film industry by building theaters and launching programs to support local filmmakers through grants and training. The Red Sea International Film Festival was launched just a year later, part of an attempt to expand Saudi influence into films, gaming, sports and other cultural fields. Activists have decried the investments as whitewashing the kingdom’s human rights record as it tightly controls speech and remains one of the world’s top executioners. With FIFA awarding the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia this week, Lina al-Hathloul, a Saudi activist with the London-based rights group ALQST, said Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman 'has really managed to create this bubble where people only see entertainment and they don’t see the reality on the ground.' These efforts are part of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan unveiled in 2016 to ease the economy's dependence on oil. As part of it, Saudi Arabia plans to construct 350 cinemas with over 2,500 movie screens — by this past April, across 22 cities, it already had 66 cinemas showing movies from the local film industry, as well as Hollywood and Bollywood. (The Red Sea International Film Festival attracts a host of talent from the latter industries, with Viola Davis and Priyanka Chopra Jonas also picking up awards Thursday.) The country's General Entertainment Authority last month opened Al Hisn Studios on the outskirts of Riyadh. As one of the largest such production hubs in the Middle East, it not only includes several film studios but also a production village with workshops for carpentry, blacksmithing and fashion tailoring. 'These facilities, when they exist, will stimulate filmmakers,' said Saudi actor Mohammed Elshehri. 'Today, no writer or director has an excuse to imagine and say, ‘I cannot implement my imagination.’' The facilities are one part of the equation — the content itself is another. One of the major players in transforming Saudi filmmaking has been Telfaz11, a media company founded in 2011 that began as a YouTube channel and quickly became a trailblazer. Producing high-quality digital content such as short films, comedy sketches and series, Telfaz11 offered fresh perspectives on Saudi and regional issues. In 2020, Telfaz11 signed a partnership with Netflix to produce original content for the streaming giant. The result has been movies that demonstrate an evolution on the storytelling level, tackling topics that were once off-limits and sensitive to the public like secret nightlife in 'Mandoob' ('Night Courier') and changing social norms in 'Naga.' 'I think we tell our stories in a very simple way, and that’s what reaches the world,' Elshehri says of the changing shift. 'When you tell your story in a natural way without any affectation, it will reach every person.' But the films were not without their critics, drawing mixed reaction. Social media discoursed ranged from pleasure that Saudi film were tackling such topics to anger over how the films reflected conservative society. As Hana Al-Omair, a Saudi writer and director, points out, there are still many stories left untold. 'We certainly have a long time ahead of us before we can tell the Saudi narrative as it should be,' she said, acknowledging that there are still barriers and rampant censorship. 'The Goat Life,' a Malayalam-language movie about an Indian man forced to work without pay in Saudi Arabia, is not available on Netflix's platform in the country. Movies that explore political topics or LGBTQ+ stories are essentially out of the question. Even 'My Driver and I,' featured at the Red Sea festival alongside 11 other Saudi feature-length films, was initially too controversial. It centers on a Sudanese man in Jeddah, living away from his own daughter, who feels responsible for the girl he drives as her parents are absent. It was initially blocked from being made because of the relationship between the girl and the driver, filmmaker Ahd Kamel has said, even though it's not a romantic relationship. Now in 2024, the film is a success story — a symbol of the Saudi film industry's evolution as well as the growing role of women like Kamel behind the camera and Dakheelallah in front of it. 'I see the change in Saudi cinema, a very beautiful change and it is moving at a wonderful speed. In my opinion, we do not need to rush,' Dakheelallah said. 'We need to guide the truth of the artistic movement that is happening in Saudi Arabia.'	https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-film-festival-saudi-cinema-13c9762d8b72066987437179fa87bb2a	2024-12-13T13:39:34-08:00	
Capitol rioter who tried to join Russian army is sentenced to prison for probation violation	WASHINGTON (AP) — A Dallas man who tried to fly overseas to join the Russian military and fight against Ukraine was sentenced on Friday to six months in prison for violating the terms of his probation for storming the U.S. Capitol four years ago. Kevin Loftus, a 56-year-old veteran of the U.S. Army, was stopped from boarding an Oct. 28 flight from Dallas to Tbilisi, Georgia, by way of Istanbul, Turkey, when Turkish Airlines identified a 'security flag' associated with him, according to federal prosecutors. Loftus didn't have the court's permission to travel internationally or to drive from Texas to Iowa, where the FBI arrested him three days after his flight plans fell apart, prosecutors said. Loftus told the FBI that he had hoped to secure a 90-day visa to travel to Russia, where he intended to apply for temporary residency. Loftus said he had used the Telegram messaging platform to communicate with a man who would connect him with the Russian Territorial Defense Unit, a volunteer military corps. 'Loftus said he had already sent the man approximately $1200 to purchase equipment for Russian soldiers,' prosecutors wrote. 'Loftus said his intent was to fight for Russia and against Ukraine.' Loftus declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich sentenced him for the probation violation. The judge said Loftus has repeatedly violated court orders. 'He doesn't think these rules should apply to him,' Friedrich said. 'He wants to be above the law.' Defense attorney Benjamin Schiffelbein said Loftus wanted to enlist in the Russian military because he 'felt bad' for Russian soldiers and wanted to help them. 'He had no idea whether they could make use of him,' the lawyer said. Loftus, a six-year Army veteran, intended to permanently relocate to another country, according to prosecutors. 'And his planned travel was for the express purpose of joining a foreign army to take up arms against one of this country’s allies and in opposition to this country’s foreign policy,' they wrote. In January 2021, Loftus traveled from Wisconsin to Washington, D.C., to attend then-President Donald Trump's 'Stop the Steal' rally near the White House. After joining the mob of Trump supporters at the Capitol, he entered the building and took photographs. He spent approximately five minutes inside the Capitol. Loftus was arrested at his Wisconsin home several days after the riot. He pleaded guilty in October 2021 to a misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. After his arrest, Loftus posted comments about his case on social media, referring to himself as 'famous' and a 'hero' for taking part in the Jan. 6 attack. 'Loftus also stated that he gained that fame by ‘standing up for all Americans’ because he ‘broke the law,’ and he would file lawsuits against unidentified persons after the criminal case was over,' prosecutors wrote. Prosecutors recommended 30 days of imprisonment for Loftus, but Friedrich initially sentenced him to three years of probation. For his probation violation, prosecutors requested a six-month prison sentence. They noted that Loftus, while on probation, also was arrested in December 2023 and charged with driving while intoxicated in Richardson, Texas. Loftus was required to attend a substance abuse program, but he avoided jail time for that violation. Over 1,500 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related crimes. More than 1,000 of them have been convicted and sentenced, with roughly two-thirds receiving a term of imprisonment ranging from a few days to 22 years. Trump has repeatedly vowed to pardon Capitol rioters, but the district court judges in Washington, D.C., typically have refused to postpone sentencings, plea hearings and trials until after the president-elect returns to the White House.	https://apnews.com/article/kevin-loftus-russia-capitol-riot-jan-6-trump-c5fbf7f0febdf789464ca438c74485c1	2024-12-13T12:58:59-08:00	
African Union chairperson candidates advocate for permanent UN Security Council seats	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Three African politicians seeking to head the African Union detailed their plans on Friday for regional security amid conflicts and political coups while strongly advocating for inter-Africa trade among other issues. Raila Odinga of Kenya, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf of Djibouti and Richard Randriamandrato of Madagascar are seeking to be elected as chairperson for the 55-member state African Union. They participated in a two-hour debate Friday in Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa in which they all advocated for two permanent seats for African countries in the U.N. Security Council to effectively represent the continent with the youngest population. Odinga said that two permanent seats with veto power were 'a must for Africa' and that this was 'only fair' since the continent has more than 50 countries. Randriamandrato urged member states to cease the opportunity and 'speak with one voice on the choice of who will represent Africa in the UNSC.' The three are seeking to convince most African countries before the February election to succeed African Union Chairperson Moussa Faki, who has served for two terms. The African Union has faced several challenges that include conflict in member countries and political coups that have seen five member states expelled from the union, making regional security a major theme in Friday’s debate. Youssouf said that regional security could be enhanced if the resources for a regional standby force were increased to reduce the overreliance on foreign partnerships for resources. 'When there is no unity of purpose among neighboring countries peace will be compromised,' Youseff said. Randriamandrato encouraged countries to take charge of their internal security while cautioning that foreign military bases should be 'a thing of the past' because they 'could be a source of conflict.' Despite the continent’s young population of 1.3 billion that is set to double by 2050, regional trade has faced challenges that were addressed in the Friday debate. Odinga said that Africa had a 'huge domestic market' that it could leverage on for economic transformation by opening up opportunities for trade between African countries. Youssouf proposed a payment compensation system that would ensure countries don't lose out while trading in different currencies adding, 'are we going to have a single currency, why not?' Randriamandrato said that regional economic blocs like the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa had a huge role to play in easing inter-Africa trade. The African Union has several proposed reforms on its structure and leadership aimed at achieving its purpose, and all candidates promised to implement the reforms if elected. Youssouf said that key reforms in the union were facing a funding bottleneck and that 'it has to change,' adding that he wouldn't impose it on member states but would 'advocate for it.'	https://apnews.com/article/african-union-chairperson-election-e938b6056e216db643338022b7d2469c	2024-12-13T10:03:29-08:00	
American released from Syrian prison is flown out of the country, a US official says	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military has transported out of Syria an American who disappeared seven months ago into former President Bashar Assad’s notorious prison system and was among the thousands released this week by rebels, a U.S. official said Friday. Travis Timmerman was flown out of Syria on a U.S. military helicopter, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing operation. Timmerman, 29, told The Associated Press he had gone to Syria on a Christian pilgrimage and was not ill-treated while in Palestine Branch, a notorious detention facility operated by Syrian intelligence. He said he was freed by 'the liberators who came into the prison and knocked the door down (of his cell) with a hammer.' Timmerman said he was released Monday morning alongside a young Syrian man and 70 female prisoners, some of whom had their children with them. He had been held separately from Syrian and other Arab prisoners and said he didn’t know of any other Americans held in the facility.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-timmerman-assad-timmerman-443d1c3b2b9cf551cdcfdff22bdcedc9	2024-12-13T09:57:44-08:00	
Hearings are done: Now the wait begins for verdict on closely-watched climate case at UN’s top court	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A lawyer for a small South Pacific island nation told the world’s highest court to heed her warning. 'Tuvalu will not go quietly into the rising sea,' Phillipa Webb said, hoping her ominous words this week would make a mark as two weeks of historic and closely-watched hearings on the threat of climate change wrapped up Friday. The International Court of Justice took up the largest case in its history after the United Nations General Assembly asked the institution to clarify what countries worldwide are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact. Tuvalu was one of several small island nations which, fearing they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, lobbied the U.N. to ask the court for an advisory opinion. In all 96 countries and 11 international organizations spoke in the Peace Palace, including many who had never before participated in proceedings before The Hague-based court. Even if the proceedings don’t lead to a defining opinion, Nikki Reisch, the director of climate policy at the Center for International Environmental Law, says they were a giant step forward. 'The hearings have really been a watershed moment for human rights, climate justice and accountability, even before a decision is out,' she said. The court has been asked to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? Countries including Tuvalu, Chile and the Philippines want countries such as the United States, China and Russia to reduce their emissions and provide financial help to alleviate the devastating impact of climate change that they feel endangers their very existence. 'We want a clear and unambiguous decision that the conduct — that has caused climate change over time — is unlawful under international law,' Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, who is leading the legal team for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Associated Press. Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. 'It is too often repeated that the decision will be non-binding,' Reisch said. Instead, she insisted, 'it will be an authoritative interpretation of international law.' Activists could bring lawsuits against their own countries for failing to comply with the decision and states could return to the ICJ to hold each other to account. And whatever the judges say will be used as the basis for other legal instruments, like investment agreements, which could be rendered 'null and void' by an aggressive opinion, according to Wewerinke-Singh. However, major greenhouse gas emitters like the United States want the court to defer to the landmark Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit human-caused warming to a 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). 'States designed this international legal framework to address the uniquely complex collective action problem posed by anthropogenic global warming, and it embodies the clearest, most specific and the most current expression of states’ consent to be bound by international law in respect of climate change,' Margaret Taylor said on behalf of the U.S., referring to the Paris Agreement. The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Between 1990 and 2020, sea levels rose by a global average of 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) and parts of the South Pacific have seen significantly more. The vast majority of participating countries said Paris does not go far enough to protect them. Fifteen judges from around the world will now consider the oral and written submissions. At the end of the hearing on Friday, the court posed a series of questions to the participants who have until the end of the year to reply. On average, the court takes six months to issue an opinion but given the extent of the proceedings, a decision isn’t expected until late in 2025. ____ Follow AP’s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment	https://apnews.com/article/world-court-climate-change-733baa2cfa306ac63db8eeed6cdf3783	2024-12-13T09:24:50-08:00	
Europe's anti-torture watchdog slams Italy over migrant detention abuses	ROME (AP) — The Council of Europe's anti-torture committee on Friday released a report criticizing Italy’s treatment of migrants in local detention centers, citing cases of physical ill-treatment, excessive force and the use of psychotropic drugs on detainees. The report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) follows an April visit to four migrant detention and repatriation centers in Milan, Gradisca, Potenza and Rome. Under Italian law, these centers are aimed at hosting migrants who try to enter the country without a visa, are not entitled to apply for asylum and are deemed 'socially dangerous' by law enforcement. The report details instances of 'interventions' in the detention facilities, known as CPRs, and identifies shortcomings including 'the absence of any rigorous and independent monitoring of such interventions and the lack of an accurate recording of injuries' sustained by detainees. Italy has in the past defended the role of these centers as a deterrent to surging illegal migration, noting that some 'prison elements' are necessary to prevent escapes from these facilities. The far-right government led by Giorgia Meloni has also tried to export the Italian model abroad, sealing a contentious agreement with Albania to build and run two migrant holding centers in the eastern country. The deal, however, has faced legal hurdles and has been suspended by Italian magistrates in its early stages. In its report Friday, the CPT was also critical of the 'widespread practice' of administering unprescribed psychotropic drugs to detainees in Potenza, one of the four centers visited. The report also highlights 'the prolonged handcuffing of persons apprehended on the territory during their transfer to a (holding facility).' In its report, the anti-torture watchdog recommended Italy to remove the 'carceral elements' from the centers and to ensure their proper maintenance, notably the sanitary facilities. It also showed the critical lack of activities offered to migrants held in the centers, with minimal efforts to offer them 'a few activities of a recreational nature.' The report concludes that the committee's findings, 'notably in relation to the very poor material conditions, the absence of a regime of activities, the disproportionate security approach, the variable quality of health care provision and the lack of transparency of the management of CPRs by private contractors,' call into question the application of such a model by Italy in an extra-territorial setting, such as in Albania. The February death of a young detainee at Rome’s Ponte Galeria center brought renewed attention to the harsh conditions inside these de facto jails for migrants, which have been condemned by lawyers and activists as 'black holes' of human rights violations. From 2019 to 2024, at least 13 people had died — five by suicide — inside Italy’s detention centers, according to activists and aid groups. Hundreds of suicide attempts and self-harm incidents have also been reported. The Italian government believes the detention centers, which were established in 1999, are essential to reduce the number of migrants risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean and reach Europe. In 2023, the government extended the maximum detention period from 90 days to 18 months. In response to Friday's report, Italian authorities indicated that the described cases of physical ill-treatment 'have not been the subject of criminal investigations and that several inspections have been carried out by the health authorities at the Potenza CPR in relation to the practice of allegedly widespread over-medication of detained persons.'	https://apnews.com/article/italy-council-of-europe-migration-centers-albania-detainees-violence-0dba82e1f333c60b3bc49a0894970e9d	2024-12-13T07:57:30-08:00	
Who was in ousted Syrian President Assad's inner circle and where are they now?	BEIRUT (AP) — After insurgents toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad this month, many senior officials and members of his dreaded intelligence and security services appear to have melted away. Activists say some of them have managed to flee the country while others went to hide in their hometowns. For more than five decades, the Assad family has ruled Syria with an iron grip, locking up those who dared question their power in the country's notorious prisons, where rights groups say inmates were regularly tortured or killed. The leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham insurgent group — which led anti-government fighters who forced Assad from power — has vowed to bring those who carried out such abuses to justice. 'We will go after them in our country,' said HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was previously known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani. He added that the group will also ask foreign countries to hand over any suspects. But finding those responsible for abuses could prove difficult. Some 8,000 Syrian citizens have entered Lebanon through the Masnaa border crossing in recent days, according to two Lebanese security officials and a judicial official, and about 5,000 have left the neighboring country through Beirut’s international airport. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. Most of those are presumed to be regular people, and Lebanon’s Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi said earlier this week that no Syrian official entered Lebanon through a legal border crossing. In an apparent effort to prevent members of Assad's government from escaping, the security officials said a Lebanese officer who was in charge of Masnaa was ordered to go on vacation because of his links to Assad's brother. But Rami Abdurrhaman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, says several senior officers have nonetheless made it to neighboring Lebanon using travel documents with fake names. Here's a look at Assad and some of the officials in his inner circle. Bashar Assad The Western-educated ophthalmologist initially raised hopes that he would be unlike his strongman father, Hafez, when he took power in 2000, including freeing political prisoners and allowing for a more open discourse. But when protests of his rule erupted in March 2011, Assad turned to brutal tactics to crush dissent. As the uprising became an outright civil war, he unleashed his military to blast opposition-held cities, with support from allies Iran and Russia. He has fled to Moscow, according to Russian state media. Maher Assad The younger brother of the ousted president was the commander of the 4th Armored Division, which Syrian opposition activists have accused of killings, torture, extortion and drug trafficking, in addition to running its own detention centers. He is under U.S. and European sanctions. He disappeared over the weekend, and Abdurrhaman said he made it to Russia. Last year, French authorities issued an international arrest warrant for Maher Assad, along with his brother and two army generals, for alleged complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity, including in a 2013 chemical attack on rebel-held Damascus suburbs. Maj. Gen. Ali Mamlouk Mamlouk was a security adviser to Assad and former head of the intelligence services. He is wanted in Lebanon for two explosions in the northern city of Tripoli in 2012 that killed and wounded dozens. Mamlouk is also wanted in France after a court convicted him and others in absentia of complicity in war crimes and sentenced them to life in prison. The trial focused on the officials’ role in the 2013 arrest in Damascus of a Franco-Syrian man and his son and their subsequent torture and killing. Abdurrahman said Mamlouk fled to Lebanon, and it is not clear if he is still in the country under the protection of Hezbollah. Brig. Gen. Suheil al-Hassan Al-Hassan was the commander of the 25th Special Missions Forces Division and later became the head of the Syrian Special Forces, which were key to many of the government's battlefield victories in the long-running civil war, including in Aleppo and the eastern suburbs of Damascus that long held off Assad's troops. Al-Hassan is known to have close ties to Russia and was praised by Russian President Vladimir Putin during one of his visits to Syria. Al-Hassan's whereabouts are not known. Maj. Gen. Hussam Luka Luka, head of the General Security Directorate intelligence service, is not well known among the wider public but has played a major role in the crackdown against the opposition, mainly in the central city of Homs that was dubbed the 'capital of the Syrian revolt.' Luka has been sanctioned by the U.S. and Britain for his role in the crackdown. It's not clear where he is. Maj. Gen. Qahtan Khalil Khalil, whose whereabouts are also unknown, was head of the Air Force Intelligence service and is widely known as the 'Butcher of Daraya' for allegedly leading a 2012 attack on a Damascus suburb of the same name that killed hundreds of people. Other officials — Retired Maj. Gen. Jamil Hassan, former head of the Air Force Intelligence service, is also suspected of bearing responsibility for the attack in Daraya. Hassan was among those convicted in France this year along with Mamlouk. — Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Ali Abbas and Maj. Gen. Bassam Merhej al-Hassan, head of Bashar Assad’s office and the man in charge of his security, are accused of human rights violations.	https://apnews.com/article/bashar-assad-maher-inner-circle-syria-3d6a78b643e6515a1b89ef5f1b9057f7	2024-12-13T07:57:01-08:00	
Nancy Pelosi hospitalized after she 'sustained an injury' from fall on official trip to Luxembourg	WASHINGTON (AP) — Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been hospitalized after she 'sustained an injury' during an official engagement in Luxembourg, according to a spokesman. Pelosi, 84, was in Europe with a bipartisan congressional delegation to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. Her spokesman, Ian Krager, said in a statement that she is 'currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals' and is unable to attend the remainder of events on her trip. He did not describe the nature of her injury or give any additional details, but a person familiar with the incident said that Pelosi tripped and fell while at an event with the other members of Congress. The person requested anonymity to discuss the fall because they were not authorized to speak about it publicly. Krager said that Pelosi 'looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.' Among the members on the trip was Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who posted on social media that he was 'praying for a speedy recovery,' for Pelosi. The two lawmakers were captured holding hands in a group photo Friday at the U.S. Embassy in Luxembourg. 'I’m disappointed Speaker Emerita Pelosi won’t be able to join the rest of our delegation’s events this weekend as I know how much she looked forward to honoring our veterans,' McCaul wrote on X. 'But she is strong, and I am confident she will be back on her feet in no time.' The former leader's fall comes two years after her husband Paul was attacked by a man with a hammer at their San Francisco home. The man, who was sentenced in October to 30 years in federal prison, broke into their home looking for Pelosi. Pelosi, who was first elected in 1987 and served as speaker twice, stepped down from her leadership post two years ago but remained in Congress and was re-elected to represent her San Francisco district in November. She has remained active in the two years since she left the top job, working with Democrats in private and in public and attending official events. Last summer, she was instrumental in her party's behind the scenes push to urge President Joe Biden to leave the presidential ticket.

Canadian government asks labor board to intervene in Canada Post strike as Christmas nears	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Mail could begin moving again in Canada as early as next week after the federal government moved Friday to end a nearly monthlong work stoppage at Canada Post. Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon announced he’s referred the dispute to the Canada Industrial Relations Board, with the aim of ordering the nearly 55,000 workers back to their posts and extending the current collective agreement until May 22, 2025 — if the board determines a deal isn’t within immediate reach. 'Canadians are rightly fed up,' MacKinnon said. With Christmas fast approaching, there was no apparent movement at the bargaining table. MacKinnon had previously rebuffed calls for Ottawa to intervene, saying it’s up to the two sides to work out a deal. But he said Canadians — especially small businesses, people in remote communities and Indigenous people — have suffered greatly as a result of the strike. The key issues include wages, job security and how to staff a proposed expansion into weekend delivery. MacKinnon said Canada Post is built to deliver letters but letter volumes have dropped dramatically and there is a highly competitive parcel delivery market. 'There are major structural changes in that industry that have to be accounted for. There are workers aspirations that have to be accounted for,' MacKinnon said. 'Those are interests that are tough to reconcile.' Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government previously forced the country’s two major railroads into arbitration, ending that work stoppage. 'The Union denounces in the strongest terms this assault on our constitutionally protected right to collectively bargain and to strike,' the Canadian Union of Postal Workers said in a statement. 'This order continues a deeply troubling pattern in which the government uses its arbitrary powers to let employers off the hook.' The Canadian Federation of Independent Business welcomed the move. It estimates small businesses have been losing a combined $100 million Canadian (US$70 million) every day. 'This will be too late to salvage any of the Christmas holiday season for small businesses,' CFIB president Dan Kelly said in a statement. 'With a massive backlog, it will be nearly impossible for any new shipments to make it to Canadians before Christmas through Canada Post,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-post-strike-mail-service-dfaad46e8a9dcfcb32127924a6caaabf	2024-12-13T06:48:42-08:00	
Lindsey Vonn to enter World Cup ski races next weekend in Switzerland in her comeback at age 40	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) — Lindsey Vonn will return to World Cup ski racing next weekend for a pair of super-G events in St. Moritz, Switzerland, as she continues her comeback at 40 years old. Vonn teased her return in an Instagram post through her sponsor, Red Bull, on Friday morning. She said, 'My body is finally put back together. I hear St. Moritz is pretty nice this time of year.' The U.S. Ski Team then confirmed she will race in St. Moritz. She's won five of her 82 World Cup races on the course at St. Moritz. There will be super-G competitions next Saturday and Sunday. 'It’s the coolest thing ever,' said Picabo Street, a two-time Olympic medalist and Vonn's former teammate. 'I’m not surprised at all. I’ve seen her intermittently and she’s stayed in great shape. She is the hardest working person I’ve met in my life — period.' It will be Vonn's first major race since February 2019, when she took third in the downhill during the world championships in Sweden. An assortment of injuries, including to her knee, sent her into retirement. But a partial knee replacement last April has her feeling good enough again to give racing another chance. Vonn earned enough points to be eligible to compete on the World Cup circuit through a series of lower-level competitions last weekend in Copper Mountain, Colorado. She’s been testing out the Birds of Prey course at Beaver Creek as a forerunner in training runs this week. She didn't take the hill Friday, but will again in a forerunning capacity ahead of the downhill on Saturday and the super-G on Sunday. 'She’s living her best life,' said Street, who's doing commentary work at the Birds of Prey races this weekend for NBC. 'She’s earned every second of it.' When Vonn left the tour, she had 82 World Cup wins — the record for a woman at the time and within reach of the all-time Alpine mark of 86 held by Swedish standout Ingemar Stenmark. The women’s record held by Vonn was eclipsed in January 2023 by Mikaela Shiffrin, whose 99 wins are more than any Alpine ski racer in the history of the sport. 'It’s awesome' to have Vonn back, said Czech Republic ski racer/snowboarder Ester Ledecka, who won the 2018 Olympic super-G in South Korea as Vonn finished tied for sixth. 'It was for me a little bit sad to see her finishing her career. I thought, ‘Hey, you should finish it when you want to, not because your body is not capable to let you do your runs.' I’m very happy that she’s back and she’s feeling good and she’s happy. 'I think she’ll be also very fast. So, I’m very happy to have her around.' ___ AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/alpine-skiing	https://apnews.com/article/lindsey-vonn-ski-racing-acdc37bed64444ee601b56f8cf5f965c	2024-12-13T06:34:13-08:00	
Saudi Arabia's plans to host the men's World Cup 2034 will be harmful for the climate, experts say	As the newly-named host of the 2034 World Cup in men's soccer, Saudi Arabia says it will construct or renovate 15 stadiums, create a futuristic city and expand airports in a massive buildout to accommodate millions of athletes, coaches and spectators. That will emit tons of planet-warming greenhouse gases as concrete and steel are manufactured and transported, diesel-powered excavators and trucks move material and new buildings are powered and cooled. When all the emissions associated with the world's buildings are grouped together, they are the largest contributor to climate change. Constructing so many new venues is 'environmentally wasteful in the extreme' because so much carbon will be emitted and scarce resources used, said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in Massachusetts who has written several books about the economics of mega sporting events. Zimbalist said the World Cup should be held in countries with a developed soccer culture and industry. Seth Warren Rose, founding director of the research organization Eneref Institute, said the world will be even hotter a decade from now, and can’t afford this added warming. 'I’m sorry, but we’re living in a different planet. We have to prepare for that,' Rose said. 'By 2034, we’ll be living in a different climate and that’s not a metaphor.' Rose said his message to organizers is: Make a genuine effort to reduce emissions or don't host at all. Saudi Arabia’s plans will rely heavily on concrete, which is responsible for about 8% of worldwide emissions that warm the planet, with iron and steel accounting for another 7%. Human rights groups are concerned that giving the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia will endanger migrant workers. In a bid book detailing its plans for development across five cities ahead of the World Cup, Saudi Arabia said three new stadiums are currently under construction and eight more are planned, to accommodate 2034's first-ever 48-team games. Buildings constructed for international sporting events often end up becoming 'white elephant' venues that sit idle once games are over. The Saudi Arabian Football Federation did not respond to request for comment. Saudi Arabia has proposed 134 accommodations for teams and referees, new hotels, several fan festival locations, transportation expansions, including high-speed rail and further investment in its futuristic city of Neom. Much of what the nation included in its bid book relates to its Vision 2030 strategic plan, which the government calls a plan to diversify its economy and unlock new business opportunities. The bid does include sustainability initiatives, said Karim Elgendy, a fellow at London’s Chatham House think tank. Among them are running stadiums on clean electricity such as solar, using energy-efficient natural ventilation and shading and mandating green building standards. But Elgendy said the sheer scale of Saudi Arabia's apparent plans for the event, plus the distances between host cities suggest this could become the most carbon-intensive World Cup in history. Elgendy said how they mitigate this undertaking will determine the environmental impact and without measures, the event could have a carbon footprint that is almost twice the record set in 2022. In contrast, organizers of this summer’s Paris Olympics said this week they met their goal of cutting the games’ carbon footprint by half compared to 2012 and 2016. They did this using renewable energy, recycled materials, plant-based food options that are less carbon-intensive than meat and even powering the famous Olympic cauldron with electricity and lights rather than burning gas. To critics who suggest FIFA ought to have chosen a different host country, like the United Kingdom which has dozens of stadiums, Walker Ross, a researcher of sport ecology and sustainability at the University of Edinburgh points out the Saudi bid was the only one in a fast-tracked process. The next World Cup, in 2026, will span 16 cities across North America. Ross said that could have a significant carbon footprint, too, as teams and fans travel across an entire continent. The same could be said for the 2030 World Cup to be played across six countries. If anyone is at fault, it's FIFA, he said, because it's their bid process. 'People kind of throw their hands up in the air and act like there are certain countries that should and shouldn’t host when it comes to these events,' he said. 'But if this sport is truly for the world, then we have to be open to everyone hosting.' Qatar went on a $200 billion construction spree, building seven stadiums, a new metro system, highways, high-rise buildings and a new city ahead of the 2022 event there. Organizers and FIFA projected it would produce some 3.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over the decade spent preparing for the tournament, or about 3% of Qatar’s total emissions in 2019, according to World Bank data. Experts say the Qatar event had the highest carbon emissions to date. Skeptics and outside experts said Qatar’s accounting that it hosted a ‘carbon neutral’ World Cup didn't encompass the event’s full carbon footprint. FIFA accepted Saudi Arabia’s sustainability and climate promises in an evaluation released in November, noting that 'whilst the extent of construction would have a material environmental impact, the bid provides a good foundation for delivering mitigation measures to address some of the environment-related challenges.' FIFA directed The Associated Press to the evaluation Thursday when asked for additional comment. Saudi Arabia's emissions have been growing; it emitted 533 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2022, or 1.6% of global emissions, according to the International Energy Agency, and its fossil fuel production is skyrocketing. Renewable energy remains nearly nonexistent. The country has a goal to source at least half of its power from renewables by 2030. 'It appears that FIFA has learnt very little from the debacle with the World Cup in Qatar,' said Khaled Diab, a spokeperson at Carbon Market Watch. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Bringing hope and joy: superheroes for children with cancer in Kosovo	PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Superheroes like Superman, Spiderman, Batman, Super Mario, Superwoman, Captain America, Bumble Bees and the Flash became a powerful symbol of renewal to children on Friday who are battling grave cancer illnesses in Kosovo. As the year draws to a close, many families eagerly anticipate the joy and togetherness of New Year’s festivities. Yet, for seven children, part of the 49 cancer patients admitted this year, battling leukemia and other types of cancer in a hospital ward in the capital Pristina, this season comes with uncertainty, fear, and hardship. However, a remarkable initiative involving 'superheroes' clad in unique costumes brought unexpected joy — not only to the children but also, perhaps even more deeply, to their parents. 'That is a very nice initiative which enjoys us so much,' said mother Blerta Sahiti. The hospital setting, often associated with clinical sterility and emotional struggles, transformed into a place of wonder and laughter when volunteers dressed as beloved superheroes climbed down in ropes to take gifts to the children. Their mission was simple: to bring joy, hope, and a moment of respite to the children and their families. 'The children love such personalities. They dream of them every day,' said Rufadie Macastena Maxhuni, a doctor at the ward. 'That is such a great joy.' Each superhero wore distinct costumes, adding a personalized touch to their appearances. They were not just characters from comic books but symbols of courage, strength, and resilience — the very traits these young fighters exhibit every day. 'You can hardly describe with words these special special feeling (we receive),' said Berat Kajtazi, who has played Captain America in the last four years. For the children, the arrival of these heroes meant stepping into a world beyond IV drips, chemotherapy sessions, and endless tests. Their faces lit up with delight as they received thoughtfully chosen gifts and shared hugs with their favorite characters. —- Semini reported from Tirana, Albania	https://apnews.com/article/children-cancer-superheroes-kosovo-hospital-4c2f946cfea2d89e18f66a6e4bdecbb6	2024-12-13T04:46:20-08:00	
Companies from UK, Italy and Japan to form joint venture for new fighter jet	LONDON (AP) — The three companies building a next generation fighter jet for the U.K., Italy and Japan revealed Friday that they are forming a joint venture to deliver the aircraft. Under the agreement, Britain's BAE Systems, Italy's Leonardo and Japan Aircraft Industrial Enhancement will each own a third of the new joint venture, which will be subject to regulatory approvals. 'This agreement is the result of an intensive journey made possible by pooling our mutual and shared experiences,' said Roberto Cingolani, Leonardo's chief executive. The headquarters for the Global Combat Air Programme, or GCAP, will be the U.K., but operations will take place in each of the partner nations. Under the terms of the agreement, the first chief executive will come from Italy. 'The new business will bring together the significant strengths and expertise of the companies involved to create an innovative organization that will lead the way in developing a next generation combat air system, creating long-term, high value and skilled jobs across the partner nations for decades to come,' said Charles Woodburn, BAE Systems' chief executive. The triangular-shaped jets will have supersonic capability and cutting-edge technology. Pilots will be able to use virtual reality in the aircraft’s digital cockpit, with vital information displayed directly in front of them. The aim is that they will take to the skies by 2035. Kimito Nakae, president of JAIEC, acknowledged that the way ahead 'might not always be simple and straightforward,' but that 'through continuing the strong spirit of trilateral cooperation and collaboration that we have fostered up to this point, we will not only deliver the GCAP on time but also at a level that exceeds all of our expectations.'	https://apnews.com/article/britain-italy-japan-fighter-jet-1b4f5c4bbf761406ae1b2b60352a483c	2024-12-13T04:34:45-08:00	
Thousands of Syrians celebrate in central Damascus during first Friday prayers since Assad's fall	DAMASCUS (AP) — Thousands of Syrians gathered Friday at Umayyad Square, the largest in Damascus, to celebrate after the first Muslim Friday prayers following the downfall of former President Bashar Assad. Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of insurgency that toppled Assad in a lightning 10-day march across the country to Damascus, appeared in a video message in which he congratulated 'the great Syrian people for the victory of the blessed revolution.' 'I invite them to head to the squares to show their happiness without shooting bullets and scaring people,' he said. 'And then after we will work to build this country and as I said in the beginning, we will be victorious by the help of God.' Al-Sharaa's force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, and its allied insurgents have been working to establish security and start a political transition after seizing the capital early Sunday. At the same time, they have tried to reassure a public that is both stunned by the fall of the state that had long ruled with an iron hand and concerned over extremist jihadis among the insurgents. The Friday prayers have a particular symbolism because in the early days of the anti-government uprising-turned-civil-war in Syria in 2011, protesters would turn out en masse after going to the mosque. 'Unified Syria to build Syria,' the crowd gathered in Damascus' Umayyad Square chanted. Some shouted slurs about the former president and his late father, calling them pigs, an insult that would have previously led to offenders being hauled off to one of the feared detention centers of Assad’s security forces. The crowd included many families with children, and some of the demonstrators had come from far-flung areas of the country, including from Idlib — the longtime rebel enclave in the northwest of Syia, for years isolated on the other side of the civil war's battle lines. Wardan Aoun, who identified himself as a fighter from Idlib, said, 'There is a good government now and God willing corruption will be gone.' 'We lived in Idlib under this government and there is no corruption there,' he said, referring to the rebel-led administration in the enclave. Khaled Abu Chahine, 51, from Kafr Shams in the southern province of Daraa, where the 2011 uprising first erupted, said he hoped for 'freedom and coexistence between all Syrians, Alawites, Sunnis, Shiites and Druze. No to racism.' 'The former government was a government of crime and executions,' he said, calling on foreign nations 'hosting these gangs to bring them to justice and those who are in Syria and committed crimes should face justice.' As the gathering took place, the top U.S. diplomat was in the region discussing the U.S. view on the developments in Syria with regional powers. In the Turkish capital, Ankara, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday there was 'broad agreement' between Turkey and the United States on what they would like to see in Syria. That starts with an 'interim government in Syria, one that is inclusive and non-sectarian and one that protects the rights of minorities and women' and does not 'pose any kind of threat to any of Syria’s neighbors,' Blinken said during joint statements with Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. The insurgent groups that toppled Assad in Syria have not made clear their policy or stance on Israel, whose military in recent days has bombed sites all over the country. Israel says it is trying to prevent weapons from falling into extremist hands, and has seized a swath of southern Syria along the border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, calling it a buffer zone. Blinken said it was imperative to continue with efforts to the keep the Islamic State group under control. The Turkish foreign minister said the two had discussed ways of establishing prosperity in Syria and ending terrorism in the country. 'Our priority is establishing stability in Syria as soon as possible, preventing terrorism from gaining ground, and ensuring that IS and the PKK aren’t dominant,' Fidan said, in reference to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party. The U.S. and Turkey have different stances on the allied Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led group in Syria that has been a key part of the fight against IS but that Turkey regards as a terrorist group. Blinken said Washington is 'very focused on Syria, very focused on the opportunity that now is before us and before the Syrian people to move from out from under the shackles of Bashar al-Assad to a different and better future for the Syrian people, one that the Syrian people decide for themselves.' ———— Lee reported from Ankara.

US and allies mark the 80th anniversary of World War II Battle of the Bulge	BASTOGNE, Belgium (AP) — Eighty years later, World War II veteran David Marshall, has a picture in his wallet of him fighting in the snow and bitter cold in one of the defining moments of the four-year conflict — the Battle of the Bulge. The 100-year-old vet was part of commemorations on Friday as the United States, its European allies and a dwindling number of veterans remembered the month of dramatic fighting that stopped Adolf Hitler’s last-ditch offensive and opened the way for the full Nazi defeat. Still, beyond the ceremonies and this weekend's events in Belgium and Luxembourg to commemorate one of the most important and deadly battles that helped decide the war, Marshall wants people to go one step beyond just remembering it. The young should 'study about the war,' Marshall said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'Learn all you can about it in order to prevent any future war.' 'If you forget the past, you are not going to have a future,' said Marshal, who was in the battle working a mortar. At dawn on Dec. 16, 1944, over 200,000 German soldiers threw Hitler’s last hopes in a unexpected attack through the dense woods of Belgium and Luxembourg’s hilly Ardennes. Making the most of the surprise move, the cold, freezing weather and wearied U.S. troops, the Germans pierced the front line so deeply it came to be known as the Battle of the Bulge. It ultimately made sure the Allied advance, started on the D-Day beaches of Normandy in June 1944, could continue right on to Berlin. Initially outnumbered, U.S. troops delayed the attack enough in fierce fighting to allow reinforcements to stream in and turn the tide of the battle by Christmas. Beyond the overwhelming German forces, the conditions were just as tough, said Marshall. 'It was cold, wind with snow — and there were a few Germans around, you know. And it was a matter of subsisting, you know, the weather rather than the Germans. Fighting them was not the problem. Fighting the weather was the problem,' said Marshall. Hitler had hoped the advance would change the course of the war by forcing U.S. and British troops to sue for peace, thus freeing Germany to focus on the rapidly advancing Soviet armies in the east. After the fighting in the Battle of the Bulge ended on Jan. 28, 1945, Allied forces invaded Germany, eventually leading to the Nazi surrender and the end of the war in Europe. Germany is now an ally of the United States and its wartime partners in NATO and the symbolism was not wasted on such day. 'There's no reason we cannot get along,' said veteran Gilbert Charleston, 101, a Choctow Nation Elder of the 739th Tank Battalion, after he shared memories over the picture with Marshall. 'If they would just take the time to be kind to each other and not try to be so possessive — help when help is needed,' he said. 'I think the world would be a lot better place.' ___ Associated Press writer Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/europe-us-wwii-battle-of-bulge-6b4d87e4f7b79614e4f8ccb343c81c47	2024-12-13T02:13:54-08:00	
Suspected Chinese spy with business ties to Prince Andrew barred from UK	LONDON (AP) — A suspected Chinese spy with business ties to Prince Andrew has been barred from the U.K. because of concerns he poses a threat to national security. A British immigration tribunal upheld the decision on Thursday in a ruling that revealed the Chinese national had developed such a close relationship with Andrew that he was invited to the prince’s birthday party. Government officials were concerned the man could have misused his influence because the prince was under 'considerable pressure' at the time, according to the ruling. British authorities believe the Chinese national, whose name wasn’t released, was working on behalf of the United Front Work Department, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party that is used to influence foreign entities. The government determined that the businessman 'was in a position to generate relationships between senior Chinese officials and prominent U.K. figures which could be leveraged for political interference purposes by the Chinese State,' according to the tribunal's decision. Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, has been repeatedly criticized for his links to wealthy foreigners, raising concerns that those individuals are trying to buy access to the royal family. Andrew’s finances have been squeezed in recent years after he was forced to step away from royal duties and give up public funding amid concerns about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the American financier and convicted pedophile who committed suicide in prison in 2019. British intelligence chiefs have become increasingly concerned about China’s efforts to influence U.K. government policy. In 2022, Britain’s domestic intelligence service, known as MI5, warned politicians that a British-Chinese lawyer had been seeking to improperly influence members of Parliament for years. A parliamentary researcher was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of providing sensitive information to China. The 50-year-old Chinese national covered by this week’s ruling was described as a man who worked as a junior civil servant in China before he came to the U.K. as a student in 2002. He earned a master’s degree in public administration and public policy at the University of York before starting a business that advises U.K.-based companies on their operations in China. He was granted the right to live and work in the U.K. for an indefinite period in 2013. Although he didn’t make Britain his permanent home, the man told authorities that he spent one to two weeks a month in the country and considered it his 'second home.' He was stopped while entering the U.K. on Nov. 6, 2021, and ordered to surrender his mobile phone and other digital devices on which authorities found a letter from a senior adviser to Andrew confirming that he was authorized to act on behalf of the prince in relation to potential partners and investors in China. The letter and other documents highlighted the strength of the relationship between Andrew, his adviser and the Chinese national. 'I also hope that it is clear to you where you sit with my principal and indeed his family,' the adviser wrote. 'You should never underestimate the strength of that relationship. Outside of his closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on.' The letter went on to describe how they had found a way to work around former private secretaries to the prince and other people who weren’t completely trusted. 'Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor,' the adviser wrote. Andrew lives at the Royal Lodge, a historic country estate near Windsor Castle, west of London.	https://apnews.com/article/prince-andrew-chinese-spy-2908cb7c032e52b706364d86c51b60b9	2024-12-13T01:27:00-08:00	
Japan's ban on recognizing same-sex unions is unconstitutional, a court finds. Here's what to know	TOKYO (AP) — Japan's refusal to recognize same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, a high court ruled Friday, the latest victory for the LGBGQ+ community to add pressure on the reluctant government. Friday’s decision by the Fukuoka High Court in southern Japan marks the eighth victory out of nine rulings since the first group of plaintiffs filed lawsuits in 2019. Here is what to know about the lawsuits, what’s next and what it means to the LGBTQ+ community. Q. What did the court say in the latest ruling? A. In Friday’s ruling, presiding Judge Takeshi Okada noted that the current civil law provisions barring the marriage of same-sex couples violates their fundamental right to the pursuit of happiness guaranteed under Article 13 of the Japanese Constitution. The court also said the ongoing ban violates sections in the Constitution that guarantee equality, individual dignity and the essential equality of both sexes. The judge said there is no longer any reason to not legally recognize same-sex marriage. The government has argued that marriage under civil law does not cover same-sex couples and places importance on natural reproduction. After the ruling, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that the government will monitor pending lawsuits and public opinion. Q. Why is the ruling significant? A. Friday’s ruling is the eighth overall that found the ongoing ban to be unconstitutional or nearly so, against only one district court decision that found it constitutional. It was the third straight high court decision, following rulings this year in Sapporo and Tokyo, that clearly called the current ban unconstitutional. The rulings can still be appealed to the Supreme Court, but lawyers and plaintiffs say the overwhelming 8-1 wins are already enough and the government should quickly take action. Friday’s verdict comes at a time the main obstacle to recognition, Japan’s conservative Liberal Democratic Party, was forced into leading a minority government after its major election loss in October. The LDP is likely to have to compromise more on liberal policies pushed by the opposition parties such as marriage equality, which is largely supported by the general public. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, considered a centrist who has indicated support for same-sex marriage, told a parliamentary session last week he is aware of the sufferings of the same-sex couples and that he will not just 'sit back and do nothing.' His comment raised hope among the LGBTQ+ community and their supporters. It is unclear whether he will act, or how much he could do against resistance within the party. Q. Why are plaintiffs suing? A. More than 30 plaintiffs have joined the lawsuits on marriage equality filed in five regions across Japan since 2019. They argue that civil law provisions barring same-sex marriage violate the Constitutional right to equality and freedom of marriage. Three same-sex couples from Fukuoka and Kumamoto in southwestern Japan are the plaintiffs in Friday’s case. Under Japan’s civil and family laws that recognize marriage only between a man and woman, the privileges and protection that result from matrimony such as inheritance rights, tax and other benefits are limited to heterosexual couples. Same-sex couples seek the same rights to pursue happiness and social recognition as a family. Q. What’s next? Two more high court rulings are pending in Osaka and Nagoya, and are expected in March. Takako Uesugi, a lawyer representing plaintiffs in Tokyo, said Friday that with all three high court rulings in favor of their campaign she has high expectations for the two upcoming decisions. 'We’ll continue fighting until we achieve legalization of same-sex marriage,' she said and urged the government to legalize marriage equality as soon as possible. Q. What is the situation of the LGBTQ+ community in Japan? Though discrimination still exists at school, work and elsewhere, public backing for legalizing same-sex marriage and support among the business community have rapidly increased in recent years. Japan is the only member of the Group of Seven industrialized countries that does not recognize same-sex marriage or provide any other form of legally binding protection for LGBTQ+ couples. The governing LDP, known for its conservative family values and reluctance to promote gender equality and sexual diversity, has stonewalled the campaign. The government enacted a non-binding LGBTQ+ awareness promotion law last year that critics said was watered down. Hundreds of municipalities have introduced non-binding recognition system such as partnership certificates in recent years, which are considered an improvement, but activists say that’s not enough.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-lgbtq-samesex-marriage-ruling-constitution-ldp-a1528f5daf4d642dfa74d61f59953252	2024-12-13T00:32:59-08:00	
China jails former national football coach for 20 years for bribery	BEIJING (AP) — The former coach of the Chinese men's national soccer team has received a 20-year-prison sentence for bribery, Chinese state media reported Friday. Li Tie, who once played in the English Premier League as a midfielder for Everton, was found guilty of 'leveraging his positions' as head coach of the national football and national selection team to receive bribes of more than 50 million yuan (about $7 million), by a court in the city of Xianning in the central Hubei province. Li coached the Chinese men’s team between January 2020 and December 2021. He was also charged with taking bribes between 2015 to 2019, when he worked for local football clubs. The investigation into Li’s conduct began in November 2022. He pleaded guilty to bribery and corruption in March of this year. Li played in England for Everton from 2002 to 2006 and with Sheffield United from 2006-2008. His sentencing is the latest in a series of high-profile corruption cases involving Chinese football. In March, the former president of the Chinese Football Association (CFA), Chen Xuyuan, was sentenced to life in prison for bribery.

UEFA punishes Serbia for fan misconduct including trying to burn Albania flag	NYON, Switzerland (AP) — UEFA punished Serbia’s soccer federation on Friday for racist acts by fans at two Nations League games, including trying to burn an Albania flag in Switzerland. On Monday, UEFA's executive committee is set to confirm Serbia and Albania as co-hosts of the Under-21 European Championship in 2027. At a Switzerland-Serbia game last month, visiting fans were filmed trying to set light to an Albania flag. The Swiss team, including captain Granit Xhaka, typically fields players with family ties to Albania or Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. UEFA said its disciplinary committee charged the Serbian federation for 'racist and/or discriminatory behavior' in Switzerland on Nov. 15 and at home to Denmark three days later, plus other incidents including fans showing an 'illicit banner.' Serbia’s federation was banned from selling tickets for the team’s next two away games in UEFA competitions, and must close parts of the stadium at two home games. The first parts of the sanctions will apply in March when Serbia faces Austria in a two-leg Nations League promotion playoff. UEFA also imposed fines totaling 173,000 euros ($181,000) with 90,000 euros ($94,000) of that for the discrimination. Serbia’s soccer body has been charged by UEFA and FIFA for repeated fan misconduct including at Euro 2024 in Germany and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/uefa-serbia-albania-fans-discrimination-1e16f2665c873f34ac3763317cb1786d	2024-12-12T23:16:33-08:00	
AP photos capture British royal family's year of illness and recovery	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s royal family is always in the public eye, their every move documented by reporters and captured for posterity by photographers. But even for a group of people who live their lives under a microscope, 2024 was something unique. In a year marked by illness and recovery that sidelined both King Charles III and the Princess of Wales for extended periods, the eyes of the public and the telephoto lenses of the press corps probed every appearance for clues about what was to come. The year began peacefully enough as Charles seemingly got on with the business of being king after celebrating his coronation in 2023 and mourning the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, the previous year. But things became complicated very quickly. In early January, Kensington Palace revealed that the Princess of Wales, usually known as Kate, had undergone planned abdominal surgery, without specifying why the operation was needed. Just 10 days later, Charles was admitted to the same London hospital for treatment of an enlarged prostate. Social media went crazy over Kate’s condition, filling a vacuum of information on specifics with a tsunami of uninformed speculation. Soon both revealed they were suffering from cancer, putting enormous strain on the royal family. With two of the most visible royals out sick — and Prince William taking time off to support his wife — it was challenging for the rest of the family to keep up with the never-ending whirl of public appearances that the British public demands. But both slowly returned to duty after receiving treatment. The public studied the pictures to judge for themselves how the royals were responding. Charles, 76, came back first, marking his return with a visit to a cancer center, where he shared his experiences with patients undergoing chemotherapy. Sometimes seen as stuffy and out of touch, Charles left the clinic as a king who could understand and empathize with those facing illness and the uncertain path to recovery. As the monarch walked out the doors, his face broke into a broad grin and he held a bouquet of pink spring flowers aloft in triumph, celebrating with the crowd that had turned out to wish him well. Underscoring his improvement, Charles took a stamina-sapping trip in October, traveling across 12 time zones to visit Australia and Samoa. Kate’s return took longer. The public got their first post-diagnosis glimpse of the 42-year-old princess through a carriage window as she attended the king’s birthday parade, known as Trooping the Color, in June. Kate also appeared at the national Remembrance Day ceremony honoring fallen servicemen and women in November as well as her annual Christmas carol service in December as she slowly took on more duties. But there’s one picture that captures the princess’ year. It’s from the day in July when Kate attended the Wimbledon men’s singles final, stepping in front of the public for the first time without a hat brim or a window between her and the cameras. The crowd is blurred, and she’s looking over her shoulder. Her smile is huge.	https://apnews.com/article/british-royals-king-charles-kate-2024-photos-43e51383f158c3c4907096cc5de79771	2024-12-12T23:04:51-08:00	
14-year-old stabs a Thai-Australian schoolmate to death in a fight, Thai police say	BANGKOK (AP) — A 14-year-old has been arrested on charges alleging that he stabbed a Thai-Australian schoolmate to death in a fight after having an ongoing feud, police in Thailand said Friday. The suspect told investigators he and the victim harbored a mutual dislike from school and they agreed via the Line messaging app to meet outside a grocery store near their homes on Tuesday in Sattahip in Chonburi province, said police Col. Tanapol Klinkesorn, director of the Sattahip police station. The suspect appeared to have lost the fight because the other boy was bigger, but the suspect rushed to his car to grab a cooking knife and stabbed the victim in the back, Tanapol said. The victim was also 14, but the suspect was an eighth-grader while the victim was a year behind him, police said. They did not release their names because of their age but said the Australian Embassy confirmed the victim had dual nationality. The boy was found lying at the entrance to the store with the knife in his back and its broken handle on the ground, according to Sawang Rojanatham Rescue Foundation, a charity organization whose EMS workers rushed to the scene. Tanapol said the suspect, accompanied by his parents, surrendered to Sattahip police about an hour after the stabbing. Police charged him with causing fatal physical harm to another person and a weapons offense. He was release on 10,000 baht ($295 ) bail Wednesday by the Chonburi Juvenile and Family Court. Police said the maximum sentence under the charges is 15 years’ imprisonment, and that they are investigating the case further. Adolescent violence is not rare in Thailand but fatal cases usually involve rival gangs of older students. Sattahip is about 114 kilometers (71 miles) southeast of the capital Bangkok.	https://apnews.com/article/student-feud-thailland-australia-b31a6bb8cfc9a7a25f4126f226d1f60e	2024-12-12T23:04:02-08:00	
Middle East latest: Blinken urges Mideast nations to support a peaceful Syrian political transition	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is pressing ahead with efforts to unify Middle East nations in support of a peaceful political transition in Syria. He is meeting on Friday with Turkey's foreign minister after talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to try to bring Turkey into a consensus to prevent Syria from collapsing into wider turmoil. It's Blinken's 12th trip to the Mideast since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in Gaza last year but first since the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The outgoing Biden administration is particularly concerned that a power vacuum in Syria could exacerbate already heightened tensions in the region and create conditions for the Islamic State group to regain territory and influence. The fighting between Israel and Hamas has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,800 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war in Gaza was sparked by an Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas in southern Israel in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and around 250 others were taken hostage. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here's the latest: Blinken says there's ‘broad agreement’ between US and Turkey on Syria's future ANKARA, Turkey -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday there was 'broad agreement' between Turkey and the United States on what they would like to see in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar Assad. 'There’s broad agreement on what we would like to see going forward, starting with the interim government in Syria, one that is inclusive and non-sectarian and one that protects the rights of minorities and women' and does not 'pose any kind of threat to any of Syria’s neighbors,' Blinken said in joint statements with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. The insurgent groups that toppled Assad in Syria have not made clear their policy or stance on Israel, whose military in recent days has bombed sites all over the country, saying it is trying to prevent weapons from falling into extremist hands. Blinken also said it was crucial to keep the Islamic State group under control. 'We also discussed the imperative of continuing the efforts to keep ISIS down. Our countries worked very hard and gave a lot over many years to ensure the elimination of the territorial caliphate of ISIS to ensure that that threat doesn’t rear its head again,' Blinken said. The Turkish foreign minister said the two discussed ways of establishing prosperity in Syria and ending terrorism in the country. 'Our priority is establishing stability in Syria as soon as possible, preventing terrorism from gaining ground, and ensuring that IS and the PKK aren’t dominant,' Fidan said, in a reference to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party. Blinken said: 'We’re very focused on Syria, very focused on the opportunity that now is before us and before the Syrian people to move from out from under the shackles of Bashar al-Assad to a different and better future for the Syrian people, one that the Syrian people decide for themselves.' Blinken and Fidan said they had also discussed a ceasefire for Gaza. 'We’ve seen in the last couple of weeks more encouraging signs that (a ceasefire) is possible,' Blinken said. Blinken, who is making his 12th trip to the Mideast since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last year but first since the weekend ouster of Assad, met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan late Thursday. The outgoing Biden administration is particularly concerned that a power vacuum in Syria could exacerbate already heightened tensions in the region, which is already wracked by multiple conflicts, and create conditions for the Islamic State group to regain territory and influence. Later Friday, Blinken is to return to Jordan for meetings on Saturday with Arab foreign ministers and senior officials from the European Union, the Arab League and the United Nations. Turkey to reopen its embassy in Syria ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey has appointed a temporary charge d’affaires to reopen its embassy in Syria, Turkey’s state-run news agency reported. The Turkish Embassy in Damascus had suspended operations in 2012 due to the escalating security problems during the Syrian civil war and embassy staff and their families were recalled to Turkey. The Anadolu Agency said late Thursday that Turkey appointed Burhan Koroglu, its ambassador in Mauritania, to the post. 2 UN aid convoys violently attacked in Gaza, US food agency says UNITED NATIONS- – Two U.N. aid convoys were violently attacked in Gaza, making it virtually impossible for humanitarian agencies to operate without putting staff and civilians at risk, the U.N. food agency says. On Wednesday, a 70-truck convoy from Kerem Shalom was waiting for personnel to safeguard the food and other aid destined for central Gaza when there were reported attacks by Israeli forces in the nearby humanitarian zone, the U.N. World Food Program said Thursday. More than 50 people are now estimated to have died in the attacks, including civilians and local security personnel who had been expected to ensure the convoy’s safety, WFP said. The Rome-based agency said the convoy was forced to proceed from Kerem Shalom to central Gaza without any security arrangements, using the Philadelphi corridor, an Israeli-controlled route that had been recently approved and successfully utilized twice. On the way, WFP said, conflict and insecurity led to a loss of communications with the convoy for more than 12 hours. 'Eventually, the trucks were found but all food and aid supplies were looted,' the U.N. agency said. In a second incident, Israeli soldiers approached a WFP convoy moving out of the Kissufim crossing into central Gaza, fired warning shots, conducted extensive security checks, and temporarily detained drivers and staff, the agency said. 'As the trucks were delayed, four out of the five trucks were lost to violent armed looting,' WFP said. UN chief urges Israel to stop attacks on Syria UNITED NATIONS – The United Nations chief has a message for Israel: Stop the attacks on Syria. Secretary-General António Guterres is particularly concerned about several hundred Israeli airstrikes on several Syrian locations and stresses 'the urgent need to de-escalate violence on all fronts throughout the country,' U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Thursday. The Israeli military said Tuesday it carried out more than 350 strikes in Syria over the previous 48 hours, hitting 'most of the strategic weapons stockpiles' in the country to stop them from falling into the hands of extremists. Israel also acknowledged pushing into a buffer zone inside Syria following last week’s overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The buffer zone was established after Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1973 war. Dujarric said Guterres condemns all actions violating the 1974 ceasefire agreement between the two countries that remains in force. And the U.N. chief calls on the parties to uphold the agreement and end 'all unauthorized presence in the area of separation' and refrain from any action undermining the ceasefire and stability in the Golan Heights, the spokesman said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-13-december-2024-7791d1df688602e790639ed6c2bb0eba	2024-12-12T22:20:52-08:00	
Russia targets Ukrainian infrastructure with a massive attack of cruise missiles and drones	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a massive aerial attack against Ukraine on Friday, firing 93 missiles and almost 200 drones, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, describing it as one of the heaviest bombardments of the country's energy sector since Russia's full-scale invasion almost three years ago. Ukrainian defenses shot down 81 missiles, including 11 cruise missiles that were intercepted by F-16 warplanes provided by Western allies earlier this year, Zelenskyy said. Russia is 'terrorizing millions of people' with such assaults, he said on his Telegram channel, renewing his plea for international unity against Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'A strong reaction from the world is needed: a massive strike – a massive reaction. This is the only way to stop terror,' Zelenskyy said. But uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry said the Russian military used long-range precision missiles and drones on 'critically important fuel and energy facilities in Ukraine that ensure the functioning of the military industrial complex.' The strike was in retaliation for Wednesday’s Ukrainian attack using U.S.-supplied the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, on a Russian air base, it said. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Friday’s attack also targeted transport networks and other key facilities. Ukraine’s biggest private energy company, DTEK, said the attack 'seriously damaged' its thermal power plants. Russia has repeatedly attempted to cripple Ukraine's electricity system in an effort to break the will of civilians left in the dark with no running water or heating and to disrupt Ukrainian defense manufacturing. Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said energy workers were doing everything necessary to 'minimize negative consequences for the energy system,' promising to release more details on damages once the security situation allowed it. Ukraine’s air force reported multiple strike drones launched at Ukraine overnight followed by swarms of cruise missiles in the country’s air space. It said Russia also used air-launched ballistic Kinzhal missiles against Ukraine’s western regions. A similar massive attack on Nov. 28 involved about 200 missiles and drones and left more than a million households without power until emergency teams restored supplies. Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia is stockpiling cruise and ballistic missiles for more attacks. On Nov. 21, Russia for the first time used an intermediate range hypersonic ballistic missile to strike an industrial plant in the city of Dnipro, in eastern Ukraine. Putin described the attack with the Oreshnik missile as retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with longer-range Western weapons. He declared that more attacks with the new weapon could follow, and U.S. officials warned Wednesday that the Oreshnik could be used again in coming days. There was no immediate sign one was launched in Friday's attack. Around half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been destroyed during the war, and rolling electricity blackouts are common and widespread. Kyiv’s Western allies have provided Ukraine with air defense systems to help it protect critical infrastructure, but Russia has sought to overwhelm the air defenses with combined strikes involving large numbers of missiles and drones called 'swarms.' Russia has held the initiative this year as its military has steadily rammed through Ukrainian defenses in the east in a series of slow but steady offensives. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-aerial-attack-december-13-2024-801d7ba2438ea021d8568502f803bb3e	2024-12-12T22:19:59-08:00	
China's military is staying silent on its recent activity around Taiwan	BEIJING (AP) — China's military kept silent Friday on its large deployment of naval and coast guard ships off Taiwan this week, with its top spokesperson quoting an ancient strategist instead. Taiwanese officials have said that China was simulating a blockade with one string of ships off the island and a second one farther out at sea, in waters between Japan's Okinawa islands and the northern Philippines. The Chinese Defense Ministry's first public comment on the activity was essentially a no comment. Wu Qian, the ministry's top spokesperson, included a famous quote from 'The Art of War,' an ancient Chinese text on warfare strategy, in his remarks. The quote says military tactics adapt to changing conditions, just as flowing water does. He then said that the military will decide whether to hold an exercise based on its needs and the situation, and that, either way, the country's People's Liberation Army remains committed to opposing Taiwan's independence and to promoting its 'reunification' with China. Taiwan is a self-governing island of 23 million people off China's east coast. The Chinese government claims Taiwan as its territory and says it must come under its control. The United States is embroiled in the dispute because it supports Taiwan's democratic government and is the main supplier of weapons for its defense. China's silence on its military activity this week contrasted with previous drills around Taiwan, which were reported by state media with dramatic graphics and images and seen as a public show of force directed at the island's government. Taiwanese officials described this week's activity as training, since there was no confirmation from China that it was holding drills. They said they were monitoring the training and viewed it as threatening. Taiwan's government was expecting China to conduct drills in response to a recent visit by Taiwan’s president to Hawaii and Guam, an American territory in the Pacific.	https://apnews.com/article/china-taiwan-military-drills-cbff9900138fcd0262464687745c3cf4	2024-12-12T21:10:23-08:00	
Rolling blackouts plague Iran and some suspect bitcoin mining may have a role in the outages	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran’s capital and outlying provinces have faced rolling power blackouts for weeks in October and November, with electricity cuts disrupting people’s lives and businesses. And while several factors are likely involved, some suspect cryptocurrency mining has played a role in the outages. Iran economy has been hobbled for years by international sanctions over its advancing nuclear program. The country's fuel reserves have plummeted, with the government selling off more to cover budget shortfalls as wars rage in the Middle East and Tehran grapples with mismanagement. The demand on the grid has not let up, however — even as Iranians stopped using air conditioners as the weather cooled in the fall and before winter months set in, when people fire up their gas heaters. Meanwhile, bitcoin's value has rocketed to all-time highs after the U.S. election was clinched by Donald Trump. It hit the $100,000 mark for the first time last week, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The surge has led some to suspect that organized cryptocurrency mining — sucking away huge amounts of power — has played a part in the outages in Iran. 'Unfortunately, some opportunistic and exploitative individuals use subsidized electricity, public networks and other resources for cryptocurrency mining without authorization,' Mostafa Rajabi, the CEO of Iran's government-owned power company, said back in August. Iran’s state energy company did not respond to a request for comment. Power outages have come and gone in the past in Iran, which struggles with aging equipment at many of its plants. Over the summer, sustained blackouts struck industrial parks near Tehran and other cities. Then in October and November, rolling power cuts across Tehran's neighborhoods became the norm in daylight hours. Climate change has been blamed in part, with persisting droughts and less water running through Iranian hydroelectric dams. Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered several power plants to stop burning mazut, a high-polluting heavy fuel common in the former Soviet Union countries. Tehran has used it in the past to make up the difference in electricity generation. Fuel reserves, both in diesel and natural gas, also remain low even though Iran is an OPEC member and home to one of the world's second-largest reserves of natural gas, behind only Russia. There's been no explanation for the decision to keep those reserves low, though critics have suggested Iran likely sold the fuel to cover budget shortfalls. For his part, Pezeshkian has said that he must 'honestly tell the public about the energy situation.' 'We have no choice but to consume energy economically, especially gas, in the current conditions and the cold weather,' he said in mid-November. 'I myself use warm clothes at home; others can do the same.' Still, winter heating isn't in full swing quite yet on Tehran — raising questions where the power is going. In many poor and densely populated neighborhoods across the country, people have access to free, unmetered electricity. Mosques, schools, hospitals and other sites also receive free power. And with electricity in general sold at subsidized rates, bitcoin processing centers have boomed. They require immense amounts of electricity to power specialized computers and to keep them cool. Determining how much power is used up by mining is difficult, particularly as miners now use virtual private networks that mask their location, said Masih Alavi, the CEO of an Iranian-government-licensed mining company called Viraminer. Also, miners have been renting apartments to hide their rigs inside of empty homes. 'They distribute their machines across several apartments to avoid being detected,' Alavi said. In 2021, one estimate suggested Iran processed as much as $1 billion in bitcoin transactions. That value likely has spiked, given bitcoin's rise. Meanwhile, Iran's blackouts began in earnest as bitcoin spiked from around $67,000 to over $100,000 in its historic rally. Rajabi, the state electricity company CEO, said his firm would offer rewards of $725 for people to report unlicensed bitcoin farms. The farms have caused 'an abnormal increase in consumption, disruptions, and problems in power networks,' Rajabi said. The amount of power used by some 230,000 unlicensed devices is equivalent, he said, to the entire power needs of Iran's Markazi province — one of the country's chief manufacturing sites. Iranian officials and media have not linked bitcoin's surge and the ongoing blackouts but the public has, with social media users resharing a video showing a massive bitcoin farm earlier this year uncovered in Iran. A voice off camera asks how it was possible the electrical company did not discover the farm sooner. The U.S. Treasury and Israel have targeted bitcoin wallets that they’ve alleged are affiliated with operations run by Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard to finance allied militant groups in Mideast war zones. That suggests the Guard itself — one of the most-powerful forces within Iran — may be involved in the mining. In contrast, Iranian media nearly every day report on individual mining operations being raided by police. Iran may see bitcoin as a hedge against increased pressure from the incoming Trump administration and as regional allies are engulfed in turmoil, said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'The question for the economists inside Iran is do we trust this enough to fund the government,' said Nephew, who has long worked on Iran issues and sanction strategies in the U.S. government. However, he cautioned against thinking of bitcoin as a magic bullet for Iran, particularly as bitcoin wallets can be targeted in sanctions. 'A pattern of behavior screams out to intelligence services,' Nephew said. 'It screams out to bank compliance departments.' ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Ukraine's reformed military procurement agency drives the country's NATO ambitions	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s Defense Ministry unveiled a new state agency for its armed forces last year. It was the government's answer to the rampant corruption within the ministry's procurement companies, and meant to be a driver of reform on the elusive path toward NATO membership. The enterprise, in charge of purchasing nonlethal military goods such as food, clothes and fuel, has already contracted 95% of the products requested for supply, and saved 25% in the process, says Arsen Zhumadilov, the CEO of the State Logistics Operator, known by the local abbreviation DOT. Soon, he says, DOT also will begin procuring drones. It's an example of the type of reform that Ukraine hopes will help clear the path toward NATO, a key deterrent against Russia, officials have argued. Membership in the alliance remains largely a political question, with key states reluctant to grant it, fearing escalation from Moscow. Western officials are also keenly awaiting the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump before making declarations. But NATO officials have also demanded widespread anti-graft reforms before Kyiv can join. Change has been a difficult pill for many within Ukraine’s post-Soviet institutions to swallow. DOT's promising results so far stand in contrast to the deeply-rooted challenges that continue to plague the tenure of Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, including slow progress with restructuring the institution and ongoing allegations of corruption within lethal military procurement. Western officials are closely monitoring DOT, three Western diplomats told The Associated Press. So far, they have been pleased with the results one year since it was formed. They spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak freely about their assessments. DOT embodies the uneasy coexistence of a digital-savvy youthful ethos and paper-heavy post-Soviet bureaucracy. Its office exudes a fresh startup culture vibe, while catering to one of the most stubbornly rigid ministries in the country. The contrast underscores the spirit of how Russia's war in Ukraine is being fought, in which innovative drone wars coincide with World War II-style trenches. 'We understand that we have been on the radars of NATO, of G7 (Group of Seven) countries, of all NATO member countries in terms of whether we manage or not to put in place a procurement system that is resilient, that is effective, efficient, and that is not prone to corruption,' Zhumadilov said. Nonlethal military purchases became the focus of two corruption scandals under the leadership of Oleksii Reznikov, the previous defense minister. The first involved inflated prices for food supplies and the other was connected to low-quality winter jackets. Umerov, Reznikov’s successor, has described DOT as not just a new agency, but as the beginning of a new public procurement architecture in Ukraine’s defense sector. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy specifically tasked Umerov to increase transparency in defense procurement where corruption has always been rife. Zhumadilov, an influential public figure with Crimean Tatar origins known for spearheading reforms in public procurement, was selected because of his previous track record of success. He previously headed Ukraine's procurement of medical supplies. Plastered on the wall of the agency is a mood board devised by the company's marketing department. A photo of a military vehicle is placed next to a snaking jungle dirt road, a drone in flight next to a fluffy puppy in midair, a Rubik's Cube and a designer candle. Staff wear oversized hoodies and T-shirts, a contrast to the military fatigues adorned by ministry officials. DOT’s answer to increasing transparency is DOT-Chain, an IT system that manages the army’s supply demands by digitizing the entire process, from the submission of applications to issuing invoices. Developed by a team of DOT IT specialists, it could reduce delivery time fourfold and is the largest digital project in the institution. For now it will cover foodstuff, but Zhumadilov envisions scaling it up. There were blips on the road. A planned merger with the Defense Procurement Agency, the state company in charge of purchasing lethal military supplies, was aborted after NATO officials recommended against it, casting Umerov’s decision-making in negative light. Acknowledging that corrupt practices in defense purchases has plagued Ukraine for years, Umerov has said the state needed to eliminate the 'Soviet, oligarchic' approach to public funds. But, like most things in the war, that is easier said than done. Zhumadilov said their company still faces resistance from ministry officials set in their old ways. 'We are trying to be open to our colleagues at Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but at the same time, and this is also good news, we are an autonomous agency within a larger ecosystem, we can preserve our own culture here.' DOT-Chain, which was designed to lower the burden of army paperwork, for instance, still faces pushback from bureaucrats who prefer signing thousands of papers per week to clicking a smartphone. 'They say that we don’t need that. We just want to keep on signing papers,' he said. 'We are saying, ‘Look, the sheer amount of papers that you are signing on a weekly basis … it is just unsustainable.’' ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-nato-reforms-military-procurement-f0483561c9d402697d7a67dd43ae844d	2024-12-12T20:06:37-08:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mixed, follow Wall St decline as price data disappoint	HONG KONG (AP) — World shares were mixed on Friday following Wall Street's decline in response to potentially discouraging data on the economy. The future for the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.3% and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%. European markets opened mixed as investors assessed the European Central Bank’s Thursday rate cut decision. Germany’s DAX added 0.2% to 20,465.58, while the CAC 40 in Paris edged 0.1% lower to 7,416.55. Britain's economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% month-on-month in October, following a 0.1% decline in September, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. The drop was driven by declines in construction and production, while the dominant services sector remained stagnant. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.2% to 8,326.93. In Asia, Chinese leaders wrapped up a two-day economic policy meeting in Beijing on Thursday. Investors were hoping for major moves to support the economy, but the readouts from the closed-door meetings of top leaders lacked details. State media reported that leaders agreed to increase government borrowing to finance more spending and to ease credit to encourage more investment and spending. 'Chinese authorities have been stuck in a more reactionary policy mode, as the uncertainty of U.S. tariff plans makes it difficult for policymakers to make any commitments just yet,' Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a commentary. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong sank 2.1% to 19,971.24, and the Hang Seng Properties index lost 2.7%. The Shanghai Composite index skidded 2% to 3,391.88. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 1% to 39,470.44. A survey by the Bank of Japan showed that business sentiment among large Japanese manufacturers was stronger than expected in the fourth quarter of this year, though overall the results were lackluster. Elsewhere, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed 0.4% to 8,296.00. South Korea’s Kospi added 0.5% to 2,494.46. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.5% to 6,051.25, marking its fourth loss in the last six days. The index had been rallying toward one of its best years of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5% to 43,914.12, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.7% to 19,902.84. A report said more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected. A separate update, meanwhile, showed that inflation at the wholesale level, before it reaches U.S. consumers, was hotter last month than economists expected. Neither report rings warning bells, but they did dilute hopes that the Federal Reserve will keep cutting interest rates. That expectation has driven the S&amp;P 500 to 57 all-time highs so far this year, driven by the fact that inflation has been slowing while the economy is solid enough to stay out of a recession. Traders are widely expecting the Fed will ease its main interest rate at its meeting next week. That would be a third straight cut by the Fed after it began lowering rates in September from a two-decade high. It’s hoping to support a slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower rates would give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, but they could also provide more fuel for inflation. A cut next week would have the Fed following other central banks. The European Central Bank cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday, as many investors expected, and the Swiss National Bank cut its policy rate by a steeper half of a percentage point. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 14 cents to $70.16 per barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gained 12 cent to $73.53 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 153.25 Japanese yen from 152.55 yen. The euro fell to $1.0472 from $1.0468.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-inflation-rates-44ade1d46d9dc7ed714934238e810f65	2024-12-12T19:51:12-08:00	
Environmental groups condemn new laws threatening soybean restrictions in Brazil's Amazon	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Dozens of environmental nonprofits issued a manifesto Thursday condemning new laws in Brazilian states that threaten to dismantle the Amazon soy moratorium — a landmark voluntary agreement banning trade in soybeans from recently deforested areas. The 18-year-old moratorium stipulates that traders and oil producers refrain from buying soybeans grown on land cleared after 2008. The deal gathered strange bedfellows, ranging from environmental groups Greenpeace and WWF to U.S. commodity giants Cargill, Bunge and ADM. However, new laws recently enacted in the Amazon states of Mato Grosso, Brazil’s largest soybean producer, and neighboring Rondonia have cut tax incentives for processing and trade companies that adhere to the agreement. Two other states and Brazil´s Congress are weighing similar legislation. 'This means penalizing companies committed to ending deforestation, promoting the continued expansion of agribusiness in Amazon forest areas, creating subsidies for deforestation and discriminating against the granting of tax incentives based on companies’ environmental commitment,' Thursday's declaration stated. 'Therefore, those who are more ambitious in environmental protection lose the incentive,' said the manifesto whose 67 signers include Greenpeace, WWF and Climate Observatory, a network of 119 organizations watching federal climate policy in Brazil. The document argues soybean production grew exponentially in the Amazon under the moratorium as it expanded into pasture land. Its area jumped from 1.6 million hectares (4 million acres) in 2007 to 7.28 million hectares (18 million acres) in 2022, according to a moratorium report. The manifesto also calls for the companies that operate in Mato Grosso and Rondonia to maintain their commitment to the agreement even though it means losing millions of dollars in tax incentives — a tough decision for small and middle-sized companies. Researchers have found the moratorium is helping to preserve the Amazon forest. A 2020 study in the journal Nature Food found that the agreement, in combination with public policies, contributed to the steepest reduction of deforestation recorded in Brazil, between 2003 and 2016 In a written response, the government of Mato Grosso said it enacted the law because the moratorium is harsher than Brazil´s legislation, which already has 'the world’s strictest environmental regulations.' It also stated that most of the state is covered by original rainforest trees and plants. 'We challenge these nonprofits to name any state, in any country, that is a major food producer and preserves 60% of its territory,' the statement said. —- The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The last Titanic salvage expedition was in 2010. Will there be any more?	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — The company that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic said Thursday that it hasn't settled on plans to retrieve more artifacts from the shipwreck, potentially cooling down a legal battle with the U.S. government. The Georgia-based company, RMS Titanic Inc., wrote in a court filing that it won't visit the wreck in 2025 and is still considering the legal and financial implications of future salvage operations. The court-recognized steward of Titanic artifacts since 1994, RMST has recovered thousands of items from silverware to a piece of the ship’s hull, which millions of people have seen through exhibits. The U.S. has been warning RMST for years that entering the Titanic’s severed hull — or disturbing the wreck — would violate a 2017 federal law and a corresponding agreement with Great Britain. Both regard the site as a memorial to the more than 1,500 people who died when the ocean liner struck a North Atlantic iceberg in 1912. The firm's last salvage expedition was in 2010, before the law and agreement took effect. But in recent years, RMST has submitted plans before a federal admiralty court in Virginia to recover more artifacts, drawing the ire of the U.S. government. RMST has previously challenged the constitutionality of U.S. efforts to 'infringe' on its salvage rights to a shipwreck in international waters. And it has argued that only the admiralty court has jurisdiction over the matter. The recent legal disputes between RMST and the U.S. government have played out as the world's most famous shipwreck rapidly deteriorates on the ocean floor — and as tragedy unfolded. Last year's implosion of the Titan submersible claimed five lives, including RMST’s director of underwater research, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, RMST's stated its position regarding future expeditions on Thursday at the admiralty court's direction. A federal judge has been considering a legal challenge by the U.S. to restrict RMST's activities at the site. The U.S. filed its challenge last year when RMST initially planned to take images inside the sunken ship's hull and pluck items from the surrounding debris field. RMST also said it would possibly recover freestanding objects from the room where the Titanic broadcast its distress calls. The company ultimately scaled back its dive plans, stating that it would only take external images. That was because of Nargeolet's death in the Titan implosion. The experimental craft was operated by a separate company, OceanGate, to which Nargeolet was lending his expertise. Nargeolet was supposed to lead the RMST expedition. After RMST revised its dive plans, the U.S. stopped trying to block that particular expedition, which occurred over the summer. But the U.S. told the court it wanted to leave the door open to challenging subsequent expeditions. Specifically, the government said it may still pursue its motion to intervene as a party in RMST’s salvage case. The U.S. asked the court to delay ruling on the motion until the company announced future salvage plans. The firm said Thursday that it needs more time to make a decision on any upcoming operations. RMST also said it opposes the U.S.'s motion to intervene. U. S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith presides over Titanic salvage matters at the federal court in Norfolk, Virginia. She said during a March hearing that the U.S.’s case against RMST would raise serious legal questions. Congress is allowed to modify maritime law, Smith said in reference to regulating entry into the Titanic. But the judge questioned whether Congress can strip courts of their own admiralty jurisdiction over a shipwreck, something that has centuries of legal precedent. In 2020, Smithgave RMST permission to retrieve and exhibit the radio that had broadcast the Titanic’s distress calls. The U.S. government challenged the expedition in court. The legal battle never played out. RMST indefinitely delayed those plans because of the coronavirus pandemic.	https://apnews.com/article/titanic-salvage-expedition-rms-legal-battle-ea56ab68995738d82184f4be41ac2a95	2024-12-12T13:25:38-08:00	
Syria faces crisis and Gaza heads toward famine, World Food Program official says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The deputy executive director of the U.N. World Food Program has been on whirlwind visits to hotspots in the Middle East and Sudan to assess dire humanitarian situations and escalating demands for food from millions of people trapped or fleeing conflicts. But Carl Skau said in an interview with The Associated Press this week that the Rome-based agency has been forced to make major cuts to the numbers of people it can help because of a lack of funding. WFP is working to diversify its funding, including targeting the private sector, but Skau said, 'it’s going to be a tough time ahead, no doubt, with increasing gaps.' 'Needs continue to rise, and the funding does not even remain stable at the levels we have currently,' he said. ‘A triple crisis’ in Syria Syria is facing the fallout from a 13-year civil war, the surge in arrivals from the recent Israel-Hezbollah war in neighboring Lebanon, and rebels unexpectedly ousting longtime leader Bashar Assad, Skau said. Even before Lebanon and the end of the Assad family’s more than 50-year rule, he said 3 million people were acutely food insecure and very hungry. But the agency was only providing food aid to 2 million because of funding cuts. Now, Skau said, 'it’s a triple crisis, and the needs are going to be massive.' While the situation in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, is 'quite calm and orderly,' he said there is still uncertainty in the capital, Damascus, where markets are disrupted, currency values have dropped, food prices are going up and transport isn’t working. This means a bigger humanitarian response in the short term. In the next phase, the U.N. will be focusing on Syria’s recovery and ultimately its reconstruction, Skau said. Gaza is heading toward famine Skau says the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza is dire but he’s equally worried about southern Gaza, 'if not even more,' because of the million or so people on the beach north of Khan Younis as winter approaches. In northern areas, where the U.N. estimates there are still 65,000 Palestinians and no aid has arrived for more than two months, Skau said Israeli military operations, lawlessness and taking of food aid have prevented access to the needy. He said some humanitarian convoys have gotten through to the broader northern area including Gaza City, where the U.N. estimates some 300,000 people are located. In the south, Skau said, WFP assisted around 1.2 million people in June, July, August and into September. In October and November, only one-third of that number — 400,000 Palestinians — got aid. At the same time, the entry of essential commercial goods was very little compared with the summer months, Skau said. He blamed the limited number of entry points and the inability to move food to WFP warehouses as well as the 'total breakdown of civil and public order.' Skau said international famine experts reported three weeks ago that if nothing changed there would be famine in Gaza, 'and I think that’s where we’re heading.' Sudan is the world’s largest humanitarian crisis The needs are overwhelming: 25 million people in war-torn Sudan are acutely food insecure, with famine declared in the huge Zam Zam camp for the displaced in western Darfur. Skau cited progress over the past month in getting clearances to deliver aid across conflict lines and the border from Chad. And with roads drying up at the end of the rainy season, WFP is able to deliver 'much more food.' One convoy reached Zam Zam camp and two others were on the way but have been held up because of fighting in the past 10 days in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, Skau said. It is the only capital in Darfur still held by Sudanese forces. The others are held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including western Darfur. WFP reached some 2.6 million people this month, Skau said, stressing that the international community should have done more to address the Sudan crisis 'and needs to do more going forward.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-gaza-world-food-program-06f429a71dee5f11779d8cce94e810fb	2024-12-12T13:14:37-08:00	
China's Xi is likely to decline Trump's inauguration invitation, seeing it as too risky to attend	WASHINGTON (AP) — Chinese leader Xi Jinping would likely see President-elect Donald Trump’s invitation to attend his inauguration as too risky to accept, and the gesture from Trump may have little bearing on the increasingly competitive ties between the two nations as the White House changes hands, experts say. Trump’s incoming press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed on Thursday that Trump extended an invitation to the Jan. 20 ceremony. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said it had no information to provide. But experts don't see Xi coming to Washington next month. Why wouldn't Xi attend? 'Can you imagine Xi Jinping sitting outdoors in Washington, D.C., in January at the feet of the podium, surrounded by hawkish members of Congress, gazing up at Donald Trump as he delivers his inaugural address?' said Danny Russel, who previously served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Russel, now vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Xi would not allow himself to 'be reduced to the status of a mere guest celebrating the triumph of a foreign leader — the U.S. president, no less.' Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank, said Beijing will play it safe when there's no protocol or precedent for a Chinese leader to attend the inauguration of a U.S. president. 'I don't think the Chinese will take the risk,' Sun said. There could be risks in the guest list, for example, Sun said, noting that Taiwan's top diplomat in the U.S. attended the swearing-in of President Joe Biden in 2021. Beijing considers Taiwan to be Chinese territory and has repeatedly warned the U.S. that it is a red line not to be crossed. Should Trump slap tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods upon taking office as he's threatened, Xi would look like a fool if he had chosen to attend, and that's unacceptable to Beijing, Sun said. Rather, Chinese officials are known for their obsession with the dignity and security of their leader when traveling abroad, said Russel, who has negotiated high-level summits with the Chinese. 'They have always demanded that any leader trip to Washington be treated as a full ‘state visit’ with all the bells and whistles,' Russel said. What's ahead for U.S.-China relations? But it should be expected that planning is underway for Trump and Xi to meet in person soon, Russel said. Trump prefers in-person meetings with foreign leaders, especially key adversaries, and Beijing might believe it can get a better deal by dealing directly with Trump, Russel said. Trump's return to the White House is expected to further intensify the U.S.-China rivalry. He has picked several China hawks for his Cabinet, including Sen. Marco Rubio as the secretary of state and Rep. Mike Waltz as the national security adviser. Beijing has adopted a 'wait-and-see' approach but says it is prepared to hit back should Washington raise tariffs on Chinese goods or make other unfriendly moves. Sun of the Stimson Center cautions that Trump's invitation does not exclude hostile policies toward China. Trump visited China in 2017 and 'played nice,' but the following year he launched the trade war, she said. 'We've seen this before,' Sun said. 'For Trump, there's no contradiction between carrot and stick. For China, that's a contradiction. It will add to China's desire to play safe, not to be played by Trump, whether it is a friendly or a hostile message.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-xi-china-inauguration-invitation-a0fbde24ca2ccafa9a953813955d532f	2024-12-12T12:27:12-08:00	
An Argentine tourist is shot in head in Rio after mistakenly driving into low-income community	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — An Argentine tourist was shot in the head and chest Thursday in Rio de Janeiro after he mistakenly drove his car into a low-income community, police said. He was reportedly using a GPS device to make his way to the Christ the Redeemer statue. Gastón Fernando Burlon, 51, was taken to Hospital Souza Aguiar, where he is in serious condition, according to Rio's health secretariat. Burlon is a former tourism secretary for the Argentine city of Bariloche and is the president of the Argentine Chamber of Student Tourism. Burlon was driving with his wife and daughter through the Morro dos Prazeres, a hillside favela dominated by criminal gang Red Command, when he was attacked, police said in a statement. 'Preliminary information given by officers in the case suggest that the wounded man was surprised by gunshots made by armed criminals as he mistakenly entered,' police said. In 2016, Italian tourist Roberto Bardella was killed in the same region after he got lost. He and his friend Rino Polato, who was found unharmed, were touring South America on motorcycle. An Argentine tourism ministry official told the Associated Press the country's government is following the case and has sent a staffer to provide assistance to Burlon and his family. The source said the medical team is trying to stabilize Burlon so he can undergo surgery. The source spoke under condition of anonymity due to a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly. ____ AP journalist Nayara Batschke contributed to this report from Buenos Aires. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentinian-tourist-shot-rio-de-janeiro-6b4a2ecd869d36444a2901b152674881	2024-12-12T12:24:35-08:00	
Protesters hold a noisy demonstration against Serbia's populist leadership	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Hundreds of protesters led by university students on Thursday held a noisy rally outside Serbia's state television headquarters despite the country's president pledging to fulfil all their demands as he faced one of the most challenging threats to his populist rule. The demonstration is part of wider protests that erupted after the fall of a concrete canopy in the northern city of Novi Sad last month, killing 15 people. Blowing whistles, booing and jeering, the protesters said they are angry the state RTS television is carrying President Aleksandar Vucic's accusations that the students were paid from the West and elsewhere to hold protests to overthrow his government. The protesters brought sacks allegedly holding bundles of money in front of the downtown RTS station in the country's capital, Belgrade. The station has been accused of spreading the nationalist pro-government narrative for years. Classes at more than 40 university faculties throughout Serbia have been suspended for days. Many in Serbia blame the deadly collapse on rampant corruption in the country that led to sloppy renovation work on the station building in Novi Sad — part of a wider deal with Chinese state companies involved in a number of infrastructure projects in the Balkan country. The canopy collapse has became a flashpoint for broader dissatisfaction with the president's growingly autocratic rule, reflecting public demands for democratic changes. Almost daily protests have been held since Nov. 1 in Novi Sad, Belgrade and other cities, which sometimes turned violent. Vucic announced at a news conference on Wednesday evening that documentation regarding the renovation of the Novi Sad railway building would be made public, as students have requested. Prosecutors have launched an investigation and detained 13 people. But a government minister has been released, fueling widespread speculation over the probe as ruling populists also control both police and the judiciary. As Vucic spoke on Wednesday, hundreds of students also blew whistles and horns outside the presidency building, which could be heard in the live coverage of the address. The students on Thursday said they also want the thugs who attacked peaceful protesters arrested. 'We came to give back the money,' one of the students told the crowd as they symbolically left improvised money bags outside the television building. 'You can hand them (bags) to the president and tell him that we want a public apology.'	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-protest-roof-collapse-students-d5fefbb6efdefc5ecc76ce4fdb34dfbb	2024-12-12T11:38:07-08:00	
Israeli strike in Gaza kills 25 people as US makes new push for a ceasefire	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli airstrike hit the central Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing at least 25 Palestinians and wounding dozens more, Palestinian medics said, as U.S. President Joe Biden’s two top national security officials were in the region making a renewed push for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire. The strike on a multistory residential building in the Nuseirat refugee camp was just the latest in a series of Israeli attacks throughout Gaza that killed at least 54 Palestinians since late Wednesday night. Palestinian officials at two of Gaza's remaining medical centers, Al-Awda Hospital in the north and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the center, reported together receiving 25 bodies from the Nuseirat strike — which also wounded 40 people, most of them children. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the deadly strike. Israel is trying to eliminate Hamas, which led the attack on southern Israel in October 2023 that sparked the war in Gaza. The Israeli military says Hamas militants hide among Gaza’s civilian population. The U.N. General Assembly's member nations approved a new resolution this week demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, although they do reflect world opinion — the vote Wednesday was 158-9, with 13 abstentions. Israel strikes all across Gaza Photos from the scene in Nuseirat sent to journalists showed a completely collapsed building with people walking through its mangled and charred remains, smoke rising from piles of belongings strewn over the rubble. Palestinian rescuers were searching for more bodies trapped beneath the rubble. The strikes Thursday evening came as Palestinian medics were still surveying the morning’s deadly toll of fierce Israeli attacks, including on Nuseirat camp. Palestinian medical officials had reported at least 28 people killed earlier in the day, including seven children and a woman. One of the strikes flatted a house in Nuseirat, according to Al-Aqsa Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the bodies were taken. Two other strikes killed 15 men who were part of local aid coordination committees set up by displaced Palestinians and the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, according to health officials at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. Eight of the men were killed in an attack near the southern border town of Rafah and the remaining seven were killed by a strike in Khan Younis. The committees aim to establish secure aid convoys, which often face challenges such as looting, hoarding and profiteering in their efforts to deliver humanitarian supplies to Palestinians facing the risk of famine. Israel says it allows enough aid to enter and blames U.N. agencies for not distributing it. The U.N. says Israeli restrictions, and the breakdown of law and order after Israel repeatedly targeted the Hamas-run police force, make it extremely difficult to operate in the territory. In Gaza's isolated and devastated north, Awda Hospital said an orthopedic doctor, Saeed Jouda, was shot in the head and killed Thursday morning. The Health Ministry said the doctor was killed by an armed quadcopter drone as he was traveling from Kamal Adwan Hospital to treat patients at Awda Hospital. The two medical facilities are in northern towns where Israel has waged a blistering offensive against Hamas militants since early October, allowing in almost no humanitarian aid and ordering tens of thousands to flee to nearby Gaza City. Experts have warned that the north may be experiencing famine. Biden administration makes final push for a Gaza ceasefire The latest bombardment came as Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, was holding official meetings in Israel as signs emerge that long-stalled negotiations between Israel and Hamas could regain momentum. On Thursday, Sullivan revived hopes for a deal, telling reporters in Jerusalem that Israel’s ceasefire in Lebanon has helped clear the way for another deal to end the war in Gaza. Sullivan plans to travel next to Qatar and Egypt, key mediators in the ceasefire talks, as the Biden administration makes a final push on negotiations before Donald Trump is inaugurated. Sullivan said 'Hamas’ posture at the negotiating table did adapt' after Israel decimated the leadership of its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon and reached a ceasefire there. 'We believe it puts us in a position to close this negotiation,' he said. Last month, the U.S. vetoes a Security Council resolution demanding an immediate Gaza ceasefire, objecting that the resolution did not link the truce to an immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas. The council’s 14 other members supported the resolution. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,800 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in the war in Gaza. The International Criminal Court found there were reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu and his former defense minister bear responsibility for the war crime of starvation and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. ___ Associated Press writers Samy Magdy in Cairo and Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report. ____ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-12-12-2024-a39e98286d8d270b6e81608a3d17fa4a	2024-12-12T11:18:17-08:00	
North Korean nationals indicted in scheme using IT workers to funnel money for weapons programs	ST. LOUIS (AP) — Fourteen North Korean nationals have been indicted in a scheme using information technology workers with false identities to contract with U.S. companies — workers who then funneled their wages to North Korea for development of ballistic missiles and other weapons, the head of the FBI office in St. Louis said Thursday. The scheme involving thousands of IT workers generated more than $88 million for the North Korean government, Ashley T. Johnson, special agent in charge of the St. Louis FBI office, said at a news conference. In addition to their wages, the workers stole sensitive information from companies or threatened to leak information in exchange for extortion payments, Johnson said. Victims included defrauded companies and people whose identities were stolen from across the U.S., including Missouri, Johnson said. The indictments were filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in St. Louis. All 14 people face wire fraud, money laundering, identity theft and other charges. Most of those accused are believed to be in North Korea. Johnson acknowledged that bringing them to justice will be difficult. To help, the U.S. Department of State is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to any of the suspects. Federal authorities said the scheme worked like this: North Korea dispatched thousands of IT workers to get hired and work remotely or as freelancers for U.S. companies. The IT workers involved in the scheme sometimes used stolen identities. In other instances, they paid Americans to use their home Wi-Fi connections, or to pose in on-camera job interviews as the IT workers. Johnson said the FBI is going after those 'domestic enablers,' too. 'This is just the tip of the iceberg,' Johnson said. 'If your company has hired fully remote IT workers, more likely than not, you have hired or at least interviewed a North Korean national working on behalf of the North Korean government,' Johnson said. The Justice Department in recent years has sought to expose and disrupt a broad variety of criminal schemes aimed at bolstering the North Korean regime, including its nuclear weapons program. In 2021, the Justice Department charged three North Korean computer programmers and members of the government’s military intelligence agency in a broad range of global hacks that officials say were carried out at the behest of the regime. Law enforcement officials said at the time that the prosecution highlighted the profit-driven motive behind North Korea’s criminal hacking, a contrast from other adversarial nations like Russia, China and Iran that are generally more interested in espionage, intellectual property theft or even disrupting democracy. In May 2022, the State Department, Department of the Treasury, and the FBI issued an advisory warning of attempts by North Koreans 'to obtain employment while posing as non-North Korean nationals.' The advisory noted that in recent years, the regime of Kim Jong Un 'has placed increased focus on education and training' in IT-related subjects. In October 2023, the FBI in St. Louis announced the seizure of $1.5 million and 17 domain names as part of the investigation. The indictments announced Tuesday were the first stemming from the investigation. Johnson urged companies to thoroughly vet IT workers hired to work remotely. 'One of the ways to help minimize your risk is to insist current and future IT workers appear on camera as often as possible if they are fully remote,' she said. Officials didn’t name the companies that unknowingly hired North Korean workers.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-it-workers-indictments-7beb2f611489da09fe36ee14736b28b9	2024-12-12T11:09:58-08:00	
Chanel appoints designer Matthieu Blazy as new artistic director	PARIS (AP) — One of the most prestigious roles in global fashion has just been filled, as Chanel appointed Franco-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy as its new artistic director, the fashion house announced Thursday. The 40-year-old will oversee all collections for the world's second biggest luxury brand starting in 2025, replacing Virginie Viard, who parted ways with the house earlier this year. Blazy arrives with a reputation for innovation and craftsmanship, honed through stints at Raf Simons, Maison Margiela and Céline under Phoebe Philo. Most recently, he was creative director at Bottega Veneta. Chanel President Bruno Pavlovsky praised his 'audacious' and 'powerful' approach, adding that Blazy would 'play with the codes and heritage of the House' to take it in 'exciting new directions.' 'I am thrilled and honored,' said Blazy. Critics have noted that Blazy’s relatively young age suggests Chanel may be positioning him for a long tenure, akin to the 36 years Karl Lagerfeld spent at the helm. His appointment marks only the fourth designer in Chanel’s over 100-year history to lead the house, following Lagerfeld, Viard, and founder Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel. Viard, who succeeded Lagerfeld after his death in 2019, left earlier this year after more than three decades with the brand — an abrupt departure, announced in the middle of the night just weeks before the couture show. For a house known for meticulous image execution, the announcement felt unusually unpolished. Later, it was revealed that Viard would not oversee her final couture presentation, with her team stepping in to handle the collection. During her tenure, Viard achieved record sales for Chanel, reaching $19.7 billion last year. But her time was not without controversy. Critics often cited her collections as lacking the theatrical flair of Lagerfeld’s era, and backlash to a poorly received mid-season show in Marseille added pressure.

Greece launches emergency inquiry into the alleged assault of an Egyptian minor at a migrant camp	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — A prosecutor from Greece’s Supreme Court on Thursday launched an emergency inquiry into the alleged beating and sexual assault of a 16-year-old Egyptian boy at a migrant camp outside Athens. Four other Egyptians housed at the facility aged 16, 17, 18 and 21 have been arrested in connection with the alleged assault at the state-run refugee facility in Malakasa, west of the Greek capital, police said. The four male suspects were detained on charges of sexual assault and causing grievous bodily harm, according to authorities. Greek Migration Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos, described the incident as 'deeply abhorrent,' while his deputy, Sofia Voultepsi, announced an investigation into security procedures at the camp’s area for unaccompanied minors. Voultepsi said the number of unaccompanied minors from Egypt in Greece was rising due to the activity of criminal gangs active in neighboring Libya. Under Greek regulations, unaccompanied minors who arrive in the country illegally are not subject to deportation. 'Out of the total of 2,588 unaccompanied minors currently (registered) in the country, 1,341 — so more than half — are Egyptian,' Voultepsi told private Skai television. 'These children are taken from impoverished villages in Egypt,' she said. 'Criminals take them to Tobruk in Libya. According to testimonies we have, they are often beaten and mistreated in camps there and with the intention of involving them in criminal activity.'	https://apnews.com/article/greece-migrants-migration-assault-egypt-libya-43619869409ed8dd911550398721d566	2024-12-12T08:33:46-08:00	
Zimbabwe's president once faced the death penalty and is now set to abolish it	HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Zimbabwe’s Senate has approved a bill to abolish the death penalty, a key step in scrapping a law last used in the southern African nation nearly 20 years ago. Zimbabwe's Parliament said Thursday that the bill was passed by senators the night before. The death penalty will be abolished if it is signed by the president, which is likely. The southern African country uses hanging, and last executed someone in 2005, partly because at one point no one was willing to take up the job of state executioner, or hangman. President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe's leader since 2017, has publicly spoken of his opposition to capital punishment. He has cited his own experience of being sentenced to death — which was later changed to 10 years in prison — for blowing up a train during the country's war of independence in the 1960s. He has used presidential amnesties to commute death sentences to life in prison. Amnesty International, which campaigns against the death penalty, urged Mnangagwa to sign the bill into law 'without delay' and commute death sentences. Zimbabwe has more than 60 prisoners currently on death row. According to Amnesty, about three-quarters of countries in the world no longer carry out the death penalty. Zimbabwe is one of more than a dozen in Africa and more than 50 across the world that have the death penalty enshrined in law without any official moratorium on it. Amnesty International said it recorded 1,153 known executions globally in 2023, up from 883 the previous year, although countries that carried out executions declined from 20 to 16. Due to a veil of secrecy, the figures do not include those from North Korea, Vietnam and China. China is the 'world’s lead executioner' where thousands of people are believed to have been executed, Amnesty said in a report released in October. Iran and Saudi Arabia accounted for almost 90% of all executions recorded by Amnesty in 2023. The United States recorded an increase from 18 executions in 2022 to 24 in 2023. Last year, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and the U.S. recorded the most executions, in that order. Zimbabwe is among four African countries alongside Kenya, Liberia and Ghana that have recently taken 'positive steps' towards abolishing the death penalty, Amnesty said. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/death-penalty-abolition-law-parliament-175391cdbbf7456247e27f09105a8ae7	2024-12-12T07:58:47-08:00	
Wander Franco's sex abuse trial has been postponed 5 months	PUERTO PLATA, Dominican Republic (AP) — The trial against Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco, who has been charged with sexually abusing a minor, sexual and commercial exploitation against a minor, and human trafficking, was postponed on Thursday and scheduled to resume June 2, 2025. Dominican judge Yacaira Veras postponed the hearing at the request of prosecutors because of the absence of several key witnesses in the case. Franco’s lawyers asked the court to reconsider the postponement, arguing Franco must report to spring training in mid-February. The judge replied that Franco is obligated to continue with the trial schedule, continue his conditional release from detainment and not leave the country. Documents that prosecutors presented to the judge in July and were viewed by The Associated Press alleged that Franco, through his mother Yudelka Aybar, transferred 1 million pesos (about $17,000) to the mother of the minor on Jan. 5, 2023, to consent to the abuse. The mother of the minor has been charged with money laundering and is under house arrest. Prosecutors say the minor’s mother went from being a bank employee to leading an ostentatious life and acquiring assets using the funds she received from Franco. During raids on the house of the minor’s mother, prosecutors say they found $68,500 and $35,000 that they allege was delivered by Franco. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/wander-franco-trial-mlb-rays-2cba7436c3dee91ecebea60773942abf	2024-12-12T07:50:55-08:00	
Paraguay reopens its embassy in Jerusalem, handing Israel a rare diplomatic victory	JERUSALEM (AP) — The small South American nation of Paraguay reopened its embassy in Jerusalem on Thursday, becoming the latest of just a small handful of countries to recognize the bitterly contested city as Israel’s capital. The move marks a welcome diplomatic victory for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has watched Israel’s international isolation deepen as the devastating war in Gaza drags on. Paraguay first relocated its embassy to Jerusalem in 2018 under the pro-Israel government of then-President Horacio Cartes but reversed its decision months later when a new administration came to power. The decision of President Santiago Peña, a protégé of Cartes who has followed in his mentor's footsteps, to reopen the Jerusalem embassy makes Paraguay the first country to make the move since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack last year triggered the war. The fate of Jerusalem is one of the most intractable disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It’s also a controversial move. Israel views the entire city as its unified capital, while the Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Israel annexed east Jerusalem, home to the Old City, with holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in 1967 in a move that was not recognized by the international community. Most countries run their embassies out of Tel Aviv. Paraguay now joins the United States, Honduras, Guatemala, Kosovo and Papua New Guinea as countries that have stationed their embassy in Jerusalem. Spirits were high at the ceremony marking the embassy’s inauguration Thursday, with Netanyahu and Israel’s new Foreign Minister, Gideon Saar, lavishing praise on President Peña. 'My good friend Santiago,' said Netanyahu, addressing Peña. 'We’re a small nation. You’re a small nation. We suffered horrible things but we overcame the odds of history…we can win and we are winning.' 'Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. It will always be the capital of Israel,' Netanyahu said. 'That will never change.' The ceremony came as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has brought a wave of condemnation on Israel, undermining its international standing. The world’s top war-crimes court issued arrest warrants last month for Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza. The Israeli offensive has so far killed over 44,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry which does not say how many are combatants. The warrants turn Netanyahu and Gallant into internationally wanted suspects, putting them at risk of arrest when they travel abroad. Nevertheless, Peña invited Netanyahu to visit Paraguay. Netanyahu hung a Jewish mezuzah, a small scroll containing verses from the Torah, on the doorway of the new Paraguayan embassy. Israel's top diplomat, Saar, said Israel and Paraguay shared a 'friendship based not only on interests but also values and principles.' He said he would soon visit Asunción, Paraguay's capital, with a delegation from the Israeli private sector. He and Paraguayan Foreign Minister Rubén Ramírez Lezcano signed a series of bilateral agreements at the ceremony. Peña thanked Netanyahu and said he looked forward to future collaboration with Israel. 'This is very important for you. We recognize that this is a very strong statement,' Peña said. 'Israel is going to win, and the countries (that) are standing next to Israel, we are going to win.' Despite a tiny Jewish community, far smaller than neighbors Argentina and Brazil, landlocked Paraguay has become one of Israel’s closest allies in Latin America. The other countries in the region to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Guatemala and Honduras, have similarly strong evangelical churches. Evangelicals, many of whom see Israel’s existence connected to biblical prophecy, are among the Israeli government's most hawkish supporters. In the U.S., conservative evangelicals have long inspired the Republican Party’s pro-Israel advocacy. Paraguay's conservative leadership has sought to curry favor with former and future U.S. President Donald Trump by strengthening its alliance with Israel as well as Taiwan — two causes célèbres of Republicans. Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ramírez Lezcano was among the first foreign dignitaries to meet with Trump following his November election victory. Earlier this year, Peña hosted Sen. Marco Rubio — Trump’s pick to become Secretary of State — in what marked the first visit by a U.S. senator to the landlocked country in four decades. The ascension of Peña to the presidency in 2023 helped revive Paraguay's strong ties with Israel years after his predecessor, Mario Abdo Benitez, shuttered Paraguay's Jerusalem embassy and prompted Israel to retaliate by temporarily closing its own in Asunción. Under former President Cartes, a powerful cigarette tycoon sanctioned by the Biden administration for corruption, Paraguay immediately followed Trump's move to relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and break with decades of policy that the city's status should be decided in peace talks. ___ Associated Press writers Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Josh Goodman in Miami contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-paraguay-embassy-jerusalem-capital-pena-netanyahu-ec4249a657d841a1e4ccd3e3b6edd574	2024-12-12T07:39:39-08:00	
Ontario to restrict electricity exports to US and bar American-made alcohol if Trump tariffs applied	TORONTO (AP) — Canada’s most populous province may bar American-made alcohol in addition to restricting electricity exports to Michigan, New York State and Minnesota if President-elect Donald Trump imposes sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products, a senior official said Thursday. The official in Ontario Premier Doug Ford's government said it is contemplating restricting Ontario's liquor control board — the largest alcohol purchaser in the world and the main retailer in the province — from buying American-made alcohol. Ontario is also considering restricting exports of critical minerals required for electric vehicle batteries and preventing U.S.-based companies from the government's procurement process, the official said, speaking on condition on anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the potential measures. Ford confirmed on Wednesday evening that Ontario is contemplating restricting electricity exports to Michigan, New York State and Minnesota. He reiterated that on Thursday and said it would make electricity unaffordable for Americans. 'It’s a last resort,' Ford said. 'I don’t think President-elect Trump wants that to happen. We're sending a message to the U.S. If you come and attack Ontario, you attack livelihoods of people in Ontario and Canadians, we are going to use every tool in our tool box to defend Ontarians and Canadians. Let's hope it never comes to that.' Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the United States from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. Ontario powered 1.5 million homes in the U.S. in 2023 and is a major exporter of electricity to Michigan, Minnesota and New York. 'That's okay if he that does that. That's fine,' Trump told CNBC when asked about Ford's remarks on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 'The United States is subsidizing Canada and we shouldn't have to do that,' Trump added. 'And we have a great relationship. I have so many friends in Canada but we shouldn't have to subsidize a country. We're subsidizing more than a $100 billion dollars a year. We shouldn't have to be doing that.' The CNBC reporter said off camera Trump told him they hope they can work something out with Canada. Canada supplies more oil to the U.S. than any other country. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. 'If you put a 25% tariff on oil from Alberta that increases every gallon of gasoline by one dollar,' said Ford, who is chairman of a council of premiers for Canada’s 10 provinces and three territories. Canada sold $170 billion worth of energy products last year to the U.S. It also has 34 critical minerals and metals the Pentagon is eager for. Ontario's Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said after Wednesday's meeting with the premiers that a number of provincial premiers voiced support for a robust response to the tariffs, including critical minerals being exported to the U.S. Freeland did not mention oil but said 'obviously other ideas were discussed as well' when asked if Canada is considering cutting off oil exports to America. About a third of Canada’s trade to the U.S. is energy. Nearly 3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Canada has promised more border security spending to address Trump’s border concerns. Ford said that will include more border and police officers, as well as drones and sniffer dogs. Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, who along with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago recently, said they plan to share details of those border plans with the incoming Trump administration in the coming days. At the dinner, Kristen Hillman, Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., said America’s trade deficit with Canada was also raised. Hillman said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. is energy exports and prices have been high. Trudeau said this week that U.S.-imposed tariffs would be 'absolutely devastating' for the Canadian economy, but it would also mean real hardship for Americans. Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for goods such as food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and others. The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington-based trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate. Canada imposed duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canadian officials have said it is unfair to lump Canada in with Mexico. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. The U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with irregular migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024, compared to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-us-trump-tariffs-c5d740bed83d71a230194ca28be02100	2024-12-12T07:37:58-08:00	
Funeral for activist turns into call for justice for other missing Syrians	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Hundreds of Syrians marched through central Damascus in a funeral procession Thursday to honor one of the country's most prominent anti-government activists, whose body was found after the ouster of President Bashar Assad. The procession for Mazen al-Hamada — unimaginable only a week earlier — turned the moment of mourning into a call for justice, with marchers carrying posters of other missing detainees and chanting for Assad to be put on trial. The capture of Damascus by insurgents last weekend brought thousands of people into the streets in celebrations, and Thursday’s march recalled the funerals-turned-protests of the early days of the uprising against Assad 13 years ago. 'We will not forget your blood, Mazen,' the marchers, most of them young people, chanted outside a mosque while family and friends held funeral prayers inside. Others chanted: 'We will get our revenge, Bashar. We will bring you before the law.' Al-Hamada joined the anti-government protest movement in its early days and was arrested several times. Released after a long detention in 2013, he left Syria for the Netherlands. There, he became a well-known figure and symbol of the anti-Assad movement, speaking publicly about the torture he endured in prison. Still, he returned to Syria in 2020 — apparently lured by promises of safety — and immediately disappeared. His family found him Tuesday in a hospital morgue. By the condition of his body, al-Hamada, who was in his late 40s, appeared to have been killed only in the past week, his family said. Tens of thousands of Syrians are still seeking information about the fate of loved ones who disappeared under Assad's police state. Many have swarmed prisons and detention facilities in their searches. Dozens of bodies have been found in morgues, some emaciated, and others with wounds that suggest they were tortured. The rebels and the transitional government have called for any information that would help identify secret prisons. In Thursday’s procession, supporters, protesters and family members carried al-Hamada’s body from al-Mujtahid mosque toward a mosque in central Damascus’s al-Hijaz Square. At Abu Awf Mosque, several family members of those still missing joined. Many participants said they last protested in Damascus 13 years ago, before Assad’s brutal crackdown on protesters turned the conflict into full-blown civil war. Mohammad Kulthum, 32, marched in the procession with his mother. 'I could not have imagined going out in a rally in any way, shape or form in Damascus.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-activist-funeral-a275b1cb50b7638d1dc0ff5a56e673e6	2024-12-12T07:32:50-08:00	
2 men deny charges of helping Hong Kong gather intelligence in UK	LONDON (AP) — Two men accused of helping Hong Kong authorities gather intelligence in the U.K. pleaded not guilty Thursday to violating Britain's National Security Act. Chung Biu Yuen, 64, and Chi Leung Peter Wai, 39, are accused of agreeing to undertake information gathering, surveillance and acts of deception likely to assist a foreign intelligence service. Yuen was the office manager of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London and Wai had worked as a U.K. Border Force officer. They had previously pleaded not guilty to a charge of foreign interference for allegedly breaking into a home in the U.K. Wai had also denied a count of misconduct in a public office for allegedly searching Home Office databases without justification when working as a border officer. The two, who are free on bail, face a March 10 trial in London’s Central Criminal Court. Officials in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese control in 1997, have voiced concerns over the charges. Beijing officials strongly criticized the case. A case against a third suspect, Matthew Trickett, an immigration enforcement officer, was discontinued after he was found dead in a park in May. A prosecutor said Trickett attempted suicide after he was charged. Authorities said his death was not considered suspicious.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-hong-kong-spying-charges-5d13785e808bae5d6dc2b8b804a3e264	2024-12-12T07:03:08-08:00	
NATO chief warns that Putin wants long-term confrontation with Europe after Ukraine	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to 'wipe Ukraine off the map' and could come after other parts of Europe next, as he urged Europeans to press their governments to ramp up defense spending. 'It is time to shift to a wartime mindset,' Rutte told security experts and analysts at the Carnegie Europe think-tank in Brussels. He said people should gird themselves for the prospect that Russia might try to use 'swarms of drones' in Europe as it has to deadly effect in Ukraine. Putin 'is trying to crush our freedom and way of life,' Rutte said. The former Dutch prime minister listed Russia’s attacks on Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, and the all-out invasion launched almost three years ago. 'How many more wake-up calls do we need? We should be profoundly concerned. I know I am,' he said. 'Russia is preparing for long-term confrontation. With Ukraine, and with us.' Rutte’s inaugural speech came just over two months after he took office as NATO’s top civilian official. He has since toured the capitals of the 32 allies, including a visit to NATO's most important member, the United States to meet with President-elect Donald Trump. NATO has been a staunch backer of Ukraine and has helped most of its members funnel weapons, ammunition and other support into the country. But Trump’s return, and pledge to end the war quickly, has fueled concern that an unfavorable truce might be forced on Ukraine. Asked by the Associated Press how damaging a quick and shoddy peace agreement might be, Rutte said that 'a bad deal means Putin coming out on top, and that will have worldwide ramifications, not only on Europe and Ukraine.' He insisted that Ukraine must be involved in any peace talks. Trump routinely complains that U.S. allies in NATO are not spending enough on defense. Rutte said Russia’s military spending is likely to amount to 7 to 8% of its GDP next year -– far more than any NATO ally –- while its defense industry churns out tanks, armored vehicles and ammunition. Putin also has the support of allies like China, Iran and North Korea. Rutte noted that defense spending has risen sharply in Europe, with 23 allies expected to reach NATO’s target of putting 2% of GDP into their military budgets. But he added: 'I can tell you, we are going to need a lot more than 2%.' Rutte listed a series of recent 'hostile actions' by Russia against NATO allies, including cyber-attacks, assassinations, an explosion at a Czech ammunition depot, the jamming of radars in the Baltic region to disrupt air traffic, and the 'weaponization' of migrants to destabilize Europe. 'These attacks are not just isolated incidents. They are the result of a coordinated campaign to destabilize our societies and discourage us from supporting Ukraine,' he said. 'They circumvent our deterrence and bring the front line to our front doors.' Beyond increased defense spending in Europe, Rutte noted that NATO now has tens of thousands of troops on high readiness should they be needed to defend allied territory. 'With all this, our deterrence is good -– for now. But it’s tomorrow I’m worried about,' he said, and warned that 'we are not ready for what is coming our way in four to five years. Danger is moving towards us at full speed.' 'What is happening in Ukraine could happen here too, and regardless of the outcome of this war, we will not be safe in the future unless we are prepared to deal with danger,' Rutte added. Rutte appealed to governments to provide the defense industry with 'the big orders and long-term contracts they need to rapidly produce more and better capabilities.' He urged the industry to boost production for defenses against drones and other new war tactics. He added that 'freedom does not come for free' to the estimated 1 billion people living in the Euro-Atlantic area. 'If we don’t spend more together now to prevent war, we will pay a much, much, much higher price later to fight it. Not billions, but trillions of euros. That’s if we come out on top, and that’s if we win,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/nato-russia-ukraine-defense-spending-industry-8a84361c3827081da3f1308851cb19dd	2024-12-12T06:27:55-08:00	
Concern over Syria's chemical weapons stockpile triggers emergency meeting of global monitor	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The global chemical weapons watchdog opened an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the situation in Syria over concerns about the country’s stockpile of toxic chemicals in the wake of the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on Monday told Syria that it is under obligations to comply with rules to safeguard and destroy dangerous substances, such as chlorine gas, after rebels entered the capital, Damascus, over the weekend. 'Chemical weapons have been used in Syria on multiple occasions and victims deserve that perpetrators that we identified be brought to justice and held accountable for what they did and that investigations continue,' Fernando Arias González, the OPCW secretary general, said in his opening remarks. 'Our reports over the past few years have reached very clear conclusions and we hope that the new circumstances in Syria will allow this chapter to be closed soon,' he added, referring to the lack of stockpile declarations and the use of the weapons themselves. Assad’s government has denied using chemical weapons but the OPCW found evidence indicating their repeated use by Syria in the grinding civil war. Earlier this year, the organization found the Islamic State group had used mustard gas against the town of Marea. In a rare move, the OPCW's executive council called the meeting, hoping that under a new government, some of its 80 inspectors may be allowed to pursue investigations into Syria's chemical weapons program. Members of the ousted Syrian government plan to gradually transfer power to a new transitional Cabinet headed by Mohammed al-Bashir, who reportedly headed the rebel alliance’s 'salvation government' in its southwest Syrian stronghold. Arias González also expressed concern about ongoing Israeli airstrikes in Syria. 'We do not know yet whether these strikes have affected chemical weapons related sites. Such airstrikes could create a risk of contamination. Another real risk would be the destruction of valuable evidence for investigations by different independent international bodies related to past use of chemical weapons,' the Spanish diplomat said. The last time the OPCW called an extraordinary meeting was in 2018, in response to the chemical attack on Douma, a town close to Damascus, when some 40 people were killed by poison gas. Last year the watchdog found that the Syrian Armed Forces dropped canisters of chlorine gas during a major military operation. Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 to ward off the threat of airstrikes in response to a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus. The OPCW’s 193 member states are required to disclose their chemical weapons programs and dismantle them. The organization, created in 1997 by the Chemical Weapons Convention, seeks to eliminate all chemical weapons. In 2013, it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its work.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-chemical-weapons-opcw-stockpiles-chlorine-assad-e195ca88035fc2ae1feb9e9106191329	2024-12-12T06:01:14-08:00	
Trump invites China's Xi to his inauguration even as he threatens massive tariffs on Beijing	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration next month — extending a diplomatic olive branch even as Trump threatens to levy massive tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump's incoming press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed on Thursday that Trump invited Xi, but said it was 'to be determined' if the leader of the United States' most significant economic and military competitor would attend. 'This is an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of countries that are not just our allies, but our adversaries and our competitors too,' Leavitt said in an appearance on Fox News' program 'Fox &amp; Friends.' 'We saw this in his first term. He got a lot of criticism for it, but it led to peace around this world. He is willing to talk to anyone and he will always put America’s interest first.' CBS News first reported the invitation to Xi. Asked at a Chinese Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday about Trump's invitation, spokesperson Mao Ning responded: 'I have nothing to share at present.' Leavitt said that other foreign leaders have also been invited, but did not provide any details. The move by Trump to invite a leader of an adversarial nation to the American moment that is Inauguration Day is unorthodox. But it also squares with his belief that foreign policy—much like a business negotiation—should be carried out with carrots and sticks to get the United States' opponents to operate closer to his administration's preferred terms. Jim Bendat, a historian and author of 'Democracy’s Big Day: The Inauguration of Our President,' said he was not aware of a previous U.S. inauguration attended by foreign head of state. 'It's not necessarily a bad thing to invite foreign leaders to attend,' Bendat said. 'But it sure would make more sense to invite an ally before an adversary.' Trump on Thursday during an appearance at the New York Stock Exchange, where he was ringing the opening bell to open the market, said he’s been 'thinking about inviting certain people to the inauguration' without referring to any specific individuals. 'And some people said, ‘Wow, that’s a little risky, isn’t it?’' Trump said. 'And I said, ‘Maybe it is. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens.’ But we like to take little chances.' Meanwhile, a top aide to Hungarian President Viktor Orban, one of Trump's most vocal supporters on the world stage, said Thursday that Orban isn't slated to attend the inauguration. 'There is no such plan, at least for the time being,' said Gergely Gulyás, Orban's chief of staff. The nationalist Hungarian leader is embraced by Trump but has faced isolation in Europe as he's sought to undermine the European Union's support for Ukraine, and routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc’s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion. Orban recently met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Every country's chief of mission to the United States will also be invited, according to a Trump Inaugural Committee official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The invitation comes as Trump has vowed to enact massive tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China to get those countries to do more to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States. He has said that, on his first day in office in January, he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada and that China could be hit with even higher tariffs. China produces precursor chemicals used in the production of fentanyl, but Beijing has stepped up efforts over the last year to crack down on the export of the chemicals. 'We’ve been talking and discussing with President Xi, some things, and others, other world leaders, and I think we’re going to do very well all around,' Trump said in a CNBC interview Thursday. Xi during a meeting with President Joe Biden last month in Beijing urged the United States not to start a trade war. 'Make the wise choice,' Xi cautioned. 'Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other.' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also pushed back on Trump's threats, warning such a tariffs move would be perilous for the U.S. economy as well. Trudeau earlier this week said that Americans 'are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive' and said he will retaliate if Trump goes ahead with them. Trump responded by calling Canada a state and Trudeau the governor. In addition to the tariff dispute, U.S.-China relations are strained over other issues, including what U.S. officials see as Beijing indirectly supporting Russia's war on Ukraine. The Biden administration says China has supported Russia with a surge in sales of dual use components that help keep its military industrial base afloat. U.S. officials also have expressed frustration with Beijing for not doing more to rein in North Korea's support for the Russian war. China accounts for the vast majority of North Korea’s trade.

Rescue group saves 11-year-old girl floating alone in the Mediterranean for days after shipwreck	MILAN (AP) — An 11-year-old girl from Sierra Leone was found floating in the Mediterranean Sea off Italy’s southernmost island of Lampedusa, believed to be the only survivor of a shipwrecked migrant boat that had departed from the port of Sfax in Tunisia, a humanitarian group said Thursday. The girl was saved by a German-flagged sailboat named Trotamar III, which brought her to Lampedusa on Wednesday morning, according to the German charity Compass Collective that has been operating in the Mediterranean Sea since August 2023. She had neither food nor water with her, and was suffering from hypothermia. 'It was an incredible coincidence that we heard the voice of a girl even though the motors were running,’’ the sailboat’s captain, Matthias Weidenluebbert, said in a press statement. The crew immediately cut the engines and searched for the source of the voice, Compass Collective's Katja Tempel, told The Associated Press 'She was exhausted and tired and cold, but in general, she was fine when we fetched her out of the water.' According to the girl’s account, she had floated in the sea for three days using innertubes inflated with air and a lifejacket. She told rescuers that she had set out in a metal boat with about 45 others, and that she had been in contact with two other people until two days before the rescue, when the contact was broken. 'We don’t know what happened to the people,'' Tempel said. 'We assume that they all drowned, but we don’t know what.' The girl was found following a storm that had lasted for days, with winds reaching more than 23 knots and waves above 2.5 meters (8 feet.) The Totamar III, a 13-meter vessel with a rotating crew of six, joined humanitarian rescue efforts in August 2023, rescuing more than 230 people to date. After picking up the girl, the boat distributed life jackets to 53 people aboard a wooden boat without a motor, and reported their location to Italian authorities. In all, the Totamar III crew has assisted 1,700 people, handing out life jackets, alerting authorities and staying with them until rescue arrives. In cases when the situation worsens, the stranded people are transferred on board the sailing ship. According to U.N. statistics, which are based largely on survivor accounts, 1,536 people have died or gone missing and are presumed dead in the central Mediterranean so far this year. A total of 64,234 have reached Italy through Thursday, according to the Italian Interior Ministry. That's down by 58% from last year, when 153,211 had arrived in the period. 'I want to emphasize, this girl is just a sign for the (deaths) in the Mediterranean,'' Tempel said. 'She's one person, and its very sad that she probably lost her relatives. But it is just a symbol for the tragedy that is happening.' ___ This story has been corrected to show that the first name of the rescue group's member is Katja, not Katya. ___ Murru reported from Rome.

Syria's new authorities say they've secured the release of an American pilgrim imprisoned by Assad	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — An American citizen who disappeared seven months ago into former Syrian President Bashar Assad’s notorious prison system was suddenly discovered Thursday outside Damascus after being released and handed over to rebel forces, Syria’s new authorities said. The political affairs office of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that led the lightning offensive to topple Assad’s government, said the group had secured the release of U.S. citizen Travis Timmerman. In interviews with media in Syria, Timmerman said he was imprisoned after crossing from Lebanon into Syria on a Christian pilgrimage. He appeared to be among the thousands of people released from Syria's sprawling military prisons this week after rebels reached Damascus, overthrowing Assad and ending his family’s 54-year rule. 'We affirm our readiness to cooperate directly with the U.S. administration to complete the search for American citizens disappeared by the former Assad regime,' the group said, adding that a search was underway for Austin Tice, an American journalist who went missing in Syria 12 years ago. As footage emerged online Thursday of Timmerman, looking disheveled and disoriented as rebels led him out of a family's home near Damascus, some initially mistook him for Tice. In the video, Timmerman could be seen lying on a mattress under a blanket. A group of men in the video said that he was being treated well and would be safely returned home. A Syrian family told The Associated Press they found Timmerman barefoot on a main road in the countryside of Damascus early on Thursday. He appeared cold and hungry so they brought him back to their home. 'I fed him and called a doctor,' said Mosaed al-Rifai, the 68-year-old waste collector who first found Timmerman. Al-Rifai said it was hard to communicate because of the language barrier but it seemed Timmerman had been held by an internal security agency. A few hours after al-Rifai discovered him, rebels arrived at the family’s house to pick him up, he said. Mouaz Mostafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based nonprofit group, said he met Timmerman at the house and arranged for a car to take him to Damascus, where the new authorities gave the ex-detainee food and water and brought him clothes and shoes. Timmerman had lice in his long, unkempt hair, Mostafa said, and reported walking for 13 miles barefoot before being discovered. Timmerman — now recovering until the rebels can figure out how to hand him to U.S. authorities — was planning to get to Jordan after his release to obtain a new passport, Mostafa said. Earlier this year, a Missouri State Highway Patrol bulletin identified him as 'Pete Travis Timmerman,' 29, and said he had gone missing in Hungary in early June. In late August, Hungarian police put out a missing persons announcement for 'Travis Pete Timmerman,' saying he was last seen at a church in Hungary’s capital, Budapest. Authorities in Missouri and Hungary had shared photos of a young man who strongly resembles the ex-prisoner who identified himself as 'Travis Timmerman' in interviews with international news outlets on Thursday. Missouri court records indicate Timmerman is from Urbana, Missouri, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Springfield in the southwestern part of the state. A graduation list from Missouri State University shows he earned his bachelor’s degree in finance in the spring of 2017. Timmerman’s mother, Stacey Collins Gardiner, told National Public Radio that he returned home to Urbana after working in Chicago for a couple of years. He then left for Budapest with the goal of writing about his Christian faith and helping people, she said. Timmerman had warned her, she added, that his travels might make communication difficult. After losing contact with him during his stay in Hungary, Gardiner later learned that her son had gone to Lebanon. On Thursday, she heard that he was found through the media. 'I will hug him. ... And then I probably won’t let him go,' she said, laughing. 'I’ll say, well, thank God you’re still alive. And I’m so happy. Our prayers came true.' U.S. officials said they were working to confirm Timmerman's identity and provide the support. From Aqaba, Jordan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that the White House was 'working to bring him home, to bring him out of Syria' but declined further comment for privacy reasons. Timmerman, with a scraggly beard and grey sweatshirt, later spoke with the Al-Arabiya TV network, saying he had illegally crossed into Syria on foot from the eastern Lebanese town of Zahle seven months ago before being detained and held in a cell alone. He said that he was treated well in detention, but could hear other young men being tortured. 'It was OK. I was fed. I was watered. The one difficulty was that I couldn’t go to the bathroom when I wanted to,' he said. He said he was only allowed to go three times a day. 'I was not beaten and the guards treated me decently,' he added. Washington's top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens, traveled to Lebanon earlier this week in hopes of collecting information on the whereabouts of Tice. President Joe Biden has said his administration believed Tice was alive and was committed to bringing him home, though he also acknowledged on Sunday that 'we have no direct evidence' of his status. The case has frustrated U.S. intelligence officials for years. On Thursday, Blinken emphasized the administration’s work on Tice's case. 'Every single day we are working to find him and to bring him home' Blinken said. 'This is a priority for the United States.' Tice, who has had his work published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and others, disappeared at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus in August 2012 as the Syrian civil war intensified. A video released weeks after Tice went missing showed him blindfolded and held by armed men. He hasn't been heard from since. Assad's government had denied that it was holding him. ___ Follow the AP's Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-war-assad-news-12-12-2024-832bd669d118305bd773a26c29893207	2024-12-12T02:25:22-08:00	
A pro-democracy ex-lawmaker in Hong Kong has been convicted of rioting during 2019 protests	HONG KONG (AP) — A Hong Kong judge on Thursday convicted a pro-democracy former lawmaker of rioting during mob violence at a subway station at the height of the city’s anti-government protests in July 2019. Prosecutors accused Lam Cheuk-ting of provoking a group of about 100 men armed with wooden poles and metal rods who attacked protesters and bystanders at a train station. The men, all clad in white shirts, in contrast with the black worn by protesters, claimed to be protecting their homeland in Yuen Long, a residential district in Hong Kong's New Territories. Dozens of people, including Lam, were injured in the violence, a key chapter that escalated the protest movement as the public criticized police for their delayed response. The landmark ruling could shape the city's historical narrative of the incident. Judge Stanley Chan ruled that Lam was not acting as a mediator as he had claimed, but rather was trying to exploit the situation for political gain. He said Lam's words directed at the white-shirted men had 'fanned the flames.' Lam, who is already in prison on a national security charge, is expected to be sentenced at a later date. Chan was still reading out the verdicts for six other lesser-known co-defendants in the same case. The prosecution alleged the seven defendants had either berated the white-shirted men, used obscene hand gestures, hurled objects or shot jets of water by pointing a hosepipe at them. The defendants had pleaded not guilty to the rioting charge. During the trial, Lam said he chose to go to Yuen Long because he hoped his then position as a lawmaker could pressure the police to act quickly. He said he could not leave the scene while fellow residents were in danger. Some defendants who targeted the white-shirted men with a hosepipe argued that they were just trying to stop the attackers from advancing. The 2019 protests were sparked by a proposed extradition law that would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to the mainland for trial. The government withdrew the bill, but the protesters widened their demands to include direct elections for the city’s leaders and police accountability. The social movement was the biggest challenge to the Hong Kong government since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In response, Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020, leading to the arrest of many activists. Others were silenced or went into exile. In November, Lam was sentenced to six years and nine months in jail in the city's biggest national security case. More than 10,000 people were arrested in connection to the protests for various crimes, such as rioting and participating in an unauthorized assembly. About 10 white-shirted men were convicted in other cases related to the mob violence in July 2019, local media reported.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-riot-verdicts-lam-cheukting-0fc782d0aa375faf8f8c3f91995a9f8f	2024-12-12T00:40:37-08:00

AP photos from Ukraine in 2024 convey wartime horror and hope	A man falls to his death from the window of a burning apartment after a Russian air strike. Two girls in pink tutus join a ballet class in a bomb shelter. The grisly evidence of war is everywhere in Ukraine, where, for a third year, soldiers and civilians are enduring the Russian army’s onslaught. AP photographers have traveled across the country, capturing the agony and the life-affirming joy witnessed in the conflict. Bombs and missiles have turned residential neighborhoods into fiery infernos, while relentless attacks have destroyed homes, hospitals and schools. Evacuations in front-line areas tear apart Ukrainian communities. The elderly are wrenched away from their longtime homes and neighbors. AP photos have evoked the grief and the poignancy of funerals for fallen soldiers and for families killed by the Russian shelling. Open coffins, including those of children, provide a glimpse of the tragedy. The United Nations accuses Russia of numerous human rights violations in Ukraine. They include aiming at civilian targets, devastating attacks on Ukraine’s power grid, and the forced transfer and deportation of children. By the end of October, the UN estimated that the war had killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians and injured almost 27,000. Despite the suffering and hardship, civilians carry on with some everyday activities that wouldn’t be out of place in peacetime. In northeastern Ukraine, about 20 young girls assemble for ballet lessons at the Princess Ballet Studio, where the windowless room doubles as a bomb shelter amid almost hourly air raids. Children leap into the water at Kyiv’s Liko Diving School. Another boy looks thoughtful as he learns chess strategy from an elderly man in one of the Ukrainian capital’s public parks. Clowns perform at a children’s hospital. Young people wave their arms and dance at a festival concert featuring an active serviceman in Ukraine’s Hroza battalion.

Hardest-hit Nigeria is latest African country to provide malaria vaccine to young children	BAYELSA, Nigeria (AP) — Ominike Marvis has lost count of the number of times her 6-year-old son has had malaria. So when Nigeria started offering a malaria vaccine, she was eager to protect her youngest child. She took the 6-month-old baby to get his first shot at a health center in hard-hit Bayelsa state, where the country's vaccination campaign kicked off last week. The vaccine aims to prevent severe illnesses and deaths from the mosquito-borne disease. 'At least I know he’s safe from it now,' Marvis, 31, said. Africa accounts for the vast majority of malaria in the world. Nigeria, the continent's most populous country, has the biggest burden with about a quarter of the cases. According to a World Health Organization report released Wednesday, there were an estimated 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths worldwide last year, mostly in children under 5. That is 11 million more malaria cases compared to 2022 with nearly the same number of deaths. 'No one should die of malaria, yet the disease continues to disproportionately harm people living in the African region, especially young children and pregnant women,' said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, calling for more support. There are now 17 countries giving new malaria vaccines to young children, the WHO report said. Nigeria began its campaign last week, offering a vaccine developed by Oxford University. Research suggests it is more than 75% effective at preventing severe disease and death in the first year and that protection is extended for at least another year with a booster. Nigeria’s health minister, Muhammad Ali Pate, called the vaccination campaign a 'monumental step' in the country’s efforts to eliminate malaria. The disease is caused by a parasite that is spread through mosquito bites. Experts say other measures like bed nets and insecticide spraying remain essential to curb the disease. Experts say Nigeria's population of more than 210 million people, as well as its climate, contribute to its high malaria burden, but so do other factors like poor sanitation and limited tools like treated bed nets. Besides the lack of funding, WHO report said countries with malaria still grapple with fragile health systems, weak surveillance and drug and insecticide resistance. But progress has also been made on several fronts, the report said, including in the African region where countries have achieved a 16% reduction in malaria deaths since 2015. And in 83 countries where malaria is present, 25 of them now report fewer than 10 cases a year, the report said. In the oil-rich but poor Bayelsa state, among the worst-hit in Nigeria, malaria is so common in riverside communities that mothers spoke of how no one in their family has been spared. 'Here, malaria is something we are used to,' said Claris Okah, a community health worker. Among the challenges health workers like Okah face is hesitancy among parents, so they are educating families about the new vaccine and other steps to prevent malaria. 'The vaccine is a good thing,' Okah siad. ___ Asadu reported from Abuja, Nigeria. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

One Tech Tip: How to protect your communications through encryption	LONDON (AP) — After a sprawling hacking campaign exposed the communications of an unknown number of Americans, U.S. cybersecurity officials are advising people to use encryption in their communications. To safeguard against the risks highlighted by the campaign, which originated in China, federal cybersecurity authorities released an extensive list of security recommendations for U.S. telecom companies — such as Verizon and AT&amp;T — that were targeted. The advice includes one tip we can all put into practice with our phones: 'Ensure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible.' End-to-end encryption, also known as E2EE, means that messages are scrambled so that only the sender and recipient can see them. If anyone else intercepts the message, all they will see is a garble that can't be unscrambled without the key. Law enforcement officials had until now resisted this type of encryption because it means the technology companies themselves won't be able to look at the messages, nor respond to law enforcement requests to turn the data over. Here's a look at various ways ordinary consumers can use end-to-end encryption: Texting Officials said the hackers targeted the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts. They also managed to see the content from texts from a much smaller number of victims. If you're an iPhone user, information in text messages that you send to someone else who also has an iPhone will be encrypted end-to-end. Just look for the blue text bubbles, which indicate that they are encrypted iMessages. The same goes for Android users sending texts through Google Messages. There will be a lock next to the timestamp on each message to indicate the encryption is on. But there's a weakness. When iPhone and Android users text each other, the messages are encrypted only using Rich Communication Services, an industry standard for instant messaging that replaces the older SMS and MMS standards. Apple has noted that RCS messages 'aren’t end-to-end encrypted, which means they’re not protected from a third party reading them while they’re sent between devices.' Samsung, which sells Android smartphones, has also hinted at the issue in a footnote at the bottom of a press release last month on RCS, saying, 'Encryption only available for Android to Android communication.' Chat apps To avoid getting caught out when trading texts, experts recommend using encrypted messaging apps. Privacy advocates are big fans of Signal, which applies end-to-end encryption on all messages and voice calls. The independent nonprofit group behind the app promises never to sell, rent, or lease customer data and has made its source code publicly available so that it can be audited by anyone to examine it 'for security and correctness.' Signal's encryption protocol is so reputable that it has been integrated into rival WhatsApp, so users will enjoy the same level of security protection as Signal, which has a much smaller user base. End-to-end encryption is also the default mode for Facebook Messenger, which like WhatsApp is owned by Meta Platforms. What about Telegram? Telegram is an app that can be used for one-on-one conversations, group chats and broadcast 'channels' but contrary to popular perception, it doesn't turn on end-to-end encryption by default. Users have to switch on the option. And it doesn’t work with group chats. Cybersecurity experts have warned people against using Telegram for private communications and pointed out that only its opt-in ‘secret chat’ feature is encrypted from end-to-end. The app also has a reputation for being a haven for scammers and criminal activity, highlighted by founder and CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France. Making calls Instead of using your phone to make calls through a wireless cellular network, you can make voice calls with Signal and WhatsApp. Both apps encrypt calls with the same technology that they use to encrypt messages. There are other options. If you have an iPhone you can use Facetime for calls, while Android owners can use the Google Fi service, which are both end-to-end encrypted. The only catch with all these options is that, as with using the chat services to send messages, the person on the other end will also have to have the app installed. WhatsApp and Signal users can customize their privacy preferences in the settings, including hiding IP address during calls to prevent your general location from being guessed. ___ Is there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

Middle East latest: Israeli airstrikes kill 28 in Gaza, including 7 children, health officials say	Palestinian medical officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 28 people in the Gaza Strip, including seven children and a woman, hours after the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. One of the strikes overnight and into Thursday flattened a house in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the casualties were taken. Two other strikes killed 15 men who were part of local committees established to secure aid convoys. The committees were set up by displaced Palestinians in coordination with the Hamas-run Interior Ministry. On Wednesday, the U.N. General Assembly approved resolutions demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and expressing support for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, although they reflect world opinion.

Shooting attack on Israeli bus kills child, wounds 2 people JERUSALEM — Israeli hospital officials say a young boy died after being wounded in a shooting attack in the occupied West Bank that also wounded two adults. An Israeli bus came under fire from a suspected Palestinian attacker late Wednesday, the military said, and Israeli forces are searching for the shooter. The shooting took place just outside Jerusalem in an area near major Israeli settlements. Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem said the boy was 12 years old, after initial reports said he was 10. A spokesperson for the hospital did not immediately respond to a request for clarification. The hospital said two other people, ages 24 and 55, were also wounded. UN General Assembly demands ceasefire in Gaza and backs UN agency helping Palestinian refugees UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban.

The votes culminated two days of speeches overwhelmingly calling for an end to the 14-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly. Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-12-december-2024-b17c7ab064079d80fd006ab9d058966b	2024-12-11T22:37:57-08:00	
Thousands attend the funeral of a Taliban minister killed by an Islamic State suicide bomber	GARDA SERAI, Afghanistan (AP) — Thousands of people attended the funeral on Thursday of a Taliban minister killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, the day before that was claimed by the Islamic State group. The funeral for Khalil Haqqani, the minister for refugees and repatriation, was held in the eastern Paktia province. The Cabinet member was the most high-profile casualty of an assault in the country since the Taliban seized power three years ago. The minister, who died in a blast Wednesday at his ministry in Kabul along with five others, was the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the acting interior minister and the leader of a powerful faction within the Taliban. The United States has placed a bounty on both their heads. Tight security was in place for the high-ranking officials attending the funeral, including Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Deputy Prime Minister Maulvi Abdul Kabir. Armed men guarded the coffin, which was draped in the Taliban flag, and loudspeakers broadcast sermons and eulogies. Local and international media were invited to cover the funeral in Garda Serai district in Paktia. Sirajuddin Haqqani led the mourners in prayer. They gathered on a vast plain against a backdrop of rugged mountains. Haqqani told the crowd he wished the person who perpetrated this 'weak action' had thought of his uncle as an enemy of non-Muslims. 'The Americans offered a $5 million reward (for information) on him,' said the acting interior minister. 'He was not an enemy of Muslims. How can you call this a great victory, that you martyred a Muslim and are proud of it?' In a statement carried by the Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State Khorasan Province — a regional affiliate of the Islamic State group — said that one of its fighters carried out the suicide bombing. The fighter waited for Haqqani to leave his office and then detonated his device, according to the statement. An official from Paktia, the Haqqanis' heartland, gave a different account of what happened. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. The assailant was able to gain access to the ministry despite setting off an alarm on the body scanner because he told the guard he had metal plates in his hands, the official said. He also claimed he was a refugee. The official added that Haqqani made time for refugees and people with disabilities who come to see him at work because he was sympathetic to their plight. He was approaching the ministry after praying in the compound's mosque when the assailant detonated the bomb, the official added. The U.N. mission in Afghanistan was among those to condemn the ministry attack. 'There can be no place for terrorism in the quest for stability,' the mission said on X. Neighboring Pakistan has also expressed shock over teh attack. Mohammad Sadiq, the special representative for Afghanistan, wrote on X on Wednesday that the government stood in solidarity with Afghanistan and reiterated its commitment to work with Afghanistan in fighting the 'menace of terrorism.' The IS affiliate, a major rival of the ruling Taliban, has previously carried out bombings across Afghanistan. But suicide attacks have become rare since the Taliban seized power in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces were withdrawing after 20 years of war. Such assaults have mostly targeted minority Shiite Muslims, especially in the capital. ___ Associated Press writer Munir Ahmed in Islamabad contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-haqqani-funeral-suicide-bombing-kabul-cf2ec2a67b230ce0a4b919561c85042e	2024-12-11T22:24:56-08:00

South Korea's Kospi gained 1.6% to 2,482.12, while the S&amp;P/ASX 200 in Australia slipped 0.3% to 8,330.30. Taiwan's Taiex climbed 0.6% and the Sensex in India shed 0.2%. The SET in Bangkok picked up 0.2%. U.S. stock indexes resumed climbing on Wednesday after an update on inflation appeared to clear the way for more help for the economy from the Federal Reserve. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.8% to break its first two-day losing streak in nearly a month and finished at 6,084.19. Big Tech stocks helped drive the Nasdaq composite up 1.8% to 20,034.89. It was its first close above 20,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, dipped 0.2% to 44,148.56. Inflation in the U.S. ticked up to 2.7% in November from a year earlier from 2.6% in October, fueled by pricier used cars, hotel rooms and groceries. That shows some price pressures remain elevated, but not enough to prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates at its meeting next week. The Fed began trimming rates in September from a two-decade high to support a slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower rates would give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, but they could also provide more fuel for inflation. Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&amp;P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times this year, with the latest coming last week. Tesla jumped 5.9% to finish above $420 at $424.77. It’s a level that Elon Musk made famous in a 2018 tweet when he said he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share. Stitch Fix soared 44.3% after the company that sends clothes to your door reported a smaller loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave financial forecasts for the current quarter that were better than expected, including for revenue. GE Vernova rallied 5% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500. The energy company that spun out of General Electric said it would pay a 25 cent dividend every three months, and it approved a plan to send up to another $6 billion to its shareholders by buying back its own stock. Albertsons fell 1.5% after filing a lawsuit against Kroger, saying it didn’t do enough for their proposed $24.6 billion merger agreement to win regulatory clearance. A day earlier, judges in separate cases in Oregon and Washington had nixed the supermarket giants’ merger. The grocers contended a combination could have helped them compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, but critics said it would hurt competition. Macy’s slipped 0.8% after cutting some of its financial forecasts for the full year of 2024, including for how much profit it expects to make off each $1 of revenue. In other dealings early Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 13 cents to $70.42 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gained 23 cents to $73.75 per barrel. The U.S. dollar slipped to 152.35 Japanese yen from 152.46 yen. The euro rose to $1.0527 from $1.0496.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-41b48ce746dc18a1b5141d4c49cff403	2024-12-11T20:37:16-08:00	
Migrant workers in Lebanon are trying to return home after alleged abuses and then war	BEIRUT (AP) — Isatta Bah wakes up from a nap in a crowded shelter on the outskirts of Beirut, clutching her baby, Blessing. The 24-year-old from Sierra Leone spends her days waiting for an exit visa that could put her and her 1-year-old on a plane back to the West African nation. She wants to reunite with her family after what she called exploitative work conditions and sexual violence, along with the recent horrors of war in Lebanon. 'My experience in Lebanon is not good for me. I am really tired,' Bah said. 'I want to go home.' Hundreds of migrant workers in Lebanon are waiting to be repatriated after the ceasefire ending the 14-month war between the Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Israel went into effect last month. Lebanon has long drawn migrant workers dreaming of building better lives for their families. Enticed by promises of stable jobs and decent pay, they enter Lebanon via recruitment agencies under a sponsorship-based labor system known as Kafala — only to find themselves often trapped with confiscated passports, long hours, withheld wages and, for many, abuse. The Kafala system has long been criticized by human rights groups, but the government rarely if ever addresses the criticism. But Bah knew little of that when she came to Lebanon in 2022. She was promised a job at a supermarket with a $200 monthly salary, she said. Instead, she was sent to care for an older woman once she arrived. Within a month of her arrival, her 3-year-old son back home fell ill and died. She said she was not given the time to grieve and fled her employer’s house. Since her employer held her passport and other documents, Bah said she had to leave them behind. Her experience in Lebanon then took a darker turn. One day she and five housemates were picked up by a taxi driver who said he would take them home. Instead, she said, the driver dropped them at the wrong spot. As they tried and failed to find another cab, a group of men chased them and raped them. 'Men were coming and they were cheering for us,' said Bah, who gave her consent to be named. 'They beat us and they had sex with us.' She said it took her about two weeks to recover and resume work at two hotels. Without documents, migrants can hesitate to go to police. Two months later, she and another friend found out they were pregnant. Bah recounted the experience as she watched her baby’s wobbly footsteps. With war, their lives became more precarious. When Israel intensified its bombardment of Beirut’s southern suburbs in September, Bah fled the area with her baby and friends on foot. Not every migrant worker escaped the attacks. An estimated 37 have been killed and 150 wounded since October 2023, said Joelle Mhanna with the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. There were few places to turn. Most government-run shelters refused to take in displaced people who were not Lebanese, said activist Dea Hajj Shaheen. After supporting migrant women during previous crises in Lebanon, she stepped in again along with other volunteers. To house over 200 women from Sierra Leone including Bah, they repurposed an abandoned space owned by her family — a former car dealership that was later a venue for pop-up events and named The Shelter. The kitchen was alive with activity as women cooked, some dancing to Nigerian music. In another area, rows of thin mattresses lay in the dim light from broken windows. Despite the modest conditions, the women set up a Christmas tree crafted from sticks. While some migrants have been accepted at government-run shelters, there were regular reports of others being evicted or denied access, the IOM said. Some migrants hesitate to approach the government shelters for fear of detention or deportation, Mhanna said. 'As a result, most are being hosted by embassies, NGOs and community-based organizations including churches, monasteries and other religious groups.' The Lebanese government has not directly addressed the issue of migrant workers being rejected from government-run shelters, despite repeated calls for action from rights organizations and the United Nations. Moving on from the shelters they found posed another challenge for migrants like Bah, as many had passports and other documents confiscated by former employers. 'We had to secure exit permits, immigration clearances and even child travel documents for the five children in this group,' said Shaheen, who coordinated the repatriation last month of 120 women and their children with the support of IOM, who chartered the flight. IOM said it has received requests from around 10,000 migrants seeking to be repatriated, a small fraction of the over 175,000 in Lebanon. As of Nov. 26, the IOM had supported over 400 migrants to return home. That included two charter flights for people from Bangladesh and Sierra Leone. It wasn't clear how many more flights are planned. or to where. Laughter and cheer filled Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport on Nov. 19. The women from Sierra Leone arrived in groups, dragging suitcases and sharing hugs. Some danced in celebration for their long-awaited flight. 'It wasn’t easy in Lebanon,' said Amanata Thullah after four years. 'I am happy to be going back to my country.' Mariam Sesay, who described herself as the head of Sierra Leone's community in Lebanon, said there had been 'a lot of distress and trauma' in recent months. Bah was not among those leaving, but she said she and others at the shelter were happy to see friends return home. She now awaits her turn, along with over 50 others. At first she was told she needed official documents for her baby and the father’s consent to travel. But a lawyer waived the requirement due to her circumstances, Shaheen said. 'I wish to go back home to continue my education,' Bah said. 'Since I was little, I always wanted to be a computer science student, because I’m good at that.' She looked down at Blessing. 'Now I have something to take care of,' she said. 'When I watch her walk or laugh, that gives me joy.' ___ Follow AP coverage of migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-migrants-sierra-leone-war-9c696b80aa3bd5099ffc26394474d1fd	2024-12-11T20:23:38-08:00	
Rights group accuses Russian mercenaries of abuses against civilians in Mali	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Mali’s armed forces, supported by Russian mercenaries, committed abuses against civilians since the withdrawal of a U.N. peacekeeping mission late last year, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday. Malian armed forces and the Russia-backed Wagner Group deliberately killed at least 32 civilians, including seven in a drone strike, kidnapped four others, and burned at least 100 homes in towns and villages in central and northern Mali since May, the rights group said. Human Rights Watch also accused jihadi groups in the region of having summarily executed at least 47 civilians and displaced thousands of people since June. It said the groups burned thousands of houses and looted livestock, which is vital to the survival of the nomadic communities in the region. 'The Malian army with the Wagner Group and Islamist armed groups have been targeting civilians and their property in violation of the laws of war,' Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in the report. Mali, along with its neighbors Burkina Faso and Niger, has for over a decade battled an insurgency fought by jihadi groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Following military coups in all three nations in recent years, the ruling juntas have expelled French forces and turned to Russia’s mercenary units for security assistance. Wagner has been present in Mali since late 2021 following a military coup, replacing French troops and international peacekeepers to help fight the militants. At the same time, the mercenary group has been accused of helping to carry out raids and drone strikes that have killed civilians. In December last year, the United Nations ended its decade long peacekeeping mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA following the government’s request that alleged the force was inadequate to respond to the insurgency. 'Since MINUSMA left Mali a year ago, it has been extremely difficult to get comprehensive information on abuses, and we are deeply concerned that the situation is even worse than reported,' Allegrozzi said. ____ Follow AP’s Africa coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mali-human-rights-watch-russia-wagner-abuses-ee01ab840c6323c176ded02d1d7be5bb	2024-12-11T20:08:38-08:00	
As tourists discover Finland's Santa Claus Village, some locals call for rules to control the masses	ROVANIEMI, Finland (AP) — Shuffling across icy ground on a cold December afternoon, lots of tourist groups poured into Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park perched on the edge of the Arctic Circle. They frolic in the snow, take a reindeer sleigh ride, sip a cocktail in an ice bar or even meet Saint Nick himself in the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, which happily calls itself the 'official hometown of Santa Claus.' The Santa Claus Village theme park, which attracts more than 600,000 people annually, is especially popular during the holiday season. 'This is like my dream came true,' beamed Polish visitor Elzbieta Nazaruk. 'I’m really excited to be here.' Tourism is booming in Rovaniemi — which has hotel and restaurant owners, as well as city officials, excited as it brings lots of money to the town. However, not everyone is happy about the onslaught of visitors, 10 times the town's population, each year at Christmas time. 'We are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it’s not anymore in control,' said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city’s streets. It’s a feeling that has been echoed in other popular European travel destinations, including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Malaga and Florence. Across the continent, locals have protested against 'over-tourism' — which generally describes the tipping point at which visitors and their cash stop benefiting residents and instead cause harm by degrading historic sites, overwhelming infrastructure and making life markedly more difficult for those who live there. Now, it seems to have spread north, all the way to the edges of the Arctic Circle. Rovaniemi counted a record 1.2 million overnight visitors in 2023, almost 30 percent growth on 2022, after rebounding from pandemic travel disruptions. 'Nordic is a trend,' Visit Rovaniemi CEO Sanna Karkkainen, said as she stood in an ice restaurant, where snow carvers were working nearby. 'People want to travel to cool countries to see the snow, to see the Northern Lights, and, of course, to see Santa Claus,' she added. Thirteen new flight routes to Rovaniemi Airport opened this year, bringing passengers from Geneva, Berlin, Bordeaux and more. Most tourists come from European countries like France, Germany and the UK, but Rovaniemi’s appeal has also spread further. Hotel availability is scarce this winter, and Tiina Määttä, general manager of the 159-room Original Sokos Hotel, expects 2024 to break more records. Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi’s city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a 'transient space for tourists.' Finnish law prohibits professional accommodation services in buildings intended for residential use, so campaigners are calling on authorities to act. 'The rules must be enforced better,' said Pakkanen. Not everyone agrees. Mayor Ulla-Kirsikka Vainio notes some make 'good money' on short-term rentals. Either way, stricter regulations likely won’t be in place to impact this winter season, and despite the unease expressed by locals, mass tourism to Rovaniemi is probably only going to grow in 2025 — as visitors want to experience the unique atmosphere up north, especially during the holiday season. 'It’s Christmas time and we would love to see the Northern Lights,' says Joy, a visitor from Bangkok. 'Rovaniemi seems to be a good place.'	https://apnews.com/article/finland-overtourism-santa-claus-hometown-rovaniemi-7dc1f0e8688aee63a86b7b0e3aead8de	2024-12-11T20:04:49-08:00	
US hikes tariffs on imports of Chinese solar wafers, polysilicon and tungsten products	BANGKOK (AP) — The Biden administration plans to raise tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect U.S. clean energy businesses. The notice from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50% from 25% and duties on certain tungsten products will increase from zero to 25%, effective on Jan. 1, following a review of Chinese trade practices under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. The decision followed a public comment period after the USTR said in September that it was considering such actions. 'The tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People’s Republic of China,' USTR Katharine Tai said in a statement. 'These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains.' Reports Thursday said U.S. and Chinese officials were meeting this week and next for trade talks ahead of the year's end. Last week, Washington tightened restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology. Beijing responded by banning exports to the U.S. of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the U.S. China provides a very large share of most of those materials and the United States has been working to secure alternative sources in Africa and other parts of the world. Tungsten is another strategically vital metal whose production is dominated by China. The U.S. does not produce it, but South Korea is a potential big supplier. It's used to make armaments and is also used in x-ray tubes and light bulb filaments, among other industrial applications. U.S. imports of the metal from China fell to $10.9 million in 2023 from $19.5 million the year before. After Beijing announced its ban on exporting gallium and the other materials to the United States, analysts said tungsten was another likely area where China might strike back. Trade frictions have been escalating ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods, among other threats. President Joe Biden has said Trump’s promise of broad tariffs on foreign imports would be a mistake. His administration has kept in place tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term in office, but says it has a more targeted approach. China has sharply ramped up production of cheap electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries at a time when the Biden administration has championed moves to support those industries in the U.S. The U.S. and other trading partners say China improperly subsidizes exports, giving exporters of solar panels and other products an unfair advantage in overseas markets, where its manufacturers charge lower prices thanks to government support. Washington also says China improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology. China accounts for more than 80% of the market for solar panels at all stages of production, according to the International Energy Agency, more than double domestic demand for those products. Its huge economies of scale have made solar power more affordable, but also concentrated the supply chain inside China. The IEA has urged other countries to assess their solar panel supply chains and develop strategies to address any risks. In early 2018, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. Beijing filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization charging that the U.S. was unfairly supporting electric vehicle purchases. The investigation that led the USTR to raise the tariffs on solar panels concluded with a report in May that has prompted increases in tariffs on a range of products including electric vehicles, syringes and needles, medical gloves and facemasks, semiconductors and steel and aluminum products, among others. It has pushed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles up to 100% from 25%, raised tariffs on Chinese-made lithium batteries to 25% from 7.5%.	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tariffs-tungsten-solar-a9653d4b14051d78314c2bd8111510e7	2024-12-11T19:39:53-08:00	
In Nigeria's lithium boom, many mines are illegal and children do much of the work	NASARAWA, Nigeria (AP) — Dressed in a faded pink dress, 6-year-old Juliet Samaniya squats under scorching skies to chip at a jagged white rock with a stone tool. Dust coats her tiny hands and her hair as she works hour after hour for less than a dollar a day. The landscape around her is dotted with active and abandoned mineshafts, farmland that may soon be cleared in search of more rich ore, and other mine workers — many of them children. Juliet should be in school, her mother, Abigail Samaniya, admits. Instead, she spends her day mining lithium, a mineral critical for batteries needed in the global transition to clean energy, to earn money that helps sustain her family. 'That is the only option,' Abigail Samaniya said. The International Labour Organization estimates more than 1 million children work in mines and quarries worldwide, a problem particularly acute in Africa, where poverty, limited access to education and weak regulations add to the problem. Children, working mostly in small-scale mines, work long hours at unsafe sites, crushing or sorting rocks, carrying heavy loads of ore, and exposing themselves to toxic dust that can cause respiratory problems and asthma. The growing demand for lithium has created a new frontier for mining in mineral-rich Nigeria. But it has come with a steep cost, exploiting its poorest and most vulnerable: its children. Their work often provides material for Chinese businesses that dominate Nigeria’s laxly regulated extractive industry and are often blamed for illegal mining and labor exploitation. The Associated Press recently traveled to the deep bush of Pasali, near the federal capital of Abuja in Nasarawa state, to follow and interview miners operating illegal mines, including the one where Juliet works. AP also witnessed negotiations and an agreement to purchase lithium by a Chinese company with no questions about the source of the lithium or how it was obtained. That company, RSIN Nigeria Limited, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But in a statement to AP, the Chinese embassy in Abuja said Chinese mining companies in Nigeria 'operate in line with local laws and regulations.' Nigeria has laws requiring basic education and prohibiting child labor, but enforcement is a challenge with many illegal mines in hard-to-reach areas. Corruption among regulatory and law enforcement officials is also a problem. The government said it's pursuing reforms that would toughen laws. Earlier this year it also launched a 'corps of mining marshals' to combat illegal mining, but activists say it's too soon to tell if that program is helping. How Nigeria's illegal mines work Lithium mining began in Pasali a decade ago, transforming a remote and slumbering community into a bustling site for small-scale illegal mining, said Shedrack Bala, a 25-year-old who began working in the mines at age 15 and now owns his own pit. Dozens of mines now dot the area, all unlicensed. The mining methods are primitive and dangerous. Miners use chisels and heavy hammers to break through rocks, descending several feet into dark pits. In some old but still viable mines, they crawl through narrow passages snaking between unstable mud walls before starting to dig. For new mines, the ground is blasted open with dynamite. Bashir Rabiu, now 19, started in these pits as an underage worker. AP journalists watched as he wriggled around at the bottom of a pit, where miners can be at risk if dynamite explodes prematurely. They also face danger of suffocating in narrow tunnels that connect pits, or burial from wall collapse — all fates Rabiu has seen befall other miners. 'But it is God that protects,' he said. Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to Juliet and five other children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over heaps of rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments. Once sorted, the minerals were bagged to begin their journey from Pasali to the global supply chain. A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. When the AP visited, they did 22 kilograms (about 48.5 pounds) in one hour. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them. They said it is enough money to cover meals at the children’s homes. In Juliet's group, only she and a 5-year-old boy named Zakaria Danladi had ever attended the local elementary school. Zakaria stopped when he was orphaned. Juliet was pulled out because her family couldn't afford to send both her and her 11-year-old brother, and his education took precedence, her mother said. Basic education is supposed to be free in Nigeria, at least in government schools like the one in Pasali. But hidden fees often put it out of reach of the poorest families. For example, in Pasali, a Parent-Teacher Association levy of 5,000 Naira (about $3) is charged per term, parents said. For Juliet’s family and others, even this amount is too much. About 63% of Nigeria's population lives in poverty. Sule Dantini, the schoolmaster, said his classes have become virtually empty with only three pupils turning up when he spoke with AP in early December. 'I used to have up to 300 pupils, but attendance has been very poor because of mining.' He denied the school charges fees. Miners say they have no trouble finding buyers Nigeria is Africa’s top oil producer, but it also has deep mineral resources including granite, limestone, and gold, and it's seeking to tap those to reduce its reliance on petroleum exports. Yet much of this wealth — including lithium — is siphoned off through unlicensed mines that cost the nation billions of dollars and drive insecurity, according to a parliamentary probe this year. The illegal mining thrives on informal networks of buyers and sellers who operate without much fear of the government. Aliyu Ibrahim, a lithium merchant in Nasarawa, owns unlicensed mines and also buys lithium ore from other illegal sites. At his warehouse, he told AP that his business flourishes by paying officials to look the other way. Ibrahim said he then sells his lithium in bulk to Chinese companies. Ibrahim said he knows that children are working at his mines and others he buys from, but he said many of the children are orphans or poor. 'It is dangerous, but the work helps them survive, while the government has abandoned poor people,' he said. Some of the bush miners avoid middlemen like Ibrahim and sell directly to Chinese companies or Chinese nationals. AP accompanied miners from Pasali illegal mines to Chinese-owned RSIN Nigeria Limited, where a sales agreement was reached without questions about the source of the minerals or the conditions under which they were extracted. Sellers were asked to leave samples to test for lithium content. A price list from the buyers offered 200,000 naira (about $119) for a metric ton of minerals containing up to 3% lithium. China's citizens and companies are frequently in the spotlight for environmentally damaging practices, exploitative labor and illicit mining in several countries. Nigeria has seen multiple cases of illegal mining arrests and prosecutions involving Chinese nationals in recent months. Experts say the materials are exported in a variety of ways, including shipping with false documentation or concealment within legitimate shipments. The Chinese embassy's statement to AP said its government has a zero-tolerance policy toward any illegal mining activity or illegal labor by Chinese companies operating abroad. Philip Jakpor, a Nigerian activist, said his nonprofit Renevlyn Development Initiative has documented widespread child labor practices across Nasarawa state. 'Revenue generation seems to have trumped the need to protect human rights,' Jakpor said. 'We expect those operating in the upper spheres of the supply chain to adopt responsible models that prevent abusive conditions in mineral extraction.' Juliane Kippenberg, associate director of children’s rights at Human Rights Watch, said global demand for lithium is expected to grow rapidly in coming years and it's imperative for governments to protect human rights and press corporations to do the same. Segun Tomori, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mining and Solid Minerals Development, said ongoing reforms such as amending the Minerals and Mining Act are aimed at minimizing the use of child labor. Tomori also said social safety programs such as school feeding initiatives are being revamped to keep children in school and combat child labor. He also cited the program to add mining marshals announced this year to clamp down on illegal mining. Abigail Samaniya, 6-year-old Juliet's mother, said she hopes her daughter will someday escape the mine. 'I still want her to go to school, have a better life, work in an office, not a mine forever,' she said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Papua New Guinea gains a team in Australian rugby league in diplomatic push aimed at curbing China	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Papua New Guinea will gain its own team in Australia’s rugby league in a soft diplomacy deal announced Thursday linked to limiting Chinese influence in the South Pacific. The Australian government will spend 600 million Australian dollars ($380 million) over a decade to add a team from its nearest neighbor to the National Rugby League from 2028. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his Papua New Guinea counterpart James Marape announced the deal at a Sydney news conference. They also announced that a bilateral security deal struck a year ago had officially come into force. China has pursued its own bilateral security pact on policing with Papua New Guinea and with other South Pacific island nations which U.S. allies including Australia fear could undermine regional security. Rugby league is the most popular sport in Papua New Guinea, a poor population of 12 million mostly subsistence farmers that is racked by tribal violence, worsening violent crime and civil unrest. Marape said the security deal with Australia 'fits in neatly' with ensuring the safety of players and officials who would be based in the capital Port Moresby. 'The player is safe when we have good rapport between our two police' forces, Marape told reporters. The prime ministers said in a joint statement the security agreement 'ensures consultation on security-related developments.' Albanese did not directly answer when asked by a reporter if the agreement would prevent Papua New Guinea from striking a security deal with China. 'Security in Pacific is primarily the responsibility of the Pacific family is a principle that we share,' Albanese said. Marape said the security pact with Australia was in his country’s interests. 'Australia is a security partner of choice in the first instance,' Marape said. 'That doesn’t stop us from relating with any nation, especially our Asian neighbors. We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner, a great bilateral partner, but on security, closer to home we have this synergy and our shared territory needs to be protected, defended, policed,' Marape added. Marape described the deal to create a Port Moresby-based football team as 'pivotal in ... anchoring' the Papua New Guinea-Australia relationship. 'At the heart of every foreign relationship lies people-to-people relations. Foreign relations minus people-to-people relations is completely in vain,' Marape said. The security pact signed by Albanese and Marape a year ago strengthened Australia’s place as the preferred security partner. It was signed six months later than initially planned. The original June 2023, date was abandoned after a security deal struck between the United States and Marape’s government sparked protests in the South Pacific nation a month earlier over concerns that it undermined Papua New Guinea’s sovereignty. Australia agreed to support Papua New Guinea’s internal security in areas of policing, courts and prisons. Australia has also helped Papua New Guinea build a new police training center in the Port Moresby that will be open to recruits from other Pacific nations.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-papua-new-guinea-china-rugby-league-37f7e5f4203bc05cbe5485e20d66f4a6	2024-12-11T17:34:58-08:00	
South Korea's Yoon defends martial law as an act of governance and vows to 'fight to the end'	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol defended his martial law decree as an act of governance and denied rebellion charges, vowing Thursday to 'fight to the end' in the face of attempts to impeach him and intensifying investigations into last week’s dramatic move. He spoke hours before the main opposition Democratic Party submits a new impeachment motion against him for a floor vote this weekend. Parliament on Thursday afternoon passed motions to impeach national police chief Cho Ji Ho and Justice Minister Park Sung Jae, suspending them from official duties, over their enforcement of martial law. Yoon’s Dec. 3 martial law declaration has generated political chaos and large protests calling for his ouster. The decree brought hundreds of armed troops attempting to encircle parliament and raid the election commission, though no major violence or injuries occurred. Martial law lasted only six hours as Yoon was forced to lift it after the National Assembly unanimously voted it down. Yoon, a conservative, said he enacted martial law as a warning to the liberal Democratic Party, which controls parliament. He called the party 'a monster' and 'anti-state forces' that he said tried to use its legislative muscle to impeach top officials, undermined the government’s budget bill for next year and sympathized with North Korea. 'I will fight to the end to prevent the forces and criminal groups that have been responsible for paralyzing the country’s government and disrupting the nation’s constitutional order from threatening the future of the Republic of Korea,' Yoon said. 'The opposition is now doing a sword dance of chaos, claiming that the declaration of martial law constitutes to an act of rebellion. But was it really?' he said. Yoon said martial law was an act of governance that cannot be the subject of investigations and doesn’t amount to rebellion. He said the deployment of nearly 300 soldiers to the National Assembly was designed to maintain order, not dissolve or paralyze it. The Democratic Party quickly dismissed Yoon’s statement as 'an expression of extreme delusion' and 'a declaration of war against the people.' Kim Min-seok, head of a party task force, accused the president of attempting to incite pro-Yoon riots by far-right forces. He said the Democratic Party will focus on getting the motion impeaching Yoon passed on Saturday. It's unclear how Yoon's comments will affect his fate. Opposition parties hold 192 seats combined, eight votes short of a two-thirds majority of the 300 members of the National Assembly. The earlier attempt to impeach Yoon failed with most lawmakers from Yoon’s governing People Power Party boycotting the vote. Yoon's speech was expected to deepen a divide inside the PPP. When party chair Han Dong-hun, a critic of Yoon, called Yoon's statement 'a confession of rebellion' during a party meeting, Yoon loyalists angrily jeered and called on Han to stop speaking. Han has urged party members to vote in favor of Yoon's impeachment. Opposition parties and even some PPP members say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. South Korean law allows the president to declare martial law during wartime or similar emergencies, and they said such a situation did not exist. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the constitution doesn’t give a president such rights in any situation. The country's law enforcement authorities are investigating whether Yoon and others involved in imposing martial law committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes. A conviction for rebellion carries a maximum penalty of death. The National Assembly on Thursday passed a bill that could introduce an independent counsel to investigate Yoon on rebellion charges without his approval. A bill it endorsed earlier this week on appointing an independent counsel requires Yoon's approval. The Justice Ministry on Monday placed an oversea travel ban on Yoon. South Korean law gives a president immunity from prosecution while in office, except for allegations of rebellion or treason. This means that Yoon can be questioned and detained by investigative agencies over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. On Wednesday, Yoon’s presidential security service didn't allow police to search the presidential office. Yoon's statement was seen as an about-face. Last Saturday, he apologized over declaring martial law and said he wouldn't avoid responsibility for it. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the political turmoil, 'including matters related to my term in office.' On Wednesday, Yoon's former defense minister, Kim Yong Hyun, was arrested on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. The national police chief, Cho, and the head of Seoul's metropolitan police have been detained while their actions of sending police forces to the National Assembly are investigated as a criminal matter. Park, the impeached justice minister, has faced suspicions raised by the opposition that he was involved in the planning and execution of Yoon’s martial law decree. Park has denied the accusations. Kim, who resigned after martial law was lifted, is one of Yoon’s close associates. He has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. He tried to kill himself in detention, but correctional officers stopped him and he was in stable condition, according to the Justice Ministry. In his speech Thursday, Yoon said he had discussed imposing martial law only with Kim before he informed other top officials about it at a Cabinet meeting just before its declaration. On the night of Dec. 3, besides the National Assembly, Yoon and Kim sent troops to the National Election Commission. That raised speculation that he might have tried to seize computer servers at the commission as he believed unfounded rumors that the results of April's parliamentary elections, in which his party suffered steep losses, were rigged. Yoon said he asked Kim to examine the supposed vulnerabilities of the commission's computer systems, which Yoon said was hampering the credibility of election results. He accused the commission of resisting a thorough inspection by Seoul’s spy agency following a cyberattack attributed to North Korea-backed hackers last year. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to remove him from office or restore his powers. If he is dismissed, a new presidential election would be required within 60 days.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-76af91dfc6a252a536ee1d80c0bdfccd	2024-12-11T16:01:49-08:00	
Slovakia's parliament passes legislation that could ban doctors from protesting low pay	BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) — Slovakia’s parliament on Wednesday approved legislation drafted by the government of populist Prime Minister Robert Fico that could effectively ban doctors from protesting against low pay and force them to continue working. Lawmakers in the 150-seat National Council voted 74-70 in favor of the law, which came in response to a mass resignation threat by more than 3,000 doctors from the nation's hospitals, who said they would quit their jobs at the beginning of next year. The law gives the government the power to declare an emergency in the case health care might not be available. Doctors would be then obliged to work because their notices to leave the job would not be accepted. Refusal to do so could result in imprisonment. The measure is intended to prevent a collapse of the health care system. The emergency measures can last for up to 120 days. Health Minister Kamil Šaško said during the parliamentary debate that he hoped that 'he’ll never be forced to use the tool,' which is strongly opposed by the labor unions representing the doctors. The doctors protested that the government had not discussed with them the cuts to a 2022 plan aimed at increasing their salaries in the next two years. The cuts are part of austerity measures approved by the government to keep the ballooning budget deficit under control.	https://apnews.com/article/slovakia-health-care-hospital-doctors-protest-6c9b0add3a1a9699c1aa7f8b69f4df6c	2024-12-11T12:52:15-08:00	
UN General Assembly demands ceasefire in Gaza and backs UN agency helping Palestinian refugees	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban. The votes in the 193-nation world body were 158-9, with 13 abstentions to demand a ceasefire now and 159-9 with 11 abstentions in support of the agency known as UNRWA. The votes culminated two days of speeches overwhelmingly calling for an end to the 14-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group. Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions. While Security Council resolutions are legally binding, General Assembly resolutions are not, though they do reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly. The Palestinians and their supporters went to the General Assembly after the U.S. vetoed a Security Council resolution on Nov. 20 demanding an immediate Gaza ceasefire. It was supported by the council’s 14 other members but the U.S. objected that it was not linked to an immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas militants during their attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war. The language of the resolution adopted by the assembly is the same as the text of the vetoed resolution, demanding 'an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire to be respected by all parties,' while also reiterating a 'demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' The second resolution backs the mandate of UNRWA, which was established by the General Assembly in 1949. It deplores laws adopted by Israel’s parliament on Oct. 28 banning UNRWA’s activities in the Palestinian territories, a measure to take effect in 90 days. And it reiterates U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ statements that UNRWA is 'the backbone' of all humanitarian operations in Gaza and no organization can replace it. Israel alleges that around a dozen of UNRWA’s 13,000 workers in Gaza participated in Hamas’ attacks on Israel that precipitated the war. It recently provided the U.N. with over 100 names of UNRWA staff it accuses of having militant ties. The resolution adopted Wednesday calls on the Israeli government 'to abide by its international obligations, respect the privileges and immunities of UNRWA and uphold its responsibility to allow and facilitate full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance in all its forms into and throughout the entire Gaza Strip.' U.S. deputy U.N. ambassador Robert Wood reiterated America’s opposition to the ceasefire resolution ahead of Wednesday’s vote and criticized the Palestinians for again failing to mention Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. 'At a time when Hamas is feeling isolated due to the ceasefire in Lebanon, the draft resolution on a ceasefire in Gaza risks sending a dangerous message to Hamas that there’s no need to negotiate or release the hostages,' he said. The Hamas attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw another 250 abducted as hostages. Gaza militants have not returned around 100 hostages, a third of them believed to be dead, and ceasefire efforts have ground to a halt. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the local Health Ministry. It says women and children make up more than half the dead but does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Wood said the U.S. will continue to seek a diplomatic solution to the war and called UNRWA 'a critical lifeline to the Palestinian people.' But he said the UNRWA resolution has 'serious flaws' because it fails to create a path to restore trust between the U.N. agency and Israel — despite U.S. efforts and a U.S. proposal. Just before the vote, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon accused the resolutions’ supporters of complicity with Hamas, which he said has 'hopelessly infiltrated' UNRWA, and denounced their failure to link a ceasefire to the release of the hostages. 'By demanding a ceasefire today without addressing the hostages, this assembly will once again side with those who weaponize human suffering,' Danon said. 'It will send a message that the lives of innocent Israelis, including children, are not worth your consideration.' 'This is not diplomacy,' he stressed. 'It is appeasement. It is enabling terror and abandoning the innocent.' At the opening of the assembly debate last Wednesday, the Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour accused Israel of mass killings, displacements, destruction and starvation — 'a cruel war of atrocities against an entire civilian population.' Mansour said the only way to stop the atrocities, free the hostages, 'and to preserve the hope of a different future' is an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and support humanitarian efforts and prevent Israel’s attempt to eliminate UNRWA. Slovenia’s U.N. Ambassador Samuel Žbogar, reflecting the views of many speakers, pointed to the tens of thousands killed in Gaza. 'Gaza doesn’t exist anymore,' he told the assembly Wednesday. 'It is destroyed. Civilians are facing hunger, despair and death.'	https://apnews.com/article/un-gaza-unrwa-palestinians-israel-resolutions-vote-2df5701e79b9678104e60a99b17d2f7a	2024-12-11T11:32:15-08:00	
The Trump and Biden teams insist they're working hand in glove on foreign crises	WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump doesn't think much of Joe Biden's foreign policy record. The Republican president-elect frequently casts the outgoing Democratic president as a feckless leader who shredded American credibility around the world during his four-year term. But a funny thing happened on Trump's way back to the White House: The Biden and Trump national security teams have come to an understanding that they have no choice but to work together as conflicts in Gaza, Syria and Ukraine have left a significant swath of the world on a knife's edge. It's not clear how much common ground those teams have found as they navigate crises that threaten to cause more global upheaval as Trump prepares to settle back into the White House on Jan. 20, 2025. 'There is a deep conviction on the part of the incoming national security team that we are dealing with ... and on our part, directed from President Biden, that it is our job, on behalf of the American people, to make sure this is a smooth transition,' Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during a weekend appearance at a forum in California. 'And we are committed to discharging that duty as relentlessly and faithfully as we possibly can.' To be certain, Trump and his allies haven't let up on their criticism of Biden, putting the blame squarely on the shoulders of Biden and Democrats for the series of crises around the globe. The president-elect says Biden is responsible for the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, arguing that policies under his watch led to Hamas and Russia becoming emboldened. And shortly before Syria's Bashar al-Assad's government collapsed last week, Trump blamed Biden's old boss, former President Barack Obama, for failing to enforce his own 'red line' in 2013 after Assad deployed chemical weapons that killed hundreds of civilians, and laying the groundwork for Islamic militants to establish a beachhead in the country. But amid the hectoring of Biden, Trump team officials acknowledge that the Biden White House has worked diligently to keep Trump's circle apprised and help ensure there is a smooth handoff on national security matters. 'For our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity that they can play one administration off the other, they’re wrong, and we are — we are hand in glove,' Mike Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said in a Fox News interview last month. 'We are one team with the United States in this transition.' While Trump rarely has a good word for the Democratic administration, there's an appreciation in Trump world of how the Biden White House has gone about sharing critical national security information, according to a Trump transition official who was not authorized to comment publicly. The coordination is precisely how lawmakers intended for incoming and outgoing administrations to conduct themselves during a handover when they bolstered federal support for transitions. It's already the most substantive handoff process since 2009, aides to Biden and Trump acknowledged, surpassing Trump's chaotic first takeover in 2017 and his wide refusal to cooperate with the incoming Biden team in 2021. Trump's pick to serve as special envoy to the Middle East, Florida real estate developer Steve Witkoff, consulted with Biden administration officials as he recently traveled to Mideast to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive talks and spoke on condition of anonymity. Sullivan, who was to travel to Israel on Wednesday for talks with Netanyahu, has in turn kept Waltz in the loop about the Biden administration's efforts at getting a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza before Trump's inauguration. Biden administration officials say that the two national security teams have also closely coordinated on Ukraine and Syria, though they have provided scant detail on what that coordination has looked like. 'Let me put it this way: Nothing that we’re doing and nothing that we’re saying are coming as a surprise to the incoming team,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. 'They will decide for themselves what policies they might want to keep in place, what approaches they might want to continue and which ones they won’t.' Trump made clear during his campaign that he would move to end the war in Ukraine quickly once he came to office. He called on Russian leader Vladimir Putin earlier this week to act to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine. But the Biden White House has begun gently — and publicly — making the case for how continued support for Ukraine lines up with Trump's priorities. On Saturday, Sullivan pointed to comments made by Trump on social media to buttress the case that Biden’s push for continued support of Ukraine falls in line with the incoming president’s thinking. Trump earlier that day had noted that Assad’s rule was collapsing because Russia 'lost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine, where close to 600,000 Russian soldiers lay wounded or dead, in a war that should never have started, and could go on forever.' 'Russia and Iran are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success,' Trump said in the posting on Truth Social. Sullivan underscored that Biden and Trump are in agreement that there should be no American boots on the ground in Syria and that the war in Ukraine was a major factor in Assad’s fall. 'I was a little bit struck by it — earlier in the post, he said part of the reason this is happening is because of Russia’s war against Ukraine,' Sullivan said of Trump. 'And I think he even referenced the sheer scale of the casualties that Russia has suffered in Ukraine, and for that reason, they’re not in a position to defend their client, Assad. And on that point, we’re in vigorous agreement.' Two days later in Washington, Sullivan made the case that Trump should bolster the little-known U.S. International Development Finance Corporation that was created during the Republican’s first term. The push for reauthorizing the foreign aid agency comes as Trump has promised to make massive cuts to the federal bureaucracy. Trump signed into law the agency's authority -- tucked into a five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration — to provide $60 billion in loans, loan guarantees and insurance to companies in developing nations. Sullivan called the agency an effective tool for private-public partnerships, before allowing that 'maybe I shouldn’t be the one' making the case 'since I’m leaving, but I will give my advice anyway.' 'It was created as we’ve all noted, under the Trump administration,' Sullivan said in remarks at the agency’s annual conference. 'It has been strengthened under the Biden administration. And as we look to DFC reauthorization next year, it has to remain a bipartisan priority.' After Assad's government fell, the Biden administration issued a warning to Iran not to speed up its nuclear program after one of its closest allies was toppled, declaring 'that’ll never happen on our watch.' The U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, hinted at coordination on the matter with the Trump team. The official said there had been 'good discussions' with the incoming administration on the matter and there was an expectation the same policy would carry over. Biden has also approved a new national security memorandum that is meant to serve as a road map for the incoming Trump administration as it looks to counter growing cooperation between China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House announced Wednesday. Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it will go about dealing with the tightening relationships between the United States’ most prominent adversaries and competitors, according to two other senior administration officials. One of those officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, sought to assure the incoming Trump team that the Biden White House effort 'isn't trying to box them in or tilt them toward one policy option or another.' Instead, the official said, it's about helping the next administration build 'capacity' as it shapes its policies on some the most difficult foreign policies it will face.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-foreign-policy-ukraine-syria-mideast-d9bdefb745fc3a54b9f32e8e690bf04c	2024-12-11T09:22:44-08:00	
Vatican's keffiyeh Nativity scene raises eyebrows and then disappears — at least until Christmas Eve	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis presided over his weekly general audience Wednesday alongside a Palestinian-crafted Nativity scene that was missing its eyebrow-raising signature element: a keffiyeh-draped manger holding the infant Jesus. The wooden Nativity scene in the Vatican’s main audience hall had generated headlines when it was unveiled Dec. 7 because of the presence of the keffiyeh, the black-and-white checkered headscarf that has become a potent symbol of the Palestinian cause. Pope Francis had prayed before the creche briefly that day when he greeted the artists and donors responsible for all the Vatican’s Christmas decorations this year, which include various depictions of the manger in a Bethlehem stable where Jesus is said to have been born. This year, the Nativity scenes were made by Bethlehem-based artisans. Representatives of the Palestinian Embassy to the Holy See, as well as special representatives of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, had been on hand at the Vatican that day for the unveiling. By Wednesday, when Francis was seen again in the audience hall, the keffiyeh, manger and infant Jesus had been removed from the Nativity scene, while the figures of parents Mary and Joseph remained. While it is tradition in the Vatican for the infant Jesus to only be placed in the manger on Dec. 24, when Catholics celebrate the birth of Jesus, often the mangers remain in the scenes empty until that date. The Christ figure had apparently been placed in the manger on Dec. 7 to show off the finished product while the donors, artisans and pope were there to see it. A Palestinian official said the Vatican had removed the keffiyeh without explanation, and it was unclear whether it would be restored on Dec. 24. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA, in its report on the unveiling, noted the significance of the Jesus figure being wrapped in a keffiyeh. During the encounter with the Christmas donors, Francis again referred to the 'martyred Palestine' and, noting the broader conflict, repeated his call for an end to war. The Holy Land, including Bethlehem, is home to a small Christian community. 'Let us remember the brothers and sisters who, instead, right there and in other parts of the world, are suffering from the tragedy of war,' he said. 'With tears in our eyes, let us raise our prayer for peace. Brothers and sisters, enough war, enough violence!' Francis has called for Hamas to release hostages taken from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but he has long been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. He recently caused an uproar when he called for an investigation to determine if Israel's attacks in Gaza constituted genocide. Two Palestinian children presented the pope with a 'Bethlehem Star' award, which WAFA said was a 'powerful reminder of the suffering and sorrow endured by Palestinian children amid the ongoing Israeli war and blockade in Gaza.' The Israeli Embassy to the Holy See declined to comment on whether it had complained about the keffiyeh creche or asked for it to be removed. Vatican officials merely recalled Vatican tradition that calls for the infant Jesus to only appear in the manger on Christmas Eve. PLO executive committee member Ramzi Khoury who attended the unveiling, expressed deep gratitude for what he said was the pope’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and his tireless efforts to end the war on Gaza and promote justice, WAFA said. Coincidentally, Francis on Thursday is due to meet Abbas, the Palestinian president, at the Vatican. ___ Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Ontario premier says US energy exports will be cut off if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs on Canada	TORONTO (AP) — The premier of Canada's most populous province said Wednesday he will cut off energy to the United States if President-elect Donald Trump imposes sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products. Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. 'We're going to put our list together, and I'm sure the other provinces will as well. But we will go to the full extent, depending on how far this goes. We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy,' Ontario Premier Doug Ford said after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other provincial premiers. Ford said he didn't want this to happen but wasn't optimistic Canada could avoid tariffs. 'This fight is 100% coming on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21,' he said, referencing to the date of Trump’s inauguration. 'We will use every tool in our tool box to fight back. We can’t sit back and roll over. We just won’t as a country. And isn’t this a shame, our closest friends and allies.' About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. It wasn't immediately clear if Ford was talking about all Canadian provinces cutting off energy exports to the U.S. or just his province. But a spokeswoman for Ford, Grace Lee, said it was raised in the call between Trudeau and the provincial premiers. 'Premier Ford can only speak on behalf of Ontario, but its an area of provincial jurisdiction that we would certainly look at,' Lee said in an email. Lee noted Ontario powered 1.5 million homes in the U.S. in 2023 and is a major exporter of electricity to Michigan, Minnesota and New York. Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the threat. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing for national security. 'Canada, of course, will respond to unjustified tariffs,' Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said after the meeting. Freeland said a number of provincial premiers voiced support for a robust response to the tariffs and said that included critical minerals that are exported to the U.S. She didn't specifically mention oil but said 'obviously other ideas were discussed as well' when asked if Canada is considering cutting off oil exports to America. About a third of Canada's trade to the U.S. is energy. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US $2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Canada has promised more border security spending to address Trump's concerns. Ford said that will include more border and police officers as well as drones and sniffer dogs. 'A priority will be to share details of this plan with the incoming Trump administration and with Canadians in the coming days,' Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said. Trudeau said this week tariffs would be 'absolutely devastating' for the Canadian economy, but it would also mean real hardship for Americans. Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods. The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington-based trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate. Canada imposed duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canada’s central bank, meanwhile, lowered its key interest rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday and called Trump’s threat to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada 'a major source of new uncertainty.' 'We did underline that the threat of new tariffs on Canadian exports, particularly at the level suggested, that is a major source of new uncertainty,' Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem said at a press conference. 'But the reality is we don't know if those tariffs are going to be implemented. 'We don't know if exemptions are going to be agreed on some parts, we don't know at what level, we don't know if Canada will take retaliatory measures.' Trudeau, meanwhile, got the attention of billionaire Elon Musk, a big supporter of Trump, with comments he made Tuesday lamenting that U.S. voters selected Trump over Kamala Harris as president. 'We were supposed to be on a steady if difficult sometimes march toward progress. And yet, just a few weeks ago, the United States voted for a second time to not elect its first woman president,' Trudeau said at a event sponsored by Equal Voice, an organization dedicated to improving gender representation in Canadian politics. 'Everywhere, women’s rights and women’s progress is under attack — overtly and subtly.' Musk called Trudeau 'insufferable' in a post on X. 'Won't be in power for much longer,' he wrote. Ford also criticized Trudeau for the remarks. 'They are not helpful at all. It was brought up a couple of times in our meeting,' Ford said. 'Donald Trump was elected democratically. If you like him or you don’t like him that’s not our issue. We elect Canadians and it was not helpful whatsoever. I’m sure the prime minister got the message loud and clear.'	https://apnews.com/article/canada-interest-rate-cut-trump-tariffs-c0ef920ffb02ea0531c93516abad64e0	2024-12-11T09:15:38-08:00	
Syrians flock to morgues looking for loved ones who perished in Assad's prisons	DAMASCUS (AP) — Mohammad Chaeeb spoke softly into his phone, telling a relative the grim news: He found his brother at the morgue. 'I saw him and said my goodbyes,' he said. His gaze lingered on the blackened body of Sami Chaeeb, whose teeth were bared and whose eye sockets were empty. It looked as if he had died screaming. 'He doesn’t look normal. He doesn’t even have eyes.' The dead man was jailed five months ago, disappearing into a dark prison system under the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. His body is just one of many found in Syrian detention centers and prisons since Assad's government fell last weekend. Some of the prisoners died just weeks ago. Others perished months earlier. Syrians across the world are now circulating images of the bodies in hope of seeing slain loved ones whose fate had been a mystery. At the morgue visited by The Associated Press on Wednesday in Damascus, families flocked to a wall where some of the pictures were pinned in a haunting gallery of the dead. Relatives desperately scanned the images for a recognizable face. Mohammad Chaeeb never knew why his brother had been imprisoned. 'We heard stories — cannabis, organ trafficking, drugs, weapon trading. But he had nothing to do with any of that,' he said. He rushed to the morgue after another brother living in Turkey sent him a photo of a body that looked familiar. He was able to identify his brother by a mole under his ear and a half-amputated finger, an injury from when he was 12. Standing over the body, he lifted the drape and gently pulled out his brother’s left hand, examining it closely. 'Here,' he said, pointing to the stump. Nearby, forensic workers worked rapidly to identify the bodies and hand them over to relatives. Yasser Qasser, a forensic assistant at the morgue, said they received 40 bodies that morning from the hospital that were being fingerprinted and having DNA samples taken. The staff had already identified about eight, he said. 'But dozens of families are arriving, and the numbers don’t match.' Some bodies came from the notorious Saydnaya Prison, still dressed in prisoner uniforms, Qasser said. His colleague, Dr. Abdallah Youssef, said identifying all of them would take time. 'We understand the suffering of the families, but we are working under immense pressure. The bodies were found in salt rooms, exposed to extreme cold,' he said. Morgue officials who examined the corpses have seen bullet wounds and marks that appeared to be the result of torture, he added. An estimated 150,000 people have been detained or reported missing in Syria since 2011. Under Assad’s rule, any whiff of dissent could send someone to prison immediately. For years, it was a sentence akin to death, as few ever emerged from the system. Citing testimony from freed prisoners and prison officials, Amnesty International has reported that thousands of Syrians were killed in frequent mass executions. Prisoners were subjected to constant torture, intense beatings and rape. Inmates frequently died from injuries, disease or starvation. Some fell into psychosis and starved themselves, the human rights group said. Among the bodies at the morgue Wednesday was Mazen al-Hamada, a Syrian activist who fled to Europe but returned to Syria in 2020 and was imprisoned upon arrival. His mangled corpse was found wrapped in a bloody sheet in Saydnaya. As they searched the morgue, some families moved among the bodies, weeping quietly and pausing to look for familiar features. The bodies lay covered in white shrouds, each marked with a number and some bearing the label 'unknown.' Hilala Meryeh, a 64-year-old Palestinian mother of four, stood in the dingy identification room, bags of bodies all around her. She had just found one of her sons. She paused, screwed her eyes closed and turned her face toward the ceiling, murmuring a prayer. Her four boys were arrested by the former Syrian regime in 2013 during a crackdown on the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk. She still needed to find three. 'I don’t know where they are,' she said. 'Give me my children, search for my children!' 'Why did he do this to his people?' Meryeh cried out. 'Imprison them, we wouldn’t have objected. Try them, but to slaughter them?' Other Syrians, like Imad Habbal, stood motionless in the morgue, coming to grips with the reality and injustice of their loss. Habbal gazed at the body of his brother, Diaa Habbal. 'We came yesterday, and we found him dead,' he said. 'They killed him. Why? What was his crime? What did he ever do to them? Just because he came back to his country?' Diaa Habbal, a Syrian who had been living in Saudi Arabia since 2003, returned to Damascus in mid-2024 to visit his family, his brother said. He was arrested by the Syrian military police six months ago on charges of evading military service.

America's closest ally in Syria is losing ground as a new order takes shape	The jihadi rebels who toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad say they want to build a unified, inclusive country. But after nearly 14 years of civil war, putting that ideal into practice will not be easy. For Syria’s Kurdish minority, America’s closest ally in the country, the struggle for a new order is entering a potentially even more challenging phase. Over the course of Syria’s civil war, Kurdish fighters have fended off an array of armed factions, partnered with the U.S. to rout the Islamic State group and carved out a largely autonomous region in the country’s oil-rich east. But the gains of the non-Arab Kurds are now at risk. The ascendance of the Sunni Arab rebels who overthrew Assad — with vital help from Turkey, a longtime foe of the Kurds — will make it hard for the Kurds to find a place in the new Syria and could prolong the conflict. The jihadi rebels who rode into Damascus over the weekend have made peaceful overtures to the Kurds. But the rebels violently drove Kurdish fighters out of the eastern city of Deir al-Zour days after government forces abandoned it. To the north, a separate opposition faction backed by Turkey that has been battling the Kurds for years seized the town of Manbij. And Turkey carried out airstrikes on a Kurdish convoy it said was carrying heavy weapons looted from government arsenals. The Kurds have long counted on U.S. aid in the face of such challenges. Around 900 American troops are in eastern Syria, where they partner with Kurdish forces to prevent an Islamic State resurgence. But the future of that mission will be thrown into doubt under president-elect Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical about U.S. involvement in Syria. Here's a closer look at the predicament the Kurds find themselves in. Who are the U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters in Syria? The Kurds are among the largest stateless ethnic groups in the world, with some 30 million concentrated in a territory straddling Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. They are a minority in each country and have often suffered persecution, which has fueled armed Kurdish uprisings. In Syria, they carved out an autonomous enclave early in the civil war, never fully siding with the Assad government or the rebels seeking to topple him. When the Islamic State group seized a third of the country in 2014, Kurdish fighters — who are secular and include women in their ranks — proved their mettle in early battles against the extremists, earning support from the U.S.-led coalition. They formed a group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, which also includes Arab fighters, and drove the Islamic State group out of large areas of Syria with help from U.S.-led airstrikes and American special forces. In 2017, these Kurdish-led forces captured Raqqa, the capital of the extremists' self-styled caliphate. Why is Turkey fighting the Kurds? Turkey has long viewed the SDF as an extension of the decades-old Kurdish insurgency within its own borders. It considers the main Kurdish faction a terrorist group on par with the Islamic State and has said it should have no presence in the new Syria. In recent years, Turkey has trained and funded fighters known as the Syrian National Army, helping them wrest control of territory from the Kurds in northern Syria along the border with Turkey. These Turkish-backed fighters have portrayed themselves as part of the opposition against Assad, but analysts say they are largely driven by opportunism and hatred of the Kurds. The Kurds have focused on battling the SNA in recent years. But the new leadership in Damascus, which also has longstanding ties to Turkey, could open another, much longer front. How do the Syrian rebels view the Kurds? The main rebel faction is led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, a former al-Qaida militant who cut ties with the group eight years ago and says he wants to build a new Syria free of dictatorship that will serve all its religious and ethnic communities. Nawaf Khalil, head of the Germany-based Center for Kurdish Studies, said the early signs were positive. He said the rebels steered clear of two SDF-controlled enclaves of Aleppo when they stormed the city two weeks ago at the start of their rapid advance across the country. 'It is also positive that they did not speak negatively about the Syrian Democratic Forces,' he said. It remains to be seen if those sentiments will endure. After sweeping into Deir al-Zour this week, a fighter from al-Sharaa's group posted a video saying they would soon advance toward Raqqa and other areas of eastern Syria, raising the possibility of further clashes with the Kurds. The rebels could still seek some kind of agreement with the Kurds to incorporate them into the post-Assad political order, but that would likely require accepting a degree of Kurdish autonomy in the east. It would also risk angering Turkey, which now appears to be the chief power broker in Syria. Will the Trump administration support the Kurds? The top U.S. military commander for the Middle East, Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, met with SDF forces in Syria on Tuesday, in a sign of the Biden administration's commitment to the alliance post-Assad. But things could change on Jan. 20. Trump has provided few details about his Middle East policy, aside from saying he wants to end the region's wars and keep the United States out of them. In a social media post shortly before Assad was overthrown, Trump wrote that 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, &amp; THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT.' During his previous term, in 2019, Trump abandoned the Kurds ahead of a Turkish incursion, casting it as the fulfillment of a campaign promise to end U.S. involvement in the region's 'endless wars.' The move prompted heavy criticism, including from prominent Republicans who accused him of betraying an ally. Trump backtracked weeks later, approving a wider mission to secure oil fields in the east. The troops remained where they were and the alliance endured. ___ Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed. ___ Follow the AP's Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-war-assad-kurds-rebels-turkey-us-2b4af609c4dcf853ac6d7a22d3dccf5d	2024-12-11T07:50:01-08:00	
Brazil’s President Lula to undergo a new surgery after initial procedure for brain bleed	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will undergo another surgery, doctors at the Sirio-Libanes hospital where the leftist leader is being treated said Wednesday. The minimally invasive procedure that doctors will perform on Lula is called middle meningeal artery embolization and aims to stop persistent bleeding on the surface of the brain, according to the University of California San Francisco’s definition. On Tuesday, the 79-year-old leader underwent surgery for a brain bleed after suffering complications resulting from a fall at home in October. Doctors told journalists after the operation that Lula would remain in intensive care for 48 hours. But doctors on Wednesday said he would undergo another surgery on Thursday. Lula 'spent the day well,' doctors said in their updated statement. 'He underwent physiotherapy, walked and received visits from family members,' they added. Lula remains in intensive care. In an earlier statement on Wednesday, doctors said the Brazilian president was lucid and had his bearings, and that he remained hooked up to a surgical drain as he awaits further routine tests. After the first surgery, doctors had said that there would be no aftereffects and that Lula was expected to return to the capital, Brasilia, at the beginning of next week. Until then, they said, he would be unable to work. Doctors will hold a press conference at 10 a.m. local time on Thursday to provide further updates, they said. Lula canceled a trip to Russia for a BRICS summit after the accident, his office said at the time. It left him with a visible cut on the back of his head, slightly above his neck. Fagnislainny Fernandes, a 40-year-old visual artist, said she went to the hospital 'out of compassion' for Lula. 'This country, unfortunately, has a lot of misinformation and so I came personally to find out if this situation is really happening,' she said. ___ AP videojournalists Thiago Mostazo and Maycron Abade contributed to this report. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-health-surgery-5331cb91a03e0880c10dae81ed643cc6	2024-12-11T07:24:52-08:00	
Macron seeks political deal to name a new prime minister and restore France's stability	PARIS (AP) — French president Emmanuel Macron is seeking a political deal that would allow him to both name a new prime minister and 'guarantee the stability of the country,' following the resignation of ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier, a spokesperson for the outgoing government said Wednesday. Maud Bregeon, the spokesperson, said Macron insisted there was at the moment no 'broader' political alliance than the current one between his centrist allies and conservatives from The Republicans party, which does not have a majority at parliament. She was relaying comments made by Macron during a weekly Cabinet meeting. Last week, the French president vowed to stay in office until the end of his term, due in 2027. The move followed a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes in the National Assembly left France without a functioning government. Barnier’s government has been tasked with handling current affairs pending the appointment of a new prime minister. Two options are still being considered by Macron, Bregeon reported. The first one would be to find a way to 'broaden the alliance,' she said, implicitly suggesting some leftists could join the government in addition to centrists and conservatives. That could give the future government a majority in the assembly. The other option would be to make a deal with opposition parties on the left so that they commit not to vote any no-confidence motion -- even though they would not be governing parties, Bregeon said. Macron did not provided any firm deadline for naming a new prime minister, she said. Since last week, Macron has held talks with politicians from the left and the right, including Socialist leaders who now appear as key in efforts to form a more stable government. Discussions have not involved the far-right National Rally party led by Marine Le Pen nor the hard-left France Unbowed party of Jean-Luc Mélenchon since Macron said he would only speak with more moderate political forces. Le Pen, who helped ousting Barnier by supporting the no-confidence motion, demanded on Wednesday her party's proposals on preserving the purchasing power of the French to be taken into account by the future government. The next prime minister knows 'what needs to be done to work in decent conditions,' that is 'talk to all political forces and build a budget that doesn't cross the red lines of each party,' Le Pen said. She concluded: 'It's perfectly doable.' On Wednesday, the outgoing government unveiled a special bill meant to enable the state to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year’s rules, and avoid a shutdown. The bill, expected to be approved by parliament by the end of the year, is 'temporary,' outgoing budget minister Laurent Saint-Martin said. 'It aims to ensure ... the continuity of the nation’s life, the regular functioning of public services and the fulfillment of our financial commitments.' A proper budget law for year 2025 will then need to be presented by the new government and approved at parliament in the coming months, Saint-Martin said.	https://apnews.com/article/france-new-prime-minister-macron-barnier-lepen-26d09486d37c741a7c048f09e65f0ca3	2024-12-11T05:35:40-08:00	
North Macedonia court delays language law ruling amid ethnic tensions	SKOPJE. North Macedonia (AP) — North Macedonia’s Constitutional Court on Wednesday postponed a ruling on a controversial law concerning the use of minority languages, triggering a new round of ethnic tensions in the tiny Balkan country. The 2019 law made Albanian a second official language in areas with a significant population of ethnic Albanians. It faces multiple legal challenges regarding its constitutionality, some focused on specific articles and others concerning the entire law. Court officials said the delay will allow further deliberations and input from foreign experts and could take up to three months. Ethnic Albanians make up roughly a quarter of North Macedonia’s 2 million population, in a country slightly larger than the U.S. state of Vermont. Several hundred demonstrators joined a protest outside the court Wednesday organized by the DUI, an ethnic Albanian opposition party. The party warned that any rollback would destabilize the country’s fragile ethnic balance. North Macedonia’s multi-ethnic composition was formalized in the 2001 Ohrid Agreement, which ended a brief ethnic conflict and granted broader rights to ethnic Albanians. The DUI accuses the current conservative government of attempting to undermine those gains. 'Any attempt to repeal parts of the Law on the Use of Languages would be absolutely unacceptable for us,' a DUI statement said. 'Such actions would upend the balance between communities and damage the basic pillars of the Ohrid Agreement.' The law has drawn criticism from both domestic and international observers, including the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe’s advisory body on constitutional matters. In 2019, it noted ambiguities in the law, particularly in its application to judicial proceedings. Critics also argue that it fails to clarify whether certain provisions apply solely to Albanian or to other minority languages, such as Turkish, Roma, and Serbian. Bujar Osmani, the DUI party's deputy leader, said he was concerned by the absence of ethnic minority judges during Wednesday’s session. 'Such mono-ethnic meetings or sessions have always been a harbinger of bad times in multi-ethnic states,' Osmani said. 'This is not just a cause for the Albanian language, but for the protection of a multi-ethnic European Macedonia.' Both the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party and the opposition Social Democrats have condemned the politicization of the issue. Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski accused the DUI of exploiting ethnic tensions for political gain. 'They are again abusing Albanians, Macedonians, and others, harassing everyone with attempts to divide and attract attention,' Mickoski said.	https://apnews.com/article/north-macedonia-minorities-language-albanian-0280605e825d4805749446cb91364b40	2024-12-11T05:34:23-08:00	
Scholz sets Germany on course for an early election as he requests a confidence vote next week	BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Olaf Scholz formally set Germany on course for an early election Wednesday by requesting a confidence vote in parliament next week. Five weeks after his three-party governing coalition collapsed in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany's stagnant economy, Scholz's office said he had requested the confidence vote in parliament's lower house, or Bundestag, for Monday. The aim is to hold a parliamentary election on Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally scheduled. Scholz is expected to lose Monday's vote. His center-left Social Democrats hold 207 seats in the Bundestag and their remaining coalition partners, the environmentalist Greens, have 117. That leaves his government well short of a majority in the 733-seat chamber. The confidence vote is needed because Germany's post-World War II constitution doesn't allow parliament to dissolve itself. If Scholz loses the vote, it's up to President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve the Bundestag. He has 21 days to make that decision, and once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. Polls show Scholz's party trailing behind the main opposition center-right Union bloc of challenger Friedrich Merz. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, whose Greens are further behind, is also bidding for the top job. The far-right Alternative for Germany, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it. Germany hasn't had a confidence vote since 2005, when then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder called and lost one as he engineered an early election that was narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-confidence-vote-parliament-election-0320454ead6b883ce70fff78d09df38a	2024-12-11T04:43:11-08:00	
UK spy agency releases annual Christmas card puzzle to uncover future codebreakers	LONDON (AP) — What does a spy agency give for Christmas? How about a riddle wrapped in an enigma inside a mystery. GCHQ, Britain’s electronic and cyber-intelligence agency, on Wednesday published its annual Christmas Challenge – a seasonal greeting card that doubles as a set of fiendishly difficult puzzles designed to excite young minds about solving cyphers and unearthing clues. The challenge is aimed at young people aged 11 to 18, who are encouraged to work in teams and use 'lateral thinking, ingenuity and perseverance' to crack the seven brainteasers set by GCHQ’s 'in-house puzzlers.' The card is sent by the head of GCHQ — short for Government Communications Headquarters — to other national security chiefs around the world. Puzzles were first included in 2015 and have become an annual tradition. The card can be downloaded from the GCHQ website, and has become popular with teachers – the agency says a third of British secondary schools have downloaded it. The agency admits the festive fun has an ulterior motive. GCHQ Director Anne Keast-Butler said she hoped the card would inspire young people to explore STEM subjects – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – 'and to consider what a career in cybersecurity and intelligence might have to offer.' 'The Challenge has been designed for a mix of minds to solve, so is best tackled in groups of classmates, families or friends,' she said. 'Whether you have an analytical mind, a creative brain or prefer engineering, there’s something for everyone.' The card features a map of the U.K., linked to the locations where GCHQ has bases, including its high-tech headquarters in Cheltenham, western England, nicknamed the doughnut because of its shape. Many British people are keen puzzle-solvers, and the link between puzzlers and spycraft is often celebrated – notably in the many books, films and TV shows about Bletchley Park, a complex of buildings and wooden huts northwest of London where, during World War II, hundreds of mathematicians, cryptologists, crossword puzzle experts and computer pioneers worked to crack Nazi Germany’s secret codes. Historians say their work shortened World War II by as much as two years.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-gchq-spy-agency-christmas-card-puzzle-33ab57e85479141ae18fd8abdef2d00f	2024-12-11T04:35:16-08:00	
Father and stepmother of 10-year-old girl found dead in England are convicted of her murder	LONDON (AP) — The father and stepmother of a 10-year-old girl found dead in her home in England were found guilty Wednesday of her murder. Urfan Sharif, 42, was accused of Sara Sharif’s murder alongside his partner, 30-year-old Beinash Batool. His brother, 29-year-old Faisal Malik, was found guilty of causing or allowing the girl's death. Police found Sara’s body under a blanket in a bunk bed at her home in Woking, southwest of London, on Aug. 10, 2023, with dozens of injuries including extensive bruising, burns and fractures. A post-mortem examination concluded she died of unnatural causes. Prosecutors have said that all three defendants played a part in a 'campaign of abuse' against Sara in the weeks leading to her death. The three fled the U.K. for Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, on Aug. 9, the day after Sara was believed to have died. The discovery was made after Urfan Sharif called U.K. police from Pakistan to say he had 'legally punished her, and she died,' prosecutors said. He told the phone operator it wasn’t his intention to kill her but he had 'beat her up too much,' they said. Police in Pakistan found the three suspects after an extensive search and put them on a flight to the U.K. They were arrested upon arrival at London’s Gatwick Airport. Batool and Malik had declined to give evidence. They denied involvement in the abuse. Prosecutor William Emlyn Jones has said all three defendants lived in the same house as Sara and that it was 'inconceivable' that just one of them had acted alone. He alleged that each of the suspects sought to point the finger at the others. He said Sharif’s case was that Batool, Sara’s stepmother, was responsible for the girl’s death, and he made a false confession to protect her. He said that violence against Sara became so normalized that no one batted an eye when she appeared with bruises at a family barbeque. Yet Sara was feisty and dreamed of being a fairytale princess. Her spirit came across on a video taken just two days before her death showing her dancing at home, despite multiple broken bones and iron burns on her bottom. 'Seeing the footage of Sara laughing and joking even when she had signs of injuries to her body and knowing what a happy child she was at school, she loved singing and dancing, and knowing what happened to her, those are the most affecting parts of the case,' Libby Clark, a specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service said.	https://apnews.com/article/sara-sharif-uk-pakistan-murder-c01b9b8285966b26ffc4e6dbcfe1b146	2024-12-11T04:17:12-08:00	
Haiti's main international airport reopens one month after gang violence forced it to close	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Haiti’s main international airport reopened on Wednesday, one month after it closed for the second time this year because of gang violence. Haitian soldiers and police, bolstered by Kenyan police leading a U.N.-backed mission to quell gang violence, boosted security in the area, and a test flight was successful, Haiti’s government said in a statement. The Toussaint Louverture airport in Port-au-Prince closed in mid-November after gangs opened fire on a Spirit Airlines flight that was preparing to land, striking a flight attendant who suffered minor injuries. Other commercial planes were also hit that day, prompting Spirit, JetBlue and American Airlines to cancel their flights to Haiti. A day later, the Federal Aviation Administration banned U.S. airlines from flying to the Caribbean country for 30 days. It wasn’t immediately clear which flights would resume on Wednesday to Port-au-Prince. The FAA’s ban is in place until Thursday. Spokespeople for Spirit, JetBlue and American Airlines did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The Guy Malary terminal, which serves domestic flights, also reopened on Wednesday. For the past month, the only international airport operating in Haiti was the one in the northern coastal town of Cap-Haitien, but traveling there by land is dangerous since gangs control the main roads leading out of Port-au-Prince and are known for opening fire on public transport. The few who could afford to escape the surge of gang violence in the capital this past month paid thousands of dollars for private air transport to Cap-Haitien. The airport in Port-au-Prince closed for nearly three months earlier this year after gangs launched coordinated attacks on key government infrastructure starting in late February. Some 5,000 people have been reported killed in Haiti this year, including more than 100 in a recent massacre in a gang-controlled community in Port-au-Prince. ___ Associated Press writer Dánica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-international-airport-reopen-gang-violence-c3890d9c79df18745e748d8715efad00	2024-12-11T03:54:23-08:00	
TikTok files challenge against Canadian government order to dissolve its business in the country	TikTok has challenged a Canadian government order to shut down the Chinese video-sharing app's business operations in the country that was imposed over national security concerns. The company said Tuesday that it filed an application for a judicial review with the Federal Court in Vancouver on Dec. 5, which seeks to set aside the order for TikTok to wind-up and cease its business in Canada. The Canadian federal government last month announced it was ordering the dissolution of TikTok Technology Canada Inc. after a national security review of its Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. The government is not blocking access to the TikTok app, which will continue to be available to Canadians. TikTok said it has 14 million users in Canada, which is about a third of the population. It has offices in Toronto and Vancouver. The wildly popular platform is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020, but is under increasing pressure in the West. It's facing a possible ban in the U.S. and intensifying scrutiny in Europe over issues including election influence campaigns allegedly coordinated by Moscow. TikTok argues in its court application, which was posted online, that Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne's decision was 'unreasonable' and 'driven by improper purposes.' It says the order is 'grossly disproportionate' and the the national security review was 'procedurally unfair.' The review was carried out through the Investment Canada Act, which allows the government to investigate foreign investment with potential to harm national security. Champagne said in a statement at the time that the government was taking action to address 'specific national security risks,' but did not elaborate. His office said in response to the filling that the government’s decision was informed by a 'thorough national security review and advice from Canada’s security and intelligence community.' TikTok said Champagne 'failed to engage with TikTok Canada on the purported substance of the concerns' that led to the order. It argues the government ordered 'measures that bear no rational connection to the national security risks it identifies' and that the reasons for the order 'are unintelligible, fail to reveal a rational chain of analysis and are rife with logical fallacies.' The platform says there were 'less onerous' options than shutting down its Canadian business, which it said would eliminate hundreds of jobs, threaten business contracts and 'cause the destruction of significant economic opportunities.'	https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-canada-social-media-52e820e4e912ad031691c322fbb9b546	2024-12-11T03:30:02-08:00	
An explosion in the Afghan capital kills the Taliban refugee minister, officials say	ISLAMABAD (AP) — A suicide bombing in the Afghan capital on Wednesday killed the Taliban refugee minister and two others, Interior Ministry officials said. The explosion struck inside the ministry, killing Khalil Haqqani, the refugee minister, officials said. The officials provided no further details. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Khalil Haqqani is the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the acting interior minister who leads a powerful network within the Taliban. Haqqani was the most high-profile casualty of a bombing in Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power three years ago. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. In March 2023, a bomb killed a Taliban-appointed provincial governor, Daud Muzmal, and two others in Afghanistan’s Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of Balkh province. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the killing of Haqqani. Dar, who is also deputy prime minister, wrote on the X platform that he was 'deeply shocked' at the killing of Haqqani and 'loss of precious lives as a result of a terrorist attack' in Kabul. 'We offer our heartfelt condolences,' he said, adding, 'Pakistan unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.' Dar said Pakistan was in touch with Kabul to get further details. The Islamic State group’s affiliate, a major rival of the ruling Taliban, has carried out previous attacks across Afghanistan. In early September, a suicide bomber in the southwestern Qala Bakhtiar neighborhood in Kabul killed at least six people, wounding 13 others. IS had claimed responsibility for the attack.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-explosion-refugee-minister-taliban-6b7044402f0741916584fc40dfc6da6e	2024-12-11T02:40:08-08:00	
Romania's pro-Western parties agree to form a majority government after political turmoil	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania’s pro-European parties agreed Wednesday to form a majority government made up of groupings that were traditionally on opposite sides and shutting out far-right nationalists who made significant gains in the election on Dec. 1. Pro-Western parties won the most votes, with the leftist Social Democratic Party, or PSD, topping the polls. The PSD reached agreement late Tuesday to form a grand coalition with the center-right National Liberal Party, or PNL, the reformist Save Romania Union party, USR, and the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party. The parliamentary election came hard on the heels of a presidential vote in which the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu won the first round. His surprise success plunged the European Union and NATO member country into turmoil as allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference emerged. Days before the Dec. 8 presidential runoff, the Constitutional Court made the unprecedented move to annul the presidential race. A statement from the new coalition said the parties would potentially support a 'common pro-European candidate' in the new presidential elections. It isn’t yet clear whether Georgescu will be allowed to run in the new vote. President Klaus Iohannis, whose second term is set to expire later this month, said a new date for the rerun presidential election would be set once the new government has taken office. He signed a decree on Wednesday to convene parliament on Dec. 20. 'In the coming days, the four parties and the representatives of the national minorities will work on a joint governing program, focusing on development and reforms, while addressing the priorities of Romanian citizens,' the coalition statement said. Elena Lasconi, the leader of USR who was set to face Georgescu in the annulled presidential runoff, said after the agreement was reached that 'Romania is going through a very difficult' period and that cutting state spending and reducing bureaucracy would be part of the governing program. In 2021, despite historically being Romania’s two main opposition parties that have dominated post-communist politics, the PSD and the PNL formed an unlikely but increasingly strained coalition together with UDMR, which exited the Cabinet last year after a power-sharing dispute.	https://apnews.com/article/romania-government-parliament-georgescu-elections-europe-psd-d897d4c03825004637e340fb5205f96a	2024-12-11T02:04:00-08:00	
FIFA prepares to give Saudi Arabia its biggest sports win yet as host of the 2034 World Cup	ZURICH (AP) — Saudi Arabia will be confirmed by FIFA as host of the men's soccer 2034 World Cup on Wednesday, giving the oil-rich kingdom its biggest prize yet for massive spending on global sports driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The decision completes a mostly opaque 15-month bid process which FIFA president Gianni Infantino helped steer toward Saudi Arabia without a rival candidate, without taking questions, and which human rights groups warn will put the lives of migrant workers at risk. FIFA and Saudi officials say hosting the 2034 tournament can accelerate change, including more freedoms and rights for women. A fast-track path to victory was cleared last year by FIFA accepting a three-continent hosting plan for the 2030 World Cup led by Spain, Portugal and Morocco. That bid also will win Wednesday in a combined approval for the 2030 and 2034 tournament hosts by applause from more than 200 FIFA member federations in an online meeting hosted from Zurich by Infantino. It will kick off a decade of scrutiny on Saudi labor laws and treatment of workers mostly from South Asia needed to help build and upgrade 15 stadiums, plus hotels and transport networks ahead of the 104-game tournament. One of the stadiums is planned to be 350 meters (yards) above the ground in Neom — a futuristic city that does not yet exist — and another named for the crown prince is designed to be atop a 200-meter cliff near Riyadh. During the bid campaign, FIFA has accepted limited scrutiny of Saudi Arabia’s human rights record that was widely criticized this year at the United Nations. Saudi and international rights groups and activists warned FIFA it has not learned the lessons of Qatar’s much-criticized preparations to host the 2022 World Cup. The kingdom plans to spend tens of billion of dollars on projects related to the World Cup as part of the crown prince’s sweeping Vision 2030 project that aims to modernize Saudi society and economy. At its core is spending on sports by the $900 billion sovereign wealth operation, the Public Investment Fund, which he oversees. Critics have called it 'sportswashing' of the kingdom's reputation. The prince, known as MBS, has built close working ties to Infantino since 2017 — aligning with the organizer of sport’s most-watched event rather than directly confronting the established system as it did with the disruptive LIV Golf project. The result for Saudi Arabia and FIFA has been smooth progress toward the win Wednesday with limited pushback from soccer officials, though some from women international players. The steady flow of Saudi cash into international soccer is set to increase. FIFA created a new and higher World Cup sponsor category for state oil firm Aramco, and Saudi funding is set to underwrite the 2025 Club World Cup in the United States that is a pet project for Infantino. North American soccer body CONCACAF signed a multi-year deal with PIF, Saudi stadiums host Super Cup games for Italy and Spain, and nearly 50 FIFA member federations have signed working agreements with Saudi counterparts. Lavish spending by PIF-owned Saudi clubs in the past two years buying and paying players – including Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Karim Benzema and Sadio Mané – put hundreds of millions of dollars into European soccer. That influence could be key in talks to agree which months to play the 2034 World Cup. The November-December slot taken by Qatar in 2022 to avoid extreme midsummer heat is complicated in 2034 by the holy month of Ramadan through mid-December and Riyadh hosting the multi-sport Asian Games. Still, January 2034 could be an option — and likely better for European clubs and leagues —after the International Olympic Committee said it saw few issues in clashing with the Salt Lake Winter Games opening Feb. 10, 2034. The IOC also has a major commercial deal with Saudi Arabia, to host the new Esports Olympics. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/fifa-world-cup-2030-2034-saudi-arabia-spain-portugal-945f8d7bf332553de0726901d096b956	2024-12-11T01:55:57-08:00	
Biden approves national security memo on China, Iran, North Korea and Russia ahead of Trump's return	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has approved a new national security memorandum ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House that could serve as a road map for the incoming administration as it looks to counter growing cooperation among China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House said Wednesday. Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it deals with the tightening relationships involving America's most prominent adversaries and competitors, according to two senior administration officials. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the classified memorandum would not be made public because of the sensitivity of some of its findings. The document includes four broad recommendations: improving U.S. government interagency cooperation, speeding up the sharing of information with allies about the four adversaries, calibrating the U.S. government's use of sanctions and other economic tools for maximum effectiveness, and bolstering preparation to manage simultaneous crises involving the adversaries. The U.S. for many years has been concerned about cooperation among the four countries. Coordination has accelerated between the countries in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The officials noted that as Russia has become more isolated by much of the world, Moscow has turned to Iran for drones and missiles. From North Korea, the Russians have received artillery, missiles and even thousands of troops that have traveled to help the Russians try to repel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region. China, meanwhile, has supported Russia with dual use components that help keep its military industrial base afloat. In return, Russia has sent fighter jets to Iran and assisted Tehran as it looks to bolster its missile defense and space technology. North Korea has received from Russia much-needed fuel and funding to help build out its manufacturing and military capabilities. The officials added that Russia has 'de facto accepted North Korea as a nuclear weapon state.' China, meanwhile, is benefiting from Russian know-how, with the two countries working together to deepen their military technical cooperation. The two nations are also conducting joint patrols in the Arctic region. Biden and Trump have sharply different worldviews, but officials in both the incoming and outgoing administrations said they have sought to coordinate on national security issues during the transition. One of the officials said that the Biden White House memo 'isn’t trying to box (the Trump administration) in or tilt them toward one policy option or another.' The official said the document is intended to help the next administration build 'capacity' as it shapes its policies on some the most difficult foreign policies it will face.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-national-security-memorandum-6d3462b37533a2665d1e844ee6f7f662	2024-12-11T01:02:21-08:00	
2 Ukrainian women are pulled alive from rubble hours after Russian missile strike	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Rescue crews working through the night pulled two women from rubble more than seven hours after a Russian missile struck a private medical clinic in a southern Ukraine city, killing eight people and wounding 22 others, authorities said Wednesday. The women called rescue services on their cellphones to say they were buried under the rubble after the attack late Tuesday in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine’s Emergency Services said. Deadly Russian strikes on civilian areas have been a feature of the almost three-year war. Ukraine’s Western allies are sending more aid to help it keep fighting Russia’s invasion, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Zaporizhzhia strike showed that his country still needs more air defense systems. He urged Western partners to send weaponry they are holding in their arsenals. 'We currently do not have enough systems to protect our country from Russian missiles. But partners have these systems,' Zelenskyy said late Tuesday in his daily address to the nation. Air defense systems that Ukraine’s allies possess 'should save lives, and not gather dust in storage bases,' he said. Meanwhile, Ukraine kept up its long-range attacks on areas behind Russian lines that are supporting its war effort. A Ukrainian drone attack caused a blaze at an industrial facility in Russia’s Bryansk region, Gov. Alexander Bogomaz said. Air defenses downed 14 Ukrainian drones over the Bryansk region early Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Also, a Ukrainian missile attack on the city of Taganrog in the Rostov region early Wednesday damaged an industrial plant, regional Gov. Yuri Slusar said. Zelenskyy thanked Ukrainian forces for hitting what he called 'military facilities on the territory of Russia, as well as facilities of the fuel and energy complex.' 'It is precisely such long range and accuracy that step-by-step bring Russia back to reality — to the reality that the war must be ended,' he said on Telegram. It wasn't possible to verify either side's claims. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-missile-strike-zaporizhzhia-ba02d01051b57d10a6fdfa9b54e1be89	2024-12-11T00:45:08-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strike on home in northern Gaza kills 19 people, Palestinian medics say	An Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 19, Palestinian medical officials said Wednesday, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed back to the region reeling from the weekend ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Kamal Adwan Hospital said it received the bodies after the overnight strike in the town of Beit Lahiya. Hospital records show that a family of eight were among those killed, including four children, their parents and two grandparents. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has waged a renewed offensive against Hamas militants in northern Gaza since early October. Another strike in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least seven people, according to al-Awda Hospital. Records show the dead included two children, their parents and three relatives. Blinken is returning to the Middle East this week on his 12th visit since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last year but his first since Assad's ouster. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people, including children and older adults. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health officials. They say women and children make up more than half the dead but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians in their count. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the latest: Germany says it's looking for ways to work with Syria's new rulers BERLIN — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Wednesday addressed Berlin's reservations but also willingness to work the Syrian militant group in control of Damascus, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. 'Nobody overlooks the origins of HTS in the al-Qaeda ideology. It is therefore clear that we will measure HTS by its actions,' Baerbock told reporters in Berlin. 'Any cooperation presupposes that ethnic and religious minorities are protected, women’s rights are respected and acts of revenge are prevented.' She said that 'whether we like it or not, the HTS militia ... is one of the decisive actors for the future of Syria.' 'Together with our partners, we are therefore looking for an adequate way of dealing with HTS, with whom many have had no direct contact for good reasons,' she added. Ahmad al-Sharaa, the insurgent leader also known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has renounced longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicted himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon kills 1, state news agency says BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike near the southern Lebanese town of Bin Jbeil killed one person and wounded another, the state news agency reported. National News Agency said Wednesday’s airstrike hit a home. It gave no further details and there was no immediate comment from Israeli military. More than a dozen people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes since a ceasefire went into effect on Nov. 27, ending the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war. Blinken is returning to the Middle East WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is returning to the Middle East this week on his 12th visit since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last year but his first since the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Assad's departure has sparked new fears of instability in the region now wracked by three conflicts despite a ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. Blinken will travel to Jordan and Turkey on Thursday and Friday for talks expected to focus largely on Syria but also touch on long-elusive hopes for a deal to end the fighting in Gaza that has devastated the territory since October 2023. The State Department said Blinken would meet Jordanian officials, including King Abdullah II, in the port of Aqaba on Thursday before flying to Ankara for meetings with Turkish officials Friday. Other stops in the region are also possible, officials said. Blinken 'will reiterate the United States’ support for an inclusive, Syrian-led transition to an accountable and representative government,' department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. Insurgents set fire to Hafez Assad's tomb, a war monitor says BEIRUT — Insurgents have set on fire the tomb of Syria’s former President Hafez Assad in his hometown in the northwest, a war monitor and a local journalist said Wednesday. Hafez Assad had ruled Syria for 30 years until his death in 2000, when his son, Bashar, succeeded him. Both ruled Syria with an iron fist and were blamed for crackdowns that left tens of thousands dead, mainly in the central city of Hama in 1982, and in much of the country since the civil war in 2011. Bashar Assad was ousted over the weekend and fled to Russia where he was given political asylum. Rami Abdurrahman of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Syrian journalist Qusay Noor told The Associated Press that the tomb was set on fire Wednesday in the town of Qardaha in Latakia province. UN appeals for $4 billion for humanitarian operations in Palestinian territories JERUSALEM — The United Nations is asking donors for over $4 billion to fund humanitarian operations in the Palestinian territories, most of it earmarked for war-ravaged Gaza. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs also called for the 'lifting all impediments to the entry of aid' in its appeal issued Wednesday. U.N. agencies say aid operations in Gaza are hindered by Israeli restrictions and the breakdown of law and order. Israel says it allows enough aid to enter and blames the U.N. for not distributing it within the territory. The appeal for 2025 includes $3.6 billion for Gaza and about $450 million for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel’s offensive, launched after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, has destroyed vast areas of the besieged territory and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million. Many have been displaced multiple times and are now crammed into squalid tent camps with little in the way of food or other essentials. Most of the population relies on international aid. Paraguay's president addresses the Knesset ahead of embassy reopening in Jerusalem JERUSALEM — The president of Paraguay addressed the Israeli parliament Wednesday ahead of the reopening of the country’s embassy in Jerusalem. The decision to reopen the embassy in Jerusalem and recognize the city as the capital of Israel is a diplomatic win for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and puts Paraguay in a small group of countries that have taken the move. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in 1967 but it wasn't recognized by the international community, and most countries run their embassies out of Tel Aviv. 'Without Jerusalem, the land of Israel is a body without a soul,' President Santiago Peña said in a speech to the Knesset. 'So I say here today that without an embassy in Jerusalem, diplomatic relations with Israel do not have a real heart.' He said he hoped the move would inspire other countries to do the same. The embassy is set to open Thursday. Pena’s move was welcomed by Netanyahu, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, along with other Israeli leaders. 'Tomorrow we will inaugurate together the embassy of Paraguay in our eternal capital, and that will happen not for the first time, but for the second time,' Netanyahu said. Paraguay had an embassy in Jerusalem in 2018, under Former President Horacio Cartes. That embassy was moved back to Tel Aviv by Cartes’ successor, Mario Abdo Benitez, prompting Israel to close its embassy in Asuncion. Israel reopened its embassy in September. Russia says it's in touch with new authorities in Syria MOSCOW — Russia said Wednesday it has maintained contacts with the new authorities in Syria. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that 'we are monitoring most closely what is happening in Syria.' 'We, of course, maintain contacts with those who are currently controlling the situation in Syria,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. 'This is necessary because our bases are located there, our diplomatic mission is located there and, of course, the issue related to ensuring the security of these facilities is extremely important and of primary significance.' Peskov wouldn’t give details of those contacts, saying only that Russia has contacted 'those who are controlling the situation on the ground.' He wouldn’t give the number of Russian troops in Syria. Asked to comment about Israel’s seizure of a buffer zone on the border with Syria, Peskov called them destabilizing. 'The strikes and actions in the Golan Heights area, in the buffer zone area, are unlikely to help stabilize the situation in an already destabilized Syria,' he said. Russia has granted political asylum to ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad and his family after they fled rebels who seized Damascus over the weekend. Iran's supreme leader says fall of Syrian government was part of joint plan by US and Israel TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says the recent events in Syria, including the fall of its government, were part of a joint plan by the United States and Israel. 'There should be no doubt that what has happened in Syria is the result of a joint American and Zionist plan,' Khamenei said in a speech in Tehran on Wednesday that was broadcast on state TV. 'We have evidence, and this evidence leaves no room for doubt.' The Supreme leader added: 'A neighboring state of Syria has played a clear role in this matter, and it continues to do so. Everyone can see this.' Khamenei also rejected speculation by analysts who have said that Iran will be weakened by the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government. 'Those ignorant analysts are unaware of the meaning of resistance. They think that if resistance weakens, Islamic Iran will also weaken. But I say, with the help and power of God — by the will of Almighty Allah — Iran is powerful and it will become even more powerful,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-11-december-2024-90f14a411f4e58cdf773b85ee75e8b4d	2024-12-10T22:10:07-08:00

Taiwan demands that China end its military activity in nearby waters	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan demanded Wednesday that China end its ongoing military activity in nearby waters, which it said is unilaterally undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and disrupting international shipping and trade. The Foreign Ministry, in a statement posted on its website, said it was responding in part to the activities of a 'large number' of Chinese naval and coast guard ships in the first-island chain, the Pacific archipelago off the Asian continental mainland that includes Japan, Taiwan and part of the Philippines. 'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs solemnly demands that the Beijing authorities immediately stop military intimidation and all irrational activities that endanger regional peace and stability,' the statement said. Taiwan defense officials say they have detected Chinese ship s since Monday, both off Taiwan and farther out along the first-island chain. They described the formations as two walls designed to demonstrate that the waters belong to China. China restricted airspace off its southeast coast from Monday to Wednesday, an indication that it was planning to hold drills, but the country's People's Liberation Army has not confirmed whether it is doing so. Taiwan has been expecting drills following stops by its president, Lai Ching-te, in Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam during an overseas trip last week. China claims self-governing Taiwan as its territory and opposes any official contact with America and other foreign governments. A Chinese spokesperson didn't comment directly on any military exercises but said in a statement posted online Wednesday that the government would not let provocations by Taiwan in collusion with external forces go unchecked. 'We will take necessary measures to resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and safeguard the fundamental interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,' said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the government's Taiwan Affairs Office. The Taiwan Strait is a 160-kilometer- (100-mile-) wide body of water between China and the island of Taiwan. China's military held major exercises around Taiwan following both Lai's inauguration in May and his national day speech in October. It also held a major drill after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-military-drills-b48c59b819f2d32e3a6d9b9635c7aa53	2024-12-10T21:36:12-08:00	
A Lebanese man who spent 32 years in Syrian prisons is welcomed home	CHEKKA, Lebanon (AP) — Suheil Hamwi spent 32 years in a Syrian prison, and now, after an offensive by insurgents that toppled the government of Bashar Assad, he's finally returned to his home in Lebanon. In 1992, Hamwi worked as a merchant, selling various goods in the town of Chekka in northern Lebanon. On the night of Eid il-Burbara, or Saint Barbara’s Day — a holiday similar to Halloween — a man came to his door to buy some whiskey. Hamwi said he handed his 10-month-old son, George, to his wife and went to his car to fetch the whiskey and make the sale. As Hamwi approached his vehicle, a car filled with men pulled up, he said, forcing him inside and taking him away. It would be years before his family heard from him again. Hamwi was one of hundreds of Lebanese citizens detained during Syria’s occupation of Lebanon from 1976 to 2005 and believed to be held in Syrian prisons for decades. On Sunday, freedom came to him and others unexpectedly — prisoners who'd heard rumors about Syria’s opposition forces and their sweeping campaign found that guards had abandoned their posts. Hamwi and other prisoners left, he said, and he would soon be among the first from Lebanon to reenter the country. 'I’m still scared this might not be real,' he told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday from his home — the same one he left more than three decades ago. This new reality feels fragile, but, he said, 'I found my freedom.' Years of uncertainty and imprisonment For years after the night of his disappearance, Hamwi’s family didn’t know where he was. It wasn’t until 16 years later that his wife discovered he was imprisoned in Syria. Even then, the reason for his detention remained unclear, Hamwi said. It took another four years before authorities finally told him the charge, he said: He was detained because he was a member of the Lebanese Forces, a Christian political party that also functioned as a militia during the 15-year Lebanese civil war that ended in 1990. The party fought against Syrian forces and remained opposed to Syria's military presence in Lebanon afterward. Hamwi said prison interrogations were cryptic. 'They asked for my name, my parents’ names, my age, and where I was from. That’s all,' he said. Then he would be sent back to his cell. 'There was no lawyer, no nothing.' He said he spent his first years in Syria’s notorious Saydnaya prison before being transferred to other facilities, eventually ending up in prison in Latakia. Torture marked his early days behind bars, he added, 'but that stopped after a while.' For years, he said, he lived in nearly complete isolation. He was alone in a small cell, surrounded by other Lebanese detainees as well as Palestinians and Iraqis. In 2008, he said, his wife was able to visit him for the first time. Then she came about once a year. The door opens to freedom Last week, there was some buzz in the prison about what was happening outside. 'But we didn’t know the dream would reach us,' Hamwi said. Early Sunday morning, chaos erupted as prisoners discovered the guards were gone. 'The first door opened,' Hamwi said, describing how rebels stormed the prison and started opening cell gates. 'Then others followed. And for those who couldn’t open their gates, they started coming out through the walls.' The prisoners left 'walking toward the unknown,' he said. 'And I walked with them.' Strangers on the street helped guide him back to Lebanon, Hamwi said. He came into the country through the Arida border crossing in northern Lebanon, where his family waited on the other side. Back home, at last As Hamwi walked through his door, it was his two grandchildren who greeted him. 'This is the first time I met them,' Hamwi later told AP, his voice tinged with disbelief. In the living room, Hamwi lit a cigarette and took a slow drag. He took in photos of moments he'd missed: George’s graduation portrait; George with his wife; Hamwi's own smiling wife, Josephine, with granddaughter Tala. Grandson Chris clung to Hamwi's hand, giggling as he called out 'Jeddo!' — Arabic for grandpa. Josephine handed out sweets, her hands steady despite the emotions of the last several days. Outside, neighbors and friends gathered, their voices echoing in the narrow hallway outside his apartment. They sat on chairs in a circle, sharing laughter and memories, as plates of the Arabic sweets and small chocolates were passed around. 'Do you know me? Do you remember me?' one friend asked, shaking Hamwi’s hand. Hamwi paused, studying the man’s face. 'You’re Jean! Yes, you’re Jean,' he said. Hawmi has visited a hospital, for tests to assess the toll of 32 years in captivity. And he has to relearn life outside prison walls. He hoped one of the best moments was yet to come: his reunion with only son George, an engineer working in the Gulf. In their first phone call, Hamwi said, George told him the words he'd been longing to hear: 'I miss you. I love you. I’m waiting to see you.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-prisoners-prison-suheil-hamwi-deae45f72edd7d4544d5d411c1717123	2024-12-10T21:35:25-08:00	
Rural resurrection: A Greek village leans into faith in fight against demographic collapse	FOURNA, Greece (AP) — Fourna, home to 180 people and hidden in the fir-tree covered mountains of central Greece, is a vanishing village that is determined to keep its place on the map. A winding four-hour drive from Athens, it enjoys near total silence, periodically broken by church bells and howling dogs. Elderly residents measure the village’s chances of survival by the number of children enrolled at the local primary school. Last year, there were only two. But Fourna’s fortunes have been reversed by an unlikely and tireless partnership. The local schoolteacher, a Ph.D. student studying artificial intelligence, found common cause with the Rev. Constantine Dousikos, a burly Orthodox priest and former lumber machine operator who was ordained shortly before turning 50. They started a despair-fueled campaign to attract families to Fourna, offering settling-in money raised from private donations and municipal programs. It’s working: Two families have moved to the village, five more are on a 2025 wait list, and hundreds of others have made inquiries. Eight children now attend elementary classes. Dousikos, equally at ease behind the wheel of his pickup or in front of the church altar, says the initiative was partly inspired by calls from the Orthodox church hierarchy urging clergy to promote family life. 'I think we did the obvious thing: Help the people here keep our village alive,' he says, standing in the Church of Transfiguration of Christ on the main square. 'Of course, village life is not for everyone. You need to be good at manual work.' Greece has one of the world’s oldest populations with 23% aged 65 or older in 2023, according to World Bank data. The central Greek region of Evrytania, home to Fourna, faces low birth rates and rural depopulation, with an average age of 56.2 – one of the three highest in the European Union. Panagiota Diamanti, Fourna’s only elementary schoolteacher and co-founder of the family campaign 'New Life in the Village,' says the urgency of the situation is palpable. 'If the kids don’t come, the teacher gets transferred and the school will close. And a closed school will never reopen,' she says. 'We need bold action.' More than 200 publicly run schools and kindergartens were shut down across Greece in the current school year due to low enrollment, many in remote parts of the country with sparse populations due to its mountainous mainland terrain and numerous small islands. Several local authorities have reached out to the Fourna campaign, and asked Diamanti to help them start a similar program. After class, she joins her eight students in a game of dodgeball at the school yard which overlooks Evrytania’s jagged mountains. The kids enjoy a local-celebrity status; their birthdays are often celebrated in the main village square. Vassiliki Emmanouil relocated to Fourna with her six children – five sons and a daughter – and says she has been showered with kindness. Village residents leave food outside her door overnight and are encouraging her to restart an old bakery when her husband returns from a spell of work in Germany. 'I’ve been here for nearly three months, and I would be ungrateful to say I’ve struggled,' Emmanouil says. 'The local priest and his wife treat me as if I’m part of their family. The entire village has been by our side, from offering daily essentials to emotional support.' Deaths overtook annual births in Greece in 2010 as the country sank into a severe financial crisis and the numbers have steadily worsened since then, reaching almost double the birth level in 2022. The conservative government last year created a ministry of family and social cohesion. It has increased family benefits in the 2025 budget and reached out to the Orthodox Church for help. Last year, the church’s governing Holy Synod issued a circular that was read out at all of Greece’s Orthodox churches, arguing that financial incentives will not be enough to reverse the dire demographic trends. 'Experts propose various solutions to address the issue, emphasizing its significant social, economic, and geopolitical implications,' the message said. 'The Church underscores the spiritual dimension of family life, advocating for unity, love, and the creation of families as a testament to divine purpose,' it added. 'Children, considered gifts from God, bring meaning to life and symbolize hope and renewal.' For Fourna’s residents, even church attendance is tied to village survival. Two dozen churches in the area remain empty most of the year, but are well maintained and open for important dates on the religious calendar. The appearance of children in church and on the village’s long-quieted streets caught most residents off guard. 'At the start, I never thought families would come to live here. It’s a remote village, very small, without much here,' local business owner Giorgos Vassilikoudis said. 'But to my surprise, families did come and they’re happy,' said Vassilikoudis, who runs a restaurant and guesthouse. 'It’s very good for the village and for people who have shops and businesses. For other villages, it serves as an example. It’s a good start.' ___ AP journalist Lefteris Pitarakis contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Brazilian beef and leather companies fall short in tackling deforestation, a study finds	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — The next United Nations climate conference, COP30, will be held in Belem, the capital of an Amazon region where widespread deforestation mainly driven by cattle farming has turned the surrounding rainforest from a vital carbon sink into a significant carbon source. Now a new report concludes around 80% of Brazil’s leading beef and cow leather companies and their financiers have made no commitments to stop deforestation. The study, released Wednesday by the environmental nonprofit group Global Canopy, highlights the country´s 175 most influential beef and leather companies and financial institutions that have supported them with $100 billion. This amount is one-third of the annual funding that wealthy nations pledged to provide for climate finance in developing countries during COP29 last month in Baku, Azerbaijan. 'Although cattle is the single most influential commodity for deforestation and linked greenhouse gas emissions, the report ... reveals a picture of staggering inaction from corporates and financial institutions alike in Brazilian supply chains,' the study said. The record is poor even among companies that commit to halting deforestation, such as JBS, according to the report. The giant meatpacker is one of the few to make such commitments and one of only two to have a system for tracing cattle all the way to the production unit. Yet the report ranks the company as the most likely to be buying cattle and cow leather from recently deforested land. This assessment of deforestation risk is based on the number of cattle bought from ranchers in each Brazilian municipality and its deforestation rate. Meatpackers buying from high-deforestation areas are more likely to source from recently cleared land than those buying from low-deforestation areas. The methodology was created by Do Pasto ao Prato, an independent Brazilian consumer app that aims to increase transparency in the livestock sector. 'Commitments are critical as one of the first steps a company takes to address deforestation,' Emma Thomson, one of the coauthors, told The Associated Press. 'But it has to be followed by effective implementation and by monitoring suppliers and indirect suppliers for compliance with those standards. It has to have effective traceability mechanisms and transparent reporting on the progress that is — or isn´t — being made.' Besides JBS, the report lists three processing companies with units based in Para state as likely to be buying cattle and cow leather from recently deforested land: Mercurio, Mafrinorte and Frigol. In a written response, JBS said the study's methodology provides a simplistic and inaccurate assessment of deforestation risk, ignoring factors such as corporate policies, sustainable procurement systems and exclusion of noncompliant suppliers. The company said that since 2009 it has maintained a system to ensure suppliers meet socio-environmental criteria. 'The companies that have made significant progress in their controls end up being criticized, and their transparency is used not as an incentive but as a penalty,' it said. Mercurio, Mafrinorte and Frigol didn´t reply to requests for comment. Global Canopy´s report was funded by the Bezos Earth Fund. Do Pasto ao Prato is financed by Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative. The state of Para harbors Brazil´s second largest cattle herd, with 25 million animals — and 35% of its territory is cleared, an area slightly smaller than Syria. As a result, it ranks first in greenhouse gas emissions among Brazilian states. A landmark study published in the journal Nature in 2021 found that the eastern Amazon, where Para is located, has ceased to function as a carbon sink, or absorber, for the Earth, due to widespread deforestation and climate change. Niki Mardas, executive director of Global Canopy, said there will be an update to Wednesday's baseline report in the runup to COP30 next November, when all eyes will be on the Amazon.

US Biathlon officials ignored sexual harassment and abuse of female racers for decades, athletes say	Sexual abuse and harassment by coaches and others who held positions of power over women on the U.S. Biathlon team have been dismissed, ignored or excused over decades by officials more concerned with winning medals than holding offenders accountable, according to a half-dozen former Olympians and other biathletes. And while the men involved climbed the ranks of the sport, these women — who described a culture of abuse dating back to the 1990s — told The Associated Press they were forced to end their racing careers early. One coach resigned after the young biathlete he was accused of sexually abusing attempted suicide, but he was later hired to coach the U.S. Paralympic team. Max Cobb, who the women say was informed but failed to address the claims, went from U.S. domestic team manager to CEO of the U.S. Biathlon Association and is now secretary general of the International Biathlon Union, the worldwide governing body of the sport, which combines cross-country skiing on trails with target shooting. Two male coaches and a former racer on the men's biathlon team confirmed the culture of misogyny described by the women, who all said they faced retaliation for speaking up. 'My safety on the team was clearly secondary to a top-down power structure focused on image, medals and marketing,' said two-time Olympian Joan Wilder, 58, who said her coach got away with trying to sexually assault her in 1990 despite her complaints to Cobb. Grace Boutot, a 2009 Youth World Championship silver medalist, said her reports to Cobb and other officials about abuse committed by two coaches, beginning when she was 15, also went unheeded, eventually leading to a suicide attempt. 'U.S. Biathlon leadership always seems to choose to support the predators instead of the person who was abused,' the now 33-year-old Boutot said. The women came forward after the AP reported that Olympian Joanne Reid was sexually abused and harassed for years, according to findings by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, a watchdog group created to investigate sex-abuse allegations in Olympic sports in the aftermath of the Larry Nassar U.S. Gymnastics scandal. Reid told the AP her repeated complaints to top U.S. Biathlon officials, which were relayed to Cobb, were ignored for three years. Cobb denied the women's allegations that he failed to act. 'During my 33 years at U.S. Biathlon, athlete safety was always fundamental to me and I can't recall ever hearing from athletes or others that my efforts in this regard were not appropriate,' he said in an email to the AP. Cobb declined to be interviewed to respond to specific allegations raised by the women, saying it would be a violation of SafeSport's code. However, an independent investigation ordered by U.S. Biathlon into team culture and safety following the AP report found biathletes faced 'misogynistic' behavior while racing and feared retaliation if they came forward with their concerns. The assessment by outside auditor Vestry Laight, released last week, said the athletes surveyed described a sport 'dominated by men who have a very different outlook on how to treat women' and criticized the 'lack of attention paid to create a respectful environment.' Biathlon officials said they were adopting an 'action plan' in response to the auditor's report, including workshops with staff and athletes to define core values and create a way to measure progress. SafeSport interviews also confirmed the sexualized atmosphere. U.S. Biathlon team psychologist Sean McCann described 'a European boys club culture' in the watchdog group's 2022 report on the Reid case, with some men sharing sexual comments and other explicit content on a private WhatsApp group. Turning a blind eye in pursuit of elusive Olympic medals, athletes say Biathlon is the only winter sport for which the U.S. has never won an Olympic medal. Desperate to excel in the European-dominated sport, U.S. officials hired European coaches and staff, and turned a blind eye when women raised claims of sexual harassment or abuse on the team, all those interviewed said. In 1990, to prepare for the first-ever women’s biathlon race at the Olympics, U.S. officials hired German biathlete Walter Pichler, a 1984 Olympic bronze medalist, to coach the U.S. women’s team. During a training camp in Montana that year, the team went out one night but then 20-year-old Wilder said she went to bed early. She suddenly woke to someone on her back. Pichler was holding her down and trying to force her to have sex, she said in a complaint filed with SafeSport. Pichler denied trying to sexually assault Wilder. 'This is unbelievable,' he told AP. 'I’m speechless. If this comes out, it does damage to me.' 'I always had a super relationship with Joanie, or with all the athletes, all the female, the men athletes. All of them.' Wilder said she chased Pichler from her room and reported it to then-team manager Cobb. He showed concern, she said, 'but didn’t consider it discipline-worthy.' Cobb justified Pichler’s behavior by saying he didn’t know U.S. laws or culture, she said. 'I recall pressing Max Cobb about sending Walter back to Germany. The conversation didn’t last long,' said Wilder, who competed under her maiden name Guetschow. Pichler's visa had taken two years to secure, he told her, 'and we were so close to the Olympics. We needed their expertise to perform well.' 'The message I felt, and it hurt, was not to harm the team, organization, Olympics over a very inconvenient ‘incident,’' she said. 'Basically, shut up for the team’s sake.' Wilder said in her SafeSport complaint that she faced retaliation for pressing the issue of firing Pichler. 'I was targeted as a ‘problem’ athlete,' she said, in the complaint. She said her rifle disappeared, her skis went to another athlete, and she was temporarily bumped from the 1994 Olympic team, then dropped from the national team before the 1998 Olympics without being told. That put her health insurance at risk. She had undergone heart surgery, so losing coverage with a pre-existing condition was catastrophic, she said. She called Cobb in distress. 'Max ended the conversation with, ‘Well, if you write a letter to the U.S. Olympic Committee and say that you’re resigning from biathlon, I’ll extend your medical insurance,’' she told the AP. She hung up, she said, deciding she didn’t have any fight left. 'It was time for me to move on.' Two coaches prey on teenage Maine biathlete Boutot grew up homeschooled and mostly isolated from others her age in Fort Kent, Maine, a town of 4,000 on the Canadian border. The Maine Winter Sports Center ran a world-class Nordic ski facility there used by U.S. Biathlon. Boutot was 12 when she was recruited into the program in 2003. She started racing biathlon the next year and began training with newly hired coach Gary Colliander when she was 15. Colliander gave her a lot of coaching attention, but also a lot of hugs, she said. Her parents had divorced and she rarely saw her father, so she appreciated his support. 'I didn’t think he would do anything to hurt me,' she told the AP of Colliander, who was 15 years her senior. As she got older, she said, his attention increased. He invited her to his home, massaged her legs and rubbed her back and buttocks, she said. He was married, but his wife lived part time in Colorado. The conduct escalated after she turned 18 to 'kissing, sexual fondling and oral sex,' according to a treatment summary by therapist Jacqueline Pauli-Ritz, shared with the AP. Boutot said she begged him to stop but Colliander ignored her. She said he warned her against telling anyone, saying his life would be ruined and her biathlon career would end. She loved racing, and felt trapped; to compete internationally she needed her coach's recommendation: 'I didn’t know what to do,' she said. She became severely depressed and started cutting herself, according to the therapist's notes. In September 2010, Pauli-Ritz contacted Colliander and told him Boutot was suffering from major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and he should stop coaching her, the treatment summary said. 'He did not do this until after the suicide attempt,' Pauli-Ritz wrote, referring to Boutot's Oct. 7, 2010, overdose on antidepressants while at a training camp in Soldier Hollow, Utah. She was found by a teammate and hospitalized. The next day, Colliander resigned. He took a coaching job in Colorado and was hired in December 2016 by the U.S. Paralympic team, where he is associate director of high performance for U.S. Paralympics Nordic Skiing. Colliander did not respond to phone messages and emails seeking comment. In October 2010, Boutot informed the CEO and the vice president of the Maine Winter Sports Center about the abuse by Colliander, according to a letter she sent to the sports center’s board. But, she said, there was no investigation. Boutot said she also faced abuse by then-U.S. Biathlon junior team coach Vladimir Cervenka of the Czech Republic, starting in 2007. He caressed her buttocks and legs, she said, and also grabbed other girls and gave 'good luck pats.' When she won a silver medal at the 2009 Youth World Championships in Canada, Cervenka grabbed her, she said. 'He forcibly kissed me and groped my entire body, smothering me and crushing me until he was pulled off of me by our team masseuse,' she said of Cervenka, who was 26 years older than her. Cervenka denied Boutot's claims. 'I absolutely did not kiss her or grope her body,' he told the AP in an email. 'Regarding inappropriate touching Grace, I have no memory of any of that and I for sure did not have any intention of doing that. All these accusations are absurd and very upsetting.' Boutot reported the alleged abuse by Cervenka twice to U.S. Biathlon officials, including in a Jan. 6, 2011, email to Cobb and a U.S. Biathlon board member in which she also expressed concern about Cervenka's inappropriate contact with other young teammates and her worries about retaliation for speaking up. In the email exchange, she was told the issues were serious, but she had to make her complaint public so Cervenka could defend himself. Boutot said she expected them to investigate. 'I wish I would have spoken up more at the time but it was terrifying,' she told the AP. 'I told them of the abuse and they never took me seriously. It felt like an insurmountable battle, me against them. I went to USBA hoping for help, and it felt like they continuously shut me down and wanted me to leave the sport.' Boutot tried to keep racing but faced retaliation by the Maine Winter Sports Center, she said in a 2011 complaint filed with the Maine Human Rights Commission. She accused the center of failing to prevent Colliander’s sexual misconduct and retaliating against her when she reported it — denying her coaching and ending its financing of equipment, travel, athlete housing and other U.S. Biathlon competition-related expenses. The center settled for $75,000, and Boutot quit racing. What comes next? SafeSport has ordered a new investigation into whether Reid was retaliated against for exposing the abuse she endured to the watchdog group. SafeSport spokeswoman Hilary Nemchik said she could not comment on the ongoing case. Olympian Deedra Irwin, Reid's teammate who is competing at the World Cup in Europe this winter, said the misogynistic culture described by SafeSport grew under Cobb's leadership. 'Max Cobb just hired all his friends,' Irwin told the AP. 'The amount of people working in USBA right now who are all ex-athletes that are all really close with Max Cobb, it's like, OK, this is how this kept happening for so many years.' 'You just keep hiring people who are comfortable with what's already happening.' SafeSport, which was created in 2017, decades after the abuse reported by Wilder and Boutot, investigates claims even when the legal statute of limitations has expired. After receiving an anonymous tip, SafeSport contacted Boutot in 2021 about filing a complaint about the abuse allegations involving Colliander, she said. She declined. A coach found guilty might only face a six-month suspension, she said, but 'what I have endured has been a life sentence.' Wilder said she didn’t know she had the option and filed a SafeSport complaint, naming Cobb and Pichler, after she found out. She said it is 'an important next step.' 'I love the sport of biathlon,' Wilder said. 'I sincerely hope that my shared story with other women biathletes results in this being bookends to a darker period — that it never happens again.' ___ EDITOR'S NOTE — Martha Bellisle is an amateur biathlete who has won several U.S. national and world championship gold medals in the master’s division for competitors 60 and older.

Rights group demands probe of ex-governor, 2 army officers in Congo for possible humanitarian crimes	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Amnesty International called for an investigation Wednesday into a former governor and two top army officials in Congo for 'possible crimes against humanity' during a deadly crackdown on demonstrators last year protesting the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the country. The human rights group said in a report Congo's security forces killed at least 56 people and injured 80 more, during a protest in the eastern city of Goma in August 2023. The protest was organized by a sect called the Natural Judaic and Messianic Faith Towards the Nations and known colloquially as Wazalendo. Its supporters were demonstrating against the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, called MONUSCO. The MONUSCO force arrived in Congo in 2010 after taking over from an earlier U.N. peacekeeping mission to protect civilians and humanitarian personnel and to support the Congolese government in its stabilization and peace consolidation efforts. However, frustrated Congolese say that no one is protecting them from rebel attacks, leading to several protests against the U.N. mission. Eastern Congo has struggled with armed violence for decades as more than 120 groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources, while others try to defend their communities. Some armed groups have been accused of mass killings. More than 7 million people have been displaced. Goma’s Mayor Faustin Napenda Kapend banned the protest soon after it was announced over concerns the organizers were inciting hate and violence. Amnesty International said it found no evidence of incitement to violence in the statements and messages from the Wazalendo it reviewed. Congolese security and defense forces amassed at major intersections in anticipation of the protest when violence broke out early in the morning. Amnesty International said it saw operational plans in which the security forces were given orders to 'destroy isolated enemy elements.' 'This massacre was not the result of a blunder by a few soldiers who intervened unexpectedly after Wazalendo followers stoned a police officer, as authorities have claimed,' Tigere Chagutah, the rights group regional director for East and Southern Africa, said in the statement. 'It was the result of a series of deliberate, planned actions by the Congolese authorities, after MONUSCO explicitly requested they prohibit the protest.' Amnesty International said it traced the timeline and locations of the killings, identifying three top officials who should be investigated and, if evidence supports it, prosecuted for possible crimes against humanity. They include Lt. Gen. Constant Ndima, who was governor of the North Kivu province at the time, Col. Mike Kalamba Mikombe, who was head of the Republican Guard unit in Goma, and Maj. Peter Kabwe, who led the Republican Guard's Special Forces. The rights group said Ndima had directed the army and the police to 'take all measures' to protect MONUSCO facilities and the city, after he informed the army and police that the Wazalendo posed a serious threat. Mikombe was accused of ordering soldiers to open fire on the protesters, who were unarmed, according to Amnesty International and two Congolese military trials, killing dozens. Amnesty International accused Kabwe of leading a raid on a Wazalendo radio station ahead of the protest in which six people, including a journalist, were summarily executed. While Mikombe was convicted and sentenced to death, which the rights group said it opposed, Ndima and Kabwe have not faced justice. 'The Democratic Republic of Congo authorities must reopen the investigations into this massacre, in line with regional and international standards, to establish the truth and hold all of those involved accountable,' Chagutah said. He added that Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi should suspend Ndima and Kabew, further investigate Mikombe, and ban the Republican Guard and Special Forces from law enforcement operations.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-army-crimes-against-humanity-amnesty-international-eb7d662c7b0efe2ef138f60df8a34e81	2024-12-10T20:08:09-08:00	
These Palestinians disappeared after encounters with Israeli troops in Gaza	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Reem Ajour says she last saw her husband and then 4-year-old daughter in March, when Israeli soldiers raided a family home in northern Gaza. She is haunted by those chaotic last moments, when the soldiers ordered her to go – to leave behind Talal and Masaa, both wounded. Eight months later, the 23-year-old mother still has no answers about their fate. The military says it does not have them. Troops leveled the house where they were staying soon after the raid. 'I am living and dead at the same time,' she said, breaking down in sobs. Ajour is one of dozens of Palestinians that an Israeli legal group, Hamoked, is helping in their search for family members who went missing after being separated by Israeli soldiers during raids and arrests in the Gaza Strip. Their cases — a fraction of the estimated thousands who have gone missing during the 14-month-long war — highlight a lack of accountability in how the Israeli military deals with Palestinians during ground operations in Gaza, Hamoked says. Throughout the war, the military has conducted what amounts to a mass sifting of the Palestinian population as it raids homes and shelters and sends people through checkpoints. Troops round up and detain men, from dozens to several hundreds at a time, searching for any they suspect of Hamas ties, while forcing their families away, toward other parts of Gaza. The result is families split apart, often amid the chaos of fighting. But the military has not made clear how it keeps track of everyone it separates, arrests or detains. Even if troops transfer Palestinians to military detention inside Israel, they can hold them incommunicado for more than two months — their whereabouts unknown to families or lawyers, according to rights groups. When people vanish, it’s nearly impossible to know what happened, Hamoked says. 'We’ve never had a situation of mass forced disappearance from Gaza, with no information provided for weeks and weeks to families,' said Jessica Montell, the director of Hamoked. Israel's High Court of Justice has refused to intervene to get answers, despite Hamoked's petitions, she said. Asked by The Associated Press about the cases of Ajour and two other families it interviewed, the Israeli military declined comment. 4-year-old Masaa Ajour was shot, then separated from her mother The Ajours were sheltering at a home in Gaza City that belonged to Talal's family after being displaced from their own house earlier in the war. Israeli troops raided the home on March 24, opening fire as they burst in, Ajour said. Ajour, who was three months pregnant, was shot in the stomach. Talal was wounded in his leg, bleeding heavily. Masaa lay passed out, shot in the shoulder – though Ajour said she saw her still breathing. As one soldier bandaged the little girl's wound, another pointed his gun in Ajour’s face and told her to head out of Gaza City. She said she pleaded that she couldn’t leave Masaa and Talal, but the soldier screamed: 'Go south!' With no choice, Ajour collected her younger son and went down to the street. 'It was all in a blink of an eye. It was all so fast,' she said. Still bleeding, she walked for two and a half hours, clutching her son. When they reached a hospital in central Gaza, doctors treated her stomach wound and found her fetus’ pulse. Weeks later, doctors found the pulse had gone. She miscarried. Ajour said that several weeks later, a Palestinian released from a prison in southern Israel told her family he had heard her husband’s name called out over a loudspeaker among a list of detainees. The rumor has kept her hope alive, but the military told Hamoked it had no record of Masaa or Talal being detained. Another possibility is that they died on the scene, but no one has been able to search the rubble of the family's building to determine if any bodies are there. The storming of their building came as Israeli forces were battling Hamas fighters in surrounding streets while raiding nearby Shifa Hospital, where it claimed the militants were based. Troops cleared families out of nearby homes and often then destroyed or set the buildings ablaze, according to witnesses at the time. The military itself may not know what happened to Ajour’s husband and daughter, said Montell of Hamoked. 'That illustrates a broader problem,' she said. Ajour and her son now shelter in a tent camp outside the central Gaza town of Zuweida. Masaa, she said, 'was my first joy' — with blond hair and olive-colored eyes, a face 'white like the moon.' Masaa’s fifth birthday was in July, Ajour said, sobbing. 'She turned five while she is not with me.' Does the military document what troops do in Gaza? Under a wartime revision to Israeli law, Palestinians from Gaza taken to military detention in Israel can be held for over two months without access to the outside world. Israel says the law is necessary to handle the unprecedented number of detainees as it seeks to destroy Hamas following the Oct. 7 2023, attack on Israel that killed 1,200 and took around 250 people hostage inside Gaza. The military has transferred some 1,770 of its Gaza detainees to civilian prisons, according to rights groups, but it has not revealed the number still in its detention. Milena Ansari, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said Israel is obligated under international law to document what happens during every home raid and detention. But the military is not transparent about the information it collects on detainees or on how many it is holding, she said. Hamoked has asked the military for the whereabouts of 900 missing Palestinians. The military confirmed around 500 of them were detained in Israel. It said it had no record of detaining the other 400. The group petitioned Israel’s High Court of Justice seeking answers in 52 cases, including that of Masaa and two other children, where witnesses testified that the missing were handled by troops before their disappearances. 'The judges just dismiss the cases, without even inquiring what measures might be necessary to prevent such cases in the future,' said Montell. A court spokesperson said it often asks the military to provide additional information but isn’t authorized to investigate if the military says it is not detaining them. In the cases of three missing adult Palestinians presented by Hamoked, the military first claimed it was not holding them, then found records of them being detained after being pressed by Hamoked to double-check. In another case, military police discovered that two Palestinians they had initially denied holding -- a father and his adult son -- had died in Israeli custody. The U.N. Human Rights Office says at least 53 Palestinians are known to have died in Israeli detention during the war. Ailing with cancer, Mahmoud Alghrabli disappeared after raid The last time the Alghrabli family saw their 76-year-old patriarch, Mahmoud Alghrabli, was when Israeli troops stormed their district in Khan Younis on Feb. 4. The soldiers ordered residents out of the area. The Alghrablis had to carry Mahmoud, suffering from cancer, out of their building on a chair, his son Ahmed Algharbli told the AP. After detaining some men, the soldiers ordered the rest to leave. Mahmoud Alghrabli made it to a sand mound near the house. Ahmed Algharbli said his brother went to help the father, but soldiers shouted at him to leave. 'He left our father by force, or he would have been shot,' he said. The family returned a month later. There was no trace of Mahmoud. Ahmed Algharbli said he 'walked meter by meter' searching for traces, finding bones but not knowing whose they were. He keeps them wrapped in a piece of cloth at home. Hamoked was told by the military there was no indication of him in Israeli detention. 'By God, I don’t sleep at night,' said Mahmoud’s wife, Sabah Abdul-Salam. Whether he was arrested or killed, she said, 'let us know, we will rest.' Mahmoud Almoqayed vanished while searching for his family The only traces left of another missing man, 77-year-old Mahmoud Almoqayed, are his torn shirt and pants with his ID in the pocket. They were found in the dirt near the school where he and his family were sheltering when it was raided by Israeli troops on May 23 in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. The soldiers released Almoqayed and sent him and other men to another shelter, said his son, Rani Almoqayed, a doctor working in Saudi Arabia who pieced together the account from witnesses and family members. Once at the second shelter, the elderly Almoqayed immediately turned back, determined to find his wife and grandchildren left behind at the school, witnesses told his son. It was dark, well after 1 a.m., and troops were all around the area. Almoqayed was never seen by his family again. Weeks later, his family found his abandoned clothes. They also found skulls and body parts nearby, Rani Almoqayed said. The military police told Hamoked it had no indication Almoqayed was detained. Rani Almoqayed believes it's possible his father was killed and Israeli troops took the body. Since December 2023, the military has returned at least 318 bodies and a sack of body parts to Gaza after seizing them to search for hostages, a senior U.N. official in Gaza told the AP, speaking anonymously to discuss confidential matters. The bodies, with no identification and often decomposed, are buried in anonymous mass graves. The family had Mahmoud Almoqayed declared officially dead, his son said. 'But the doubt will not stop and one’s heart won’t ease unless they see the body.' ___ El Deeb reported from Beirut, and Frankel from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-war-missing-military-court-f5a8633d750e496e1fe91dd07fa71a4f	2024-12-10T20:02:53-08:00	
Stock market today: Trading muted on Wall Street ahead of key US inflation report	Trading on Wall Street was muted early Wednesday ahead of the latest update on inflation coming out before markets open. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 edged less than 0.1% higher before the bell, while futures for the Dow were off less than 0.1%. Wednesday’s update on consumer inflation and a report Thursday on inflation at the wholesale level will be the final big pieces of data the Federal Reserve will get before its meeting next week, where many investors expect this year’s third cut to interest rates. The Fed has been easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high since September to take pressure off the slowing jobs market, after bringing inflation nearly down to its 2% target. Lower rates would help give support to the economy, but they could also provide more fuel for inflation. Expectations for a series of cuts through next year have been a big reason the S&amp;P 500 has set so many records this year. In premarket trading Wednesday, Macy's tumbled close to 10% after the department store chain reported a decline in third-quarter profits and sales as consumers continue to divert spending toward essentials amid elevated prices. Macy's raised its annual sales forecast but lowered profit projections, citing an uncertain economic environment. Shares of Kroger stabilized early Wednesday following a more than 5% decline late Tuesday when the supermarket giant's proposed merger with Albertsons was nixed by judges in separate cases in Oregon and Washington. The grocery stores contend the merger would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, but critics of the deal, including the Federal Trade Commission, said the tie-up would hurt competition. Stitch Fix was a big gainer early Wednesday after the personalized fashion styling service posted a narrower loss than expected raised its full-year outlook. Its shares jumped 20% before the bell. Dave &amp; Buster's tumbled 15% after the restaurant and arcade chain posted more than double the loss that Wall Street expected as sales fell. In Europe at midday, Germany’s DAX was flat, while the CAC 40 in Paris and Britain’s FTSE 100 each gained 0.3%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.8% to 20,155.05 while the Shanghai Composite index advanced 0.3% to 3,432.49 as Chinese leaders convened an annual planning meeting in Beijing that is expected to set economic policies and growth targets for the coming year. Earlier this week, top leaders agreed on a 'moderately loose' monetary policy during a meeting of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo. That’s the first move in 10 years away from a more cautious, 'prudent' stance. Readouts from state media hinted at more robust stimulus to support the world’s second-largest economy, but analysts remained skeptical about any dramatic measures. South Korea's market rose for a second straight day, recovering from last week's political turmoil. The Kospi added 1% to 2,442.51. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was little changed at 39,372.23 after data showed that Japan’s wholesale inflation in November rose 3.7% year-on-year, marking three consecutive months of increases and adding to pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates. Japan's central bank will hold a two-day policy meeting next week. Markets widely expect the bank to raise short-term interest rates from the current level of 0.25%. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped 0.5% to 8,353.60. U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 91 cents to $69.50 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 7 cents to $71.05 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 152.65 Japanese yen from 151.93 yen. The euro was trading at $1.0504, down from $1.0531.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-inflation-rates-f52917dbab997a2c95fbeb9b83d175f1	2024-12-10T19:37:44-08:00	
What should I do?' Unpredictable school fees bar many children in Africa from an education	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — The day Shalom Mirembe was sent home from school last month over unpaid tuition, her father lay dying in a hospital. Even as her mother sat by his bedside, school officials were calling and demanding payment. For Mirembe's mother, a shoe vendor who looks after four children, it was a heartbreaking moment in the daily struggle to pay often unpredictable and unregulated school fees. Constant threats demanding payment can leave her feeling helpless. Some officials are more tolerant, but eventually they all grow tired of her pleas. 'You have to care for this one, you have to care for the other one,' Justine Nangero said, describing a delicate balancing act to keep Mirembe and the others enrolled. 'I try to fight to see that I pay to all these schools.' It is a crushing issue for many across sub-Saharan Africa, where the lack of a few hundred dollars can determine a child's future. The region has long had the world's highest dropout rates. Reasons vary, but financial pain is the biggest. Last year, the World Bank said 54% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa rank the issue of paying school fees higher than medical bills and other expenses. It said school fees were the biggest source of financial worry for 40% of people in Uganda, where top government-funded schools now charge nearly $700 in tuition per three-month term. That's a significant amount in this East African country where annual GDP per capita was $864 in 2023. More than anything, it’s the unpredictable tuition hikes — for sometimes questionable reasons — that haunt parents across the country of more than 45 million people. Some critics, including Uganda's parliament speaker, have called for regulation to protect parents from exploitation. The Equal Opportunities Commission, a government agency that tracks inequality and discrimination, released a report in September calling for punitive measures against government-supported schools that appear to set excessive fees. It warned that arbitrarily raising fees can force children to drop out. Attendance falls from 68% in grade school to 22% in secondary school, with financial difficulty the main reason for failure to continue studies, according to new figures from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. Uganda does have a program for universal secondary education, introduced in 2007 and similar to one for primary education, but such schools are often rundown and undesirable for many families. They are generally tuition-free, but parents must pay sometimes burdensome fees for uniforms, textbooks and other items. When it comes to more popular, and more expensive, private schools, the government is not interested in price intervention, said Dennis Mugimba, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education. Setting fees for private schools is 'purely administrative and it is adjusted according to the business environment,' he said. But certain charges such as those including 'capital development' should not be the responsibility of parents, he said. Such private schools have mushroomed across Uganda and now make up the majority of the country's schools, addressing growing demand but also emphasizing the profitability of education as a business. That worries some experts. 'We can’t let education be treated like a market stall,' said Fagil Mandy, a former inspector of schools. Education authorities should standardize regulations to make school fees universally predictable, he said. Routine school expenses, for both private and some top government-funded schools, can include everything from a contribution towards the purchase of a bus to the procurement of laboratory equipment. But when the list of fees includes a ream of photocopying paper or a bag of cement from each student, questions emerge about where they end up. The school that Mirembe attends outside the capital, Kampala, charges the equivalent of $300 per term. Its officials expect 70% of fees to be paid at the beginning of a term, but many parents fail to meet that threshold. Some, like Nangero, send their children to school having paid nothing, counting on the mercy of officials. But measures to track payments include gate passes that show how much is owed and when, and a student may be denied entry, said Joanita Seguya, a deputy head teacher at the school, Wampewo Ntakke Secondary. In the school of more than 2,100 students, roughly 400 are from working-class families that routinely struggle to pay fees, according to Seguya, who said the system can seem harsh. To accommodate some parents, the school accepts in-kind payments such as vegetables and fruit, she said. But Nangero, whose family shares a single room, has nothing of the sort to offer. Her shoe business, long drained of cash by school fees, has collapsed. The death of her husband, whose carpentry once supplemented the family income, has increased the pain. She said anxiety over school fees is more damaging for her children, who spend days at home whenever school officials lose patience. She's grateful that two of her sons in secondary school are now supported by an evangelical cleric — rare support made possible via contact through their religious fellowship. The 20-year-old Mirembe, who is taking her final exams this year, was able to start the school term in September because of a bursar's sympathy, she said, but other officials were not so lenient weeks later as her father was near death. 'At least maybe I will come and pay something tomorrow,' her mother recalled pleading with one official. 'And she told me, ‘No, we are not going to allow your daughter to be here.’' Mirembe arrived home hours before her father died. Vincent Odoi, a teacher at her school, recalled the incident as unfortunate, saying administrators didn’t know of the family’s challenges. Mirembe was allowed to return days after her father’s burial, which some of her teachers attended. Other families are not so fortunate. One is a nearby family of seven children who dropped out of school in recent years for lack of tuition. Their jobless father, Moses Serikomawa, described the scramble in vain for school fees as 'like a cancer. It cannot be treated.' Raising a total of over $200 in school fees each term is too much trouble when the family sometimes lacks food, he said. His oldest child, who would be in high school now, dropped out after completing secondary school last year. Now the boy is idle. 'The children still want to go back to school,' Serikomawa said. 'When I look at my children, there is no joy, no joy at all.' ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Humanitarian aid to North Gaza mostly blocked for the last 2 months, UN says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Humanitarian aid to North Gaza, where Israel launched a ground offensive on Oct. 6, has largely been blocked for the past 66 days, the United Nations said Tuesday. That has left between 65,000 and 75,000 Palestinians without access to food, water, electricity or health care, according to the world body. In the north, Israel has continued its siege on Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya with Palestinians living there largely denied aid, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, said. Recently, it said, about 5,500 people were forcibly displaced from three schools in Beit Lahiya to Gaza City. Adding to the food crisis, only four U.N.-supported bakeries are currently operating throughout the Gaza Strip, all of them in Gaza City, OCHA said. Sigrid Kaag, the senior U.N. humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told reporters after briefing the U.N. Security Council behind closed doors Tuesday afternoon that civilians trying to survive in Gaza face an 'utterly devastating situation.' She pointed to the breakdown in law and order and looting that has exacerbated a very dire situation and left the U.N. and many aid organizations unable to deliver food and other humanitarian essentials to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in need. Kaag said she and other U.N. officials keep repeatedly asking Israel for access for convoys to North Gaza and elsewhere, to allow in commercial goods, to reopen the Rafah crossing from Egypt in the south, and to approve dual-use items. Israel’s U.N. Mission said it had no comment on Kaag’s remarks. The U.N. has established the logistics for an operation across Gaza, she said, but there is no substitute for political will that humanitarians don’t possess. 'Member states possess it,' Kaag said. And this is what she urged Security Council members and keeps urging the broader international community to press for — the political will to address Gaza’s worsening humanitarian crisis.	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-aid-united-nations-f529bf77d09e609265179e259b799c6b	2024-12-10T15:45:24-08:00	
Ex-defense chief in South Korea tried to kill himself after being arrested over martial law case	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s previous defense minister was stopped from attempting suicide while in detention over last week's martial law, officials said, as police were reported to be raiding President Yoon Suk Yeol’s office Wednesday in their intensifying investigation. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party also plans to submit a new motion to impeach Yoon for his Dec. 3 declaration that imposed martial law. Yoon’s ill-conceived power grab has paralyzed South Korean politics, frozen its foreign policy, and rattled financial markets, greatly reducing his chances of completing his five-year term and casting a turbulent shadow over one of Asia’s most robust democracies. Shin Yong Hae, commissioner general of of the Korea Correctional Service, told lawmakers Wednesday that Kim tried to kill himself at a detention center in Seoul. He said that Kim's suicide attempt failed after center officials stopped him and that he is in a stable condition now. At the same parliament committee meeting, Justice Minister Park Sung Jae confirmed Kim's failed suicide attempt. Kim was arrested earlier Wednesday after a Seoul court approved a warrant for him on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. Kim became the first person formally arrested over the Dec. 3 martial law decree. Later in the day, National Police Agency Commissioner General Cho Ji Ho and Kim Bong-sik, head of the metropolitan police agency of the capital, Seoul, were detained over their actions during martial law. They are being investigated for their roles in deploying police forces to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting to lift Yoon’s martial law decree. South Korean police also searched Yoon's office Wednesday over his martial law decree, Yonhap news agency reported. Other South Korean media also carried similar reports. but Yoon's office and police have not immediately confirmed the search. The country’s main law enforcement institutions are focusing on finding whether Yoon and others involved in imposing martial law committed the crime of rebellion. Yoon survived an impeachment attempt last Saturday when the ruling party boycotted the vote, but the Democratic Party is aiming to put the new motion to a vote on Saturday. After last week’s impeachment motion fell through, the leader of Yoon’s conservative party pledged to arrange his stable exit from power, saying the party will coordinate with Cabinet members over state affairs and that Yoon will be sidelined from duties during a transition to an early election. However, the plans have been widely criticized as unrealistic and unconstitutional. The constitution explicitly states that impeachment is the sole method for suspending presidential powers and that the authority to command the military rests solely with the president. The Defense Ministry said this week that Yoon remains in charge of the country’s military forces. The Assembly was also encircled by heavily armed troops, which military commanders say were deployed on the orders of the former defense minister. But enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and unanimously rejected Yoon’s decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun to obstruct lawmakers from entering the Assembly’s main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim’s instructions was to prevent the 300-member parliament from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon’s martial law order. Kwak said Yoon later called him directly and asked for the troops to 'quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.' Kwak said he discussed Yoon’s order with the commander at the scene and that they concluded there was nothing that could be done, ruling out the possibility of threatening the lawmakers by shooting blanks or cutting off electricity. At the same hearing, senior officer Kim Dae-woo of the military’s counterintelligence agency said his commander, Yeo In-hyung, asked him if an army bunker in Seoul had space to detain politicians and other figures after martial law was imposed. Yeo is considered a close associate of Kim Yong Hyun. Last week, Hong Jang-won, a deputy director of the country’s spy agency, said Yoon ordered him to help Yeo’s command to detain some of his political rivals but he ignored the president’s order. Kwak and Yeo are among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended them last week. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If he is dismissed from office, a new presidential election would be required. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' and South Korea wasn’t in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean Constitution doesn’t allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces,' a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has had near-constant friction with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which introduced motions to impeach some of his top officials and launched a political offensive over scandals involving Yoon and his wife. On Wednesday, North Korea’s state news agency for the first time reported about the political turmoil and street protests triggered by Yoon’s martial law decree. The report mostly attempted to explain the South Korean events though it used its typical abusive language like calling Yoon 'a traitor' and his military 'gangsters.' Many experts say North Korea is sensitive to the domestic spread of news on massive anti-government protests in foreign countries because its own people have no official access to international news and could be affected by such events.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-3210438b8663fe609bfe4cb8b748a114	2024-12-10T15:35:52-08:00	
Vandals burn a car and spray graffiti in latest antisemitic attack in Australia	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Vandals torched a car and sprayed graffiti with anti-Israel slogans including an apparently misspelled 'Kill Israiel' on Wednesday in a Sydney suburb that is home to Australia's largest Jewish community. Officials condemned the attack as antisemitic. The incident in the eastern suburb of Woollahra came after federal police this week established a task force to investigate increasing antisemitic crimes across the country. Police were searching for two male suspects, aged between 15 and 20, who were seen running from the scene of the attack, wearing face masks, or balaclavas, and dark clothing, New South Wales state Police Commissioner Karen Webb said. She said there were 'antisemitic writings' on the walls of two buildings, two cars including the burnt car, and the sidewalks. She did not detail what words were spraypainted, but the media photographed 'Kill Israiel' painted on a garage door. Last week's arson at a Melbourne synagogue marked an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and the militant Hamas group started over a year ago in the Gaza Strip. Premier Chris Minns, the Sydney-based leader of the New South Wales state government, described the attack as an attempt to 'intimidate the Jewish community in Sydney.' 'This was a targeted attack in Sydney’s eastern suburbs ... directly after the burning down of a synagogue,' Minns told reporters. 'This was a deliberate attack ... designed to put fear into the hearts of the people who live in Sydney’s east,' he added. Police say the torched car had been stolen from elsewhere and used by the suspects to get to Woolahra. Stolen cars are often torched before they are abandoned. Two men are in custody facing multiple charges after buildings were similarly graffitied with antisemitic slogans and a car was set alight in another part of Woolahra on Nov. 21. They each face prison sentences of up to 10 years if convicted. Assistant Police Commissioner Peter McKenna said detectives did not believe the Woollahra crimes were linked. 'We will get to the bottom of this. We will bring people to justice,' McKenna said. David Ossip, president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, which represents the state's Jewish community, said the latest Woolahra attack was part of a 'sustained campaign of intimidation, harassment and terror against the Jewish community.' 'But the message to the perpetrators and all who wish ill on the Jewish community is that the Jewish community is strong, it is proud, it is united and it will not be cowed by these attempts to intimidate and harass us,' Ossip said. This week, authorities declared the attack on Melbourne's Adass Israel Synagogue a terrorist attack, which increases the resources and information available to investigators. Also this week, federal police announced Special Operation Avalite to target those behind antisemitic attacks around the country — including the arson at the Melbourne synagogue, the attack on Jewish lawmaker Josh Burns’ Melbourne office in June, and the Woollahra attacks last month. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the Woollahra attack on Wednesday as an 'outrage' and a 'hate crime.' 'It is another antisemitic attack and all Australians must condemn it,' Albanese said. 'I stand with the Jewish community and unequivocally condemn this attack. There’s no place for antisemitism in this country or anywhere else for that matter.' He said he had been briefed by Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw on the attack and would soon be briefed by Special Operation Avalite officials, and rejected allegations the attack could be a criticism of Israel rather than Jews. 'This isn’t an attack on a government, this is an attack on people because they happen to be Jewish,' Albanese said. 'The idea that we take a conflict overseas and bring it here is something that is quite contrary to what Australia was built on.' Government opponents argue that Albanese has been too slow to call out rising antisemitism for fear of alienating pro-Palestinian groups. Opposition Sen. Jane Hume said she knew a Jewish couple who were considering moving from Australia to Israel because they would feel safer there, despite the raging Mideast wars. 'Because the government has prevaricated, because it has used weasel words and wishy-washy language, it does seem that those that are committing these offenses have been emboldened if not enabled by a government that has failed to take leadership,' Hume said. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish global human rights organization, issued a travel warning on Tuesday, urging Jews to 'exercise extreme caution' in Australia as 'a result of the failure of Australian authorities to stand up against persistent demonization, harassment and violence against Jews and Jewish institutions in Australia.'	https://apnews.com/article/australia-sydney-graffiti-woollahra-antisemitism-89f8b08f58047ba1e3e7fb8c6447f52f	2024-12-10T14:07:37-08:00	
The swift fall of Syria's Assad brings moments inconceivable under his iron rule	It took barely 10 days for Syria’s insurgents to march from their stronghold in the northwest into Damascus and bring an end to the Assad family rule that had gripped the country for half a century. Every step of the way brought moments that would have been unbelievable only days earlier. Raising their hands and automatic rifles into the air, insurgents rode out of their enclave in Idlib province on Nov. 28. Some wore Islamic extremist emblems on their uniforms, a sign of the jihadi roots of the leading insurgent faction, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. First to fall was Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, with a swiftness that may have amazed even the fighters. They celebrated by taking photos of each other stomping on a poster of President Bashar Assad in his sunglasses and military uniform. At the airport, they tore down a poster glorifying the ruling family — Bashar; his father and predecessor Hafez Assad; and Bashar’s elder brother Basel, who was supposed to succeed their father but died in a 1994 car crash. More towns and cities fell like dominoes in the following days, including Hama and Homs. Along the way, Assad’s army melted away. Surrendered soldiers lined up for rebel-issued certificates of amnesty. Advancing rebel fighters passed army trucks and tanks abandoned on the side of the highway. There was little fighting. The main response from the government was sporadic airstrikes from Syrian and Russian warplanes. Among the dead was a Syrian photographer, Anas Alkharboutli, who worked for Germany’s DPA news agency. Friends mourned over his body, his press helmet and flak jacket laid on his chest. Overnight Saturday into early Sunday, the fighters marched unopposed into their greatest prize, the capital, Damascus. Assad and his family fled, ultimately taken in by his ally Russia. Assad's regime was deplored by many for its brutality and corruption. Insurgents and civilians celebrated his downfall by waltzing freely into his private residence and ransacking it. One man yanked a chandelier from the ceiling. A fighter posed for a photo behind a gigantic desk surrounded by luxurious furniture of wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl. A family posed in the palace’s grandiose atrium lined with colored marble beneath a giant chandelier. Others streamed into the biggest symbol of Assad’s police state, Saydnaya Prison, hoping to find relatives who had disappeared years or even decades earlier. One man held up nooses he found — a reminder of the mass executions that rights groups say killed thousands of inmates. Insurgents set fire to a military court building, where rights group say death sentences were churned out after perfunctory trials that often lasted just minutes. Some insurgents danced in the streets while others posed — cheering — on an army tank. Many waved the flag of the Syrian opposition, green, white and black with three red stars, instead of the Assad-era flag of red, white and black with two green stars. The insurgent takeover has pushed the country into the unknown. There is potential for more chaos with jihadi militants hoping to seize power and the possibility of conflicts between the many armed factions. But with the end of Assad’s rule, it is a time for celebration.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-fall-of-assad-photo-gallery-f4862a7f801eae711a69482f04b88c8a	2024-12-10T11:08:26-08:00	
Citizens against smog: Protesters in North Macedonia demand action against pollution	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — Thousands of protesters across North Macedonia took part in demonstrations Tuesday to demand better air quality in cities that are among the most polluted in Europe. In the capital, Skopje, demonstrators gathered outside the Environment Ministry, some wearing gas masks to highlight the problem blamed by authorities for some 3,500 premature deaths annually. Pollution levels often spike during the winter months due to the widespread use of log fires. Many urban households, unable to afford central heating, burn wood, old tires, plastic and other waste materials, releasing a toxic mix of harmful chemicals. Protest organizers called for rare national action after winter weather brought another spike in air pollution levels. They demand stricter government regulation of traffic and industry, citing decades of neglect. Gorjan Jovanovski, a prominent environmental campaigner who created a mobile app to monitor air quality, said pollution was forcing city-dwellers to flee as 'ecological migrants.' 'It’s enough! We have waited decades for governments to act, but they’ve done nothing,' Jovanovski said. According to European Union health authorities, pollution levels in Skopje and other Macedonian cities often exceed World Health Organization's limits by more than four times. Several thousands joined Tuesday's protests that were organized by Green Human City, one of several environmental campaign organizations largely focused on air pollution.	https://apnews.com/article/north-macedonia-pollution-protest-e865d9fcd676f6ba169dfc636aeb312d	2024-12-10T10:39:52-08:00	
Haitians demand protection after gang leader massacres dozens of people to avenge son's death	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A gang leader accused of killing more than 100 people in Haiti's capital to avenge his son's death was still persecuting residents on Tuesday, according to a rare witness account. Mackenson Cangé, whose father was among the victims, told Magik9 radio station that residents in the gang-controlled area said gunmen were still hunting down older people and killing younger ones as well. 'I believe in the justice of my country. But I’m tired of the government (only) condemning these massacres. We need to take action,' he said. Few details about the two-day killing spree in the community of Cité Soleil on Friday and Saturday have been made public. Residents have not been allowed to leave, and no images of the killings have been shared on social media like they often have been in previous incidents. A spokesman for Haiti’s National Police did not return messages for comment on Tuesday. Neither did the leader of a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police that deployed earlier this year to help quell gang violence in Haiti. For years, police have been unable to penetrate the gang-controlled area, and even human rights groups have not been able to access it this time, relying on witnesses who live there and often refuse to talk for fear of being killed. Two local human rights groups say more than 100 people were killed on Friday and Saturday, while Volker Türk, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said at least 184 people were killed. It isn't clear how they determined the number of victims. Numbers vary wildly following massacres in Haiti since they occur in areas with limited or no access. The killings blamed on gang leader Micanor Altès, also known as Monel Felix and Wa Mikanò, were triggered by his son’s illness and eventual death, according to the National Human Rights Defense Network and the Cooperative for Peace and Development. The two rights groups said Altès blamed Vodou religious leaders and older people in the community of practicing witchcraft and harming his son. On Tuesday, Haiti’s Office of Citizen Protection decried the killings, noting the victims were between 60 and 80 years old. The ombudsman agency said 'sorcery accusations never justify violence or summary executions. Older people, who have contributed so much to society, deserve respect and protection.' It called on police and judicial officials to react quickly and identify all those responsible. The Haitian Bridge Alliance, a U.S.-based nonprofit, also called for a thorough investigation on Tuesday as it demanded that the government improve security. 'This massacre is a profound tragedy that underscores the escalating crisis of gang violence and lawlessness in Haiti,' said Guerline Jozef, the alliance's executive director. Altès controls the coastal communities of Wharf Jérémie, La Saline and Fort Dimanche and is known for robbery, extortion and hijacking of goods and trucks, according to a U.N. report. Experts say he was not known for being as brutal as other Haitian gang leaders. Cangé said residents in Wharf Jérémie told him that gunmen are still hunting down older people and killing young ones as well. He said his father, Marcel Cangé, was killed after three men showed up at his home on Friday night and demanded he go with them. The older Cangé was already preparing for bed because he was going to church early Saturday and liked to be punctual. When he requested that the men allow him to put on a shirt and pants, they told him it wasn’t necessary, according to his son. 'I never believed something like that would happen to my father,' Mackenson Cangé said, noting he had lived in that community for 29 years. 'My father was assassinated. Stabbed and then burnt.' Cangé said he personally knows some 30 other people who were killed. His mother and sister, who lived with his father, survived. 'I lost a best friend, someone who supported me my whole life,' Cangé said. The gang-controlled area, like many others, remains inaccessible to police and other authorities. While the government has pledged to bring those responsible to justice, it wasn’t clear how it planned to do so. 'A red line has been crossed, and the state will mobilize all its forces to track down and destroy these criminals,' the government said in a statement Monday. More than 4,500 people have been reported killed so far this year in Haiti.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-massacre-killed-gangs-5fe82962c3111f433308ec1b28913857	2024-12-10T10:34:02-08:00	
Venezuela's opposition signals flexible timeline toward long-sought government transition	MADRID (AP) — Venezuela’s political opposition on Tuesday signaled a shift toward a flexible timeline for a government transition that it had long insisted would come next month when the new presidential term is set to begin. The change came as the faction’s candidate in the July presidential election, Edmundo González, remained in exile in Spain and its leader Maria Corina Machado continued to hide in Venezuela, both efforts meant to avoid arrest, with only 30 days left before Venezuela’s constitutionally mandated swearing-in ceremony. The move underscores the challenges the opposition coalition faces to deliver on its promise to remove President Nicolás Maduro from office, even as dozens of nations back the faction's claim to victory and denounce the government for electoral fraud. 'On January 10, the one who is against the wall is really Maduro, not us,' Machado said via livestream during an event in Madrid, that highlighted the repression ruling party opponents have faced since the July 28 election. 'When will that understanding really be reached and trigger the transition? It could be before, it could be on January 10, it could be after.' Machado did not give details of the 'terms of a negotiation' which she said the opposition has offered the government. But the faction has repeatedly said that a top priority is the release from prison of hundreds of people detained for being actual or perceived government opponents. Venezuela’s National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared him the election winner hours after polls closed. But unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. Meanwhile, the main opposition coalition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said the voting records showed González won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. The government ignored calls for transparency from inside and outside Venezuela, and instead, the ruling party-controlled National Assembly sent Maduro an invitation for his swearing-in ceremony. González left Venezuela in September for exile in Spain after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with an investigation into the publishing of the vote tally sheets, while Machado has been hiding for months at an undisclosed location, which she says is in Venezuela. González again told reporters Tuesday that he is willing to return to Venezuela to take office. 'I see myself assuming the position for which I was voted by the majority of Venezuelans on July 28,' he said without offering a timeframe. Dozens of governments, including the United States, have recognized González as the election winner, but it is unclear whether Maduro and allies would allow him to enter Venezuela. Anti-government protests erupted nationwide the day after the election, drawing repression from state security forces, which arrested more than 2,200 people, including political leaders, lawyers, poll workers, election volunteers and protesters, both minors and adults. Relatives of a few of the detained attended the event in Madrid and spoke of the conditions detainees face. The arrests had a chilling effect across the country, with people carefully choosing what they say in public or on social media. The move also hit the opposition's capacity to summon thousands to the streets. Not a single massive rally has taken place since August, but Machado sought to quelch doubts about the strength of her movement, arguing that it continues to gain 'more and more support' and characterizing the repression as the actions of a government 'in a terminal state.' 'We were told that it was impossible for us to defeat the regime on July 28, and we did,' she said. 'The voices that today want us to believe that it is not possible to enforce (the election’s result) will be wrong again. So, it is time to move forward firmly.'	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-election-president-maduro-opposition-machado-edmundo-f9edc6ec5276728eeea6446010b09c2a	2024-12-10T09:09:55-08:00	
Syrians in Germany worried by some politicians' eagerness for them to go home after Assad's fall	BERLIN (AP) — Nearly a decade after he arrived in Germany from Syria and took a selfie with then-Chancellor Angela Merkel, Anas Modamani has finished his university studies and has a German passport. He’s less positive about some German politicians’ reactions to the fall of Bashar Assad, which was followed within hours by the first talk of Syrians returning. 'Berlin has become my second home, I will definitely stay here,' Modamani said Tuesday. 'I managed it' — a reference to Merkel's famous slogan 'We will manage it,' coined as Germany faced the challenge of integrating hundreds of thousands of migrants. As Syrians took to the streets of Berlin Sunday, far-right leader Alice Weidel wrote on social platform X that anyone celebrating a 'free Syria' in Germany 'evidently no longer has a reason to flee. He should return to Syria immediately.' With a German election approaching and the government under longstanding pressure to reduce irregular migration, some mainstream opposition politicians also appeared eager to kickstart the return of Syrians. On Monday, prominent conservative lawmaker Jens Spahn suggested on n-tv television the government could say that 'for everyone who wants to go back to Syria, we will charter planes for them, they will get a starting fund of 1,000 euros ($1,055).' He stressed, though, that it will take time before it's clear whether things have stabilized. Such ideas strike Syrians as indecently hasty. Modamani, a 27-year-old from Damascus who came to Germany in 2015, said he was 'shocked' by reports of the 1,000-euro proposal. 'I think that’s a terrible idea,' he said as he sat over lunch with Syrian friends at a Berlin restaurant. 'The situation in Syria is still just as dangerous as before.' Modamani, who says he shares an apartment with his girlfriend from Ukraine and finished his studies in business communication, illustrates what German officials acknowledge is the successful integration of many Syrians. A deputy interior minister, Juliane Seifert, said Syrians are 'a group that has significantly above-average educational qualifications,' among them many doctors. The number of Syrians gaining German citizenship has risen from 6,700 in 2020 to 75,500 last year, when they were the biggest single group and accounted for 38% of all naturalizations. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, whose conservative party has talked tough on migration, said Tuesday that many Syrian refugees are now 'superbly integrated in our country, have a job and are urgently needed here' and no one is thinking of getting such people to leave Germany. 'Those who have already integrated well are still cordially welcome,' Herrmann told Deutschlandfunk radio Tuesday. 'But it is clear that there are also people who have been here for 10 years and don’t have a job and haven’t integrated well, and then it’s right to help them return to their homeland' if Syria stabilizes. It's not surprising that hopes of a more stable Syria raise hopes in Germany of reducing immigration. Official figures show that, at the end of October, there were nearly 975,000 Syrian nationals in Germany, a country of 83 million. The majority had some kind of refugee or other protected status. On Monday, Germany and a string of other European countries announced that they were suspending decisions on Syrians' asylum applications as they wait for the situation in Syria to become clearer. Over 47,000 cases are pending in Germany, one of the main destinations for Syrians outside the Middle East. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said that is the right thing to do, but it would be 'unserious to speculate in such a volatile situation' about the eventual return of Syrians. Among those who will may face a longer wait is Basil Khalil, a 26-year-old Kurdish Syrian who said he applied for asylum Monday after crossing from Turkey into Bulgaria and traveling to Germany on the back of a truck. Khalil said he spent the last nine years as a refugee in Turkey, but was worried that Turkish authorities may soon start deporting Syrians. 'I applied for asylum in Germany because I’m afraid that back in Syria I may get drafted as a soldier,' he told The Associated Press as his cousin translated for him. 'But if the German government will deport me, then I guess I will go back,' Khalil said. 'We Syrians have been through so much suffering, all we want to do is survive.' Tarek Alaows, a spokesperson for pro-refugee group Pro Asyl, said that 'many from the Syrian community naturally want to return ... Many want to participate in the reconstruction. But they must not be forced to leave the country' for a still-unstable Syria. Alaows, 35, who fled Damascus in 2015 and became a German citizen over three years ago, said many Syrians in Germany were concerned to hear public calls so soon for the quick return of Syrians. 'These debates that are going on right now — nobody needs them,' he said. Yamn Molhem, who arrived 10 years ago, sees it the same way. The 39-year-old father of four now manages the Aldimashqi restaurant on Berlin’s Sonnenallee boulevard, known for its many Arabic stores and businesses. 'All of my family has left Aleppo, and the situation in Syria is generally very unstable,' he said. Molhem said he is applying for a German passport, proudly adding that his youngest son already has one. ’They can’t deport our family,' said, 'My son is German.' In general, Molhem said, Germans should think twice before they even consider sending back Syrians who work, pay taxes and help keep the economy running. 'Syrians don’t just sleep here,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-syria-refugees-asylum-future-ab24be8f2ffef4e118ed12a4b0df110f	2024-12-10T08:04:27-08:00	
US says it will support new Syrian leaders who protect women and renounce terrorism	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Tuesday it will recognize and support a new Syrian government that renounces terrorism, destroys chemical weapons stocks and protects the rights of minorities and women. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the U.S. would work with groups in Syria and regional partners to ensure that the transition from President Bashar Assad’s deposed government runs smoothly. He was not specific about which groups the U.S. would work with, but the State Department has not ruled out talks with the main Syrian rebel group despite its designation as a terrorist organization. The qualified pledge of support for a post-Assad Syria comes as the Biden administration continues to look to target Islamic State fighters to prevent the group from reemerging as an international threat and maintains support for Israel as its forces conduct their own operations inside Syria. The sudden ouster of Assad has left President Joe Biden's outgoing administration having to delicately maneuver through yet another volatile moment in the Middle East and as President-elect Donald Trump demands that the United States tread carefully in the region and stay out of the fray. 'The transition process and new government must also uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbors, and ensure that any chemical or biological weapons stockpiles are secured and safely destroyed,' Blinken said. He added that Syrians should decide their future and that other countries should 'support an inclusive and transparent process' and not interfere. 'The United States will recognize and fully support a future Syria government that results from this process,' Blinken said. 'We stand prepared to lend all appropriate support to all of Syria’s diverse communities and constituencies.' The Assad government collapsed over the weekend during lightning strikes led by the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, known as HTS, which has been designated a 'foreign terrorist organization' by the U.S. since 2012. The State Department says it will review that designation if the group takes steps to reverse the reasons for it but says the listing itself does not prohibit discussions between its members and U.S. officials. Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, whom Trump has picked to serve as his national security adviser, said the 'jury is out' on HTS and its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani. 'On the one hand, though, he’s not, at least so far, beheading former Assad regime officials or hanging them from bridges. They do seem to be sitting and talking, which is a very, which is a good initial first sign,' Waltz said in a Fox News interview. 'But President Trump and our team are watching very closely., and we’re also watching very closely the tens of thousands of ISIS fighters and their, and their families that are still held in camps from when President Trump in his first term cleaned up and destroyed the ISIS caliphate.' The White House also signaled its approval of Israel’s strikes against Syrian military and alleged chemical weapons targets as well as the seizure of a buffer zone in the Golan Heights after the fall of the Assad government. 'These are exigent operations to eliminate what they believe are imminent threats to their national security,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday, saying the U.S. would leave it up to the Israelis to discuss their operations. 'They have, as always, the right to defend themselves,' Kirby said. He declined to say whether any U.S. intelligence cooperation with the Israelis may have gone into the strikes. Kirby said the White House was reasserting its support of the 1974 Golan Heights disengagement agreement, but he didn’t criticize the Israeli seizure of the demilitarized zone. The agreement on disengagement between Israel and Syria, which concluded the Yom Kippur War, established the buffer zone. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel's military is temporarily seizing control of the buffer zone, saying the disengagement agreement has collapsed with the rebel takeover of Syria. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar are condemning Israel’s deployment into Golan Heights, a plateau about 60 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Damascus. Israel seized the strategic highlands from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War and unilaterally annexed it in 1981. The U.S., during Trump's first White House term, became the only country to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan, which the rest of the international community regards as Israeli-occupied. Biden is dispatching his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Israel this week for talks with Netanyahu and Israelis officials about the situation in Syria and ongoing efforts to win a ceasefire and hostage deal that could bring an endgame to the war in Gaza. Sullivan is scheduled to meet on Tuesday at the White House with the families of American hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Kirby said while Israel and Hamas are 'not on the verge of completion of a deal,' U.S. officials think the evolving situation could bolster the chances of getting a deal done. 'Hamas has got to be looking out at the world today and realizing that the cavalry’s not coming to rescue them. and so one would hope that recent developments in Syria reinforce, for them, that they are just increasingly isolated and ought to take a deal,' Kirby said.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-united-states-assad-b02790878868ddb3d2f5bc887b66fd5e	2024-12-10T07:30:54-08:00	
US officials to investigate labor and human rights abuses in Nicaragua	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is opening an investigation into labor and human rights abuses in Nicaragua, impacting relations with a country the U.S. has a free trade deal with amid growing concerns over President Daniel Ortega’s increasingly authoritarian rule. The investigation being opened by the U.S. Trade Representative must be completed within a year. 'Numerous reports suggest the Government of Nicaragua is engaging in repressive acts that harm Nicaragua’s own workers and people, undermine fair competition, and destabilize our region,' U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a statement. The investigation, authorized under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, will look into not only allegations of abuse but also the extent to which they affect commerce with the U.S. Only after that determination is made will retaliatory actions, if any, be taken. The U.S. trade representative, in her statement, cited credible reports by several watchdog groups against Ortega's government, including politically-motivated arrests, forced labor, human trafficking and repression of freedom of association and collective bargaining. 'Such actions exacerbate worker exploitation and diminish economic growth and trade opportunities,' the agency said, adding that its decision to open the probe was part of a range of actions taken Tuesday to mark International Human Rights Day. Nicaragua Vice President and government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo did not immediately respond to an emailed request seeking comment. In May, the U.S. government imposed Section 301 tariffs on an array of Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel and aluminum. Those tariffs largely reflected the government’s conclusion that China was unfairly subsidizing those industries. 'For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies,' President Joe Biden said about those tariffs. 'It’s not competition, it’s cheating.' In Nicaragua’s case, any retaliatory action would be complicated by its membership in a regional free trade pact, the Central America Free Trade Agreement. Of the five members of the trade pact, Nicaragua is one of only two to run a trade surplus with the U.S., about $3 billion in 2022, or almost 20% of its gross domestic product. Ortega last month proposed a constitutional reform that would officially make him and his wife, Murillo, 'copresidents' of the Central American nation and extend the presidential term to six years from five. The proposals come amid an ongoing crackdown by the Ortega government that has resulted in the mass imprisonment and forced exile of adversaries including religious leaders and journalists. Since 2018, the government has shuttered more than 5,000 organizations, largely religious, and forced thousands to flee the country. — AP Writer Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/us-nicaragua-trade-investigation-labor-abuse-211917bda504c6b35a60c39709a71b2d	2024-12-10T07:09:32-08:00	
Japanese survivor of atomic bomb recalls its horrors in Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech	OSLO, Norway (AP) — A 92-year-old Japanese man who lived through the American atomic bombing of Nagasaki described on Tuesday the agony he witnessed in 1945, including the charred corpses of his loved ones and the ruins of his city, as he accepted this year's Nobel Peace Prize on his organization's behalf. The prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of Japanese atomic bombing survivors who have worked for nearly 70 years to maintain a taboo around the use of nuclear weapons. The weapons have grown exponentially in power and number since being used for the first and only time in warfare by the United States on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945. The bombings pushed Japan to surrender to the Allies. They killed some 210,000 people by the end of 1945, but the full death toll from radiation is certainly higher. As the survivors reach the twilight of their lives, they are grappling with the fear that the taboo against using the weapons appears to be weakening. It was a concern expressed by the 92-year-old-survivor, Terumi Tanaka, who delivered the acceptance lecture in Oslo's City Hall to an audience that included Norway's royal family. 'The nuclear superpower Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, and a cabinet member of Israel, in the midst of its unrelenting attacks on Gaza in Palestine, even spoke of the possible use of nuclear arms,' Tanaka said. 'I am infinitely saddened and angered that the nuclear taboo threatens to be broken.' That concern drove the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award this year's prize to the Japanese organization, though it had honored other nuclear non-proliferation work in the past. Jørgen Watne Frydnes, the chair of the committee, said in introducing the laureates that it was important to learn from their testimony as the nuclear dangers grow. 'None of the nine countries that possess nuclear weapons — the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea — appear interested in nuclear disarmament and arms control at present,' he said. 'On the contrary, they are modernizing and building up their nuclear arsenals.' He said the Norwegian Nobel Committee was calling upon the five nuclear weapon states that have signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons — the U.S., Russia, China, France and the U.K. — to take seriously their obligations under the treaty, and said others must ratify it. 'It is naive to believe our civilization can survive a world order in which global security depends on nuclear weapons,' Frydnes said. 'The world is not meant to be a prison in which we await collective annihilation.' In his speech, Tanaka described the attack on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. He recalled the buzzing sound of a bomber jet followed by a 'bright, white light,' and then an intense shock wave. Three days later, he and his mother sought out loved ones who lived near the hypocenter. 'Many people who were badly injured or burned, but still alive, were left unattended, with no help whatsoever. I became almost devoid of emotion, somehow closing off my sense of humanity, and simply headed intently for my destination,' he said. He found the charred body of an aunt, the body of her grandson, his grandfather on the brink of death with severe burns and another aunt who had been severely burned and died just before he arrived. In all, five family members were killed. He described the efforts of survivors to use their experiences to try to abolish nuclear weapons for the sake of humanity, and to try to receive compensation from the Japanese state, which started the war, for their suffering. 'I hope that the belief that nuclear weapons cannot — and must not — coexist with humanity will take firm hold among citizens of the nuclear weapon states and their allies, and that this will become a force for change in the nuclear policies of their governments,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/norway-nobel-japan-peace-prize-nuclear-9f39bcd5d6035fb1e75ac2030cf5c009	2024-12-10T07:00:55-08:00	
Negotiations over the war in Ukraine could start 'in the winter,' Poland's leader Tusk says	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s prime minister said Tuesday that negotiations over Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine could start 'in the winter,' as his country prepares to take over the rotating presidency of the European Union on Jan. 1. 'Our presidency will have, among others, joint responsibility for the shape of the political landscape, for what the situation will look like probably during the negotiations that, perhaps — there are still question marks here — will begin in the winter of this year,' Prime Minister Donald Tusk told his Cabinet. He said he hoped that the 'end effect' of Poland's and the EU's efforts will be peace in Ukraine. He offered no details of the efforts or any time frame. He didn't say who might be involved in the negotiations or where or when they might take place. Poland has been one of Ukraine's strongest backers against Russia's full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022. Poland will assume the EU presidency just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in the U.S. Trump has been pushing for an end to the war in Ukraine and during his campaign said that he could settle the matter in a day if he were elected. In a television interview that aired Sunday, Trump also said he would be open to reducing military aid to Ukraine and pulling the United States out of NATO. Those are two threats that have alarmed Ukraine, NATO allies and many in the U.S. national security community. Tusk said that he would be holding numerous meetings with political leaders concerning the situation relating to the war in Ukraine. Later Tuesday, he was meeting with Friedrich Merz, the head of Germany's CDU party, who was returning from talks in Kyiv with the Ukrainian government. Tusk will also speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. French President Emmanuel Macron is expected in Warsaw on Thursday, and Tusk said they will talk about meetings Macron recently held in Paris with Trump and Zelenskyy. Tusk said that Poland was taking the six-month EU presidency during a 'very dramatic' situation for the continent. Last week, he pointed to armed conflicts, also in Europe's vicinity, political crises some of Europe's biggest countries are going through and to the change in U.S. leadership. 'I would like it very much for Poland to be the country that will not only mark its presence all the time, but will also set the tone of the decisions that are to bring us security and safeguard Poland's interests,' Tusk told a government meeting.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-war-poland-tusk-negotiations-russia-eu-23802e5b26f5c0c1d45a32e9cc80f362	2024-12-10T05:36:21-08:00

Netanyahu is testifying in his corruption trial. He has been dogged by scandal for years	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the witness stand Tuesday for the first time in his long-running trial on corruption charges. But long before these accusations emerged, Netanyahu has been vexed by a flurry of embarrassing scandals and allegations. Netanyahu consistently and vehemently denies wrongdoing and has assailed investigations into his conduct or that of his family as witch hunts driven by a hostile media and a biased justice system. Here’s a look at some of the scandals that have beset Netanyahu, his family and his aides since he began to dominate Israel’s political scene. Submarine suspicions Close confidants of Netanyahu are suspected of receiving bribes to advance a deal to purchase submarines and other warships from Germany. Netanyahu is not a suspect in that case. But a state commission of inquiry looking into the affair earlier this year sent a letter to the prime minister warning him that he could be harmed by its conclusions. The committee did not detail the precise accusations against Netanyahu, but painted a picture of improper decision-making at multiple levels in government, the defense establishment and the military. He denies wrongdoing. Leaked and doctored documents A spokesperson for the Israeli leader has been charged with leaking classified information to German tabloid 'Bild' that indictments alleged harmed Israel's wartime security and interests. Netanyahu himself has not been accused of wrongdoing. Critics say the leak was meant to sway public opinion to be more in favor of Netanyahu's negotiating positions with Hamas, and diminish public pressure on him to reach a deal to release hostages held by the militants. Another Netanyahu aide is being investigated for doctoring documents, a move critics say was meant to protect Netanyahu from future investigations into his wartime conduct. Big spending In 2016, an official expense report revealed that Netanyahu spent more than $600,000 of public funds on a six-day trip to New York, including $1,600 on a personal hairdresser. Three years earlier, he was criticized for spending $127,000 in public funds for a special sleeping cabin on a five-hour flight to London. Netanyahu contended he was unaware of the cost and halted the practice. He also was forced to stop purchasing ice cream from an artisanal Jerusalem parlor after news erupted that his office ran up a $2,700 bill for his favorite flavors, vanilla and pistachio. His wife, Sara, has also been charged with misusing some $100,000 in public funds to order lavish meals from celebrity chefs at the prime minister’s official residence, even though she already had cooks on the government payroll. She agreed to pay $15,000 for misusing state funds as part of a plea deal. Allegations also mounted against the Netanyahus for using government money to purchase furniture for their private beach house and to cover the medical expenses of Sara Netanyahu’s late father. The attorney general ultimately dismissed the allegations. Flying high Netanyahu was suspected of double billing travel expenses and using state funds to cover personal travel in the 2000s, while he was finance minister and opposition leader. After a drawn-out investigation, the attorney general dismissed the case. Unhappy household Netanyahu's household staff has repeatedly accused Sara Netanyahu of explosive tirades and mistreatment. During Netanyahu’s first stint as prime minister, the family’s nanny said she was fired by Netanyahu’s wife for burning a pot of vegetable soup. The young woman said she was thrown out of the family’s home without her clothes or passport, and later was ordered to pick up her belongings dumped outside the front gate. Netanyahu’s office said the woman was fired because she was prone to violent outbursts. Two household aides have won damages in lawsuits accusing Sara Netanyahu of abusive conduct. In 2016, a Jerusalem court awarded one domestic worker over $42,000 in damages. Netanyahu and his wife have both rejected the accusations. In 2018, a recorded phone conversation surfaced of the prime minister's wife screaming at her publicist about how a gossip column omitted mention of her educational credentials. Joyride In 2018, a recording surfaced of Netanyahu’s eldest son, Yair, joyriding with his super-rich buddies to Tel Aviv strip clubs in a drunken night out in a taxpayer-funded government vehicle. He later apologized. The 33-year-old Netanyahu has also sparked controversy for lewd and offensive social media posts over the years, such as his publishing a caricature that drew on classic antisemitic tropes. Facebook briefly suspended his account after he wrote he would prefer an Israel without any Muslims. Mistress leak Back in the 1990s, rumors circulated that a videotape existed depicting Netanyahu and his image consultant, a married woman named Ruth Bar, in 'compromising romantic situations.' In response, Netanyahu went on television and confessed to adultery, even though the tape never turned up. Influence peddling During his first term in office in the 1990s, Netanyahu was suspected of appointing a crony as attorney general in exchange for political support from the ultra-religious Shas party. Prosecutors called Netanyahu’s conduct 'puzzling' but ultimately closed the case, citing lack of evidence. Lining pockets During that same spell in office, Netanyahu and his wife were suspected of pocketing gifts and foreign contributions received from world leaders — items considered state property. The Netanyahus also were suspected of accepting favors from a contractor. Both cases were closed without charges.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-netanyahu-corruption-trial-scandals-13d309b5513d8f18c67a7cb364b97533	2024-12-10T05:20:07-08:00	
France flies out 2 Mirage fighter jets from Chad to signal beginning of military withdrawal	PARIS (AP) — France flew out the two Mirage fighter jets it had stationed in Chad on Tuesday, signaling the beginning of the withdrawal of its military forces from the former French colony in Central Africa that last month broke off its defense cooperation agreement with Paris. The pair of Mirage 2000-D fighters took off after midday from a French base in the capital, N’Djamena, after Chadian military forces came to wish them farewell, and were returning to a French air force base in Nancy in eastern France, French military spokesman Col. Guillaume Vernet said. He added that negotiations with Chadian authorities were continuing on how and when France might withdraw other members of its 1,000-strong force in Chad, and whether all or just some of them will leave. In announcing the end of the defense cooperation agreement with France last month, the Chadian government described the decision as a historic turning point for the country that gained independence in 1960, and said that it would enable Chad to redefine its strategic partnerships in line with national priorities. Chad was one of the last countries in the region in which France maintained a large military presence, having been ousted in recent years from Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso after years of fighting Islamic extremists alongside regional troops. Those countries have inched closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel, the vast expanse below the Sahara desert. France has maintained about 1,000 troops in Chad. Chadian authorities didn’t specify when they have to leave and said the end of the defense agreement in no way calls into question the countries’ historical ties and that it wants to maintain relations in other areas of common interest. Last week, hundreds of people marched in N’Djamena to call for the withdrawal of French troops, chanting 'Chad for us, France out!' Some held banners that read, 'We do not want to see a single French person in Chad.'	https://apnews.com/article/france-chad-military-withdrawal-mirage-fighter-jets-6d98f486f122e0792b66397633aca3a8	2024-12-10T04:07:42-08:00	
Dutch police arrest 3 with possible links to huge apartment explosion that killed 6 in The Hague	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Dutch police said Tuesday that they have arrested three suspects who might have been involved in the explosion and fire that killed six people in an apartment building in The Hague over the weekend. Authorities had said they were investigating 'all possibilities' that could have caused the disaster, and the arrests indicate there might have been a criminal intent. 'More arrests are not excluded,' The Hague police said in a statement. It didn't elaborate on any reason for the arrests and said the three were seen as 'possibly implicated in the explosion.' Police also seized several vehicles, but they said that it was unclear whether they included the one which was seen driving away at high speed from the site shortly after the explosion. Early Saturday, residents of the northeastern neighborhood of Mariahoeve in The Hague heard the blast and screams before dawn, and authorities were still working at the scene of collapsed homes on Tuesday.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-gas-explosion-fire-apartments-hague-11f06d110ca7dc6ebc8a7eca73992a78	2024-12-10T03:45:14-08:00	
China's CATL forms joint venture with Stellantis to build electric vehicle battery factory in Spain	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Chinese electric battery company CATL and automaker Stellantis will build a major battery factory in northern Spain, the partners announced Tuesday. They said the plant will be located in Zaragoza and start producing lithium iron phosphate batteries by the end of 2026. The joint venture represents an investment of 4.1 billion euros ($4.3 billion), they said in a statement. The plant plans to be carbon neutral, apparently by making use of Spain's ample supplies of solar, wind and water power. The announcement comes after CATL and Stellantis agreed in November 2023 to collaborate on fabrication of batteries to help build electric cars in Europe. European carmakers are struggling to keep up with their Chinese counterparts in electric cars, a key pillar of the green transition that the European Union is pursuing. The bloc's 27 member states won’t be able to produce internal combustion cars after 2035. The EU, like the United States, is applying tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China to help protect domestic producers and encourage Chinese carmakers to move production to Europe and create local jobs. CATL and other Chinese battery makers are far ahead in the critical area of producing batteries for electric vehicles. Northvolt, Europe’s great hope for catching up, filed for bankruptcy last month. CATL is already producing batteries at two European factories in Germany and Hungary. The deal comes a day after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez met with CATL Chairman Robin Zeng in Madrid. Spain produces the second most cars in the EU after Germany. Sánchez posted on X that he was 'very satisfied' when the deal was made official. Spain’s Minister of Industry Jordi Hereu applauded the announcement, which he said received public funding from Europe’s post-pandemic recovery plan that includes Spain's ambitious plan to shift to electric vehicles. 'We all have a lot riding on the transition toward an electric transport model,' Hereu told reporters. 'Therefore we consider this investment to be a great sign that the car industry believes in Spain.' Stellantis includes the Chrysler, Citroen, Dodge, Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat, Opel and Alfa Romeo brands, among others. In Spain, Stellantis group has car factories in Zaragoza, Vigo and Madrid. The production of electric vehicles in Spain has risen from just 16,000 models in 2019 to 323,000 in 2023, but that is still 13% of the total output of 2.4 million vehicles produced, according to ANFAC, the Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers. Germany, which is now seeing layoffs in its car industry, led Europe with 4.1 vehicles of all types produced in 2023, ANFAC said. Volkswagen Group, through its Spanish affiliate SEAT, announced in 2022 its plans to build an electric battery plant in Spain's eastern Valencia region.	https://apnews.com/article/electric-car-batteries-china-spain-stellantis-catl-eaec84bbc375c8814c1030dab73f389b	2024-12-10T01:56:59-08:00	
Death toll in Italy fuel depot blast rises to 5	ROME (AP) — Rescuers found the body of the last missing person on Tuesday at the site of a fuel depot explosion in Italy's central Tuscany region, bringing the death toll to five, Italian media reported. The blast on Monday caused the collapse of a building with offices, injuring 14 people, Tuscany’s governor Eugenio Giani said, adding that two were in critical condition. The explosion struck an ENI fuel depot north of Florence, sending a dark plume of smoke into the air. Witnesses kilometers away reported a large bang and tremors. Residents were initially advised to keep their windows closed, but environmental officials later determined that the air quality was safe. The smoke temporarily interrupted regional train services. The cause of the blast at the depot in the town of Calenzano was under investigation. The flames were quickly contained, preventing the fire from spreading to storage tanks from a loading dock area where the explosion occurred. Prosecutors in the nearby city of Prato have started an investigation into the deadly blast.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-calenzano-eni-fuel-depot-explosion-deaths-116a9a499c9d041d6db943d3b8d53cb2	2024-12-10T00:38:36-08:00	
Hundreds protest in New Delhi against reported attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh	NEW DELHI (AP) — Hundreds of protesters rallied near the Bangladesh diplomatic mission in the Indian capital on Tuesday, pressing for an end to reported attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh after former premier Sheikh Hasina fled into exile in India in August. The protesters demanded an intervention by the United Nations, carrying banners and placards that criticized the world body for not doing more to address the problems in Bangladesh. They also rejected claims by interim government officials in Bangladesh that the targeting of minorities was an internal matter. 'It's a very serious attack, a very sustained attack on the lives of the (Hindu) minority,' said Veena Sikri, a former Indian ambassador to Bangladesh. Attacks on the livelihoods, homes and businesses of minorities in Bangladesh must stop, she said. Scores of social and cultural organizations joined the protest in New Delhi a day after top Foreign Ministry officials from the two countries, Vikram Misri and Mohammad Jashim Uddin, met in Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital, to discuss their strained relations. It was the first high-level visit to Bangladesh by an Indian official since massive protests ended Hasina’s 15-year rule. Following Hasina's ouster, minorities — and particularly Hindus — have reported widespread attacks in the Muslim-majority nation of Bangladesh, but Bangladesh says the reports are widely exaggerated. Most Bangladeshi Hindus are thought to support Hasina’s secular Awami League party. Tensions spiked over the recent arrest of a Hindu spiritual leader in Bangladesh, which is currently being run by an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. India also stopped issuing visas to Bangladeshis, except for emergency medical visas, after Hasina fled. Many Indian nationals working on infrastructure projects also left Bangladesh because of security threats. After Monday's meeting, Misri told reporters there was no reason for the mutually beneficial relationship between the two countries to deteriorate. 'To that end, therefore, I have underlined today India’s desire to work closely with the interim government of Bangladesh,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/indians-protest-bangladesh-diplomatic-mission-hindu-minority-attack-154c6cef14508507aab5a841846c4e21	2024-12-10T00:10:30-08:00	
Doctors say Brazil's Lula is recovering after surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is recovering in an intensive care unit after undergoing unplanned surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage, doctors said Tuesday. The procedure was performed after the 79-year-old leftist leader suffered complications resulting from a fall at home in October, doctors said. 'He is in a stable condition, talking normally and eating. He will remain under observation for the next few days,' Dr. Roberto Kalil with the Sirio-Libanes hospital in Sao Paulo told a press conference. There will be no aftereffects, doctors said, adding that Lula expected to return to the capital, Brasilia, at the beginning of next week. Until then, he will not be working, they said. Lula traveled from Brasilia in the early hours Tuesday to be treated in Sao Paulo, 1,000 kilometers south (620 miles). Doctors said the first lady was at his side and the president had no other visitors. Lula canceled a trip to Russia for a BRICS summit after the accident, his office said at the time. It left him with a cut visible on the back of his head, slightly above his neck. Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa sent his best wishes for a full and speedy recovery, according to a statement. Colombia's President Gustavo Petro posted his wishes on X, calling Lula a 'comrade.'	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-surgery-recovering-icu-bb058df92bf29fb67a5fb1d44700aa39	2024-12-09T23:45:07-08:00	
Israeli warplanes pound Syria as troops reportedly advance deeper into the country	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Israel carried out a wave of heavy airstrikes across Syria as its troops advanced deeper into the country, a Syrian opposition war monitor said Tuesday. Israel denied its forces were advancing toward Damascus after they pushed into a buffer zone inside Syria following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. Associated Press reporters in the capital heard heavy airstrikes overnight and into Tuesday on the city and its suburbs. Photographs circulating online showed destroyed missile launchers, helicopters and warplanes. There was no immediate comment from the insurgent groups — led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS – that have taken control of much of the country. Their lightning advance brought an end to the Assad family’s half-century rule after nearly 14 years of civil war. There are concerns over what comes next. ‘Damascus is more beautiful now’ Life in the capital is slowly returning to normal after the overthrow of Assad, who fled the country over the weekend and has been granted political asylum in Russia. Private banks reopened on instructions from the Central Bank, said Sadi Ahmad, who runs a branch in the upscale Abu Rummaneh neighborhood. He said all his employees returned to work. Shops also reopened in the city's ancient Hamidiyeh market, where armed men and civilians could be seen buying things like perfume and ice cream. A clothing shop owner, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said he hoped vendors would no longer have to pay bribes to security officials. At Bakdash, a famous ice cream shop, a poster outside read: 'Welcome to the rebels of free Syria. Long live free Syria.' 'Damascus is more beautiful now,' said Maysoun Qurabi, who was shopping in the market. 'It has a soul, and people feel at ease and secure.' Under Assad, she said, 'people were hungry and scared. The regime was strong.' Israeli incursion draws condemnation In the immediate aftermath of Assad's fall, Israeli forces moved into a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) buffer zone inside Syria that had been established after the 1973 Mideast war, a move it said was taken to prevent attacks on its citizens. Israel has also said it is striking suspected chemical weapons sites and heavy weapons to prevent them from falling into the hands of extremists. Israeli officials rarely acknowledge individual strikes. Israel has a long history of seizing territory during wars with its neighbors and occupying it indefinitely, citing security concerns. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally, except by the United States. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has closely tracked the conflict since the civil war erupted in 2011, said Israel has carried out more than 300 airstrikes across the country since the rebels overthrew Assad. The Observatory, and Beirut-based Mayadeen TV, which has reporters in Syria, said Israeli troops are advancing up the Syrian side of the border with Lebanon and had come within 25 kilometers (15 miles) of Damascus, which the Israeli military denied. Israel denies advancing toward Damascus Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said 'the reports circulating in the media about the alleged advancement of Israeli tanks towards Damascus are false.' He said Israeli troops are stationed within the buffer zone in order to protect Israel. Israel's military had previously said troops would enter the buffer zone 'and several other places necessary for its defense.' Israeli media meanwhile reported that the air force was methodically destroying Syria's military assets to ensure whoever rules the country next would have to rebuild them. The operations 'have been systematically destroying all that remains of the escaped tyrant’s military,' wrote Yossi Yehoshua, the military correspondent for Israel's largest daily, Yediot Ahronot. 'Dozens upon dozens of targets, including arms depots of various kinds, have been hit in waves of attacks so as to prevent them from falling into hostile hands and from posing a threat to Israel.' The air force 'currently enjoys complete freedom of action,' he added. Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have condemned Israel’s incursion, accusing it of exploiting the disarray in Syria and violating international law. Turkey, which has been a main backer of the Syrian opposition to Assad, also condemned Israel’s advance. The Turkish Foreign Ministry accused Israel of'displaying a mentality of an occupier' at a time when the possibility of peace and stability had emerged in Syria. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Monday said Israel's incursion constitutes a violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement and called on both Israel and Syria to uphold it. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut and Lidman from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Frieder Reimold, journalist who wrote AP’s iconic ‘East Germany opens borders’ bulletin, dies at 80	BERLIN (AP) — Frieder Reimold, a former Berlin bureau chief of The Associated Press German-language service who wrote the iconic 1989 bulletin that East Germany had opened its borders, has died. He was 80. Reimold died Thursday in Berlin of complications related to cancer, his daughter Nancy Stephan told the AP. He began working for AP as a political correspondent in Bonn in the late 1970s after entering journalism on a German newspaper. After months of overtime writing about upheaval and protests in East Germany, Reimold, who had by then become the Berlin bureau chief of AP’s German-language service, settled in on Nov. 9, 1989, to watch a televised evening briefing by Günter Schabowski, a member of the communist country’s Politburo. History didn’t give Reimold a break that night. About an hour into the rambling news conference, Schabowski mentioned that East Germany was lifting all restrictions on travel across its border into West Germany. Pressed on when the new regulations would take effect, he looked at his notes and stammered, 'As far as I know, this enters into force ... this is immediately, without delay.' The remark was so offhanded that it took Reimold a little time to recognize the implications of the statement — that East Germany was opening the Berlin Wall and the heavily fortified border with West Germany. Carefully, Reimold then typed out what has become his iconic alert: 'DDR öffnet Grenzen' — 'East Germany opens borders.' 'This was the alert that changed the course of the night,' Reimold said during an interview with the AP in 2019, when Germany celebrated the 30-year-anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. 'The alert sped up a development that sooner or later would have been inevitable in any case.' Reimold sent out his alert at 7:05 p.m. Other wire services alerted the news as well, but none went so far that moment as to say that Schabowski’s announcement in fact meant that East Germany had opened its border. His alert is widely seen as having helped nudge the process along, and in a nod to its significance his words are today immortalized in a plaque in the sidewalk on Bornholmer Strasse, the border crossing where people first walked over from East to West. Frieder Reimold was born on April 21, 1944, in the Bavarian village of Irschenhausen. His family moved to Hannover in northern Germany a couple of years later when his father took a job at a museum there. After graduating from high school, Reimold left Germany for Canada, where he first stayed with relatives and later worked in logging before attending university in Vancouver to study languages, his sister Sabine Reimold told the AP. During his three decades with the AP, Reimold worked as political correspondent in Bonn, led the Berlin bureau and later covered the foreign ministry. He also spent several years in Vienna reporting on the upheavals created by the war in Yugoslavia. 'He was a terrific journalist and dear friend who helped me a great deal during the Cold War when I was a correspondent for the Associated Press in Bonn,' in the 1980s, Susan Cornwell, a retired former AP reporter, said in an email from Washington D.C. 'Frieder was always ready to explain the political and historical background to the events I was covering. I used to call him the ‘spazierendes Brockhaus'' — a walking German encyclopedia, Cornwell remembered. He 'knew details about key German political figures and was especially good at helping me understand the historical backdrop for events going on at that time, from the rise of the Greens party to NATO’s deployment of Pershing II missiles in West Germany,' she said. Annette Ramelsberger, another colleague, who covered the fall of the Berlin Wall and its aftermath with Reimold at the AP German service, remembered him as very smart and accurate, and at the same time as a caring and supportive manager with a fine sense of humor. 'It was great to go together with him through this wild time,' Ramelsberger, who now works for German daily newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, said. After his retirement in 2009, Reimold took on archery and enjoyed working in his garden at his home in Stahnsdorf, on the outskirts of Berlin, friends said. He was also very interested in history, culture and traveling, his sister said. Reimold 'was always a journalist, always conscientious, always put his own feelings aside,' his niece Rebekka Reimold said. 'The facts were important to him — even in the last days of his life, when he spoke soberly about the facts concerning his illness and its consequences.' ___ Randy Herschaft contributed reporting from New York.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-frieder-reimold-associated-press-dies-6e92d49a09cd9e549f1afd6ed6e19a87	2024-12-09T23:33:04-08:00	
Greyhound racing is increasingly rare worldwide. New Zealand now plans to outlaw the practice	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand plans to outlaw greyhound racing because too many dogs are hurt or killed, the government said Tuesday, spelling an end to the practice in one of the few countries where it still operates. The racing of greyhounds as a betting sport was wildly popular at times last century. But the number of dogs euthanized due to race-day injuries, or because homes cannot be found for them after their short careers end, has provoked animal welfare campaigns and growing public distaste for the sport. Commercial greyhound racing continues in the United States, Australia, the U.K. and Ireland, with only two tracks remaining in the U.S. after many states ended the practice. New Zealand’s ban is not yet law but has universal political support. The government plans to stop the racing from Aug. 1, 2026, to allow the 2,900 racing dogs to be rehomed and more than 1,000 people employed in the industry to find other work, Racing Minister Winston Peters said Tuesday. Unease over animal welfare New Zealand’s greyhound racing industry has faced repeated reviews in recent years over its dog safety record, with multiple reports urging sweeping changes. Peters said the industry had made progress -– but not enough. Stricter policies governing when dogs can be euthanized, and rehoming programs that send retired New Zealand greyhounds abroad as pets when homes cannot be found domestically, have reduced the numbers killed each year. But the percentage of dogs injured 'remains persistently high,' Peters said. 'The time has come to make a call in the best interest of the animals,' he said. Greyhound Racing New Zealand, an industry group, accused the government of not recognizing improvements made, including its commitment to tracking the care of every retired dog for the rest of its life. Tuesday’s announcement was 'a devastating blow,' said chair Sean Hannan. The animal welfare organization SPCA praised the government for showing 'compassion for dogs made to work in a dangerous gambling industry.' The practice has long been out of favor in New Zealand, spokesperson Arnja Dale said. A racing industry in global decline Some lawmakers in parliament on Tuesday described the racing industry’s end as inevitable following the steady decline of greyhound racing worldwide. Commercial racing operates in four other countries. In the U.S., its popularity peaked in the 1980s and the number of states allowing the practice has dwindled since then amid reports of dog mistreatment and the explosion of other gambling options. Only two tracks remain -– both in West Virginia -– after Iowa, Arkansas and Florida shuttered their racing industries. Greyhounds have become popular as pets in the U.S., and New Zealand has sent dozens of dogs to new owners there when homes could not be found in the country of 5 million people. Greyhound racing is also legal in Australia, where critics have decried the practice, and the rules governing it vary by state. Commercial racing currently operates throughout the U.K. and Ireland, but the Scottish parliament is considering a ban there. The practice remains legal in Mexico and Vietnam, but there are no longer operational tracks in either country, according to information supplied by Peters’ office. A swift legal change to protect dogs Hours after it announced the end to greyhound racing, New Zealand's government rushed through a law to prevent dogs from being killed while the industry winds down, unless a veterinarian deems it unavoidable. This will prevent owners from euthanizing dogs for economic reasons, Peters said. Lawmakers unanimously agreed to the change. The law shutting down the industry will take longer, however, and is not expected to pass until next year after a period of public submissions. All political parties support the ban.	https://apnews.com/article/greyhound-racing-ban-zealand-dogs-welfare-11159c996fa5e5ee6602bbbb4e6a40e4	2024-12-09T22:31:27-08:00

Middle East latest: Netanyahu prepares to testify in court in a corruption trial	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to testify in court on Tuesday, facing charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three separate cases. Netanyahu has repeatedly requested to delay his testimony because of the conflicts roiling the Middle East but was mostly denied by the courts. The long-running trial comes as Netanyahu is already facing accusations by critics in Israel of dragging out the war in Gaza and putting off a cease-fire deal that could release some 100 hostages who remain in the territory after 14 months of war triggered by the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in the Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, according to local health authorities. They say most of the dead are women and children but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250, including older adults and children. Meanwhile, U.S. prosecutors have accused two senior Syrian officials of overseeing a notorious prison that tortured peaceful protesters and other political prisoners, including a 26-year-old American woman who was later believed to have been executed. The indictment was unsealed Monday, two days after a shock rebel offensive overthrew Syrian President Bashar Assad. The U.S., U.N. and others accuse him of widespread human rights abuses in a 13-year battle to crush opposition forces seeking his removal from power. Assad fled to Russia, where he received asylum from his longtime ally. ___ Here's the Latest: Israeli military official says troops plan to seize a buffer zone inside Syria TEL AVIV, Israel — An Israeli military official says troops plan to seize a buffer zone inside Syria as well as 'a few more points that have strategic meaning.' The official spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The official dismissed reports of a larger Israeli invasion as 'rumors.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israeli forces were moving to control a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized buffer zone in Syrian territory. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. Following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad, Israel sent troops into the buffer zone. It said the move was temporary and was aimed at preventing attacks. It said the 1974 agreement establishing the zone had collapsed and that Syrian troops had withdrawn from their positions. Israel has also carried out airstrikes across Syria in recent days targeting what it says are suspected chemical weapons and long-range rockets. Egypt and Saudi Arabia have condemned Israel’s incursion, accusing it of exploiting the disarray in Syria and violating international law. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move not recognized by the international community, except for the United States. The rest of the world views the strategic plateau as occupied Syrian territory. ___ From AP journalist Joseph Krauss. Israeli air force has launched hundreds of airstrikes in Syria, war monitor says DAMASCUS, Syria — Israel’s air force has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Syria as its ground forces move north of the Golan Heights along the border with Lebanon, according to an opposition war monitor. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Tuesday that since the fall of President Bashar Assad’s government, Israel’s air force has carried out more than 300 airstrikes against research centers, arms depots and military infrastructure across Syria, as well as a naval base along the Mediterranean coast. Associated Press journalists in Damascus witnessed intense airstrikes on the city and its suburbs overnight into Tuesday morning. Photographs posted online by activists showed destroyed missile launchers, helicopters and warplanes. Meanwhile, Israeli troops marched along the border with Lebanon and now control a long stretch on the Syrian side facing Lebanon’s Rashaya region, according to the war monitor's head, Rami Abdurrahman, and the Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV, which has reporters in Syria. Israeli troops are now about 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Damascus, according to the monitor. Saudi Arabia condemns Israeli incursion into a buffer zone in Syria DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Saudi Arabia has condemned Israel’s incursion into a buffer zone in Syria and a wave of Israeli airstrikes launched after the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that 'the assaults carried out by the Israeli occupation government, including the seizure of the buffer zone in the Golan Heights, and the targeting of Syrian territory confirm Israel’s continued violation of the principles of international law and its determination to sabotage Syria’s chances of restoring its security, stability and territorial integrity.' Israel sent troops into a buffer zone inside Syria that had been established after the 1973 Mideast war. It said the move was temporary and was taken to prevent any cross-border attacks after Syrian troops withdrew. Israel has also carried out heavy airstrikes that it says are aimed at preventing suspected chemical weapons and long-range rockets from falling into the hands of extremists. Saudi Arabia has been in talks with the United States in recent years over normalizing relations with Israel in exchange for a U.S. defense pact, American assistance in establishing a civilian nuclear program and a pathway to the establishment of a Palestinian state. But the kingdom has also repeatedly condemned Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip, where it is at war with the Hamas militant group. Last month, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and day-to-day ruler Mohammed bin Salman accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, allegations Israel adamantly rejects.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-10-december-2024-90bc663aea10628735f8c1acd75664d4	2024-12-09T21:57:57-08:00	
Is it a military drill? China deploys ships and planes around Taiwan but remains mum	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China's secretive military appears to be up to something around Taiwan, but it's unclear exactly what. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that it had detected a dozen Chinese naval ships and 47 military planes in the past 24 hours but no live-fire activity as in previous drills. Taiwan's military has been bracing for possible exercises by China in response to a recent overseas trip by Taiwan's president that included Hawaii and Guam, an American territory. Without any Chinese announcement, Taiwan officials are calling it training, said Taiwanese Lt. Gen. Hsieh Jih-sheng, while noting that training can become drills, and drills can become war. 'It’s in the status of regular training,' he said at a news conference. 'But under the status of normalized training, it’s able to mobilize military forces on such a large scale and carry out exercises in such a large area.' China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and opposes the self-governing island having official interactions with other countries, and in particular, the United States. Lai spoke with with U.S. congressional leaders by phone while in Guam last week. While the U.S., like most of the world, doesn't formally recognize Taiwan a a country, it is the largest supplier of arms to the island of 23 million people for its defense. China, which views Lai as a separatist, held major military exercises around Taiwan following his inauguration in May and his National Day speech in October. It also held a major drill after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022. Taiwan's military set up an emergency response center on Monday in response to increased Chinese naval activity and the announcement of flight restrictions in seven zones off China's east coast. The restrictions are in place until Wednesday. 'We have noticed that there are no live-fire drill activities in the seven exercise areas as planned in the past,' said Hsieh, who heads the office of the deputy chief of general staff for intelligence.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-military-drills-training-d1da8a88fab175fc816b919b384ac964	2024-12-09T21:28:01-08:00	
Israel's Netanyahu vows to challenge 'absurd' corruption charges as he takes the stand in his trial	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised defiantly on Tuesday to knock down corruption allegations against him as he began testifying in his long-running trial, becoming the first sitting Israeli leader to take the stand as a criminal defendant. The testimony is another low point for Israel’s longest-serving leader, who also faces an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war in Gaza. In his opening testimony in a packed Tel Aviv courtroom, Netanyahu argued that he was a dedicated leader and a defender of Israel’s interests, swatting away the charges against him as a 'drop in the sea' compared to the challenges he has faced protecting his country. But the charges have torn open divisions in Israel and complicated Netanyahu's legacy, which has also been tainted by the war in Gaza and the growing international isolation Israel faces because of it. Speaking freely and appearing at ease, Netanyahu said he could balance appearing at his trial with his duties as prime minister at a time when Israel is still fighting a war in Gaza and contending with the fall of Bashar Assad in neighboring Syria. 'I waited eight years for this moment, to say the truth,' Netanyahu said, standing at a podium, with his son Avner and several members of his Likud party seated on the courtroom benches. He said his testimony would 'poke holes in the absurd accusations.' Netanyahu will answer during his court appearances to charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. He is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assistance with personal and business interests. He is also accused of promoting advantageous regulations for media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage of himself and his family. Netanyahu, 75, denies wrongdoing, saying the charges are a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media and a biased legal system out to topple his lengthy rule. His testimony caps years of scandals that have swirled around him and his family, who have gained a reputation as enjoying a lavish lifestyle at taxpayers' expense. Netanyahu's testimony is taking place in an underground, fortified courtroom for security reasons. Outside the courthouse, dozens of protesters gathered, both supporters of Netanyahu and his opponents. A banner draped outside read 'Crime Minister' as each side chanted slogans. Some families of hostages held in Gaza also demonstrated. At the start of his testimony, a judge told Netanyahu he had the same privileges as other witnesses and could sit or stand as he chose. Netanyahu told his version of events and shared personal details about his life that he might hope would shape the judges’ perception of him. He said at the start of his career in public service he would lose sleep over media coverage but learned it had no meaningful bearing — in contrast to the prosecution’s attempts to paint him as image-obsessed. He said he smoked cigars but could hardly finish them because of his workload, and hated champagne. Ahead of the testimony's start, Netanyahu’s lawyer, Amit Hadad, accused the Israeli justice system of making up the charges in an attempt to ensnare Netanyahu. 'There was a huge effort … to find a few pieces of a puzzle that don’t connect to each other,' Haddad said, as Netanyahu sat on a bench behind him. 'In court, in the light of day, we see everything falls apart.' The testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu’s working hours, prompting critics to ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran. His lawyer asked that he be allowed to receive notes while testifying to help ensure he could continue running the country, and at some points during the trial, Netanyahu did. Under Israeli law, indicted prime ministers are not required to step down. But the charges against Netanyahu cleaved deep divisions in Israel, with protesters demanding he resign and former political allies refusing to serve in government with the Israeli leader, triggering a political crisis that led to five elections in less than four years beginning in 2019. Netanyahu’s supporters view the charges as the result of bias and overreach by the justice system. Despite the pressure, Netanyahu has rejected calls to step down and has used his position as prime minister to lash out at law enforcement, media and courts. An Israeli court rejected a request by Netanyahu’s lawyers to reduce the expected number of hours of testimony, as well as several other requests to delay its start, which they said were necessary because of the prime minister’s busy schedule and the country’s significant challenges. A verdict isn’t expected until 2026 at the earliest and Netanyahu will have the option to appeal to the Supreme Court. Since the trial began in 2020, the court has heard prosecution witnesses in the three cases, including some of Netanyahu’s once closest aides who turned state witnesses. The prosecution has tried to portray the prime minister as an image-obsessed leader who broke the law to improve his public perception. Netanyahu’s testimony could further tarnish his image at a complicated time. His popular support dropped after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, with the public blaming his leadership for failing to prevent the assault, and if elections were held today he would struggle to form a government. Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza with no end in sight, despite heavy international pressure to wind down the war, as well as pressure from the families of hostages held in Gaza and their supporters to bring their loved ones home. The Israeli leader along with his former defense minister also face an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes charges related to the war in Gaza. The warrant puts Netanyahu in the same company as Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-netanyahu-corruption-trial-gaza-478c957c7749986d5b8b2d039f670d54	2024-12-09T21:08:44-08:00	
US defense secretary in Japan to support alliance as Osprey aircraft safety causes concern	TOKYO (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with officials in Japan on Tuesday to reaffirm the importance of their alliance and Washington's commitment to regional security as threats rise from China and North Korea. Austin also stressed that U.S. trilateral cooperation with Tokyo and Seoul is crucial for regional stability even as South Korea is in political turmoil following President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived declaration of martial law last week. Austin’s visit also came amid growing concerns over the safety of Osprey military aircraft, which have been grounded in the United States following a near crash at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico last month. The incident, caused by weakened metal components, was similar to a fatal crash off southwestern Japan last year. The U.S. measure prompted Japan to also ground its Ospreys. After confirming details with the U.S. military, Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force has suspended operations of its 17 Ospreys, except for possible disaster relief and other missions, beginning Tuesday to prioritize safety, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters. During their meeting, Austin and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba noted the collapse of the Syrian government and praised the strength of the Japan-U.S. alliance at a time of rapid global political change. 'The world can change drastically in a week,' Ishiba told Austin, referring to political unrest in South Korea and Syria. The U.S. defense chief, whose term ends in January when President-elect Donald Trump takes office, told Ishiba that he appreciated the steady alliance with Japan during 'very dynamic times' and that he was proud of the modernization of alliance command and control, strengthening of force posture and deterrence capabilities over the past several years. Austin later met with Japanese counterpart Gen Nakatani and noted China's 'coercive behavior' in the East and South China Seas, North Korean support for Russia's war in Ukraine as growing challenges. Austin underlined U.S. commitment 'to advancing our historic trilateral cooperation' with South Korea. Washington's commitment of 'extended deterrence,' including its nuclear umbrella, to Japan and South Korea is 'iron clad,' he added. Nakatani earlier told reporters that cooperation between Japan and the U.S., as well as with South Korea and other partners, is important as tensions escalate in the region. The trilateral partnership between Japan, the U.S. and South Korea has significantly strengthened under President Joe Biden’s administration, but faces new uncertainty amid ongoing political unrest in South Korea, which already led to the cancellation of Austin's planned trip to that country. On Monday, Austin greeted crew members of the USS George Washington, a nuclear-powered flagship aircraft carrier docked at the U.S. Navy base in Yokosuka, near Tokyo. Austin stressed the importance of U.S. cooperation with allies and partners in the region as he singled out China as the only country in the world with the intent and capability to change the rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific, according to the U.S. Defense Department. 'We want to see this region remain open to freedom of navigation and the ability to fly the skies in international airways,' Austin was quoted as saying on the Defense Department's website. 'We will work with allies and partners to ensure we can do just that,' he added. The U.S. carrier, which is under maintenance in Yokosuka, will carry the advanced F-35C stealth combat aircraft squadron currently based in the Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in the southwestern Japanese prefecture of Yamaguchi. ___ Mayuko Ono contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-us-defense-austin-alliance-korea-osprey-d5d4319cb9b5ce687f951b8c50689664	2024-12-09T20:44:57-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares mostly higher as Chinese stocks are lifted by latest stimulus	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares in Asia were mostly higher on Tuesday as Chinese shares were buoyed by an apparent shift in Beijing toward easier credit and other forms of stimulus for the sluggish economy. Shares in market superstar Nvidia fell 0.6% in afterhours trading extending a 2.6% loss after China said it’s investigating the company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws. The Shanghai Composite index surged 1.6% to 3,456.12 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 1%, at 20,618.18. At a meeting announced late Monday, top Chinese leaders agreed on a 'moderately loose' monetary policy for the world’s second-largest economy. That’s the first move in 10 years away from a more cautious, 'prudent' stance. A major planning meeting expected Wednesday could also bring more stimulus for the Chinese economy. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 0.5% to 39,335.74 while the Kospi in South Korea jumped 2.3%, recovering some of its recent losses as the country's recent political turmoil simmered on. On Tuesday, South Korean prosecutors were seeking to formally arrest the former defense minister alleged to have colluded with President Yoon Suk Yeol in imposing martial law last week, as both men are being investigated on rebellion and other charges. Taiwan's Taiex shed 0.8% as the government said China’s military appeared to be preparing for widely anticipated drills in response to a recent visit by its president, Lai Ching-te's visits to Hawaii and Guam. Taiwan’s defense ministry said Monday that it has detected Chinese naval and coast guard ships entering the Taiwan Strait and the western Pacific and that China had restricted airspace along its southeast coast through Wednesday. The moves ratchet up tensions after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he would not commit to defending Taiwan if China were to invade during his presidency. Elsewhere in the region, Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.4% to 8,389.30. Markets in Thailand were closed for a holiday. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6% to 6,052.85, coming off its 57th all-time high of the year so far. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.5% to 44,401.93, and the Nasdaq composite pulled back 0.6% to 19,736.69. Nvidia’s decline was by far the heaviest weight on the S&amp;P 500. It has skyrocketed to become one of Wall Street’s most valuable companies because its chips are driving much of the world’s move into artificial-intelligence technology. That gives its stock’s movements more sway on the S&amp;P 500 than nearly every other. U.S.-listed stocks of several Chinese companies climbed, including a 12.4% jump for electric-vehicle company Nio and a 7.4% rise for Alibaba Group. Stocks in Shanghai. The week’s highlight for Wall Street will arrive midweek when the latest updates on inflation arrive. Economists expect Wednesday’s report to show consumer inflation was little changed last month. A separate report on Thursday, meanwhile, could show an acceleration in inflation at the wholesale level. They’re the last big pieces of data the Federal Reserve will get before its meeting next week on interest rates, where it is expected to cut its main interest rate for the third time this year. The Fed has been easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high since September help the slowing jobs market, after bringing inflation nearly down to its 2% target. In the oil market early Tuesday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude gave up 44 cents to $67.93 per barrel. It rallied 1.7% Monday to settle at $68.37 following the overthrow of Syrian leader Bashar Assad, who sought asylum in Moscow after rebels. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 39 cents to $71.75 per barrel. On Monday it added 1.4% to $72.14 per barrel. The price of gold rose 0.3% to $2,693.10 per ounce after gaining 1% a day earlier amid the uncertainty created by the end of the Assad family’s 50 years of iron rule.

Biden is rushing aid to Ukraine. Both sides are digging in. And everyone is bracing for Trump	WASHINGTON (AP) — The grinding war between Ukraine and its Russian invaders has escalated ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration, with President Joe Biden rushing out billions of dollars more in military aid before U.S. support for Kyiv’s defenses is thrown into question under the new administration. Russia, Ukraine and their global allies are scrambling to put their side in the best possible position for any changes that Trump may bring to American policy in the nearly 3-year-old war. The president-elect insisted in recent days that Russia and Ukraine immediately reach a ceasefire and said Ukraine should likely prepare to receive less U.S. military aid. On the war's front lines, Ukraine's forces are mindful of Trump's fast-approaching presidency and the risk of losing their biggest backer. If that happens, 'those people who are with me, my unit, we are not going to retreat,' a Ukrainian strike-drone company commander, fighting in Russia's Kursk region with the 47th Brigade, told The Associated Press by phone. 'As long as we have ammunition, as long as we have weapons, as long as we have some means to defeat the enemy, we will fight,' said the commander, who goes by his military call sign, Hummer. He spoke on condition he not be identified by name, citing Ukrainian military rules and security concerns. 'But, when all means run out, you must understand, we will be destroyed very quickly,' he said. The Biden administration is pushing every available dollar out the door to shore up Ukraine's defenses before leaving office in six weeks, announcing more than $2 billion in additional support since Trump won the presidential election last month. The U.S. has sent a total of $62 billion in military aid since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. And more help is on the way. The administration is on track to disperse the U.S. portion of a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, backed by frozen Russian assets, before Biden leaves the White House, U.S. officials said. They said the U.S. and Ukraine are in 'advanced stages' of discussing terms of the loan and close to executing the $20 billion of the larger loan that the U.S. is backing. Biden also has eased limits on Ukraine using American longer-range missiles against military targets deeper inside Russia, following months of refusing those appeals over fears of provoking Russia into nuclear war or attacks on the West. He's also newly allowed Ukraine to employ antipersonnel mines, which are banned by many countries. Biden and his senior advisers, however, are skeptical that allowing freer use of the longer-range missiles will change the broader trajectory of the war, according to two senior administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. But the administration has at least a measure of confidence that its scramble, combined with continued strong European support, means it will leave office having given Ukraine the tools it needs to sustain its fight against Russia for some time, the officials said. Enough to hold on, but not enough to defeat Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces, according to Ukraine and some of its allies. Even now, 'the Biden administration has been very careful not to run up against the possibility of a defeated Putin or a defeated Russia' for fear of the tumult that could bring, said retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, a former supreme allied commander of NATO. He is critical of Biden’s cautious pace of military support for Ukraine. Events far from the front lines this past weekend demonstrated the war's impact on Russia’s military. In Syria, rebels seized the country’s capital and toppled Russia-allied President Bashar Assad. Russian forces in Syria had propped up Assad for years, but they moved out of the way of the rebels’ assault, unwilling to take losses to defend their ally. Biden said it was further evidence that U.S. support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was wearing down Russia’s military. Trump, who has long spoken favorably of Putin and described Zelenskyy as a 'showman' wheedling money from the U.S., used that moment to call for an immediate ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. And asked in a TV interview — taped before he met with Zelenskyy over the weekend in Paris — if Ukraine should prepare for the possibility of reduced aid, Trump said, 'Yeah. Probably. Sure.' Trump's supporters call that pre-negotiation maneuvering by an avowed deal-maker. His critics say they fear it shows he is in Putin's sway. Zelenskyy said Monday that Russian forces’ retrenchment from outposts worldwide demonstrates that 'the entire army of this great pseudo-empire is fighting against the Ukrainian people today.' 'Forcing Putin to end the war requires Ukraine to be strong on the battlefield before it can be strong diplomatically,' Zelenskyy wrote on social media, repeating near-daily appeals for more longer-range missiles from the U.S. and Europe. In Kursk, Hummer, the Ukrainian commander, said he notices Russian artillery strikes and shelling easing up since the U.S. and its European allies loosened limits on use of longer-range missiles. But Moscow has been escalating its offensives in other ways in the past six months, burning through men and materiel in infantry assaults and other attacks far faster than it can replace them, according to the Institute for the Study of War. In Kursk, that includes Russia sending waves of soldiers on motorcycles and golf carts to storm Ukrainian positions, Hummer said. The Ukrainian drone commander and his comrades defend the ground they have seized from Russia with firearms, tanks and armored vehicles provided by the U.S. and other allies. Ukraine’s supporters fear that the kind of immediate ceasefire Trump is urging would be mostly on Putin’s terms and allow the Russian leader to resume the war when his military has recovered. 'Putin is sacrificing his own soldiers at a grotesque rate to take whatever territory he can on the assumption that the U.S. will tell Ukraine that U.S. aid is over unless Russia gets to keep what it has taken,' Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at Scotland’s University of St. Andrews, wrote on his Substack channel. Putin's need for troops led him to bring in North Korean forces. Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range missiles more broadly in Russia was partly in response, intended to discourage North Korea from deeper involvement in the war, one of the senior administration officials said. Since 2022, Russia already had been pulling forces and other military assets from Syria, Central Asia and elsewhere to throw into the Ukraine fight, said George Burros, an expert on the Russia-Ukraine conflict at the Institute for the Study of War. Any combat power that Russia has left in Syria that it could deploy to Ukraine is unlikely to change battlefield momentum, Burros said. 'The Kremlin has prioritized Ukraine as much as it can,' he said. ___ Novikov reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-military-aid-russia-biden-efbcff8ed068e621055e8fa70b5905e1	2024-12-09T20:07:59-08:00	
Here's how the US is countering the Islamic State group during Syria's upheaval	WASHINGTON (AP) — Massive U.S. airstrikes on Islamic State militants in Syria were meant in part as a message to the group and a move to ensure that it doesn't try to take advantage of the chaos following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad's government. The U.S. and its partners want to make sure the Islamic State group, which still has a presence in Syria, can't step into the leadership void and once again exert control over wide swaths of the country, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Monday. The U.S. on Sunday struck about 75 IS targets in the Syrian desert. The U.S. has had troops in Syria for the last decade to battle IS. The tumult following a rebel offensive that toppled Assad has raised fears of an Islamic State resurgence. 'ISIS will try to use this period to reestablish its capabilities, to create safe havens,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday, using another acronym for the group. 'As our precision strikes over the weekend demonstrate, we are determined not to let that happen.' So far, U.S. officials are saying that they do not plan an increase in American forces in Syria but are focused on making sure those already there are safe. Here's a look at the U.S. fight against the Islamic State group: What's the U.S. military presence in Syria? The U.S. has about 900 troops and an undisclosed number of contractors in Syria, largely at small bases in the north and east, with a small number farther south at the al-Tanf garrison closer to the Iraq and Jordan borders. U.S. special operations forces also routinely move in and out of the country but are usually in small teams and are not included in the official count. Islamic State militants seized large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014, declaring a caliphate. The U.S. gathered a coalition of allies and was able to defeat IS in Iraq in 2017. The U.S. partnered with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, and after fierce fighting, ultimately declared an end to the caliphate in Syria in 2019. Remnants of the militant group remain, including as many as 10,000 fighters held in SDF-run detention facilities in Syria and tens of thousands of their family members living in refugee camps. And IS fighters have been more active over the past year or so, including in attacks against U.S. and Kurdish forces in Syria. The country has been wracked by violence and competing interests. Russia has a naval port in the north, and while there have been fewer Russian forces in the area since the onset of the war in Ukraine, the U.S. maintains a deconfliction phoneline with Moscow to avoid any troop miscalculations on the ground or in the air. Iran also has had a significant presence, often using Syria as a transit route to move weapons into Lebanon for use by Hezbollah militants against Israel. The al-Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria is located on a vital road that can link Iranian-backed forces from Tehran all the way to southern Lebanon and Israel’s doorstep. So troops at the U.S. garrison can try and disrupt those shipments. Why is the U.S. striking Islamic State targets? The U.S. has, over the past decade, routinely targeted IS leaders, camps and weapons in Syria to keep the group at bay and prevent it from coalescing. In the past year, as Israel's war with Hamas widened into a broader conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, attacks by Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria as well as by the Islamic State group have escalated. As a result, the U.S. has kept up a steady drumbeat of counterattacks against all the groups, including against IS camps in the desert, where fighters found safe haven. Officials say that while the group is vastly weaker than in 2014, it still maintains thousands of militants in Syria. On Sunday, the U.S. launched one of its larger, more expansive assaults against IS camps and operatives in the desert, taking advantage of the Assad government's downfall. The U.S. bombed at least 75 targets in about five locations using B-52 bombers, A-10 attack aircraft and F-15 fighter jets. 'Does it send a message? I mean, I think it absolutely sends a message that we use B-52s, A-10s and F-15s,' Singh told reporters. She had no other details on the result of the strikes. What's next for the U.S. in Syria? The Biden administration insists the U.S. will not get involved in Syria's war or the overthrow of the Assad government. But the U.S. and its allies have deep interests in Syria, including the efforts to defeat IS, disrupt Iran-backed groups and contain the remnants of al-Qaida and other terror groups that have found sanctuary. 'I think it is a harbinger of more instability and the potential for more political violence,' Chris Costa, former senior director for counterterrorism in the first Trump administration, said last week before the fall of Damascus. Costa spent decades in the U.S. Army and ran special operations in combat zones. 'I think there’s the potential for ISIS again to make trouble not just for the Iraqis but also be emboldened in the region.' Alex Younger, who led Britain’s foreign intelligence agency, MI6, between 2014 and 2020, said a big concern is the 'very large number of ISIS detainees left over from the destruction of the caliphate.' Younger told the BBC that IS remnants are 'currently contained by the Kurdish groups in the east, but if they go off the job, you can expect a serious spike in the threat posed to Europe by ISIS.' Who will rule Syria? Another problem is figuring out who's in charge. The opposition forces that stormed into Damascus and sent Assad fleeing to Russia are led by a group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, that originally was part of al-Qaida, but split a number of years ago. HTS is considered a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. Its leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has sought to reassure Syrians that the group is more moderate. U.S. officials say that while he may be saying some of the right things, they are adopting a wait-and-see attitude for now. White House national security spokesman, John Kirby, told CNN News Central on Monday that while HTS 'was the vanguard' they aren't the only opposition group involved. 'We’re going to be working through all the processes we can, including at the U.N., to make sure that there is adequate communication with these opposition groups and that we are all working together,' he said. Singh said she is not aware of any formal U.S. channel of communications with the group. But, she said, 'We have other ways of getting messages through, you know, groups and other allies in the region.' ___ Associated Press reporters Eric Tucker and Sagar Meghani in Washington and Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-islamic-state-united-states-airstrikes-b4e72b3fd8fff4e9364597a1ca817803	2024-12-09T20:05:26-08:00	
Thousands scour Syria's most horrific prison but find no sign of their loved ones	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — They came from all over Syria, tens of thousands. The first place they rushed to after the fall of their longtime tormentor, former President Bashar Assad, was here: Saydnaya Prison, a place so notorious for its horrors it was long known as 'the slaughterhouse.' For the past two days, all have been looking for signs of loved ones who disappeared years or even decades ago into the secretive, sprawling prison just outside Damascus. But hope gave way to despair Monday. People opened the heavy iron doors lining the hallways to find cells inside empty. With sledgehammers, shovels and drills, men pounded holes in floors and walls, looking for what they believed were secret dungeons, or chasing sounds they thought they heard from underground. They found nothing. Insurgents freed dozens of people from the Saydnaya military prison on Sunday when Damascus fell. Since then, almost no one has been found. 'Where is everyone? Where are everyone’s children? Where are they?' said Ghada Assad, breaking down in tears. She had rushed from her Damascus home to the prison on the capital’s outskirts, hoping to find her brother. He was detained in 2011, the year that protests first erupted against the former president's rule – before they turned into a long, grueling civil war. She didn’t know why he was arrested. 'My heart has been burned over my brother. For 13 years, I kept looking for him,' she said. When insurgents last week seized Aleppo — her original hometown — at the start of their swiftly victorious offensive, 'I prayed that they would reach Damascus just so they can open up this prison,' she said. Civil defense officials helping in the search were as confused as the families over why no further inmates were being found. It appeared fewer were held here in recent weeks, they said. But few were giving up, a sign of how powerfully Saydnaya looms in the minds of Syrians as the heart of Assad’s brutal police state. The sense of loss over the missing — and the sudden hope they might be found -- brought a kind of dark unity among Syrians from across the country. During Assad’s rule and particularly after the 2011 protests began, any hint of dissent could land someone in Saydnaya. Few ever emerged. In 2017, Amnesty International estimated that 10,000-20,000 people were being held there at the time 'from every sector of society.' It said they were effectively slated for 'extermination.' Thousands were killed in frequent mass executions, Amnesty reported, citing testimony from freed prisoners and prison officials. Prisoners were subjected to constant torture, intense beatings and rape. Almost daily, guards did rounds of the cells to collect bodies of inmates who had died overnight from injuries, disease or starvation. Some inmates fell into psychosis and starved themselves, the human rights group said. 'There is not a home, there is not a woman in Syria who didn’t lose a brother, a child or a husband,' said Khairiya Ismail, 54. Two of her sons were detained in the early days of the protests against Assad – one of them when he came to visit her after she herself had been detained. Ismail, accused of helping her son evade military service, spent eight months in Adra prison, northeast of Damascus. 'They detained everyone.' An estimated 150,000 people were detained or went missing in Syria since 2011 — and tens of thousands of them are believed to have gone through Saydnaya. 'People expected many more to be here ... They are clinging to the slightest sliver of hope,' said Ghayath Abu al-Dahab, a spokesman for the White Helmets, the search and rescue group that operated in rebel-held areas throughout the war. Five White Helmet teams, with two canine teams, came to Saydnaya to help the search. They even brought in the prison electrician, who had the floor plan, and went through every shaft, vent and sewage opening. So far, there were no answers, Abu al-Dahab said. He said the civil defense had documents showing more than 3,500 people were in Saydnaya until three months before the fall of Damascus. But the number may have been less by the time the prison was stormed, he said. 'There are other prisons,' he said. 'The regime had turned all of Syria into a big prison.' Detainees were held in security agencies, military facilities, government offices and even universities, he added. Around the Y-shaped main building of the prison, everyone kept trying, convinced they could find some hidden chamber with detainees, dead or alive. Dozens of men tried to force a metal gate open until they realized it led only to more cells upstairs. Others asked the insurgents guarding the prison to use their rifle to lever open a closed door. A handful of men were gathered, excavating what looked like a sewage opening in a basement. Others dug up electrical wiring, thinking it might lead to hidden underground chambers. In a scene throughout the day, hundreds cheered as men with sledgehammers and shovels battered a huge column in the building’s atrium, thinking they had found a secret cell. Hundreds ran to see. But there was nothing, and tears and loud sighs replaced the celebrations. In the wards, lines of cells were empty. Some had blankets, a few plastic pots or a few names scribbled on walls. Documents, some with names of prisoners, were left strewn in the yard, the kitchen and elsewhere. Families scoured them for their loved ones’ names. A brief protest broke out in the prison yard, when a group of men began chanting: 'Bring us the prison warden.' Calls on social media urged anyone with information of the secret cells of the prison to come forth and help. Firas al-Halabi, one of the prisoners freed when insurgents first broke into Saydnaya, was back on Monday visiting. Those searching flocked around him, whispering names of relatives to see if he met them. Al-Halabi, who had been an army conscript when he was arrested, said he spent four years in a cell with 20 others. His only food was a quarter loaf of bread and some burghul. He suffered from tuberculosis because of the cell conditions. He was tortured by electrocution, he said, and the beatings were constant. 'During our time in the yard, there was beating. When going to the bathroom, there was beating. If we sat on the floor, we got beaten. If you look at the light, you are beaten,' he said. He was once thrown into solitary for simply praying in his cell. 'Everything is considered a violation,' he said. 'Your life is one big violation to them.' He said that in his first year in the prison guards would call out hundreds of names over the course of days. One officer told him it was for executions. When he was freed Sunday, he thought he was dreaming. 'We never thought we would see this moment. We thought we would be executed, one by one.' Noha Qweidar and her cousin sat in the yard on Monday, taking a rest from searching. Their husbands were detained in 2013 and 2015. Qweidar said she had received word from other inmates that her husband was killed in a summary execution in prison. But she couldn’t know for sure. Prisoners reported dead in the past have turned up alive. 'I heard that (he was executed) but I still have hope he is alive.' Just before sundown on Monday, rescue teams brought in an excavator to dig deeper. But late at night, the White Helmets announced the end of their search, saying in a statement they had found no hidden areas in the facility. 'We share the profound disappointment of the families of the thousands who remain missing and whose fates are unknown.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-saydnaya-prison-assad-families-search-9f533d54b4df72f97416f90921dd2a9c	2024-12-09T20:05:04-08:00	
Soros' Open Society Foundations say they remain focused on human rights	NEW YORK (AP) — Despite years of internal turmoil and changes, Open Society Foundations wants those in the human rights sector to know their movements will still receive support from the organization, its president Binaifer Nowrojee said Tuesday. The foundations, founded by billionaire investor George Soros and now led by one of his sons, Alex Soros, have historically been one of the largest funders of human rights groups. But since 2021, they closed some of their programs and reduced their staff as part of a major internal reorganization. In the process, many grantees and others in the human rights movement have waited anxiously to see where the chips would fall. 'A reimagination has taken place under the leadership of the new board chair at Open Society Foundations,' Nowrojee said, referring to Alex Soros. 'One of the reasons that we wanted to really reiterate in a large way, with balloons, et cetera, that we are still committed to human rights, is because of this fear that’s permeated with the changes that somehow Open Society Foundations is no longer going to be working on rights or equity or justice,' she said in advance of Human Rights Day, which the United Nations observes on Dec. 10. Nowrojee offered few new details about OSF's specific funding priorities, though earlier this year, the foundations committed $400 million toward green jobs and economic development. Another new program focuses on protecting environmental defenders that will work in a few countries, like Colombia and the Democratic Republic of Congo and end after five years, said Sharan Srinvias, a director of programs at OSF. 'We did a survey of what other donors are supporting and in general, we saw that this is where the gap is,' he said of people who come under attack for defending land, water or other resources. 'Especially bilateral donors find it much easier to support global organizations, who in turn are able to support prominent rights defenders in capital cities who are well known.' One benefit of the limited time horizon, Srinvias said, is his team will mostly make grants of three or five years — longer than OSF's typical grants — and offer grantees more flexibility. It will also have some funds to respond to emergencies for human rights defenders all over the world. In 2020, OSF was the largest global human rights funder, giving out the most money overall and making the largest number of grants. That's according to the Human Rights Funders Network, a membership organization of grantmakers that tracks philanthropic funding for human rights groups. 'When major funders adjust their priorities, it can have a ripple effect. Their decisions can dramatically impact the human rights movements they once supported, especially in regions where they’ve been a long-time champion,' HRFN wrote in its most recent Advancing Human Rights report from September. To add to the atmosphere of uncertainty, another major human rights funder, Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, announced earlier this year that it would end its work by 2028. OSF's board aims to employ 600 people in total around the world, Nowrojee said, which is down from a reported 800 in 2021. Some of the changes OSF made in the last three years include winding down its global public health program and significantly diminishing its programs in the European Union. It spun off its area of work focused on Roma communities into a new organization and issued final grants to many of its partners. 'You never want philanthropy to just be doing the same thing. You want philanthropy to be getting out of stuff,' Nowrojee said. 'And so there’s large areas of work where huge achievements were made, which we have retreated from, not because we don’t think that there’s value in them, but the movements themselves have strengthened.' People who worked for OSF's public health program and some of their grantees have spoken about its impacts over almost three decades through an oral history project led by University of Southern California Institute on Inequalities in Global Health and funded by OSF. Jonathan Cohen, who led the OSF public health program and now holds positions at USC, told an interviewer with the oral history project about a decision in 2020 by OSF's leadership to take funding from its programs and reallocate it to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 'That claw-back in April should have been a sign, I think, to all of us that we were not long for this world,' Cohen said, of the public health program. 'But of course, you don’t accept that. You fight. You resist. You try to keep your program, which is what we did until we couldn’t.' Among the movements that OSF had supported under its public health program was the the Network of Sex Work Projects, a global coalition of sex worker groups. It formed in 1992 in part in response to the killing of sex workers who had HIV, said Ruth Morgan Thomas, who was NSWP's global coordinator for many years, as part of the oral history project. She said she was saddened to see the closure of OSF's public health work. 'I hope as it reemerges and its global strategy reemerges, it will retain its stance and support for promoting the realization of sex workers’ rights and inclusion in our societies,' she said. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

China's exports slow, imports decline, in November falling below forecasts	HONG KONG (AP) — China’s exports slowed in November and its imports declined, falling below forecasts and underscoring potential weakness in trade at a time when its leaders are striving to boost the economy after the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Customs data Tuesday showed exports grew 6.7% from a year earlier, down from a 12.7% increase in October. Analysts had estimated that exports had risen more than 8%. Imports fell 3.9% from a year earlier, reflecting weak demand from industries and consumers. With exports outpacing imports, China’s trade surplus rose to $97.4 billion. The report came a day after Beijing pledged to loosen monetary policy and provide more support for the world’s No. 2 economy. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs of 60% or more on imports of Chinese goods, complicating Beijing's efforts by threatening an area of the economy that has performed relatively well while the property sector remains in the doldrums and consumer spending remains fragile. Some analysts say that the latest setbacks are likely to be temporary. 'We expect exports to accelerate again in the coming months, supported by gains in export competitiveness and exporters front-running tariffs,' Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a note. 'Import volumes declined last month, but they are likely to recover in the short run as accelerated fiscal spending boosts demand for industrial commodities,' she said. The effects of tariffs will likely only be felt in the middle of 2025, Huang wrote. In another sign of slack demand, consumer inflation in November was a lower-than-expected 0.2%, according to data released Monday, down from 0.3% the month before mainly due to lower food prices. But late last month, an official survey by the National Bureau of Statistics showed China's factory activity expanding for a second consecutive month in November, rising to 50.3, the highest figure reported in seven months. A reading above 50 suggests growth while below 50 represents a contraction. The revival in factory orders may also reflect efforts to beat higher tariffs, analysts said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-trade-exports-economy-47d2788059c9dabbb2905120d16f6ea9	2024-12-09T19:42:05-08:00	
South Korean prosecutors seek to arrest ex-defense minister over martial law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean prosecutors are seeking to formally arrest the former defense minister alleged to have colluded with President Yoon Suk Yeol in imposing martial law last week, as authorities are investigating whether their acts amount to rebellion. Martial law lasted only about six hours but was the first of its kind in more than 40 years and has caused a domestic firestorm and large street protests. Yoon and his associates face criminal investigations and impeachment attempts. The Justice Ministry has banned Yoon and eight others from leaving the country as authorities see them as key suspects in the martial law case. It’s the first time that a sitting president in South Korea has received such a travel ban. The Seoul Central District Court said Tuesday it’ll review prosecutors' request for a warrant to arrest former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber to unanimously reject Yoon’s decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Dec. 4. Kim released a statement through his law firm, saying that he 'deeply apologizes for causing significant anxiety and inconvenience.' He said that all responsibility over the martial law enforcement rests solely with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers deployed to enforce martial law, saying they were only following orders. If the arrest warrant is issued, Kim would be the first person arrested over the martial law case. Prosecutors would have up to 20 days to investigate Kim and determine whether to indict him. A conviction on the charge of rebellion would carry up to the death penalty. Prosecutors reportedly accuse Kim of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power by staging a riot to disrupt the constitution in collaboration with Yoon and other military and police officers. Prosecutors' offices in Seoul couldn't immediately confirm the reports. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun, to obstruct lawmakers from entering the National Assembly’s main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim’s instructions was to prevent the assembly from gathering the required 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon’s martial law order. Kwak is among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended him last week. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' but South Korea wasn’t in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean constitution doesn’t allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed the need to rebuild the country by eliminating 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces' in a reference to his liberal rival rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has been on a near-constant collision course with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which has introduced motions seeking to impeach some of his top officials and launched a fierce political offensive against Yoon over a spate of scandals involving him and his wife. The focus of attention is how authorities could investigate Yoon and whether they can detain him. South Korean law gives a president immunity from prosecution while in office, except for allegations of rebellion or treason. This means that Yoon can be questioned and detained by investigative agencies over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. They also say the security service won’t likely permit searches of Yoon’s office, citing a law that prohibits searches on sites with state secrets without approval from those in charge of those areas. In the case of former President Park Geun-hye, who was thrown out of office in 2017 after being impeached by parliament over a corruption scandal, prosecutors failed to search her office and ended up receiving documents outside the compound because presidential officials turned them away. After refusing to meet with prosecutors while in office, Park underwent questioning by them and was arrested after the Constitutional Court approved her impeachment and ruled to dismiss her as president in March 2017. Yoon avoided impeachment Saturday, after most ruling party lawmakers boycotted a floor vote. The Democratic Party said it would prepare for a new vote to impeach Yoon on Saturday. The party on Tuesday submitted motions to impeach Yoon’s police chief and justice minister as well. It pushed to impeach Kim Yong Hyun and the safety minister, but they resigned before parliament votes took place. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If it voted for removal, a new presidential election would be required.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-defense-minister-c07fea5a701d5d708bfc236b3b81ee6f	2024-12-09T19:40:33-08:00	
Argentina’s Milei marks one year in office. Here's how his shock measures are reshaping the economy	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — When libertarian President Javier Milei assumed office one year ago, Argentine supermarkets were marking price increases on an almost daily basis. Middle-class families tried to spend their rapidly depreciating pesos as quickly as they got them, and economists warned the country was teetering on the brink of hyperinflation. It was popular outrage over this upside-down economy that fueled the rise of Milei, a self-declared 'anarcho-capitalist' and former TV pundit who rode to power on vows to 'blow up' the central bank, take an axe to the bloated government and kill sky-high inflation. It was an almost impossible job, and Milei's lack of government experience, unkempt hairdo, sexual boasts and missionary-like zeal for his dead dog, the Rolling Stones and the free market didn't inspire much confidence in a country with a history of failed economic reforms. 'It wasn’t a given that he could govern Argentina when he took office,' said Marcelo J. García, Americas director at geopolitical risk firm Horizon Engage. 'He was Mr. Nobody.' On taking power, Milei implemented a series of austerity measures, including slashing energy and transportation subsidies, laying off tens of thousands of government workers, freezing public infrastructure projects and imposing wage and pension freezes below inflation. It has been brutal. Unemployment has climbed, economic activity has declined and poverty has surged. But now signs have emerged that Argentina’s bizarre and long mismanaged economy is starting to look a little more normal. Monthly inflation has plummeted, bonds have rallied and the closely watched gap between the black market dollar and the official rate has shrunk as much as 44%. Argentina's country-risk index, an influential measure of the risk of default, is at its lowest point in five years. 'He reaches the anniversary at the best moment of his administration,' García said. Inflation: a priority Inflation, Argentina's perpetual scourge and Milei's top priority upon coming to office, slowed from a monthly rate of 25.5% in December 2023 to just 2.7% in October — its lowest level in three years. 'Inflation has gone down faster than what everyone has expected,' said Ignacio Labaqui, a Buenos Aires-based senior analyst at risk consultancy Medley Global Advisors. 'That’s something that validates his narrative and sustains his popularity.' In a sign of Milei's long way to go — and the unmitigated shambles he inherited — Argentina's annual inflation rate remains at 193%. But Argentines are paying closer attention to month-to-month inflation, taking the sharp decline as a sign that Milei’s fiscal shock therapy is paying off. 'Last year it was a shock to the system, I couldn’t keep up with the prices,' said 34-year-old deli worker Jazmin Quintana. 'I’m not saying I like the guy, I find his personality very weird and aggressive, but I admit — if he continues on this route I’ll be very happy.' A stronger peso A stronger peso is also boosting confidence. The black market dollar price has dropped since July, narrowing its gap with the official rate of 980. Chileans, once accustomed to bargain-hunting in Argentina, are now surprised to see the traffic reversed. Shoppers unable to afford iPhones and kitchen appliances in Argentina arrive at Chilean border towns by the busload to get the most bang from their buck. The customs office shut down briefly last month because officials were overwhelmed. Underpinning the currency appreciation is a new tax amnesty to lure Argentines to declare their hidden U.S. dollar savings — longs squirreled away in offshore bank accounts and under mattresses. Ahead of the first-phase deadline on Oct. 31, the scheme drew some $19 billion into Argentina’s banks, the tax agency reported, boosting scarce foreign exchange reserves. But a strong peso also carries risks — squeezing domestic industry by making exports more costly, deterring investors and raising fears of a crash. Foreign visitors are warned of higher prices as peak tourism season begins. 'The prices are INSANE,' reads a popular Reddit post about travel in Argentina, filled with cautionary tales of $50 dinners and $100 T-shirts. Painful consequences Argentina's first budget surplus in 12 years has come at a steep cost. Milei halted inflation increases for university budgets, leaving some universities struggling to keep their lights on and elevators running. He downgraded the culture ministry, closed the national theater institute, shuttered a state-funded news agency and defunded scientific research. He suspended public works projects, leaving cities littered with white-elephant structures. An estimated 200,000 construction workers lost their jobs in the last year, says the Argentine Chamber of Construction. The brutal austerity has deepened Argentina's recession, with consumer spending falling 20% percent in the past year and poverty rates soaring to a two-decade high of 52.9% in the second half of last year. Argentina’s retirees are perhaps the most potent symbol of the strife inflicted by Milei’s fiscal shock. Some of the government’s biggest savings came from holding down the real value of pensions. The average minimum monthly pension is just $300. 'We have always been in bad shape, but now things are even harsher,' said Rubén Cocurullo, 76, among dozens of pensioners protesting at the social welfare office in Buenos Aires last week. 'Do they want to kill us?' An uncertain future In a country with a long history of raucous street protests, it's striking that the mass unrest pundits predicted last year has not materialized. That his approval ratings have held up at some 50% is also a sign of how desperately Argentines wanted change after years of crisis. 'Strangely enough, there comes a time in all societies, when the cost of a fiscal adjustment becomes less than the cost of continuing with inflation,' said Sebastián Mazzuca, an Argentine political scientist at Johns Hopkins University. 'It’s like a fire. There are badly injured people, but the fire was put out, wasn’t it?' It helps Milei that Argentina's left-leaning Peronist opposition is in disarray, with former President Alberto Fernández charged with beating his ex-wife while in office. Many also attribute the social peace to Milei’s expectation management. He warned that things would get worse before they got better. But now, as an ebullient Milei declares his government the most successful in history and assures Argentines they’ll soon collect on the economic revival he pledged would follow the pain, the bar is getting higher even as risks remain. To fulfill his promise of transforming the heavily regulated nation into one of the world’s freest economies, Milei needs to lift strict currency controls. That requires a fresh infusion of cash or a new deal with the International Monetary Fund, which would relieve pressure on the billions of dollars in debt repayments due next year. Foreign investors, as well as the IMF, to which Argentina owes an unprecedented $44 billion, have expressed excitement about Milei’s changes. But, still haunted by Argentina’s 2001 crisis — which culminated in the largest foreign-debt default in modern history — they’re cautious. 'Argentina still seems to be mired in a major ‘wait and see’ period,' said consulting firm Zuban Córdoba and Associates in a report on Milei’s first year. The radical populist hopes to profit from his budding bromances with President-elect Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk. As president of the biggest shareholder of the IMF in 2018, Trump was key to Argentina securing a record $56 billion loan package. The three men dined and danced together at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida last month. Milei claims his brutal cost-cutting inspired Trump and Musk to plan their so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Last week the Conservative Political Action Conference brought its traveling program to Buenos Aires, where Milei and right-wing political figures railed against socialism, praised Trump and pledged to battle what they saw as the global scourge of liberal 'woke-ism.' 'Everyone assumed that we were going to fail politically,' Milei told the cheering crowd. 'Today they admit, through gritted teeth, that they are surprised.' ___ Associated Press reporter Debora Rey contributed to this report. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-trump-musk-default-economy-inflation-libertarian-18efe55d81df459792a038ea9e321800	2024-12-09T19:20:26-08:00	
Mass evacuation of Philippine villages underway after a brief but major volcanic eruption	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — About 87,000 people were being evacuated in a central Philippine region Tuesday a day after a volcano briefly erupted with a towering ash plume and superhot streams of gas and debris hurtling down its western slopes. The latest eruption of Mount Kanlaon on central Negros island did not cause any immediate casualties, but the alert level was raised one level, indicating further and more explosive eruptions may occur. Volcanic ash fell on a wide area, including Antique province, more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) across seawaters west of the volcano, obscuring visibility and posing health risks, Philippine chief volcanologist Teresito Bacolcol and other officials said by telephone. At least six domestic flights and a flight bound for Singapore were canceled and two local flights were diverted in the region Monday and Tuesday due to Kanlaon’s eruption, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines. The mass evacuations were being carried out urgently in towns and villages nearest the western and southern slopes of Kanlaon which were blanketed by its ash, including in La Castellana town in Negros Occidental where nearly 47,000 people have to be evacuated out of a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) danger zone, the Office of Civil Defense said. More than 6,000 have moved to evacuation centers aside from those who have temporarily transferred to the homes of relatives in La Castellana by Tuesday morning, the town’s mayor, Rhumyla Mangilimutan, told The Associated Press by telephone. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said authorities were ready to provide support to large numbers of displaced villagers and that his social welfare secretary flew early Tuesday to the affected region. 'We are ready to support the families who have been evacuated outside the 6-kilometer danger zone,' Marcos told reporters. Government scientists were monitoring the air quality due to the risk of contamination from toxic volcanic gases that may require more people to be evacuated from areas affected by Monday’s eruption. Disaster-response contingents were rapidly establishing evacuation centers and seeking supplies of face masks, food and hygiene packs ahead of the Christmas season, traditionally a peak time for holiday travel and family celebrations in the largely Roman Catholic nation. Authorities also shut schools and imposed a nighttime curfew in the most vulnerable areas. The Philippines’ Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the nearly four-minute eruption of Kanlaon volcano on Monday afternoon had caused a pyroclastic density current — a superhot stream of gas, ash, debris and rocks that can incinerate anything in its path. 'It's a one-time but major eruption,' Bacolcol told the AP, adding that volcanologists were assessing if Monday's eruption spewed old volcanic debris and rocks clogged in and near the summit crater or was caused by rising magma from underneath. Few volcanic earthquakes were detected ahead of Monday's explosion, Bacolcol said. The alert level around Kanlaon was placed on Monday to the third-highest of a five-step warning system, indicating 'magmatic eruption' may have begun and may progress to further explosive eruptions. The 2,435-meter (7,988-foot) volcano, one of the country’s 24 most-active volcanoes, last erupted in June sending hundreds of villagers to emergency shelters. In 1996, three hikers were killed near the peak and several others were later rescued when Kanlaon erupted without warning, officials said. Located in the so-called Pacific 'Ring of Fire,' a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the Philippines is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms a year and is among the countries most prone to natural disasters.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-kanlaon-volcano-eruption-ceb5c089dd807d39d96b94536911abd8	2024-12-09T18:10:29-08:00	
Trudeau says Americans are realizing that Trump's tariffs on Canada make life a lot more expensive	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday said Americans 'are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive' and said he will retaliate if Donald Trump goes ahead with them. Speaking at an event put on by the Halifax Chamber of Commerce, Trudeau also said dealing with Trump will be 'a little more challenging' than the last time because Trump’s team is coming in with a much clearer set of ideas of what they want to do right away than after his first election win in 2016. The U.S. president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. 'Trump got elected on a commitment to make life better and more affordable for Americans, and I think people south of the border are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive,' Trudeau said. On the weekend, Trump appeared in an interview with NBC’s 'Meet the Press,' where the president-elect said he can’t guarantee that his promised tariffs on key U.S. foreign trade partners won’t raise prices for American consumers. 'Let’s not kid ourselves in any way, shape or form, 25% tariffs on everything going to the United States would be devastating for the Canadian economy,' Trudeau said. 'It would also, however, mean real hardship for Americans as well. Americans import 65% of their crude oil from Canada, significant amounts of electricity. Just about all the natural gas exported from Canada goes to the United States. They rely on us for steel and aluminum. They rely on us for a range of agriculture imports. All of those things would get more expensive.' If Trump makes good on his threat to slap 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, the price increases that could follow will collide with his campaign promise to give American families a break from inflation. Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods. The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate. 'We will of course, as we did eight years ago, respond to unfair tariffs,' Trudeau said. Trudeau said his government is still mulling over 'the right ways' to respond, referencing when Canada put billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports just $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most of it comes from one plant in Wisconsin, the home state of then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty. 'It was the fact that we put tariffs on bourbon and Harley-Davidsons and playing cards and Heinz ketchup and cherries and a number of other things that were very carefully targeted because they were politically impactful to the president’s party and colleagues,' Trudeau said. Trudeau said when Trump says things he means them but they also know Trump is trying to insert uncertainty and 'a bit of chaos' into democracies. 'One of the most important things for us to do is not freak out, not to panic,' Trudeau said. 'Knowing these would be absolutely devastating means we have to take them seriously but it does mean we have to be thoughtful and strategic and not going around making our opponents arguments for him but making our arguments in a significant and united way.' Canadian officials have said it is unfair to lump Canada in with Mexico. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with irregular migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time. Trump has also claimed the U.S. is 'subsidizing Canada to the tune of over $100 billion a year.' On America’s trade deficit Canada’s ambassador to Washington, Kirsten Hillman, told the AP U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and prices have been high. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing for national security. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trudeau-us-trump-tariffs-f23417b8f6671adf6b4c908be630615f	2024-12-09T15:49:17-08:00	
US hostage envoy in Beirut to seek information on missing journalist Austin Tice	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government's top hostage negotiator is in Beirut in hopes of collecting information on the whereabouts of Austin Tice, an American journalist missing in Syria for 12 years, the State Department said Monday. Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, is talking to officials in the region following the overthrow of Bashar Assad’s government to find out where Tice is and 'get him home as soon as possible,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters Monday. Lebanon has been involved for years in mediating talks about Tice. President Joe Biden said Sunday that his administration believed Tice was alive and was committed to bringing him home, though he also acknowledged that 'we have no direct evidence' of his status. Tice, who has had his work published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and others, disappeared at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus as the Syrian civil war intensified. A video released weeks after Tice went missing showed him blindfolded and held by armed men and saying, 'Oh, Jesus.' He has not been heard from since. Syria has publicly denied that it was holding him.	https://apnews.com/article/tice-journalist-syria-carstens-e20547144d1ad0580e7d64462b8c4135	2024-12-09T11:22:52-08:00	
Virginia man charged in FBI sting with supporting Islamic State goes on trial	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A Virginia man accused of funneling tens of thousands of dollars to the Islamic State group was a lonely man looking for a wife and relentlessly targeted by FBI sting operations, a defense lawyer told jurors Monday, including one undercover operative who pretended to be a willing bride. A jury in U.S. District Court in Alexandria heard opening statements in the terrorism trial of Mohammed Chhipa, 35, of Springfield, Virginia. Prosecutors say he met several times with an undercover FBI operative who gave him hundreds of dollars on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, earmarked for a Syrian woman and Islamic State member known as Umm Dujanah. In his opening statement, prosecutor Andrew Dixon said Chhipa took the money on each occasion, converted it to Bitcoin and sent it to accounts in Turkey, destined for the Islamic State. Dixon said Chhipa sent more than $74,000 in similar fashion to accounts in Turkey, collecting money from willing donors and funneling it to the Islamic State through Umm Dujanah. Chhipa was particularly interested in sending funds to help women from the Islamic State escape prison camps to which they had been sent after the terrorist group was routed from territory it held in Iraq and Syria, Dixon said. Dixon said Chhipa was well aware that what he was doing was illegal, fleeing the country at one point, only to be forced back to the United States. At one point, he said while under surveillance, 'I'm not sure why I'm not in prison.' Chhipa's defense attorney, Zachary Deubler, said the FBI had closely scrutinized Chhipa for years, based largely on advocacy of extremist views on social media. But he said the FBI never came up with a reason to arrest him, even after searching his home in 2019 and finding a cache of Islamic State propaganda. Deubler acknowledged that Chhipa left the country, through Latin America with an ultimate goal of getting to Egypt. The FBI met Chhipa when he returned to the U.S. at Dulles International Airport and questioned him about his activities but never arrested him. Deubler said the government's entrapment efforts intensified, to include a fake bride at one point and a supposed Muslim marriage broker at another. 'He was a lonely, sad, inflated man who the government tried to set up,' Deubler said. The trial began with several quirks. Chhipa appeared at trial in a green jumpsuit from the Alexandria jail, where he is being held. He said he did not want to wear civilian clothes, which are typically provided to defendants out of concern that jail outfits will prejudice the jury against a defendant. After a morning break, Chhipa's family refused to stand when the clerk said 'all rise' as the judge left the bench, and U.S. District Judge David Novak angrily told the family either to stand or be taken into custody. No arrests were made, even though several family members refused repeated directives from court security officers to stand. Last year, after Chhipa's arrest, prosecutors said Chhipa considers himself to be married to Allison Fluke-Ekren, an American from Kansas who is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Fluke-Ekren pleaded guilty last year to organizing and leading the Khatiba Nusaybah, a battalion in the Islamic State in which roughly 100 women and girls learned how to use automatic weapons and detonate grenades and suicide belts. Prosecutors, though, say that the marriage was apparently conducted online and has no legal status in the U.S. They said Chhipa, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from India, has been trying to adopt Fluke-Ekren’s children. The trial is expected to last about a week.	https://apnews.com/article/islamic-state-financing-chhipa-virginia-fbi-77235ab9804887d4ed6692612abd2c7b	2024-12-09T11:22:24-08:00	
A long road ahead to decide Syria’s future after rapid end to Assad’s rule	BEIRUT (AP) — For the first time in 50 years, the question of how Syria will be governed is wide open. The end of the Assad family's rule is for many Syrians a moment of mixed joy and fear, of the total unknown. The insurgency that swept President Bashar Assad out of power is rooted in Islamist jihadi fighters. Its leader says he has renounced past ties to al-Qaida, and he has gone out of his way to assert a vision of creating a pluralistic Syria governed by civil institutions — not dictators and not ideology. But even if he is sincere, he is not the only player. The insurgency is made up of multiple factions, and the country is riven among armed groups, including U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters controlling the east. Remnants of the old regime’s military — and its feared security and intelligence services — could coalesce once again. Foreign powers with their own interests have their hands deep in the country, and any of them — Russia, Iran, Turkey, the United States and Israel — could act as spoilers. Syria’s multifaith and multiethnic population sees itself poised on a moment that could tip either into chaos or cohesion. The country’s Sunni Muslims, Shiite Alawites, Christians and ethnic Kurds have often been pitted against each, whether by Assad’s rule or a 14-year civil war. Divisions from the conflict run deep, and many worry about revenge killings, whether against former figures of Assad’s state or — more frightening — whole communities seen as backing the old system. The civil war displaced half of Syria's prewar population of 23 million. Many who fled are watching developments closely to determine whether the time has come to return. Right now there are only questions. How will Syria be governed? In the short period following Assad’s abrupt fall, rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has sought to reassure Syrians that the group he leads — Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS – does not seek to dominate the country and will continue government services. He has spoken of setting up a decentralized governance system. Government officials who remained in Damascus as Assad fled — including Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali — have met with the rebels to discuss the transfer of power. The Al Jazeera television network reported Monday that HTS had decided to appoint the head of the 'salvation government' running its stronghold in northwest Syria, Mohammed Al-Bashir, to form a transitional government. There was no official confirmation. Details on what form the government will take have been scarce. The rebels likely did not expect to be saddled with running an entire country when they launched their offensive against Aleppo less than two weeks ago, said Qutaiba Idlbi, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs. The rapid fall of Damascus and the melting away of police and military, left security challenges, he said. The only existing framework for a transition is no longer relevant. U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 had called for a political process involving both Assad’s government and opposition groups. 'Everyone’s saying, especially rebels on the ground, ‘That framework is no longer applicable, because there is no longer a regime. We’re not going to give the regime in politics what they lost through military means,’' Idlbi said. So far, public sector workers have not heeded calls from the caretaker prime minister to go back to their jobs -- causing troubles in places like airports, borders and at the Foreign Ministry, said Adam Abdelmoula, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Syria. 'I think it will take a couple of days — and a lot of assurance on the part of the armed groups — for these people to return to work again,' he said. In the current chaos, U.N. workers have had difficulty accessing the country, and that has hampered distribution of humanitarian aid, he said. How inclusive will the insurgents be? The insurgents have sought to reassure Syria’s religious minorities that they will not be targeted, despite HTS' fundamentalist Sunni Muslim origins. So far the civil peace seems to be holding. The insurgents have appeared disciplined, working to keep order, with no sign of reprisals. Experts say only time will tell what post-Assad Syria will look like. 'Everyone’s still willing to really engage, really work with others,' said Haid Haid, a consulting fellow at the Middle East and North Africa program of Chatham House. 'That sort of positive atmosphere is crucial, but it might not last long.' Splits could open as decisions are made. It can’t be guaranteed all the fighters within the HTS will back al-Sharaa’s talk of a pluralist system. Outside Damascus’ historic Hamadiyeh market on Sunday, around a dozen fighters chanted, 'Down, down with a secular state' — a sign that at least some among the insurgents may seek a harder Islamist line. 'The opposition is not a homogenous movement,' said Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow for Middle East Security at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London. There are multiple armed opposition groups, including forces in the south who are distinct from HTS and the Turkish-backed groups in the north. Internal fractures within the HTS-led movement, 'which may become more salient in the weeks and months to come, may lead to discord and threaten Syrian stability,' Ozcelik said. There may be pressure to purge former members of Assad’s large state bureaucracy, especially those employed as part of a vast security state that included informers and officers widely hated for torture, abuses and corruption. Insurgents and many in the public don’t want them to return. But a purge can spark a destabilizing backlash — as when U.S. administrators disbanded Iraq’s army after Saddam Hussein’s fall in 2003, fueling a Sunni insurgency. Syria’s Alawite population is feeling particularly vulnerable. Assad and his family were Alawites — a branch of Shia Islam — and many among the Sunni insurgents see the community as his loyalists. The question of the Kurds looms large Kurdish-led forces allied with the United States have run a semi-autonomous zone in Syria’s northeast for years, where they have been a key player in the fight against the Islamic State militant group. While both were opponents of the government during the civil war, the relationship between the Kurds and the Arab opposition groups is tense. HTS has been extending an olive branch to the Kurds. Reintegrating the east would likely mean some form of concession to Kurdish autonomy. But that risks angering neighboring Turkey, which vehemently opposes the Kurdish factions that run Syria’s east. Already, Turkish-backed insurgents allied with HTS have taken the opportunity to push the Kurds out of some pockets of territory, seizing the northern town of Manbij, and clashes have broken out in other areas. While the insurgents' largely benign approach to minorities so far has allayed many international worries, Abdelmoula said, 'those pockets of fighting are very significant because the fighting is mostly along ethnic lines.

Mexican soldiers will get a pay raise after elimination of oversight agencies, president says	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president said Monday that much of the money gained by eliminating independent oversight and regulatory agencies will go to the army to fund a rise in soldiers’ pay. The announcement by President Claudia Sheinbaum is the latest in a a series of new and unusual funding sources to pay for the country’s increasingly influential military. Last week, Mexico’s Congress approved charging every cruise ship passenger a $42 immigration fee, with much of that money also going to the armed forces. Under Sheinbaum's Morena party, since 2019 the military has been given powers to build and run everything from railways, airports and airlines in Mexico, and some of those projects appear to be losing money. For over a century before, Mexico's armed forces were very limited in their actions, restricted from taking any role in politics and didn't have many business interests. But that all changed under Sheinbaum's predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who saw the army as a loyal, unquestioning ally and a safeguard for his political and policy legacy. López Obrador, Sheinbaum's political mentor, also made the armed forces, and the quasi-military National Guard, the country's main law enforcement forces. In late November, Mexico’s Senate voted to eliminate seven independent regulatory and oversight agencies, a move that critics warn will cement the ruling party’s power and avoid outside scrutiny. Sheinbaum called it a money-saving measure, arguing that the government can more efficiently handle functions like freedom of information requests, anti-monopoly enforcement and energy-market regulation. However, critics and foreign investors and critics fear this could open the door to favoritism and a lack of transparency. And earlier this month, Mexico’s Senate — controlled by the president's Morena party — voted to charge cruise ship passengers $42 per head for port calls, drawing sharp criticism from the tourism industry. Mexican business chambers say the immigration charge — from which cruise passengers used to be exempt — may hurt the country’s $500 million per year cruise industry. Two-thirds of the money raised from the cruise ship charges would go to the Mexican army, not to improve port facilities. Moreover, many of the military-run projects appear to be big money losers, which may help explain the government's urge to find extra funding for the armed forces. For example, one of López Obrador's pet projects — the 'Maya Train,' a tourist line which runs in a loop around the Yucatan Peninsula — has drawn only 20% of the ridership expected when it was proposed. The Maya Train started service on Dec. 16, 2023. While it's not completely finished — two relatively little-used stretches are scheduled to enter service later this months — the most popular and heavily-travelled parts of the line are already in service. As of Dec. 8, authorities announced the train line had carried a little more than 600,000 passengers in its first 51 weeks. That is only one-fifth of the 3 million passengers authorities had claimed it would carry per year. On Monday, the government announced a 'package tour' deal in which another military-run, money losing project — the government-owned Mexicana airline — would offer flights to stations along the Maya Train line. The flight would take off, of course, from another military-run project, the new Mexico City Felipe Angeles airport, which is just starting to break even because the government forced cargo planes, and some passenger flights, to use it. Mexico’s ruling Morena party is already running enormous budget deficits to fund its favorite building projects like railways and oil refineries — some of which are being built by the army. The government is desperate to find new revenue sources.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-army-funding-projects-e6ad34e863414c47f5180be63cefccdc	2024-12-09T09:34:13-08:00	
Ghana's ex-leader is declared the winner of the presidential election	ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — Ghana’s former leader John Dramani Mahama was officially declared the winner of the presidential election on Monday evening, after voters vented anger at the government’s handling of the economy. Previously president between 2012 and 2017, Mahama, 65, received 6.3 million votes, or 56.5% of votes cast, the electoral commission said. Mahama’s main opponent, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, conceded defeat on Sunday. Bawumia got 4.6 million votes, or 41%. The turnout based on the votes from 267 constituencies stands at 60.9 percent, said Jean Mensa, the electoral commissioner. Although vote counting was ongoing in nine constituencies, that will not change the final result, Mensa added. Mahama has described his victory as 'emphatic.' He had promised to 'reset' the country on various fronts, during a campaign that prioritized the economy and largely appealed to young Ghanaians who saw the vote as a way out of the country’s economic crisis. After Bawumia conceded defeat, celebrations broke out on Sunday among the supporters of the opposition candidate in parts of the country, including the capital city. Wearing the opposition party’s white, green, red and black colors, women and young people danced to music and trumpet blasts on the streets and at the party’s national headquarters The election for both the president and members of parliament was held against the backdrop of the country’s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. It was seen as a litmus test for democracy in a region shaken by extremist violence and coups. West Africa’s regional bloc of ECOWAS said the election was generally peaceful, a continuing trend in Ghana. Bawumia was running as the flagbearer of the ruling New Patriotic Party, or NPP, which has struggled to resolve the economic crisis under outgoing President Nana Akufo-Addo. Mahama’s National Democratic Congress also won the majority in parliament, he said. Mahama’s win is viewed as following the latest trend of elections around the world, favoring opposition parties against incumbents, from the United States to European countries — such as Britain and France — as well as South Africa. The former president is 'the only person' who can fix the ailing economy in Ghana, one of West Africa’s economic powerhouses, said Jude Agbemava, a policy analyst who voted for him. Like in most other elections in countries where the incumbent lost, the vote in Ghana was about the people making their disaffection known against a government that has lost goodwill, said Seidu Alidu, head of the department of political science at Ghana’s University of Legon. 'I think it has to do with the economy, which is largely a bread and butter issue for every Ghanaian,' said Alidu. 'When the people elect you, they require you to do certain things for them. But it was also about the style of governance (because) even in other countries facing economic challenges, governments were being honest with the people, telling them what the reality is, and the steps they have taken to manage it,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/ghana-election-president-mahama-409cfac5c60e0ab8056b04c867e068bc	2024-12-09T09:15:53-08:00

As Israel advances on a Syrian buffer zone, it sees peril and opportunity	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The dramatic downfall of Syrian President Bashar Assad presents possible danger, and an opening, for neighboring Israel. After fighting wars on multiple fronts for months, Israel is now concerned that unrest in Syria could spill over into its territory. Israel also views the end of the Assad regime as a chance to disrupt Iran's ability to smuggle weapons through Syria to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The Israeli military over the weekend began seizing control of a demilitarized buffer zone in Syria created as part of a 1974 ceasefire between the countries. It said the move was temporary and meant to secure its border. But the incursion sparked condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria for a land grab. Israel still controls the Golan Heights that it captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed — a move not recognized by most of the international community. Here’s a look at recent developments along the Syrian frontier. Where are the Israeli troops? Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israeli forces were moving to control a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized buffer zone in Syrian territory. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. A U.N. force of about 1,100 troops has patrolled the area since then. On a visit Sunday to a Golan Heights hilltop overlooking Syria, Netanyahu said that because Syrian troops had abandoned their positions, Israel's move into the buffer zone was necessary as a 'temporary defensive position.' 'The peacekeepers at (the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, or UNDOF) informed the Israeli counterparts that these actions would constitute a violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement, that there should be no military forces or activities in the area of separation,' said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric. He added that the buffer zone was calm and UNDOF peacekeepers remained in their position. The Security Council is scheduled to meet for special consultations called by Russia to discuss the buffer zone issue. The rebels who ousted Assad and now control much of Syria are led by a former senior al-Qaida militant, although he severed ties with the extremist group years ago and has promised representative government and religious tolerance. On Monday evening, Netanyahu said Assad’s fall is the 'direct result of the heavy blows we landed on Hamas, on Hezbollah and on Iran.' He added that Israel would occupy the summit of Mount Hermon, which is within the buffer zone on the Syria-Lebanon border, and at 2,814 meters (9,232 feet) is the highest peak in the eastern Mediterranean coast. Israel has sent both ground and air troops into the buffer zone, including on the Syrian side of snow-dusted Mount Hermon, which is divided between the Golan Heights, Lebanon, and Syria. Only the United States recognizes Israel's control of the Golan Heights. How long will Israeli troops be in the buffer zone? Israeli troops began moving into the buffer zone Saturday. Also on Saturday, armed men attacked U.N. forces near the border with Israel, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. '(The Israeli military) took targeted and temporary control of certain areas near the border to prevent an Oct. 7 scenario from Syria,' Saar said, referring to Hamas' surprise 2023 attack into Israel from the Gaza Strip. Many in the region condemned the move. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry accused Israel of 'exploiting the power vacuum … to occupy more Syrian territories and create a fait accompli in violation of international law.' This isn’t the first time Israel has entered the buffer zone this year. An Associated Press report last month examining satellite imagery found that Israel had been working on a construction project, possibly a new road, along the border with Syria from as early as July, and had in some cases entered the buffer zone during construction. Following the AP report, U.N. forces warned that the Israeli military has committed 'severe violations' of its ceasefire deal with Syria. Is Israel invading Syria? Israeli political and military leaders have stressed that the seizure of the buffer zone is temporary and not a prelude to entering other parts of Syrian territory. 'The plan at the moment is that this is a temporary step to make sure stability is kept in the border, making sure the buffer zone is kept, and the U.N. forces can stay,' said a military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military guidelines. The official noted that in 2014, U.N. peacekeepers fled the buffer zone after al-Qaida-linked Syrian rebels attacked their encampments. After armed men attacked U.N. forces over the weekend, Israel wanted to ensure the situation did not repeat itself, the official said. Israel isn’t currently trying to change the border or prepare for an invasion into Syria, said Carmit Valensi, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think-tank. 'Right now, it’s a tactical operation, not a long-term strategy, in response to the dynamic situation in Syria,' she said. With the collapse of the Syrian army, Israel wants to protect its borders until the situation stabilizes, she said. What are Israel’s interests? Israel says its immediate goal is to prevent the instability in Syria from spreading into the border region. Defense Minister Israel Katz on Monday laid out Israel’s plans for the border area. He said that after completing the takeover of the buffer zone, Israel would create a 'security zone' beyond it by destroying heavy artillery across Syria and preventing Iran from smuggling weapons through Syria into Lebanon. Foreign Minister Saar said Monday that Israel has struck multiple sites holding chemical weapons and long-range missiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of hostile actors. Saar did not say when the strikes occurred. Analysts said Israel is likely to continue carrying out strikes against targets across Syria. Israel is planning outreach to Syria’s Druze population, a close-knit religious minority that also lives in Israel, Jordan and Lebanon and has maintained some ties across borders. Israel is also trying to open lines of communication with Syrian rebel groups, to help ensure Iranian-backed factions don’t reclaim any territory, according to Valensi. For many years, Israel quietly provided food, medicine, clothing and other assistance to war-ravaged southern Syria through 'Operation Good Neighbor,' which ended in 2018. More than 4,000 wounded and sick Syrians received medical treatment in Israel or in Israeli field hospitals, and those non-diplomatic connections could now prove crucial. ___ Associated Press writer Edith M.

Assad’s downfall is a humbling blow to Russia. How will it affect Putin's prestige?	Almost exactly seven years ago, President Vladimir Putin stood with Russian troops at their air base in Syria and proudly declared victory over 'terrorists' in that country as part of the Kremlin’s military intervention to prop up the government of Bashar Assad amid a civil war. This weekend, those hard-won gains seemed a distant memory. Assad hastily fled to Moscow as his power crumbled during a lightning offensive by rebels that his main international allies, Russia and Iran, were unable to stem. The Kremlin’s failure to prevent Assad’s swift downfall has exposed limits of Russia’s power and dented its international clout at a pivotal stage of its war in Ukraine. A look at Russia’s involvement in Syria and the possible consequences of Assad’s demise for Moscow: What was Russia's role in Syria and its civil war? The Soviet Union was a longtime ally of Assad's father, Hafez Assad, who ruled the country for nearly 30 years, and provided military advisers and aid. After an 2011 uprising against Bashar Assad’s rule morphed into a civil war, Russia continued to be a key backer of Damascus, offering political support at the United Nations. When Assad’s rule neared collapse after a series of battlefield defeats in 2015, Russia joined Iran to intervene militarily. Russia deployed warplanes to the Hemeimeem air base in Syria’s coastal province of Latakia, delivering thousands of tons of military equipment and supplies in an operation dubbed the 'Syrian Express.' On Sept. 30, 2015, Moscow launched its air campaign. Russia kept only about 50 warplanes at Hemeimeem, but they operated at a frenetic pace, each flying several sorties a day. Most of the Russian air force personnel were rotated through the base, giving them combat experience. At the same time, Moscow expanded and upgraded its naval base in Tartus, the only such outpost outside the former USSR. It deployed special operations forces for critical ground missions and sent hundreds of military advisers to train Syrian troops and direct their operations. Mercenaries from Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner Group military contractor also joined the battle. The military intervention allowed Assad to reclaim control of most of Syria, making the Kremlin a key power broker in the Middle East and boosting Russia’s prestige. Putin's triumphal visit to Hemeimeem on Dec. 11, 2017, came a week after Russia declared victory over the Islamic State group in Syria and shortly after he announced a reelection bid for 2018. It was Russia’s first military operation outside the former Soviet Union since the USSR's collapse in 1991 and gave Moscow a chance to test its latest weapons in combat. That military success emboldened Putin and was a key factor that contributed to his decision to invade Ukraine in 2022. Why did Russia fail to keep Assad in power? After helping Assad regain control over most Syria, Russia urged him to engage in talks with moderate opposition groups. Buoyed by opposition defeats, however, Assad staunchly resisted any initiatives aimed at national reconciliation. 'Trying to minimize its costs in Syria, Russia has increasingly focused on maintaining the shaky and inefficient status quo, preserving the crumbling and delegitimized Assad regime without any perspectives,' said Ruslan Pukhov, a Moscow-based military expert, in an analysis. During recent contacts between Syrian and Turkish officials that Moscow helped broker this year, Assad’s government showed little interest in compromise -– a recalcitrance that paved the way for the offensive by Turkey-backed opposition groups that ousted Assad. Syria’s economic woes, exacerbated by isolating international sanctions, weakened the country and its military. The demoralized Syrian army quickly crumbled under the brunt of the opposition offensive, a rapid meltdown that Tehran and Moscow couldn't avert with the small contingents they had in Syria. Russia dedicated the bulk of its assets to the war in Ukraine, while Iran, weakened by international sanctions and locked in a tense standoff with Israel, similarly lacked resources to help Assad. Alexander Dugin, an ideologue linked to some hawkish Kremlin circles, called Assad’s demise as a painful blow to Russia. 'The Assad regime that we supported through enormous efforts collapsed in just a few days. It’s very sad,' Dugin said. What happens to Russian assets in Syria? With Assad’s demise, the future of Russia bases in Syria — its only military foothold outside the former Soviet Union — is in question. The number of Russian warplanes at Hemeimeem air base has shrunk from several dozen to just a few, although it continues to be a key logistics point. Russian military cargo planes ferrying private contractors and supplies to Africa used it for refueling, and its loss would pose logistical problems for operations there. 'The importance of Syria for Russia’s operations in Africa has been invaluable,' Moscow-based Middle East expert Nikolai Sukhov said in televised comments. The Tartus naval base is used by Russian warships for maintenance, refueling and replenishing supplies on visits to the Mediterranean. While opposition forces that eventually ousted Assad swept across Syria in late November, the Russian navy and air force held drills in the eastern Mediterranean, with Tartus as its operational center. Even as Putin granted Assad and his family an asylum in Russia, Moscow reached out to the new Syrian authorities to try to ensure the security of its bases and to extend their stay. An opposition flag quickly was hoisted at the Syrian Embassy in Moscow. Asked about the bases, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would be a topic for future discussions with the new authorities. 'For now, we are witnessing a period of transformation and extreme instability, so it will obviously take time and require a serious conversation with those who will have power,' he said. Syria's new leaders reportedly promised not to attack Russian military facilities. Bronwen Maddox, director and chief executive at Chatham House, noted in a commentary that 'whatever government emerges in Damascus is expected – for the moment -– to respect the deal that Assad struck granting Russia use of a military base on the Syrian coast.' But she added that this 'important asset is vulnerable,' and that risks Russia's regional influence. What does Assad's demise mean for Russia? Assad's rapid downfall dealt a heavy blow to Putin at a time when he is preparing for a new U.S. administration and what that means for the war in Ukraine. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to negotiate an end to the conflict. Many observers note that the humiliating loss of Russia's only ally in the Middle East has dented Kremlin prestige on the global stage and could weaken Putin’s hand in any negotiations on Ukraine. 'The key issue is how Moscow will now try to adapt to the new realities and whether it will have enough flexibility to deal with the new masters of Syria, who seem to be interested in avoiding conflict with Moscow for now,' Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center wrote in a commentary. There is also the possibility that Putin could take an even more uncompromising stance in negotiations to avoid looking weak. 'Assad’s collapse has also shaken Putin, making him less inclined to demonstrate flexibility with Ukraine,' Stanovaya added. 'The war in Ukraine has, to some extent, cost him Syria, which reinforces his unwillingness to compromise.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-syria-assad-ukraine-war-31fa9b933372b3704ed285c96863892b	2024-12-09T07:59:57-08:00	
A gang leader in Haiti is accused of massacring older people to avenge his son's death	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A gang leader who controls a key port in Haiti's capital is accused of massacring older people and Vodou religious leaders in his community to avenge his son's death, according to the government and human rights organizations that estimate more than 100 killed. Reports on the number of dead in Port-au-Prince can vary wildly in a country where such killings often occur in gang-controlled, largely inaccessible areas. Haiti’s government in a statement Monday acknowledged the massacre, saying over 100 were killed in the Cité Soleil neighborhood, and promised to bring to justice those responsible for 'this unspeakable carnage.' Volker Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told journalists on Monday that at least 184 people were killed by a powerful gang leader. It wasn’t clear where his office had obtained that number, and a spokesperson did not return a request for comment. The U.N. secretary-general's office said 127 of the dead were older people. Haitian watchdogs also estimated more than 100 were killed, at times citing community residents. The Cooperative for Peace and Development, a local rights group, said in a statement Sunday its monitoring unit found that around 20 older people were killed. But it noted that unidentified residents in the community controlled by gang leader Micanor Altès, also known as Monel Felix and Wa Mikanò, claimed there were more than 100 victims. The National Human Rights Defense Network, another local rights group, said at least 110 people were killed between Friday and Saturday. The group and its executive director, Pierre Espérance, did not say where it obtained that information, and Espérance did not return requests for comment. The murky information was a worrying sign in a country in the grip of widespread gang violence. 'The fact that we have so many doubts about what happened days after the massacre is a signal that clearly indicates the level of control (gangs) have on the population,' said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. The accused gang leader controls the coastal communities of Wharf Jérémie, La Saline and Fort Dimanche and was known for robbery, extortion and hijacking of goods and trucks, according to a U.N. report earlier this year. 'Micanor was not known for being as brutal as other gang leaders,' Da Rin said. 'Not until now.' The gang leader could not be reached for comment and has not posted on social media. A spokesman for Haiti's National Police did not return a message for comment. The National Human Rights Defense Network said the massacre occurred because the gang leader's child was severely ill, prompting him to seek advice from a Vodou priest. After his son died, he accused older people in the community 'of practicing witchcraft and harming the child.' The Cooperative for Peace and Development said that according to information circulating in the community, Micanor accused people in the neighborhood for causing his son’s illness. 'He decided to cruelly punish all elderly people and (Vodou) practitioners who, in his imagination, would be capable of casting a bad spell on his son,' the group said. It said gunmen rounded up well-known community leaders and took them to the gang leader’s stronghold, where they were executed. Also killed were motorcycle drivers who tried to save some victims. The group also noted that there’s a ban on people leaving the community 'in order to continue to identify (Vodou) practitioners and the elderly with the aim of carrying out the silent killing.' Da Rin noted that usually killings in Haiti are documented and posted on social media, though they can be difficult to verify. 'In this case, there was not even a message on WhatsApp or a video on TikTok, which is very unusual,' he said. The Cooperative for Peace and Development said Micanor has previously targeted Vodou practitioners, killing a dozen older women and Vodou leaders 'wrongly accused of witchcraft' in recent years. It’s not unusual for Haitians to seek medical and other advice from Vodou priests known as 'oungans.' The religion that mixes Catholicism with animist beliefs was at the root of the revolution that led Haiti to become the world’s first free Black republic in 1804. The massacre in Port-au-Prince comes two months after over 70 people were killed in the central town of Pont-Sondé, where gangs are vying to control more territory. Such killings have overwhelmed Haiti’s National Police and a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police that lacks funds and personnel, with the U.S. and other countries pushing for a U.N. peacekeeping mission. 'The crisis in Haiti has reached catastrophic levels with allied criminal groups intensifying large-scale, coordinated attacks on the population and key state infrastructure,' Human Rights Watch said Monday as it called for a U.N. mission. It noted that 'many Haitians live with the constant fear of being killed, raped, kidnapped, or forcibly recruited even as they struggle every day to find adequate food, water, and health care to survive.'

Nobel Peace Prize winner urges Putin to understand the destructiveness of nuclear weapons	OSLO, Norway (AP) — Terumi Tanaka, a survivor of the U.S. atomic bombings of Japan and the representative of an organization that won this year's Nobel Peace Prize, called on Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday to stop making nuclear threats. The 92-year-old spoke at a news conference in Oslo, Norway, a day before a ceremony where he is to deliver a lecture on behalf of Nihon Hidankyo, an organization of survivors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that won this year's prize. Asked by a reporter if he had a message for Putin, Tanaka said that the Russian leader's repeated nuclear threats convinced him that Putin must not understand how devastating the use of nuclear weapons would be. He said that his organization's message to Putin — which he said had also been conveyed to the Russian leader directly — is that 'nuclear weapons are things which must never be used.' 'I don’t think he has even thought about this or understood this. Therefore, he is able to say these kind of things. So I think that how we can change his way of thinking is what we need to do to have him really understand what these are,' he said through a translator. The first U.S. atomic bombing killed 140,000 people in the city of Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945. A second on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killed another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, ending World War II. Japan's Kyodo news agency says that Tanaka was 13 and living in Nagasaki when the United States dropped the atomic bomb there. While he did not suffer major injuries himself, he lost five family members, and has said that the images of burned bodies in the devastated city are etched in his memory. Jørgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said in announcing the award weeks ago that it was made as the 'taboo against the use of nuclear weapons is under pressure.' The committee noted that rather than embrace disarmament, nuclear powers are upgrading their arsenals, while other countries appear to be preparing to acquire nuclear weapons. It also noted that threats are being made to use the weapons in ongoing warfare, an apparent reference to Russia's threats amid its war in Ukraine. The Japanese group's elderly members are calling for the abolishment of nuclear weapons, a message also directed at the United States. Tanaka noted that 'we are old now' but still carry a 'heavy sense of responsibility' as witnesses to remind the world of the destructiveness of nuclear weapons. 'Nuclear weapons and humanity cannot coexist,' he said. Back in Japan, Empress Masako on Monday described the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Nihon Hidankyo as a key event of this year that impressed upon her the importance of global peace efforts. In a statement, she said she 'felt anew the importance for the people of the world to strive for mutual understanding and work together in order to build a peaceful world.' ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.	https://apnews.com/article/nobel-peace-prize-nihon-hidankyo-terumi-tanaka-5920653f1f577c591ea3dc644e92b3bb	2024-12-09T05:28:37-08:00	
Zelenskyy open to Western troops providing security for end to war in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that he's open to the potential deployment of Western troops in Ukraine to guarantee the country’s security as part of a broad effort to end the almost three-year war with Russia. The deployment would be a step toward Ukraine joining NATO, Zelenskyy said in a post on his Telegram channel. 'But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO,' Zelenskyy said. His proposals tread a delicate diplomatic path amid international efforts to find a way of ending Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II at a time when Russia has gained an upper hand in the fighting. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is seeking to bring about a ceasefire and met with Zelenskyy in Paris on Saturday. But Zelenskyy said Monday that he would approach outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden about Ukraine’s possible NATO membership because he's still in office, while Trump doesn't yet have 'legal rights' to decide on the matter. The possibilities of Ukraine joining the 32-nation military alliance and of Western troops being stationed on its soil have been deeply divisive and contentious issues since Russia’s full-scale invasion began on Feb. 24, 2022. At their summit in Washington in July, NATO declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership, but stopped short of inviting the country in. The United States and Germany have balked at Ukraine joining NATO while at war with Russia. One obstacle has been the view that Ukraine’s borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the alliance’s pact of mutual defense would come into effect. Russia’s invading army occupies about one-fifth of Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron floated the idea of Western troops on the ground in Ukraine last February. But it raised the same fears of escalation that have led Western leaders to place limits on weapons supplies and permissions for their use. European military heavyweights Germany and Poland immediately said they wouldn't send troops to Ukraine. Macron declined to provide details about which nations were considering sending troops, saying he preferred to maintain some 'strategic ambiguity Meanwhile, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s challenger in the upcoming German election, Friedrich Merz, said that there’s a 'basic consensus' in Germany on continuing to provide military aid to Ukraine. But during a visit to Kyiv, he also highlighted differences with Scholz, who has refused to send Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine as he insists that everything must be done to prevent a wider war between the West and Russia. Merz has been open to providing them and allowing Ukraine to hit military targets inside Russia. As he met Zelenskyy, Merz noted that France, the U.K. and the U.S. have a different position from the current German government. 'Our position is clear, as is that of my parliamentary group: we want to put your army in a position to reach military bases in Russia – not the civilian population, not the infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being fought,' he said. 'With this range restriction, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand behind its back, and that is not our position,' he added. Merz’s center-right Union bloc leads German opinion polls. The election is expected on Feb. 23. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-troops-nato-9bf883670879e2a398fe1a7ebfb71ddb	2024-12-09T04:47:09-08:00	
Indigenous Mayans want their sacred cenotes to have personhood status	HOMUN, Mexico (AP) — A huge poplar tree stands proud in Maribel Ek's courtyard, adorned with a sign that reads: 'Florece desde adentro' ('It blooms from within'). Deep underground, the tree's long roots search for the water that makes this land special: a sinkhole lake, known as a cenote. Cenotes provide an important water source to Ek's community of Homun, in the Mexican state of Yucatan, and a livelihood for locals who lead tourists from around the world into the caverns to bathe in their crystalline waters. But more than that, cenotes are sacred to Indigenous Mayans like her. As she descends into the cavern, Ek shines a light on a stone covered in flowers, pots, and candles —the remains of an offering she made to thank the cenote for everything it has given her. She refers to the sacred space as her 'neighbor,' one that needs protection. That belief is the basis of a lawsuit that seeks personhood status for the Ring of Cenotes, made up of hundreds of subterranean lakes that surround the northwest of the Yucatan peninsula in a semicircle, and provide the main source of freshwater in the region. The lawsuit, from the Indigenous Mayan organization Kana’an Ts’onot, or Guardians of the Cenotes, seeks to protect the area from further contamination by industries that have moved there to take advantage of the plentiful water. The group, as designated guardians, would be able to fight on behalf of the Ring of Cenotes in court. If they win, this would become the first ecosystem in Mexico to have its own rights, following in the wake of other cases worldwide, such as the Whanganui River in New Zealand or the Komi Memem River in the Brazilian Amazon. Ek, a member of the Guardians group, speaks of the cenote and its waters as a person, as she explains the reasons behind their fight. 'Because you have to be the voice, that she doesn’t have,' she said. 'Because you have to be the hands, that she doesn’t have.' Polluting the waters The threats to cenotes have been multiplying in recent years. In addition to uncontrolled urban development and the lack of drainage in cities, new dangers include the increase in breweries and massive soybean fields and the construction of the Maya Train, which has embedded thousands of steel pillars in this underground paradise. But what most worries the Guardians of the Cenotes are the pig farms. According to Mexico’s Ministry of the Environment, 507 pig farms are operating near the Ring of Cenotes, 90% of which don’t have environmental impact studies and more than 60% that don’t have a wastewater discharge permit. That means there is no control over what happens to the thousands of liters of water filled with pig excrement and urine generated at the facilities. In many cases, the pollutant-filled water seeps into the aquifer. The area is particularly vulnerable because the soil is karstic, made up of very thin and porous limestone full of conduits and cavities that allow everything that is dumped on the surface to filter underground, explains biologist Yameli Aguilar, master in environmental engineering from the Autonomous University of Yucatan. A comprehensive report conducted last year by the Ministry of the Environment analyzed the water quality of 20 cenotes near pig farms and found that all of them exceeded the limits for fecal coliform (E. coli), set by Mexican authorities to protect aquatic life. In addition, in 26 of the 51 municipalities in Yucatan where pig farms operate, they found 'critical conditions for the water sustainability of the aquifer' due to high amounts of nitrogen from pig excrement and urine. The state designates the land as a natural protected area, and it is considered a wetland of international importance by the Ramsar Convention, an organization formed around a global treaty to protect wetlands. Yet the government fails to prevent the 'serious contamination' and the cenotes are suffering, said lawyer Lourdes Medina, who represents the Guardians in the process. Ek and other cenotes’ owners created the Guardians of the Cenotes group to lead the fight against a 49,000 pig farm that was installed on the outskirts of Homun in 2017. They organized dozens of protests, sit-ins, public consultations and legal actions, but nothing seemed to have any effect. A year later, a lawsuit filed by six children from Homun demanding their right to water and a healthy environment succeeded in getting a judge to order the farm closed. It remains closed nowadays, but the legal battle continues. In 2022 they filed the personhood lawsuit that would not only protect Homun, but also the other 52 communities located within the Ring of Cenotes. And it's already bearing fruit: a judge of the state of Yucatan ordered the authorities not to grant permits to any project that could impact the area until the lawsuit is resolved. That could happen at the beginning of next year. Without protections, the group fears that their sacred cenotes will be contaminated and lose the pristine waters they depend on. What do the pig farmers say? Pig farms and other large industries are drawn to the area because of the availability of water. The farms use large quantities of water (about 20 liters per kilo of meat produced) to cool the animals and clean their waste. The industry says they are not to blame for the contamination. Carlos Ramayo Navarrete, director of the Pig Farmers Association in Merida, which represents the largest pig companies in Yucatan, said the problem is the lack of drainage in cities and the small-scale and 'backyard' pig operations, because they are not as regulated by the authorities as are the bigger farms he represents. He said around half the water the farms use is then reused. In addition, he said that all of the farms have treatment plants to reduce the load of pollutants in their wastewater, which is then used as fertilizer to irrigate fields. 'An industry that does everything within its reach and more can't be demonized,' he said. However, both the Ministry of the Environment and Aguilar have said that the measures taken by the industry are still not enough to prevent contamination of the aquifer. 'As so much (water) is used, to date there is no treatment plant that can lower the pollution load of all that wastewater,' Aguilar said. What will the future bring? As the lawsuits wend their way through the courts, tension between mega-farms and the local population has increased. In 2023, the residents of Sitilpech, about 50 kilometers from Homun, took to the streets to protest against the 48,000 pig farm located on the outskirts of their village. The demonstrations were repressed by the police and resulted in the arrest of several villagers. When a group of AP reporters approached the farm earlier this year, owned by pig giant Kekén, they saw a security guard with a machete in his hand at the entrance. The Sitilpech house closest to the farm is small and painted green, with a porch overlooking the road and a banner written in capital letters demanding that the pig farm leave. In the backyard, Marcela Chi Eb has just put in a washing machine and is hanging clothes on ropes supported by two lemon trees. Their leaves are dry and brownish; she said they got that way when the farm started operating. At night she is awakened by the farm's stench and, although the heat is unbearable, she closes the windows to keep out the smell that permeates her nose and clothes. While one of her daughters rests in a hammock, Chi Eb talks about what worries her most: that in the future neither she nor her children will be able to use the water that comes from the faucet in her house. Back in Homun, Maribel Ek reaches the end of the cavern and, without a second thought, dives into the turquoise waters of the cenote. As a child she came down here every day to collect water because the public supply didn’t reach her house. Since then she learned this wasn't just 'a dark hole with bats,' but 'a blessing, a dark hole that becomes a friend,' she says. 'That's why we demand rights for our cenotes.' ___ Follow Teresa de Miguel on X at @tdemigueles ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Head of UN human rights promises advice to FIFA and Saudi Arabia over 2034 World Cup issues	GENEVA (AP) — Two days before FIFA confirms Saudi Arabia as the 2034 World Cup host, the United Nations’ top human rights official pledged Monday to try to ensure migrant labor standards are 'properly respected' around the tournament. Saudi Arabia is the only candidate and sure to win Wednesday when FIFA will ask an online meeting of its 211 member federations to award the 2034 hosting rights by acclaim without an itemized vote. The oil-rich kingdom’s World Cup plan needs to build eight of the 15 promised stadiums from scratch, plus add 175,000 hotel rooms. It will rely heavily on migrant workers, often from South Asia, within a labor law framework that activist groups say does not protect them. On Monday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, said his organization in Geneva was not directly engaged by FIFA on World Cup issues. 'What we are involved in though is to make sure that indeed, in each and every major sporting event, human rights are part and parcel of the way that sports events are not only conceived but also conducted,' Türk said at a news conference on the eve of the UN’s annual Human Rights Day. Critics of FIFA say a Saudi-hosted World Cup risks repeating rights abuses seen during a decade of similar preparations for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Allegations of widespread labor abuses in Saudi Arabia are already part of an investigation by the UN-backed International Labor Organization (ILO) after a formal complaint by trade unions. Two United States senators have cited human rights in urging FIFA to find a different host for its marquee men’s event that earns billions of dollars in profit for the soccer body. 'Whatever the decision is, to whoever is going to organize it, we will provide precisely that type of advice to the organizers,' Türk, an Austrian lawyer, said. 'That will include also, of course, the need to make sure that migrant labor standards are properly respected and all the various other human rights dimensions of major sporting events.' FIFA has been criticized for not using its leverage ahead of the World Cup decision with Saudi Arabia, despite its president Gianni Infantino building close ties to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi officials made some promises in a formal bid document to engage with the ILO and domestic agencies but not international groups like unions and rights groups that have limited or no access to work in the country. Soccer’s world body praised the Saudi bid in a mandatory in-house evaluation published Nov. 30 and noted the 48-team, 104-game tournament offers 'significant opportunities for positive human rights impact.' FIFA also acknowledged that Saudi Arabia must invest 'significant effort and time' to comply with international standards, which were widely criticized this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council. In their letter to Infantino in October, U.S. senators Ron Wyden and Dick Durbin — Democrats representing Oregon and Illinois, respectively — urged finding a 2034 host 'with a record of upholding human rights.' 'The kingdom continues to torture dissidents, engage in extrajudicial killings, discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community, oppress women and religious minorities, exploit and abuse foreign workers, and restrict almost all political rights and civil liberties,' the letter said. The FIFA decision to confirm Saudi Arabia on Wednesday will be combined with awarding the 2030 World Cup to Spain, Portugal and Morocco. That project gives one game each to Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which was the original World Cup host in 1930. By teaming up Europe, South America and Africa for 2030 — four years after North American neighbors the United States, Canada and Mexico are due to co-host in 2026 — FIFA was able in October last year to open an unexpected and fast-track 2034 contest limited to bidders from Asia or Oceania. That all-but ensured a Saudi win. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/un-human-rights-2034-world-cup-fifa-saudi-arabia-325e17597c7b10fa49034fa1763e6862	2024-12-09T03:01:29-08:00	
Taiwan says China has sent naval ships into nearby waters ahead of anticipated drills	BEIJING (AP) — China's military appears to be preparing for widely anticipated drills in response to a recent visit by Taiwan's president to Hawaii and Guam. Taiwan's defense ministry said Monday that it detected Chinese naval and coast guard ships entering the Taiwan Strait and the western Pacific and that China had restricted airspace along its southeast coast through Wednesday. There was no immediate confirmation from the Chinese side. It comes as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he would not commit to defending Taiwan if China were to invade during his presidency. China says Taiwan is part of its territory and opposes American support and military sales to the self-governing island. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te made stops in Hawaii and Guam during a weeklong tour of the Pacific that ended Friday. China maintains that Taiwan is a province that should not have its own president or foreign relations. Taiwan's defense ministry said it has set up an emergency response center and launched combat readiness exercises in response to Chinese activity in the Taiwan Strait. It did not say what those exercises entailed. 'It must be pointed out that there is no such thing as a defense ministry in Taiwan,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said when asked about the Taiwanese statement. 'Taiwan is part of China, and the Taiwan issue is China’s internal affairs. China will firmly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.' China, which views Lai as a separatist, held major military exercises around Taiwan following his inauguration in May and his national day speech in October. It also held a major drill after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022. The Taiwan defense ministry statement said China had restricted air space in seven zones off Fujian province, which faces Taiwan, and off Zhejiang province, which stretches north from Fujian to Shanghai. Trump was asked during a televised interview if he would commit to defending Taiwan. 'I never say, because I have to negotiate things, right?' he told NBC's 'Meet the Press.' He said he had spoken in recent days with Chinese leader Xi Jinping but the two did not discuss the Taiwan issue. 'We talked about other things,' he said. 'But I have a very good relationship, and I hope he doesn’t do it.'	https://apnews.com/article/china-taiwan-tensions-military-drills-2ab811378272b53e270e3848ecefa893	2024-12-08T23:09:19-08:00	
Syrian prime minister says government is still functioning but foreign and domestic challenges loom	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syria's prime minister said Monday that most cabinet ministers are still working from offices in Damascus after rebels entered the capital over the weekend and overthrew President Bashar Assad. Streams of refugees crossed in from neighboring countries, hoping for a more peaceful future. But there were already signs of the difficulties ahead for the rebel alliance now in control of much of the country, which is led by a former senior al-Qaida militant who severed ties with the extremist group years ago and has promised representative government and religious tolerance. The rebel command said Monday they would not tell women how to dress. Israel said it is carrying out airstrikes on suspected chemical weapons sites and long-range rockets to keep them from falling into the hands of extremists. Israel has also seized a buffer zone inside Syria after Syrian troops withdrew. In northern Syria, Turkey said allied opposition forces seized the town of Manbij from Kurdish-led forces backed by the United States, a reminder that even after Assad's departure to Russia the country remains split among armed groups that have fought in the past. The Kremlin said Russia has granted political asylum to Assad, a decision made by President Vladimir Putin. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on Assad’s specific whereabouts and said Putin was not planning to meet with him. Damascus was quiet on Monday, with life slowly returning to normal while most shops and public institutions were closed. In public squares, some people were still celebrating. Civilian traffic resumed but there was no public transport. Long lines formed in front of bakeries and other food stores. There was little sign of any security presence, and Associated Press reporters saw a few SUVs on the side of a main boulevard that appeared to have been broken into. In some areas, small groups of armed men were stationed in the streets. A video circulating online showed a man in military fatigues holding a rifle attempting to reassure residents of the Mezzeh neighborhood in Damascus that they would not be harmed. 'We have nothing against you, neither Alawite, nor Christian, nor Shiite, nor Druze, but everyone must behave well, and no one should try to attack us,' the fighter said. Prime minister says the government is still operational Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali, who remained in his post after Assad and most of his top officials vanished over the weekend, has sought to project normalcy. 'We are working so that the transitional period is quick and smooth,' he told Sky News Arabia TV on Monday, saying the security situation had already improved from the day before. He said the government is coordinating with the insurgents, and that he is ready to meet rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who made a triumphal appearance at a famed Damascus mosque on Sunday. Syrians who only days ago were working at all levels of the bureaucracy in Assad’s government were adjusting to the new reality. At the court of Justice in Damascus, which was stormed by the rebels to free detainees, Judge Khitam Haddad, an aide to the justice minister in the outgoing government, said Sunday that judges were ready to resume work quickly. 'We want to give everyone their rights,' Haddad said outside the courthouse. 'We want to build a new Syria and to keep the work, but with new methods.' The rebels, meanwhile, said they would guarantee personal freedoms and would not impose Islamic dress on women. 'It is strictly forbidden to interfere with women’s dress or impose any request related to their clothing or appearance, including requests for modesty,' the General Command said in a statement on social media. Separately, a Syrian opposition war monitor said a top aide to Assad's brother, Maher, was found dead in his office near Damascus. A video that circulated on social media purportedly showed Maj. Gen. Ali Mahmoud covered with blood and with his clothes burned. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was not clear if he was killed or died by suicide. Maher Assad led the army's 4th Armored Division, which played a major role in the civil war that erupted in 2011, after a popular uprising against Assad led to a violent crackdown on dissent and the rise of an insurgency. Israel confirms it has struck suspected chemical weapons, rockets Israelis welcomed the fall of Assad, who was a key ally of Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, while expressing concern over what comes next. Israel says its forces temporarily seized a buffer zone inside Syria dating back to a 1974 agreement after Syrian troops withdrew in the chaos. 'The only interest we have is the security of Israel and its citizens,' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters on Monday. 'That’s why we attacked strategic weapons systems, like, for example, remaining chemical weapons, or long-range missiles and rockets, in order that they will not fall in the hands of extremists.' Saar did not provide details about when or where the strikes took place. An AP journalist in Damascus reported airstrikes in the area of the Mezzeh military airport, southwest of the capital, on Sunday. The airport has previously been targeted in Israeli airstrikes. Strikes were also heard in the capital on Monday. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria in recent years, targeting what it says are military sites related to Iran and Hezbollah. Israeli officials rarely comment on individual strikes. Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons stockpile in 2013, after the government was accused of launching an attack near Damascus that killed hundreds of people. But it is widely believed to have kept some of the weapons and was accused of using them again in subsequent years. Turkey says its allies have taken northern town Officials in Turkey, which is the main supporter of the Syrian opposition to Assad, say its allies have taken full control of the northern Syrian city of Manbij from a U.S.-supported and Kurdish-led force known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. The SDF said a Turkish drone struck in the village of al-Mistriha in eastern Syria, killing 12 civilians, including six children. Turkey views the SDF, which is primarily composed of a Syrian Kurdish militia, as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has waged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey. The SDF has also been a key ally of the United States in the war against the Islamic State group. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Monday expressed hope for a new era in Syria in which ethnic and religious groups can live peacefully under an inclusive government. But he warned against allowing Islamic State or Kurdish fighters to take advantage of the situation, saying Turkey will prevent Syria from turning into a 'haven for terrorism.' ___ Mroue reported from Beirut and Goldenberg from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Middle East latest: Israeli strikes hit Gaza and also target suspected weapons sites in Syria	Israeli strikes killed at least six people in the central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical officials said Monday, while also hitting suspected chemical and long-range weapons sites in Syria to keep them from rebels who seized Damascus. The U.N. Security Council plans to hold emergency closed consultations on Syria later Monday at the request of Russia, which on Monday said it granted asylum to its longtime ally Syrian leader Bashar Assad. Russian President Vladimir Putin personally made the decision to offer asylum to Assad, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov wouldn’t comment on Assad’s specific whereabouts and said that Putin wasn’t planning to meet with him. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in the Gaza since the start of the war, according to local health authorities. They say most of the dead are women and children but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250, including older adults and children. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here's the Latest: Syrian insurgents say they won't interfere with women's dressing or personal freedoms DAMASCUS, Syria — Syrian insurgents who toppled President Bashar Assad said they won't impose any religious dress code on women and vowed to guarantee personal freedom for everyone. In a statement posted on social media, the insurgents' General Command said 'it is strictly forbidden to interfere with women’s dress or impose any request related to their clothing or appearance, including requests for modesty.' The command said it affirms that personal freedom is guaranteed to everyone, and that respect for the rights of individuals is the basis for building a civilized nation. In areas that were controlled by Syrian opposition groups since the civil war erupted in 2011, the vast majority of women dressed modestly, only revealing their faces and hands. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the militant leader whose forces entered Damascus over the weekend, has renounced longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicted himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. T housands of Syrian soldiers cross into Iraq, an official says BAGHDAD — More than 4,000 Syrian army soldiers have crossed into Iraq since rebel forces seized Damascus and overthrew the government of Bashar Assad, a militia official in western Iraq said Monday. The official with the Anbar Tribal Mobilization Forces said that the soldiers had turned over their weapons, ammunition and armored vehicles and would be housed in a camp. He did not say where the camp was located. Another security official said that the governor of the Syrian province of Hasakeh had come to the border late Sunday night with a convoy of Syrian army soldiers who wanted to cross into Iraq, and they were allowed in via the Qaim crossing. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The Iraqi government has close ties with Iran and used to be one of Assad's primary backers but Baghdad has taken a neutral position on the advance of the insurgents and Assad’s downfall. — By Qassim Abdul-Zahra UN human rights chief says Assad and other officials should face justice GENEVA — The U.N. human rights chief said Monday that former President Bashar Assad and other top Syrian officials behind possible war crimes 'should be brought to justice.' Volker Türk also said any transition process in Syria should not be separated from the need for accountability for alleged war crimes that took place in its civil war that began in 2011, leaving hundreds of thousands dead and millions fleeing their homes. Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, also noted that Syria has not ratified the International Criminal Court statute, but the court in The Hague could have jurisdiction if the 'new Syria' decides to ratify it -- an allusion to whoever the new leadership of Syria becomes. Turk said there were 'serious grounds to believe' that Assad and others in serious leadership positions in his government may have committed atrocity crimes, 'and as a result, yes, they should be brought to justice.' Russia grants political asylum to Assad, Kremlin says MOSCOW — The Kremlin said Monday that Russia has granted political asylum to former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Russian President Vladimir Putin has personally made the decision to offer asylum to Assad, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 'Such decisions certainly can’t be made without the head of state,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. 'It was his decision.' Peskov wouldn’t comment on Assad’s specific whereabouts. He said that Putin wasn’t planning to meet with Assad. The Kremlin spokesman said that Moscow has been doing everything needed to ensure the security of its military bases in Syria. He said the future of the Russian bases will be a subject for discussion with the new authorities. 'For now, we are witnessing a period of transformation and extreme instability, so it will obviously take time and require a serious conversation with those who will have power,' he said. 'The developments have surprised the world, and we weren’t an exclusion,' Peskov said when asked whether the Kremlin was surprised by Assad’s quick demise. Turkish foreign minister says Ankara hopes for ‘an inclusive government’ in Syria ANKARA, Turkey — Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday that Ankara hopes the fall of the Syrian government will usher in a new era where different ethnic and religious groups can live peacefully under an inclusive new government. Fidan also said his country hopes that a 'new Syria' would maintain good relations with its neighbors and bring stability to the volatile region. 'The developments in Syria yesterday have given us a glimmer of hope,' Fidan said in a speech to Turkish ambassadors. 'We expect international actors, especially the United Nations, to reach out to the Syrian people and support the formation of an inclusive government.' The minister said Turkey would continue to support Syria’s territorial and political unity and work toward the country’s 'prosperity, security and stability.' But Fidan said it was important that the Islamic State group and Kurdish militants do not take advantage of the situation, adding that Turkey 'would work with determination' to prevent Syria from turning into a 'haven for terrorism.' 'Turkey, which has reached out to its Syrian brothers during difficult times, will also be by their side, as the new page opens in Damascus,' Fidan said. 'We believe that the Syrian people will also make good use of this golden opportunity.' Israel says a drone that appears to have originated in Yemen hit a city in central Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said Monday that a drone that appeared to have originated in Yemen slammed into a city in central Israel. Video posted by Israeli news sites showed a large burst of smoke erupting from a high-rise apartment building. The military said sirens were not sounded to warn of the incoming drone. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Iran-backed militants in Yemen have been attacking Israel since Hamas’ assault on southern Israel in October 2023. Their drones have at times evaded Israel’s sophisticated aerial defense system. Turkey-backed forces take full control of Syrian city from U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led force ANKARA, Turkey — The Turkish-backed forces known as the Syrian National Army launched an offensive against the Syrian Democratic Forces in the northern Syrian city of Manbij on Dec. 6, days after expelling SDF fighters from the city of Tal Rifaat. Turkish security officials said Monday that 'control of Manbij has been secured,' without providing further details. The officials provided the information on condition of anonymity, in line with Turkish regulations. Turkey views the SDF, which is primarily composed of a Syrian Kurdish militia group, as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, and a terrorist organization. The force, however, has been a key partner of the United States in the fight against the Islamic State group. Separately, the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement on Monday that a Turkish drone strike in the village of al-Mistriha north of Raqqa in eastern Syria killed 12 civilians, including six children. Top aide to Assad's brother found dead, war monitor says BEIRUT — A Syrian opposition war monitor says a top aide to the brother of Syria’s ousted president was found dead in his office near the capital, Damascus. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Maj. Gen. Ali Mahmoud, who was in charge of Maher Assad’s office, had led a 2018 military campaign in southern Syria. A video that circulated on social media allegedly showed Mahmoud covered in blood while sitting on a chair. His clothes appear to have been set on fire. It was not clear if he was killed by Maher Assad or he committed suicide, the observatory’s chief Rami Abdurrahman said. Maher Assad was in charge of the army’s 4th Armored Division which played a major role in Syria’s conflict since it began in March 2011. Israel says it has struck suspected chemical weapons sites and long-range rockets in Syria JERUSALEM — Israel’s foreign minister says the strikes were to prevent them from falling into the hands of hostile actors. Gideon Saar said Monday that 'the only interest we have is the security of Israel and its citizens.' 'That’s why we attacked strategic weapons systems, like, for example, remaining chemical weapons, or long-range missiles and rockets so that they will not fall in the hands of extremists.' Syrian prime min ister says Cabinet working to ensure smooth transition of power DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s prime minister says most Cabinet ministers who are in Damascus are performing their duties from their offices to promote security and that food and medicine are available to the public. 'We are working so that the transitional period is quick and smooth,' Mohammed Ghazi Jalali told Sky News Arabia TV station on Monday. The government is working with insurgents, Jalali said, adding that he is ready to meet their leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who heads the jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Israeli strikes kill 6 in central Gaza, Palestinian officials say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes in the central Gaza Strip overnight killed at least six people, including a woman, Palestinian medical officials said Monday. Among the dead were Raed Ghabaien, who was released from Israeli detention in 2014, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the casualties were taken. He was killed along with his wife when an Israeli strike hit their tent in the central town of Zuweida, the hospital records showed. Two other people were killed in a strike that hit their house late Sunday in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp. Another two were killed in a strike in the Wadi Gaza area early Monday. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital’s morgue. Mourners held funeral services Monday morning for the six dead and nine others who were killed in a strike the previous day in the urban refugee camp of Bureij. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in the Gaza since the start of the war, according to local health authorities. They say most of the dead are women and children but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel says it only strikes militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in residential areas. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250, including older adults and children. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. US Central Command forces launch airstrikes in central Syria TAMPA, Fla. – U.S. Central Command says its forces launched dozens of airstrikes targeting Islamic State group camps and operatives in central Syria. The strikes on Sunday were intended to 'disrupt, degrade, and defeat ISIS, in order to prevent the terrorist group from conducting external operations and to ensure that ISIS does not seek to take advantage of the current situation to reconstitute in central Syria,' it said in a statement. The airstrikes hit over 75 targets using B-52s, F-15s and A-10s, it said, noting that damage assessments were underway and there were no indications of civilian casualties. Japanese official says Tokyo is ‘gravely worried’ about situation in Middle East TOKYO — Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi says Tokyo is watching recent development in Syria 'with serious interest,' while hoping for an improvement in human rights conditions for the Syrian people. 'Japan is gravely worried about large number of deaths among citizens and strongly concerned about further worsening of the humanitarian conditions,' Hayashi said Monday. He added that Japan is 'hopeful' that the latest developments could lead to an improvement in the situation. New Zealand foreign minister calls for ‘peaceful transition’ in Syria WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters says his country is closely following developments related to the collapse of former President Bashar Assad’s government in Syria. 'This was a regime that perpetrated significant human rights abuses, including repeated chemical weapons attacks, against its own people for many years,' Peters said in a statement issued on Monday. 'Now we need to see a peaceful transition with civilians protected and UN Security Council resolutions upheld. This is critical for moving towards a sustainable and comprehensive political solution.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-9-december-2024-0a5c8edb3a7dc438f8407f44a0fd7154	2024-12-08T22:40:02-08:00	
Netanyahu is set to take the witness stand for the first time in his corruption trial in Israel	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to take to the witness stand Tuesday for the first time in his trial on corruption allegations, a pivotal point in the drawn-out proceedings that comes as the leader wages war in Gaza and faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes charges. At home, Netanyahu is on trial for accusations of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate affairs. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing, but his appearance on the witness stand will be a low point in his decades-long political career, standing in contrast to the image of a sophisticated, respected leader he has tried to cultivate. The trial will take up a chunk of Netanyahu's time at a crucial point for Israel. While he makes his case for weeks from the stand, he will still be tasked with managing the war in Gaza, maintaining a fragile ceasefire with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and keeping tabs on threats from the wider Middle East, including Iran. It will be the first time an Israeli prime minister has taken the stand as a criminal defendant, and Netanyahu has repeatedly sought to delay the proceedings, citing the ongoing Gaza war and security concerns. The judges ordered the trial to resume Tuesday, moving the proceedings to an underground chamber in a Tel Aviv court as a security precaution. Netanyahu's appearance in the courtroom will also draw attention to other legal issues in the Israeli leader's orbit. Close advisers in his office are embroiled in a separate series of scandals surrounding leaked classified information and doctored documents. While Netanyahu is not suspected of direct involvement in those, they could weaken his public image. Here is a look at the ongoing trial. Where does Netanyahu's trial stand? The trial, which began in 2020, involves three separate cases in which prosecutors say Netanyahu exchanged regulatory favors with media titans for favorable press coverage and advanced the personal interests of a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for lavish gifts. Prosecutors have called roughly 140 witnesses to the stand — fewer than the 300 initially expected to testify. Those witnesses have included some of Netanyahu's closest former confidants who turned against him, as well as a former prime minister, former security chiefs and media personalities. Lawyers have submitted thousands of items of evidence -- recordings, police documents, text messages. A new documentary, 'The Bibi Files,' has shined new light on the cases by obtaining footage of Netanyahu being questioned by police, as well as interrogations of his wife and some key witnesses. In a glimpse of what can be expected in the courtroom, Netanyahu appears both combative and anxious at times, accusing police of unfairly picking on him and denigrating other witnesses as liars. The prosecution called to the stand its final witness over the summer, bringing to an end three years of testimony and setting the stage for the defense to lay out its case, with Netanyahu its first witness. Netanyahu’s appearance will give Israelis a chance to see the long-serving Israeli leader answer to the charges before the three-judge panel. What are some notable moments from Netanyahu's trial? The prosecution has sought to portray Netanyahu as media-obsessed, to push its narrative that he would break the law for favorable coverage. Witness accounts have shed light not only on the three cases but also on sensational details about Netanyahu’s character and his family’s reputation for living lavishly on the backs of taxpayers and wealthy supporters. One former aide and a key prosecution witness called him a 'control freak' over his image. Another witness described expensive gifts for Netanyahu and his wife. Arnon Milchan, an Israeli producer of Hollywood blockbuster films such as 'Pretty Woman,' took the stand last year by videoconference, describing how he routinely delivered tens of thousands of dollars of champagne, cigars and other gifts requested by the Israeli leader. One key witness, a former top aide to Netanyahu, stunned prosecutors by backtracking from his earlier claims against the prime minister, opening the door for the defense to erode his credibility as a witness. The trial was jolted by Israeli media reports that police used sophisticated phone-hacking software to spy on this witness. What happens next in Netanyahu's trial? The prosecution formally rested its case in July, and the court recessed for the summer and fall. The defense has repeatedly asked for delays in Netanyahu's testimony, which have mostly been denied. Like other witnesses, Netanyahu will testify three days a week, for hours at a time, and his testimony is expected to last weeks. The defense will seek to depict Netanyahu as a law-abiding leader who was a victim of careless and biased police investigations. Netanyahu's critics have sought to draw a clear line between the cases and the war in Gaza. They say the allegations led Netanyahu to promote a contentious judicial overhaul plan last year that bitterly divided the country and created an image of weakness that encouraged the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that triggered the war. Netanyahu’s critics, including families of hostages held by Hamas, now accuse him of dragging out the conflict — and risking the lives of their loved ones — to avoid an embarrassing investigation and new elections that could force him from power. If he is eventually voted out of power, being away from the prime minister’s seat would make it harder for Netanyahu to rail against the justice system and delegitimize the verdict in the eyes of the public. A verdict isn’t expected until 2026 — at least — and then Netanyahu can choose to appeal to the Supreme Court. Israel's courts are notoriously sluggish, and the case was further delayed last year when courts went on hiatus for two months after war broke out following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Once the defense rests, each side will summarize their cases before judges convene to deliberate over Netanyahu's fate.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-corruption-trial-gaza-war-a84a5a2743d111bb13982be3a4a1ea7b	2024-12-08T21:53:49-08:00	
Landslides and flash floods hit Indonesia’s Java island, leaving 10 dead and 2 missing	SUKABUMI, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian rescuers recovered 10 bodies that were swept away in flash floods or buried under tons of mud and rocks that hit hilly villages on the country’s main island of Java, officials said Monday. Two people are still missing. Torrential rains since last week have caused rivers to burst their banks, tearing through more than 170 villages in Sukabumi district of West Java province, as mud, rocks and trees tumbled down mountainside hamlets, said Lt. Col. Yudi Hariyanto, who heads a rescue command post in Sukabumi. Landslides, flash floods and strong winds devastated 172 villages and forced more than 3,000 people to flee to temporary government shelters, Hariyanto said. Authorities have warned nearly 1,000 people to evacuate as more than 400 houses are threatened by extreme weather. The disasters also destroyed 31 bridges, 81 roads and 539 hectares (1,332 acres) of rice fields, while 1,170 houses were flooded up to the roof. Extreme weather has also damaged more than 3,300 other houses and buildings, the local Disaster Management Agency said. Rescue workers on Monday pulled out 10 bodies in the worst-hit villages of Tegalbuleud, Simpenan and Ciemas, including three children, and rescuers are searching for two villagers who are reportedly still missing, Hariyanto said. Videos circulating on social media showed flash floods caused by heavy downpours in Sukabumi swept away almost everything in their path, including cars, motorbikes, buffaloes and cows. Footage released by West Java's Search and Rescue Agency showed roads that were transformed into murky brown rivers and villages covered by thick mud, rocks and uprooted trees as soldiers, police and rescue workers pulled mud-caked bodies from a devastated hamlet. Seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains. Last month, a landslide and flash floods triggered by heavy downpours hit Indonesia’s North Sumatra province, leaving 20 dead and two missing. A landslide in the region also hit a tourist bus that killed nine people. ___ Karmini reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-west-java-rain-landslide-flash-floods-cd3ea5fb6ae47b53aa87ba307c73a4c3	2024-12-08T21:41:30-08:00	
Russia has used its hypersonic Oreshnik missile for the first time. What are its capabilities?	The silent black-and-white surveillance camera video of the Russian missile attack in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro was brief but chilling: Six huge fireballs pierced the darkness and slammed into the ground at astonishing speed. Within hours of the Nov. 21 attack on the military facility, Russian President Vladimir Putin took the rare step of speaking on national TV to boast about the new, hypersonic missile. He warned the West that its next use could be against Ukraine’s NATO allies who allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Putin said the missile was called the 'Oreshnik' — Russian for 'hazelnut tree.' A look at the weapon, how it fits into Moscow's battle plan and what political message Russia wants to send by using it: What's known about the Oreshnik? A satisfied smile played across Putin's face as he described how the Oreshnik streaks to its target at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, 'like a meteorite,' and claimed it was immune to any missile defense system. Ukrainian military officials said it reached Mach 11. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, head of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, said the Oreshnik could carry nuclear or conventional warheads and has a range to reach any European target. The Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia's RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. The attack marked the first time such a weapon was used in a war. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019. Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate said the missile had six warheads, each carrying six submunitions. Its payload of independently targetable warheads, like a cluster of hazelnuts growing on a tree, could be the inspiration for the missile's name. Video of the attack appeared to show six warheads surrounded by clouds of plasma raining down in a fiery descent. The six submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives. Putin claimed the weapon is so powerful that using several such missiles — even fitted with conventional warheads — could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. It’s capable of destroying underground bunkers 'three, four or more floors down,' he boasted, threatening to use it against the government district in Kyiv. Ukraine’s Security Service showed The Associated Press wreckage of the missile -- charred, mangled wires and an ashen airframe — at Dnipro's Pivdenmash plant that built missiles when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. There were no fatalities in the attack, and authorities haven’t described the damage to the plant. They said the missile was fired from the 4th Missile Test Range of Kapustin Yar in Russia’s Astrakhan region on the Caspian Sea. What other missiles has Russia used? Russia has used an assortment of missiles to pummel Ukraine since the start of its invasion in February 2022, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik. They included subsonic long-range cruise missiles that carry about 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of explosives, enough to inflict a significant damage to Ukrainian power plants and other key infrastructure. The winged, jet-propelled cruise missiles have a range of up to 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles), able to reach all of Ukraine. Russia also used swarms of inexpensive, Iranian-designed drones that carry only about 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of explosives. The slow-flying drones are relatively easy to intercept, but Russia used dozens of them at a time to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses and divert attention from simultaneously launched cruise missiles. For some priority targets, Russia has used faster and harder-hitting missiles, including the ground-launched Iskander short-range ballistic missile with a range of 500 kilometers (310 miles). For particularly important targets, Moscow has used the hypersonic Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile. Its high speed — able to briefly reach Mach 10 — and ability to maneuver in flight helps it evade air defenses, although Ukraine claims to have shot down a few of them. Oreshnik is even more difficult to intercept than Kinzhal. It can inflict significantly heavier damage because of its multiple high-energy warheads. What message is Putin sending with the Oreshnik? Putin described the Oreshnik as a response to the U.S. and U.K. allowing Ukraine to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory, a move he said gave 'elements of a global character' to the conflict. 'We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,' he said. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Putin’s Security Council, said Oreshnik could reach targets in Europe within minutes, inflicting 'catastrophic' damage. 'Bomb shelters will not save you,' he posted on his messaging app channel. Russian state media extolled the Oreshnik, claiming it will take just 11 minutes to reach an air base in Poland and 17 minutes to reach NATO’s headquarters in Brussels. T-shirts have appeared with images of Putin and the Oreshnik, and he was told at a briefing that a couple planned to name their daughter after the missile. Military expert Mathieu Boulègue of Chatham House in Britain said that while the Oreshnik isn’t a game-changer on the battlefield, 'in terms of psychological warfare, it works great' in serving the Kremlin’s goal to scare a Western audience. The Nov. 21 attack came two days after Putin signed a revised version of Russia’s nuclear doctrine, which lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons. The doctrine allows for a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. The use of the Oreshnik was an expression of Moscow’s anger at the use of longer-range Western missiles and a signal to Ukraine and President-elect Donald Trump that Russia was going to pursue its goals, regardless of the support for Kyiv, said James J. Townsend, senior fellow at the Center for New American Security. 'This is a very powerful message being sent,' Townsend said. 'It’s showing Trump how serious Russia looks on what the Biden administration has been doing and how seriously they look on and how angry they are about this type of assistance.' Putin’s warning about potential strikes on NATO assets follows calls by Russian hawks for such attacks to force Ukraine’s allies to back down. Unlike other Russian conventional weapons with a shorter range, Oreshnik offers the capability to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether Oreshnik carries a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target. 'The enemy must understand that we are ready to take the most resolute steps and strike the territory of NATO members with conventional weapons first,' said Sergei Karaganov, a political expert who advises the Kremlin. 'At the same time, we will warn them that if they respond to that attack in an escalatory way, a nuclear strike would come second, and a third wave will target American bases.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-oreshnik-hypersonic-missile-putin-ukraine-war-345588a399158b9eb0b56990b8149bd9	2024-12-08T20:26:56-08:00	
Fishing boat capsizes after colliding with sand barge in South Korea, killing 7	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A fishing boat capsized after colliding with a sand barge in waters off South Korea’s southeastern coast early Monday, leaving seven crew members dead and one missing, according to local coast guard and fire departments. The 29-ton fishing boat, which had eight passengers, three South Koreans and five Indonesian nationals, capsized after colliding with a 456-ton barge in waters near the city of Gyeongju, according to Kim Eul-dong, an official at the Pohang coast guard. Dozens of emergency workers, along with 15 coast guard vessels and six helicopters, were mobilized to search for the missing passenger, who was Indonesian. None of the passengers from the barge were hurt.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-capsized-fishing-boat-gyeongju-199c41bc8863dae87ea85c9c41439f8e	2024-12-08T20:25:11-08:00	
2 men are standing trial on charges they chopped down Britain's scenic Sycamore Gap tree	LONDON (AP) — It was neither Britain’s biggest tree nor its oldest. But the majestic sycamore that stood for 150 years along a stretch of Hadrian’s Wall in northern England was one of the most beloved. Perched symmetrically in a dip between two hills, the Sycamore Gap tree had been the site of first kisses, wedding proposals and even a place where the ashes of loved ones were scattered. When local residents and admirers woke to the news last fall that it had been cut down in the dark of night, they wanted to know why and who could have committed such a senseless act. On Monday, prosecutors are expected to start providing those answers. Two men are scheduled to go on trial in Newcastle Crown Court on charges related to toppling the tree and damaging the ancient wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire. Little has been said about the case, including a possible motive, to protect the integrity of the trial and rights of the accused. Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, have pleaded not guilty to two counts each of criminal damage. Prosecutors said the value of the tree exceeded 620,000 pounds ($790,000) and damage to the wall was assessed at 1,100 pounds ($1,400). 'This is a case that will be instantly recognizable to you, indeed anyone hearing the charges read out,' prosecutor Rebecca Brown said at a court appearance for the two men in May. 'The prosecution say the tree was deliberately felled on Sept. 28 last year and the resultant fall damaged Hadrian’s Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,' Brown said. 'The prosecution say these defendants are responsible as part of a joint enterprise.' Word of the tree's demise spread swiftly and the impact reverberated through the wild and scenic Northumberland region. 'I still can’t come to terms with the fact that the tree’s not there,' said Catherine Cape, who lives nearby. 'I am still really angry about it. I can’t understand why you would want to destroy something so beautiful.' The tree became famous after being featured in Kevin Costner’s 1991 film 'Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves,' and was a big draw for tourism. Before the tree was cut down, about 80% of the inquiries at Northumberland National Park 's main visitors center were from people planning to walk to the tree, the park's chief executive, Tony Gates, said after the tree was cut down. The sycamore’s broad canopy framed between two hills had long been a popular draw for landscape photographers and a scenic stop for walkers on the path along the wall. Cape walked to the tree on her first and second dates with her future husband. They later watched their daughter take her first steps there. And after her mother and sister both died in 2020, she met her brother-in-law and nephews there when they couldn’t gather indoors during the COVID-19 lockdown. The tree was a huge draw for the guests that stayed at a small cabin Cape owns. Bookings dropped off after the tree was downed but they have largely rebounded. She used to drive past the tree two or three days a week but now takes the highway instead because she doesn't like to see the empty space on the hillside where it stood. The sycamore was removed with a crane and taken to a National Trust property for storage. A section of the trunk went on display at the park visitor center this fall and seeds from the tree that were used to grow saplings are being donated for planting around the U.K. In time, the tree itself may grow back. More than two dozens shoots were discovered sprouting from the stump. 'The tree does still live on, but just not in the form that it was,' Cape said. 'We’ll never see it in our lifetime grow into a tree, or what it was before.'	https://apnews.com/article/sycamore-gap-tree-northumberland-trial-3c65e5416be23dbf2afebefed362345e	2024-12-08T20:12:24-08:00	
Syrian rebels free prisoners from Assad's notorious dungeons who celebrate in Damascus streets	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Bashar Barhoum woke in his dungeon prison cell in Damascus at dawn Sunday, thinking it would be the last day of his life. The 63-year-old writer was supposed to have been executed after being imprisoned for seven months. But he soon realized the men at the door weren't from former Syrian President Bashar Assad ’s notorious security forces, ready to take him to his death. Instead, they were rebels coming to set him free. As the insurgents swept across Syria in just 10 days to bring an end to the Assad family’s 50-year rule, they broke into prisons and security facilities to free political prisoners and many of the tens of thousands of people who disappeared since the conflict began back in 2011. Barhoum was one of those freed who were celebrating in Damascus. 'I haven’t seen the sun until today,' Barhoum told The Associated Press after walking in disbelief through the streets of Damascus. 'Instead of being dead tomorrow, thank God, he gave me a new lease of life.' Barhoum couldn’t find his cellphone and belongings in the prison so set off to find a way to tell his wife and daughters that he’s alive and well. Videos shared widely across social media showed dozens of prisoners running in celebration after the insurgents released them, some barefoot and others wearing little clothing. One of them screams in celebration after he finds out that the government has fallen. Torture, executions and starvation in Syria's prisons Syria's prisons have been infamous for their harsh conditions. Torture is systematic, say human rights groups, whistleblowers, and former detainees. Secret executions have been reported at more than two dozen facilities run by Syrian intelligence, as well as at other sites. In 2013, a Syrian military defector, known as 'Caesar,' smuggled out over 53,000 photographs that human rights groups say showed clear evidence of rampant torture, but also disease and starvation in Syria's prison facilities. Syria’s feared security apparatus and prisons did not only serve to isolate Assad’s opponents, but also to instill fear among his own people said Lina Khatib, Associate Fellow in the Middle East and North Africa program at the London think tank Chatham House. 'Anxiety about being thrown in one of Assad’s notorious prisons created wide mistrust among Syrians,' Khatib said. 'Assad nurtured this culture of fear to maintain control and crush political opposition.' Just north of Damascus in the Saydnaya military prison, known as the 'human slaughterhouse,' women detainees, some with their children, screamed as men broke the locks off their cell doors. Amnesty International and other groups say that dozens of people were secretly executed every week in Saydnaya, estimating that up to 13,000 Syrians were killed between 2011 and 2016. 'Don’t be afraid … Bashar Assad has fallen! Why are you afraid?' said one of the rebels as he tried to rush streams of women out of their jam-packed tiny cells. Tens of thousands of detainees have so far been freed, said Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based pro-opposition war monitor. Over the past 10 days, insurgents freed prisoners in cities including Aleppo, Homs, Hama as well as Damascus. Families seek loved ones who have been missing for years Omar Alshogre, who was detained for three years and survived relentless torture, watched in awe from his home far from Syria as videos showed dozens of detainees fleeing. 'A hundred democracies in the world had done nothing to help them, and now a few military groups came down and broke open prison after prison,' Alshogre, a human rights advocate who now resides in Sweden and the U.S., told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, families of detainees and the disappeared skipped celebrations of the downfall of the Assad dynasty. Instead, they waited outside prisons and security branch centers, hoping their loved ones would be there. They had high expectations for the newcomers who will now run the battered country. 'This happiness will not be completed until I can see my son out of prison and know where he is,' said Bassam Masri. 'I have been searching for him for two hours. He has been detained for 13 years,' since the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011. Rebels struggled to control the chaos as crowds gathered by the Court of Justice in Damascus. Heba, who only gave her first name while speaking to the AP, said she was looking for her brother and brother-in-law who were detained while reporting a stolen car in 2011 and hadn't been seen since.

Emilia Pérez' leads Golden Globe nominations with 10, followed by 'The Brutalist' and 'Conclave'	Jacques Audiard’s audacious musical 'Emilia Pérez,' about a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirming surgery to become a woman, led nominations to the 82nd Golden Globes on Monday, scoring 10 nods to lead it over other contenders like the musical smash 'Wicked,' the papal thriller 'Conclave' and the post-war epic 'The Brutalist.' The nominations for Globes, which will be televised by CBS and streamed on Paramount+ on Jan. 5, were announced on Monday morning by Mindy Kaling and Morris Chestnut. The embattled Globes, which are no longer presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are still in comeback mode after years of scandal and organizational upheaval. Working in the Globes favor this year: a especially starry field of nominees. Zendaya, Timothée Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Glen Powell and Selena Gomez all scored nominations. The young Donald Trump drama 'The Apprentice' also landed nominations for its two central performances, by Sebastian Stan as Trump and Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn. The president elect has called 'The Apprentice' a 'politically disgusting hatchet job' made by 'human scum.' How much the recent president election will figure into Hollywood's awards season remains to be seen. In the season's first awards ceremony, the Gotham Awards, Trump went unmentioned but sometimes alluded to. Stan also received a nomination Monday for the dark comedy 'A Different Man.' While 'Oppenheimer' and, to a lesser degree, 'Barbie,' sailed into the Globes nominations as the clear heavyweights of awards season, no such frontrunner has emerged this year. The Globes don’t often align with the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, a much larger group that far more closely reflects the film industry. But they can give movies a major boost, and ripe fodder for their awards marketing. Following 'Emilia Pérez,' Brady Corbet’s 'The Brutalist' landed seven nominations, including best picture, drama, and acting nods for Adrian Brody and Guy Pearce. The soon-to-be-released film, from A24, is uncommonly ambitious, with a runtime of three-and-a-half hours, including an intermission. Close behind it was Edward Berger’s 'Conclave,' starring Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal tasked with leading the conclave to elect a new pope. It landed six nominations, including best picture, drama, and acting nods for Fiennes and Isabella Rossellini. Sean Baker's Palme d'Or-winning 'Anora,' starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn sex worker who marries the son of a Russian Oligarch, was nominated for five awards, including best picture, comedy or musical, and best female actor for Madison and best supporting actor for Yura Borisov. The Golden Globes will be hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser, who scored her own nomination for best stand-up special. CBS, which began airing the Globes last year on a new deal, will hope Glaser manages to do better than last year’s emcee, Jo Koy, whose stint was widely panned. Here’s details from the nominations: Who are this year's Globes nominees? The nominees for best motion picture drama are: 'The Brutalist'; 'A Complete Unknown,'; 'Conclave'; 'Dune: Part Two'; 'Nickel Boys;' 'September 5.' The nominees for best film musical or comedy are: 'Wicked'; 'Anora'; 'Emilia Pérez'; 'Challengers'; 'A Real Pain'; 'The Substance.' The nominees for best male actor in a motion picture musical or comedy are: Jesse Eisenberg, 'A Real Pain'; Hugh Grant, 'Heretic'; Gabriel LaBelle, 'Saturday Night; Jesse Plemons, 'Kinds of Kindness'’ Glen Powell, 'Hitman'; Sebastian Stan, 'A Different Man.' The nominees for best animated film are: 'Flow'; 'Inside Out 2'; 'Memoir of a Snail'; 'Moana 2'; 'Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl'; 'The Wild Robot.' The nominees for cinematic and box office achievement are: 'Alien: Romulus'; Beetlejuice Beetlejuice'; Deadpool &amp; Wolverine'; 'Gladiator II'; 'Inside Out 2'; 'Twisters'; 'Wicked'; 'The Wild Robot.' The nominees for best original score: 'Conclave'; 'The Brutalist'; 'The Wild Robot'; 'Emilia Pérez'; 'Challengers'; 'Dune: Part Two.' How about the TV categories? The nominees for best television drama are: 'Shogun'; 'The Diplomat'; 'Slow Horses'; 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith'; 'The Day of the Jackal'; 'Squid Game.' The nominees for TV series (comedy or musical) are: 'Abbott Elementary'; 'The Bear; 'Hacks'; 'Nobody Wants This'; 'Only Murders in the Building'; 'The Gentlemen.' The nominees for best male actor in a drama series are: Donald Glover, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith'; Jake Gyllenhaal, 'Presumed Innocent'; Gary Oldman, 'Slow Horses'; Eddie Redmayne, 'The Day of the Jackal'; Hiroyuki Sanada, 'Shogun'; Billy Bob Thornton, 'Landman.' The nominees for female actor in a comedy series are: Kristen Bell, 'Nobody wants This'; Quinta Brunson, 'Abbott Elementary'; Ayo Edebiri, 'The Bear'; Selena Gomez, 'Only Murders in the Building'; Kathryn Hahn, 'Agatha All Along'; Jean Smart, 'Hacks.' What’s new this year? Last year, the Globes introduced two new categories that remain this time around: the cinematic and box office achievement award and the best performance in stand-up comedy on television. One tweak this time comes in the lifetime achievement awards. This year, those are going to Ted Danson (for the Carol Burnett Award) and Viola Davis (for the Cecil B. DeMille Award). Those will be handed out in a gala dinner on Friday, Jan. 3, several days before the Globes. What’s the deal with the Golden Globes, anyway? The Globes aren’t ever quite drama-free, but things have settled down for the embattled awards body. Last year’s Globes were the first after the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and their acquisition by Dick Clark Productions and billionaire Todd Boehly’s private equity firm Eldridge Industries. However, earlier this fall, the Ankler reported that former members of the HFPA filed a letter with the California Attorney General’s office questioning 'the validity of the purchase.' ___ For more coverage of the 2025 Golden Globe Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/golden-globe-awards	https://apnews.com/article/golden-globes-nominations-2025-84e022069bd2083252c08918242cf7f9	2024-12-08T20:07:42-08:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mixed as oil prices jump following ouster of Syria's Assad	BANGKOK (AP) — World shares were mixed and oil prices jumped Monday after the weekend overthrow of Syrian leader Bashar Assad, who sought asylum in Moscow after rebels ended the Assad family’s 50 years of iron rule. That added to uncertainty in a region fraught with conflict. U.S. benchmark crude oil jumped 75 cents to $67.95 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard gained 69 cents to $71.81 per barrel. In early European trading, Germany's DAX fell 0.3% to 20,322.32, while the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.3% to 7,448.45. Britain's FTSE 100 edged 0.2% higher. The future for the S&amp;P 500 edged 0.1% lower while that for the Dow was unchanged. Hong Kong shares bounced higher after top Chinese leaders met and agreed on a 'moderately loose' monetary policy, shifting away from a more cautious 'prudent' stance for the first time in 10 years. Chinese shares were mixed, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rebounding from early losses to gain 2.8% to 20,414.09. The Shanghai Composite index fell less than 0.1% to 3,402.53. Investors took heart from the state media’s readout from a meeting of the ruling Communist Party’s Politburo that pledged more support for the sluggish economy. A major planning meeting later this week is expected to set the policy agenda for coming months, possibly bringing fresh stimulus for the world’s No. 2 economy. The Kospi in Seoul slumped 2.8% to 2,360.58. South Korea’s political situation remained tense as local media reported that the police were considering imposing an overseas travel ban on President Yoon Suk Yeol. Yoon’s status was uncertain after he declared martial law last week in the midst of a budget dispute and then reversed that hours later. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index edged 0.2% higher, to 39,160.50 after the government reported that the economy expanded at a 1.2% annual rate in July to September, higher than the initial estimate of 0.9% growth. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 was nearly unchanged at 8,423.00. India's Sensex shed 0.3%, while Taiwan's Taiex gained 0.3%. In Bangkok, the SET declined 0.3%. On Friday, U.S. stocks rose to records after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not strong enough to raise immediate worries about inflation. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.2% to 6,090.27, just enough to log another all-time high, closing a third straight winning week in what looks to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.3% to 44,642.52, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% to set its own record of 19,859.77. The jobs report strengthened traders’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. It showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, but also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. The hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had earlier seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates swiftly to crush inflation. A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan’s survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened. In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 10.6% for one of the S&amp;P 500’s larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stocks were some of the market’s strongest this week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they’re getting from the artificial-intelligence boom. In other dealings early Friday, Bitcoin was sitting near $98,300 after bursting above $103,000 to a record the day before. The euro rose to $1.0583 from $1.0561. The dollar was trading at 150.44 yen early Monday, up from 150.07 yen.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-korea-inflation-syria-2cf5e3044843320565fae24dd99d2ca8	2024-12-08T20:02:22-08:00	
Morocco produces Africa’s first mpox tests as the continent tries to rely less on imports	TAMESNA, Morocco (AP) — After African countries struggled to get testing kits during the COVID-19 pandemic, officials vowed to make the continent less dependent on imported medical supplies. Now, in a first for Africa, a Moroccan company is filling orders for mpox tests as an outbreak continues. Moroccan startup Moldiag began developing mpox tests after the World Health Organization declared the virus a global emergency in August. Africa’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported more than 59,000 mpox cases and 1,164 deaths in 20 countries this year. The WHO has also announced a plan to provide mpox tests, vaccines and treatments to the most vulnerable people in the world’s poorest countries, after facing criticism for moving too slowly on vaccines. It recommends all suspected mpox cases be tested. But in some far-flung areas of the mpox outbreak, tests have to be delivered to distant labs for processing. Most of Congo’s 26 provinces don’t have such facilities. And some areas have no tests. In eastern Congo’s South Kivu province, doctors are still diagnosing patients by taking temperatures and looking for visible symptoms. That makes it difficult to tell how the virus is spreading, health officials say. 'This is a major problem,' said Musole Robert, medical director of the Kavumu Referral Hospital, one of the few treating mpox patients in eastern Congo. 'The main issue remains the laboratory, which is not adequately equipped.' Mpox primarily spreads through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions. A health worker swabs the rash and sends the sample to a lab. Mpox testing is critical because many symptoms resemble diseases like chicken pox or measles. When mpox cases were found in some Western countries like the United States in 2022, some companies began developing rapid test kits that don’t require lab processing. But they shelved those efforts when the virus was largely contained. Then outbreaks emerged again in Africa. Scientists are concerned by the spread of a new version of the disease that might be more easily transmitted among people. Morocco has reported three mpox cases, though most have been in central Africa. At his factory in Morocco, Moldiag founder and chief scientific officer Abdeladim Moumen said the tests they make — sold for $5 each — can help to remedy shortages affordably. The company last month began accepting orders from Burundi, Uganda and Congo and has also sold them to Senegal and Nigeria as well. 'It’s rather easy to send tests from an African nation to another one rather than waiting for tests to come in from China or Europe,' Moumen said. Moldiag was founded out of Morocco’s Foundation for Advanced Science, Innovation and Research, a university-affiliated nonprofit whose research has received funding from the European Commission and Morocco’s government. The startup previously developed similar genetic tests for COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Moldiag won approval to distribute its mpox tests from the Africa CDC in November. But it hasn't submitted paperwork to be considered for expedited approval from the WHO, which during this outbreak has approved three mpox tests and is considering five others. Each is made in North America, Europe or Asia. The Africa CDC’s acting director for laboratory diagnostics and systems, Yenew Tebeje, said the organization created a process to accelerate approval of tests like Moldiag’s because the WHO’s approval process can take months or years and 'be a limiting factor for access to diagnostics.' Historically, international institutions have not always ensured medical supplies like tests are quickly made available for crises in Africa, Tebeje added. Only mpox tests that require laboratory processing have been approved by the WHO and Africa CDC, which has expressed the need for rapid tests that don't need to be sent to labs. Moldiag and other companies are working to develop rapid tests and pursue approval. Moldiag's $5 price for the current tests aligns with recommendations from both the WHO's target product standards and demands of health advocates who have criticized the cost of other tests. The nonprofit Public Citizen last month called on Cepheid — one of the WHO's three approved mpox test manufacturers — to reduce its price from about $20 to $5, citing a Doctors Without Borders analysis showing genetic tests can be produced for less. Africa-based manufacturing fulfills a primary objective that African Union member states agreed on after the COVID-19 pandemic, which revealed global disparities and unequal access to medical supplies, including vaccines, tests and antiviral medications. In 2022, shaken by the pandemic, African leaders called for action to address those disparities plaguing the continent's over 1.4 billion people, who experience the highest incidence of public health emergencies. Moumen said experts were waking up to the fact that it makes more sense for tests to come from regions where outbreaks are taking place so manufacturers can tailor production to address issues close to home. 'They want African tests for Africa,' he said. ___ Alonga reported from Goma, Congo.

Australian synagogue fire declared terrorism in a decision that increases investigation resources	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian law enforcement authorities on Monday declared an arson attack on a synagogue last week a terrorist act in a decision that increases resources available to the investigation. Arson squad detectives have been investigating the blaze that extensively damaged the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne on Friday. But the investigation was taken over on Monday by the Joint Counter-Terrorism Team which involves Victoria state Police and Australian Federal Police as well as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, the nation’s main domestic spy agency. 'The decision ... to transition the Adass Israel Synagogue fire attack to the Victorian Joint Counter-Terrorism Team is a crucial turning point in this investigation,' Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Krissy Barrett told reporters. 'I want to thank Victoria Police investigators for the significant information they have gathered so far, which has helped lead us to believe that this is likely to be a politically motivated attack. This is now a terrorism investigation,' Barrett added. The declaration gave investigators more resources, information and legal powers to pursue the three suspects, police said. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said investigators had made 'significant progress,' but declined to detail that progress. Witnesses reported seeing two masked men spreading a liquid accelerant in the mosque before the fire. Police have not revealed what role the third suspect played. Police have also not revealed if they know the identity of any suspect. The synagogue fire is the first declared terrorist incident in Australia since April when a 16-year-old boy allegedly stabbed a bishop and priest in a Sydney Assyrian church while a service was being streamed online. Some lawmakers had been calling for the arsonists to be charged with terrorism offenses so that they would potentially face longer prison sentences. The blaze is an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and Hamas last year. Cars and buildings have been vandalized and torched around Australia in protests inspired by the war. In a separate initiative, Australian Federal Police announced on Monday the formation of Special Operation Avalite to target antisemiticism around the country. The investigators were brought together in response to arson attacks on the synagogue, Jewish lawmaker Josh Burns' Melbourne office in June and on a car in a Sydney street last month that was related to antisemitic vandalism. 'Special Operation Avalite will be an agile and experienced squad of counter-terrorism investigators who will focus on threats, violence, and hatred towards the Australian Jewish community and parliamentarians,' Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said. Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, who is Jewish, said his government was striving to make the Jewish community 'feel safe.' 'We’ve experienced in Australia, in the last year, the highest level of antisemitism that I’ve experienced in my lifetime. That’s a common reaction from members of the Australian Jewish community,' Dreyfus said. The Victoria government on Friday offered 100,000 Australian dollars ($64,300) to help repair the synagogue and said there would be an increased police presence in the area. The federal government on Sunday offered the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, an umbrella body representing more than 200 Jewish organizations, AU$32.5 million ($20.8 million) to enhance security at community sites including synagogues and schools. ___ This story has corrected the Victoria police official’s surname to Patton not Patterson.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-synagogue-fire-melbourne-terrorism-a9b3940618560648504ce48b02fdcd36	2024-12-08T18:52:22-08:00	
South Korean police considering overseas travel ban on President Yoon over martial law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Police are considering placing an overseas travel ban on South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol as they investigate possible rebellion charges over his brief imposition of martial law last week, reports said Monday. Yoon’s martial law decree last Tuesday, which brought armed special forces troops into Seoul streets, is plunging South Korea into huge political turmoil. On Sunday, he avoided an opposition-led bid to impeach him, with most ruling party lawmakers boycotting a floor vote. But the opposition parties vowed to submit a new impeachment motion against him this week. On Monday, Yonhap news agency cited police as saying that they are considering banning Yoon from leaving the country as they investigate charges of rebellion. Other South Korean media carried similar reports. Repeated calls to the National Police Agency weren’t immediately answered. The main opposition Democratic Party called Yoon’s martial law imposition 'unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or a coup.' It has filed complaints with police against at least nine people, including Yoon and the former defense minister, over the alleged rebellion. While the president mostly has immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. South Korean prosecutors on Sunday detained former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who allegedly recommended Yoon declare martial law. He became the first person detained over the martial law case. The Defense Ministry said it has separately suspended three top military commanders over their alleged involvement in imposing martial law. They were among those facing the opposition-raised rebellion allegations. On Saturday, Yoon issued an apology over the martial law decree, saying he won’t shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country’s political turmoil, 'including matters related to my term in office.' Since taking office in 2022 for a single five-year term, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid scandals involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a 'den of criminals' bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.'	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-a196573506375f39d5645843bcf87828	2024-12-08T17:07:09-08:00	
Mbappé speaks to French TV station for first time about reports of a rape investigation in Sweden	PARIS (AP) — Kylian Mbappé says he reacted with disbelief when he saw media reports from Sweden two months ago that he was the subject of a rape investigation. The Real Madrid star spoke about the case publicly for the first time in an interview that aired Sunday on French TV station Canal Plus. Several Swedish media reported in October that Mbappé was the subject of a rape investigation following a visit to Stockholm during time off from playing for Madrid and France. At the time Mbappé's legal team dismissed those reports as false. 'I was surprised and I still am surprised, by the way. These are things that come into your life like that, you can’t see them coming,' Mbappé told Canal Plus. 'It’s just incomprehension. I don't think it weighed on me in the sense that I have never considered myself involved.' Mbappé added that he 'would go' to Sweden if ever he were summoned but that he has not been contacted by authorities. 'Listen, I haven’t received anything, no summons, nothing,' he told Canal Plus. 'The Swedish government has not said anything, so I’m not concerned (involved).' When the reports emerged in October, Swedish authorities confirmed that they were investigating a suspected rape at a Stockholm hotel but didn't name any suspect. A prosecutor told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet late last month that the investigation was still ongoing but didn't give other details. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/mbappe-rape-accusations-sweden-3f9167d659c0ca3ffad736cc3b3f484c	2024-12-08T12:27:31-08:00	
Georgian journalists allege brutal beatings as protests rage against ending EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Tens of thousands of people joined an 11th straight day of protests in Georgia on Sunday after the governing party suspended negotiations on joining the European Union, while a separate demonstration decried violence against Georgian journalists covering the rallies. Police have been using increasing force in their attempts to curb the demonstrations, which have centered on the parliament building in the capital, Tbilisi. Riot police have used water cannons and tear gas every day to disperse the rallies, beating scores of protesters who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital’s central boulevard. At Saturday night’s demonstration, reporter Maka Chikhladze and her colleague from the independent Pirveli TV channel were targeted by a violent mob, Chikhladze told The Associated Press. Chikladze said her colleague managed to capture footage of men dressed in black who were beating demonstrators before they turned on the pair, violently pushing Chikhladze to the ground. She later told AP that her colleague sustained a head injury and had his camera stolen. Chikhladze charged that Georgia’s government was using bands of thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, an allegation denied by representatives of the Georgian Dream party. On Sunday, several hundred media workers marched down Tbilisi’s central Rustaveli Avenue before putting up posters of colleagues they say had been assaulted while doing their jobs. 'Our colleagues are beaten, injured, some remain in hospital in serious condition,' TV Pirveli anchor Ekaterine Mishveladze told AP. In a separate incident Saturday, AP journalists saw several masked men violently tackle a protester attempting to enter the offices of an opposition party, Ahali. The man, Koba Khabazi, lay slumped on the ground while his attackers repeatedly kicked him. He later showed AP his head injuries. Georgian Dream retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 election, a vote widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president, Salome Zourabichvili, have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia’s help and have boycotted parliament sessions. Opposition protests gained new momentum after the Georgian Dream’s decision last Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. Riot police have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the rallies and beat scores of protesters, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on Rustaveli Avenue. The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials. Speaking Thursday at a ministerial conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken denounced what he described as the brutal 'repression of those calling for their country to stay on the path to closer ties with Europe.' Mamuka Mdinanradze, leader of the Georgian Dream party, condemned mob violence against protesters during a news briefing Sunday, and denied any connection with the government. The office of Georgia’s rights ombudsman on Sunday issued a statement criticizing Georgian police for 'failing to take adequate measures' to ensure safety during the demonstrations. President Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, refused to recognize the official election results and contested them before the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal earlier this week. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. The law requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-protest-opposition-police-violence-russia-tbilisi-6c7bf69d66c468c5833d97a60ba3461b	2024-12-08T11:59:42-08:00

The crew managed to detain him and all those aboard the flight are safe, according to the company which is one of the country’s main airlines. The plane was diverted to Guadalajara in central Mexico, where the person was handed over to authorities. Other passengers later continued to their destination of Tijuana on the border with the U.S. Volaris said it has become a plaintiff to ensure that the passenger faces the full weight of the law.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-diverted-plane-flight-867ecc08010c35287f8dd95db5c51e7e	2024-12-08T11:51:38-08:00	
Gaza health officials say latest Israeli airstrikes kill at least 14 including children	DEIR AL BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes in central Gaza killed at least 14 people including children Sunday, Palestinian health officials said, while the bombing of a hospital in northern Gaza wounded a half-dozen patients. Israel’s military continues its latest offensive against Hamas militants in northern Gaza, whose remaining Palestinians have been almost completely cut off from the rest of the territory amid a growing humanitarian crisis. One airstrike flattened a residential building in the urban Bureij refugee camp Sunday afternoon, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the casualties were taken. At least nine people were killed including six children and a woman. An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies at the hospital’s morgue. Earlier on Sunday, another Israeli strike hit a tent in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least five people including two parents and their two children, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said. In northern Gaza, the Health Ministry said a bombing targeted the Indonesian Hospital wounding six patients, one of them seriously. It is the largest hospital north of Gaza City. 'We demand international protection for hospitals, patients and medical staff,' the ministry said in a statement that also urged safe passage to and from hospitals, more medical supplies and fuel and safe evacuation of the wounded. The Israeli military Sunday evening said it was unaware of any attack on the Indonesian Hospital 'in the last three to four hours.' Meanwhile, the military said it briefly closed the key Kerem Shalom crossing after fighters launched mortar shells several meters (feet) from the nearby humanitarian corridor toward its troops. It said Gaza's main cargo crossing was reopened after those who fired were 'eliminated,' though it added that the arrival and distribution of humanitarian aid was delayed. Kerem Shalom is the only crossing between Israel and Gaza that is designed for cargo shipments and has been the main artery for aid since the Rafah crossing with Egypt was shut in May. Last month, nearly two-thirds of aid entering Gaza came through Kerem Shalom. A second cold, rainy winter is beginning in Gaza, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in squalid tent camps and reliant on international aid. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 45,600 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-war-news-20a0d3732f81d88246f446b9e169113e	2024-12-08T09:18:34-08:00	
Cataldi promises hospitalized teammate Bove a goal and delivers as Fiorentina wins 8th straight	ROME (AP) — Danilo Cataldi texted hospitalized Fiorentina teammate Edoardo Bove to say that he would score for him Sunday and then fulfilled his promise in a 1-0 win over Cagliari on Sunday. It was Fiorentina’s first Serie A match since Bove collapsed on the field during a game against Inter Milan last weekend and was placed in a medically induced coma. The 22-year-old has been awake and alert since last Monday as doctors continue to investigate the cause of his collapse. Cataldi found the top corner midway through the first half and that was all Fiorentina needed for its eighth straight win in the Italian league to match the club record set in 1960. After he scored, Cataldi ran toward a TV camera, held up four fingers to match Bove’s No. 4 jersey then created a heart symbol with his fingers as he shouted, 'I told you. I told you.' 'I texted him before the match, saying: ‘Watch the game on TV because I'm going to score a goal into the top corner,’' Cataldi said. 'He said it was ‘impossible.’ We’re pleased that he’s feeling well and about these three points.' Fiorentina, which has a game in hand since the match against Inter was abandoned, moved level on points with third-place Inter. Fiorentina is three points behind new leader Atalanta, which is on a nine-game winning streak, and one point behind second-place Napoli, which was beaten 1-0 at home by Lazio. Gustav Isaksen scored for Lazio with a long-range shot late in the second half. Lazio also moved level on points with Inter and Fiorentina. Napoli had led for most of the season under first-year coach Antonio Conte but has now lost at home to both Atalanta and Lazio. Lazio has won six of its last seven matches. Also, Empoli won 4-1 at Hellas Verona and moved up to ninth; and Venezia and Como drew 2-2. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/fiorentina-cataldi-promise-bove-napoli-lazio-italy-93865f5f3257d73d040e2a0bea0fa9b0	2024-12-08T08:15:00-08:00	
Global reaction to Assad's sudden ouster from Syria ranges from jubilation to alarm	Across the Middle East and beyond, the fall of Syria’s authoritarian government at the hands of jihadi militants set off waves of jubilation, trepidation and alarm. Expatriate Syrians and many residents across the Middle East exulted at the overthrow of a leader who led his country through 14 years of civil strife that left half a million Syrians dead and displaced millions to countries around the world. Others worried about still more instability rocking a region in turmoil. Governments — whether allies or opponents of Assad — scrambled to absorb the sudden, stunning development and assess the implications for the Middle East and the world. Mixed emotions in the Middle East In Lebanon, thousands of Syrians headed for the Masnaa border crossing to return to their home country, despite the uncertainty. 'Anything is better than Bashar,' said Sami Abdel-Latif, a refugee from Hama who was heading back to join his wife and four children. 'This is a feeling we’ve been waiting 14 years for,' said Malak Matar, who was preparing to return to the capital Damascus. Now, he said, 'Syrians have to create a state that is well organized and take care of their country.' Many citizens in Syria's neighboring countries reacted with joy to news Assad was gone. In Jordan’s capital, Amman, resident Muhab al-Majali said his fall marked the end of 'unjust and tyrannical rule.' 'I believe that the future is beautiful and prosperous for the Syrians,' he said. Others were not so sure, in a region that saw the energy of the 2011 Arab Spring democracy movement collapse into conflict and authoritarian rule. Saeed Sawy, an engineer in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, predicted that Syria’s rebel groups would descend into infighting over the country’s future. 'We saw this happen before,' he said. 'We saw this in Libya, in Tunisia, in Yemen and Sudan. People rejoice over the fall of tyrants, then they disagree and fight, and a civil war starts.' Syria’s neighbors stepped up security along their borders. Lebanon said it was closing all but one of its land border crossings with Syria. Jordan also closed a border crossing. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces had — temporarily, he said — seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement, after Syrian troops abandoned their positions. Airstrikes were reported on a military airport near Damascus, which has previously been targeted by Israel, and on other Syrian military sites. Iran, a key ally of Assad, said the Syrian people should decide their country’s future 'without destructive, coercive foreign intervention.' The Foreign Ministry in Tehran said Iran supports Syria’s unity and national sovereignty, and hopes to see 'the end of military conflicts, the prevention of terrorist activities and the start of a national dialogue' with the participation of all groups. The Iraqi government, which is close to Iran, said it 'supports all international and regional efforts seeking to open a dialogue' for Syria. Egypt’s foreign ministry urged a 'comprehensive political process' to establish a new era of peace in the war-torn county. The head of Yemen’s internationally recognized government welcomed the fall of Assad as 'a historic moment.' Yemen’s government is at war with the Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran. Turkey has backed anti-Assad militant groups in Syria, and could play a key role in what happens next. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the fall of Assad brought 'hope.' He called on the world to help 'unite and reconstruct' Syria. Fidan, who met in Qatar on Saturday with diplomats from Russia and Iran, the main backers of the Assad regime, said regional and global powers should try 'to act with prudence and calm.' Europe urges calm The war sent millions of Syrians fleeing to Europe and expatriates took to the streets in celebration in cities including Paris, London, Stockholm, Helsinki and Athens. Many European governments welcomed Assad’s departure while urging a rapid return to stability. 'The end of Assad’s dictatorship is a positive and long-awaited development,' said Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s newly appointed foreign policy chief, in a post on X. 'Our priority is to ensure security in the region. I will work with all the constructive partners, in Syria and the region.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement that the end of Assad’s rule was 'good news,' adding that 'what matters now is that law and order are quickly restored in Syria.' France’s foreign ministry welcomed the fall of Assad, saying 'the Syrian people have suffered too much.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also welcomed the end of Assad’s 'barbaric regime.' 'We call on all sides to protect civilians and minorities and ensure essential aid can reach the most vulnerable in the coming hours and days,' he said. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also called for calm and urged work to ensure an 'orderly political transition to renewed institutions.' Russia, which backed Assad with troops and warplanes, said it has been following the 'dramatic events' in Syria 'with extreme concern.' Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha of Ukraine, which is at war with Russia, wrote on X that the ousted Syrian leader had suffered the fate of 'all dictators who bet on (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. He always betrays those who rely on him.' The U.S. assesses events In Washington, President Joe Biden was meeting with his national security team Sunday for an update on the situation in Syria. President-elect Donald Trump said in a social media post Saturday, before Assad’s fall was confirmed: 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, &amp; THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria, including U.S. forces working with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State group.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-overthrow-world-reaction-7caf6eca9a5f3af01e0801d434076232	2024-12-08T08:07:26-08:00
