Argentina's President Milei presents 2025 budget, vowing austerity and setting up a showdown	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Libertarian President Javier Milei of Argentina presented the 2025 budget to Congress late Sunday, outlining policy priorities that reflected his key pledge to kill the country's chronic fiscal deficit and signaled a new phase of confrontation with lawmakers.In an unprecedented move, Milei personally pitched the budget to Congress instead of his economy minister, lambasting Argentina's history of macroeconomic mismanagement and promising to veto anything that compromised his tough slog of tight fiscal policy. The president's budget proposal followed a week of political clashes in the legislature — where Milei controls less than 15% of the seats — over spending increases that the administration warns would derail its IMF-backed 'zero deficit' budget. Opposition parties have sought to pass laws to raise salaries and pensions with inflation to help hard-hit Argentines cope with brutal austerity. 'The cornerstone of this budget is the first truth of macroeconomics, a truth that for many years has been neglected in Argentina: that of zero deficit,' Milei told lawmakers, facing a handful of empty seats as most of the hard-line opposition Peronist bloc, Unión por la Patria, skipped his address. 'Managing means cleaning up the balance sheet, deactivating the debt bomb that we inherited.'Milei's supporters interrupted his speech — packed with his usual libertarian talking points — with whoops and cheers.It will fall to the opposition-dominated Congress, which controls the government’s purse strings, to approve the final budget. Milei’s political isolation makes matters fraught, setting up weeks of negotiations with political rivals who insist on concessions.But Milei vowed that nothing would stop him from pressing on with austerity. 'The budget is a declaration of principles,' said Argentine economist Agustín Almada. 'Even if there is no compromise from the opposition, Milei will continue pursuing this fiscal contraction.'If the stroke of a veto pen failed to prevent powerful lawmakers from spending, Milei promised to find other ways to cut down the state.'We will only discuss the increase in spending when it comes along with an explanation of what we’ll cut to compensate for it,' Milei said.Over Milei’s past nine months in office, dramatic cuts to public spending — which he says are necessary to restore market confidence in a country ravaged by one of the world's highest annual inflation rates — have racked up a fiscal surplus (0.4% of gross domestic product), something unseen in nearly two decades.The austerity has also caused deep economic pain in Argentina, with nearly 60% of Argentines now living in poverty, up from 44% in December, according to the Catholic University. Milei has largely balanced the budget by slashing financial transfers to provinces, removing energy and transport subsidies and holding wages and pensions steady despite inflation.The fight over pensions reached a head last week, when Milei and his allies defeated a bill that would have boosted social security spending in Argentina, compromising the administration's fiscal discipline. The bill swept through both houses of Congress last month but opposition parties ultimately failed to obtain the two-thirds majority needed to override the president’s veto after government lobbying eroded support for the measure. At news of the bill's rejection Thursday, outraged retirees — who have lost roughly half of their purchasing power due to inflation — poured into the streets of downtown Buenos Aires, where they faced off with riot police spraying tear gas and water canons. Milei warned that his fiscal shock therapy was not going to be easy. But his administration is betting that the worst has passed. Although Argentina's annual inflation hovers around 237%, Milei has retained popular support by working to keep a lid on monthly inflation, which has dropped to 4% since its peak of 26% last December when he took office. In an optimistic statement about the budget Sunday, the Finance Ministry said it expected Milei's proposal to result in an annual inflation rate of just 18% by the end of 2025 and yield a 5% economic growth rate. Argentina's economy contracted by more than 3% in the first half of 2024.But much of Milei's future depends on Congress. The government's pension law victory last week proved short-lived, as lawmakers in the lower house also passed a bill increasing spending on public universities. Milei has vowed to veto the bill. Congress dealt Milei another blow last week when it rejected his plan to raise spending on the intelligence services by more than $100 million. Despite all the belt-tightening, Milei has committed to increasing defense spending from 0.5% of GDP to 2.1%, raising the hackles of some lawmakers as his cuts to health and education hit the populace. Although Milei has repeatedly compromised to get his legislation through Congress, he took a strident tone in Sunday's speech, describing lawmakers as 'miserable rats who bet against the country.'Some analysts warned that Milei's exercise in political messaging spelled trouble. 'The image of a half-empty chamber of deputies during the president’s speech is an indication that it will not be easy for the government to pass this budget,' said Marcelo J. García, Director for the Americas at the New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. 'Again, Milei seems to be prioritizing confrontation over compromise.'	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-budget-congress-economy-inflation-c83178217097093d476fab94429768a4	2024-09-15T19:09:57-07:00	
Asian stocks mixed amid weak China data after Wall Street closes the best week of 2024	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks were mixed on Monday with several key markets closed for a holiday, after U.S. stocks finished their best week of the year and climbed to the cusp of their records.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.3% to 17,312.37 after data released over the weekend showed a slowdown in China’s economy in August, as factory output, retail sales and investment figures failed to meet expectations. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate unexpectedly surged to a six-month high, adding further challenges to the fragile economy.'The drums of a deepening economic slowdown are beating louder, and it’s time for China’s leadership to decide whether to step up or risk sliding further into stagnation,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4% to 8,133.40.Markets in Japan, mainland China and South Korea were closed for a holiday.Investors will closely watch the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, when the central bank is expected to announce its first interest rate cut since 2020. The Bank of Japan’s policy meeting on Thursday and Friday is expected to leave Japan's rate unchanged.In currency trading, the Japanese yen strengthened against the greenback, with the dollar falling to 140.53 yen from 140.82 yen. The euro cost $1.1092, inching up from $1.1076.U.S. futures and oil prices were higher.On Friday, the S&P 500 rose 0.5% to 5,626.02 for a fifth-straight gain and is just 0.7% below its all-time high set in July. Rallies for Microsoft, Broadcom and other big technology stocks helped it claw back almost all its losses from last week, which was its worst in nearly 18 months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.7% to 41,393.78 and the Nasdaq composite added 0.7% to 17,683.98.Stocks also got support from the bond market, where Treasury yields eased ahead of this week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve. The unanimous expectation on Wall Street is for the Fed to deliver the first cut to interest rates in more than four years on Wednesday, and traders are rekindling hopes it may offer bigger-than-usual relief.The Federal Reserve has been keeping its main interest rate at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy enough to stifle high inflation. With inflation having eased substantially from its peak two summers ago, the Fed has said it can turn more focus to bolstering the slowing job market and economy. How much to cut rates by will be a delicate balancing act for the Fed: Lowering them relieves pressure on the economy but can also give inflation more fuel. Reports earlier this week showed some underlying upward pressure may remain on inflation, which initially pushed traders to ratchet back expectations for the size of the Fed’s upcoming move.On Friday last week, though, traders were seeing roughly a coin flip’s chance that the Fed could deliver a large cut of half of a percentage point, instead of the more traditional quarter of a point, according to data from CME Group. The federal funds rate is currently sitting in a range of 5.25% to 5.50%.The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 3.65% from 3.68% last Thursday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, fell more sharply to 3.58% from 3.65%.In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude gained 22 cents to $67.97 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 16 cents to $71.77 a barrel.___AP Writers Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-today-wall-street-interest-rates-4e491b309ad5e9952627c1d9a0ee8e29	2024-09-15T19:05:54-07:00	
The Coast Guard will hear from former OceanGate employees about the Titan implosion	U.S. Coast Guard officials investigating the implosion of an experimental watercraft en route to the wreck of the Titanic were scheduled Monday to hear from former employees of the company that owned the Titan submersible.The aim of the two-week hearing in Charleston County, South Carolina, is to 'uncover the facts surrounding the incident and develop recommendations to prevent similar tragedies in the future,' the Coast Guard said in a statement earlier this month. The ongoing Marine Board of Investigation is the highest level of marine casualty investigation conducted by the Coast Guard.The Titan imploded in the North Atlantic in June 2023, killing all five people on board and setting off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration.Among those killed was Stockton Rush, co-founder of OceanGate, the Washington state company that owned the Titan. The company suspended operations after the implosion. Witnesses scheduled to testify on Monday include OceanGate's former engineering director, Tony Nissen; the company's former finance director, Bonnie Carl; and former contractor Tym Catterson.Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Some key OceanGate representatives are not scheduled to testify. They include Rush's widow, Wendy Rush, who was the company's communications director. The Coast Guard does not comment on the reasons for not calling specific individuals to a particular hearing during ongoing investigations, said Melissa Leake, a spokesperson for the Coast Guard. She added that it's common for a Marine Board of Investigation to 'hold multiple hearing sessions or conduct additional witness depositions for complex cases.'Scheduled to appear later in the hearing are OceanGate co-founder Guillermo Sohnlein; former operations director, David Lochridge; and former scientific director, Steven Ross, according to a list compiled by the Coast Guard. Numerous guard officials, scientists, and government and industry officials are also expected to testify. The U.S. Coast Guard subpoenaed witnesses who were not government employees, Leake said.OceanGate has no full-time employees at this time but will be represented by an attorney during the hearing, the company said in a statement. The company has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board investigations since they began, the statement said.'There are no words to ease the loss endured by the families impacted by this devastating incident, but we hope that this hearing will help shed light on the cause of the tragedy,' the statement added. The Titan became the subject of scrutiny in the undersea exploration community in part because of its unconventional design and its creator’s decision to forgo standard independent checks. The implosion killed Rush and veteran Titanic explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet; two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood; and British adventurer Hamish Harding.The Titan made its final dive on June 18, 2023, losing contact with its support vessel about two hours later. When it was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland.The search for the submersible attracted worldwide attention, as it became increasingly unlikely that anyone could have survived the implosion. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 300 meters (330 yards) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said.The time frame for the investigation was initially a year, but the inquiry has taken longer. The Coast Guard said in July that the hearing would delve into 'all aspects of the loss of the Titan,' including both mechanical considerations as well as compliance with regulations and crewmember qualifications. The Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/titan-submersible-implosion-hearing-2ae3c044e50a69647bd42cffe96c7f98	2024-09-15T19:03:51-07:00	
Starmer and Meloni holding talks on curbing migrant boats reaching UK and Italy	ROME (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Monday, as the two very different politicians, from left and right, seek common cause to curb migrants reaching their shores by boat.Support for Ukraine is also on the agenda for the trip, part of Starmer’s effort to reset relations with European neighbors after Britain’s acrimonious 2020 departure from the European Union.The center-left Labour Party prime minister isn't a natural ally of Meloni, who heads the far-right Brothers of Italy party. But migration has climbed the U.K. political agenda, and Starmer hopes lessons from Italy can help him stop people fleeing war and poverty trying to cross the English Channel in flimsy, overcrowded boats.More than 22,000 migrants have made the perilous crossing from France so far this year, a slight increase compared to the same period in 2023. Several dozen people have perished in the frigid Channel, including at least eight who died off the French coast on Saturday night.Hub peek embed (Migration) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Starmer promised 'a new era of international enforcement to dismantle these networks, protect our shores and bring order to the asylum system.' 'No more gimmicks,' he said before his trip to Rome — a reference to the previous Conservative government’s scuttled plan to send some asylum-seekers on a one-way trip to Rwanda.Meloni pledged a crackdown on migration after taking office in 2022, aiming to deter would-be refugees from paying smugglers to make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing. Her nationalist conservative government has signed deals with individual African countries to block departures, imposed limits on the work of humanitarian rescue ships, cracked down on traffickers and taken measures to deter people from setting off.Italy also has signed a deal with Albania under which some adult male migrants rescued at sea while trying to reach Italy would be taken instead to Albania while their asylum claims are processed.The number of migrants arriving in Italy by boat in the first half of this year was down 60% from 2023, according to the country’s Interior Ministry, and Starmer wants to learn from Italy’s mix of tough enforcement and international cooperation.Starmer will tour Italy’s national immigration crime coordination center with newly appointed U.K. Border Security Commander Martin Hewitt. The government says Hewitt, a former head of Britain’s National Police Chiefs’ Council, will work with law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the U.K. and across Europe to tackle-people smuggling networks.Soon after being elected in July, Starmer scrapped the Conservatives’ contentious plan to send asylum-seekers who cross the Channel to Rwanda, about 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) away, with no chance of returning to the U.K. even if their refugee claims were successful.The Conservatives said the deportation plan would act as a deterrent, but refugee and human rights groups called it unethical, judges ruled it illegal and Starmer dismissed it as an expensive gimmick. He has, though, expressed an interest in striking agreements like the one Italy has with Albania that would see asylum-seekers sent temporarily to another country.The Rome trip follows visits to Paris, Berlin and Dublin during Starmer’s first weeks in office — all part of efforts to restore ties with EU neighbors that have been frayed by Brexit. Starmer has ruled out rejoining the now 27-nation bloc, but is keen for a closer relationship on security and other issues.Ukraine will also feature in his talks with the Italian government, which holds the presidency of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations this year.Unlike some politicians on the European right, Meloni is a staunch supporter of Ukraine. Starmer meets her after returning from Washington, where he and U.S. President Joe Biden discussed Ukraine’s plea to use Western-supplied missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pressing allies to allow his forces to use Western weapons to target air bases and launch sites inside Russia as Moscow steps up assaults on Ukraine’s electricity grid and utilities before winter. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that would mean NATO countries 'are at war with Russia.'So far, the U.S. hasn't announced a change to its policy of allowing Kyiv to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia’s border with Ukraine.___Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/uk-italy-starmer-meloni-migration-c1705b3c44c750f71061eed5719c0d0d	2024-09-15T19:01:48-07:00	
Typhoon hits Shanghai with 94-mph winds after 400,000 people were evacuated	BEIJING (AP) — The strongest typhoon to hit Shanghai since at least 1949 made landfall early Monday with powerful winds and heavy rains after more than 400,000 people were evacuated.Flights, ferries and train services were suspended in the megacity and in neighboring provinces, disrupting travel during China’s three-day Mid-Autumn Festival. Shanghai’s airports canceled hundreds of flights starting Sunday and through Monday, while in Hangzhou, about 170 kilometers (106 miles) southwest of Shanghai, authorities were also planning to cancel more than 180 flights.More than 60,000 emergency responders and firefighters were at hand to lend aid in Shanghai, according to state media. More than 414,000 people had been evacuated by Monday. Bebinca made landfall around 7:30 a.m. in the sprawling Pudong business district with maximum winds of 151 kph (94 mph) near its center. Authorities expected the typhoon would also affect the nearby provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui.Shanghai, which has 25 million people, is rarely hit by strong typhoons, which usually make landfall further south in China.Typhoon Yagi hit China’s southern Hainan island earlier this month and has caused devastation in Southeast Asia. In Myanmar, Yagi caused at least 74 deaths with dozens missing. Four deaths were reported in Hainan, at least 10 have died in Thailand and 20 in the Philippines.Vietnam has reported more than 230 people killed in the typhoon and subsequent flooding and landslides, with dozens more still missing.	https://apnews.com/article/china-typhoon-bebinca-shanghai-74e8af786c5cf9bac56542df81af5ac4	2024-09-15T18:36:48-07:00	
Emmy Moments: Hosts gently mock 'The Bear,' while TV moms, 'Happy Days' and 'West Wing' celebrated	The last Emmys — in January, the 75th edition — went reunion crazy on such a big birthday, with cast reunions of such classic series as 'Cheers,' 'The Sopranos,' 'It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia' and 'All in the Family.' The latest Emmys said: 'Hold my applause.''Shogun,' 'Baby Reindeer' and 'The Bear' all picked up trophies throughout the night that was peppered with reunions of shows like 'Saturday Night Live' and 'Happy Days,' as well as themes, like TV dads and moms.Here are some of the night’s notable moments:Gentle hosts The father-and-son duo of Eugene and Dan Levy, the winning stars of the 2020 Emmys aboard 'Schitt’s Creek,' hosted and they were warm, mocking themselves as they noted the TV telecast was honoring 'movie stars on streaming services.'Even when the Candians went after a show — like 'The Bear,' competing in the best comedy series category, even though it's not a traditional yukfest — it was gentle. Hub peek embed (EmmyAwards) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) 'Now, I love the show, I love the show, and I know some of you will be expecting us to make a joke about whether ‘The Bear’ is really a comedy — but in the true spirit of ‘The Bear,’ we will not be making any jokes,' Eugene Levy said.In one bit, the two found themselves in the audience but in different rows, mistaking stage left for house left. Awkwardness ensued. When they tried to push through, Eugene Levy wailed: 'I can't see the prompter!'The show goes to the dogsJohn Oliver thanked a lot of people after his 'Last Week Tonight' won for outstanding scripted variety series, but things got weird when he ended up honoring his family’s recently dead dog.'We have the most fantastic dog, and she was at our wedding and she got us through the pandemic. She was with us for two pregnancies…,' he said, before getting the leave-the-stage music swelled.Oliver didn’t take the hint: 'We had to say goodbye to her. I feel like Sarah McLaughlin right now. She was an amazing dog,' he said. He then shouted an expletive and tried to make it more than about his deceased canine.'This isn’t just for her. This is for all dogs,' he continued as the auditorium roared. 'All dogs, you are all very good girls. You are very good boys. You all deserve a treat. Play me off now! Thanks so much.'‘The West Wing’ reunited'The West Wing' celebrated its 25th anniversary with castmembers Martin Sheen, Dulé Hill, Richard Schiff, Janel Moloney and Allison Janney gathering to help hand out the best drama trophy. Created by Aaron Sorkin and first airing on NBC in the fall 1999, 'The West Wing' offed an idealistic depiction of what politics can be. The castmembers gathered in a set mimicking the Oval Office. It ended in 2006.'It's hard to believe that just 25 years ago, Aaron and the writers actually had to use their imaginations to create interesting plot lines for ‘The West Wing,’' Janney said. Added Schiff: 'Unlike today, where storylines can be plucked right off the news, storylines that writers would have deemed a bit far-fetched if not utterly ridiculous 25 years ago.' Put me in, coachJane Lynch, who played vicious cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester on 'Glee' and Brendan Hunt, the quiet Coach Willis Beard on 'Ted Lasso,' teamed up to help hand out the award for best director of a drama series. They appeared in a locker room set, with Lynch teasing Hunt that she was a head coach on TV and he was just an assistant coach. But the stage seemed a little too big for just these two TV coaches.That changed when the stage revealed Paris Olympians Ilona Maher, Caeleb Dressel and Stephen 'Pommel Horse Guy' Nedoroscik alongside Paralympian Ezra Frech.'Saturday Night Live' greats mock its creator'Saturday Night Live' got a head start to its 50th anniversary next year with a mini-reunion, as Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Seth Meyers and Bowen Yang presented the award for best writing for a variety special. Three of the four mocked creator and producer Lorne Michaels in the audience, who they claimed was nominated and lost 85 times at the Emmys. Rudolph said he was 'robbed.' Yang said 'it gets better' and 'keep winning.' Meyers corrected them all to say that, in fact, Michaels has actually won 21 Emmys. Yang then leaned into mispronouncing his boss' first name.It may have been a taste for 2025, when the trailblazing sketch show will be celebrated, including a three-hour live primetime special in February. It has been the springboard for such stars as Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell and Mike Myers.Bad guys and galsAntony Starr of 'The Boys,' Giancarlo Esposito from 'Breaking Bad' and Kathy Bates of 'Misery' came out to represent an oddly key part of TV — the villains.'Without villains or antagonists, there wouldn’t be much of a story,' Esposito said. But it takes its toll. 'Do you know how hard it was to get a date after ‘Misery,'' Bates joked about her Stephen King role as a crazed kidnapper.Esposito complained that drug dealers will interrupt his dinner to ask his advice about building their empires and Starr said so many 12-year-old critics have approached him to say his superhero is 'bad.' He responds that the show has an R rating. 'It’s sloppy, sloppy parenting,' he observed.Moms and dadsGeorge Lopez, Damon Wayans, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who have all played memorable TV dads, gathered to recognize the lead actor in a comedy series. They walked into a mancave set and Lopez and Wayans said they wanted to thank their TV wives, but Ferguson balked, having starred with a TV husband instead on 'Modern Family.' 'I’m so sorry, did you watch my show, or...?' he asked them. 'Yes, all 90 seasons,' Wayans responded. Later, it was the moms’ turn. Meredith Baxter, who played the 'Family Ties' matriarch, Connie Britton of 'Friday Night Lights' and Susan Kelechi Watson of 'This Is Us' presented the award for best writing for a comedy series. 'We have come a long way,' said Baxter. 'TV moms are no longer one-dimensional,' said Watson. 'It’s OK to ask for as much as a TV dad.''Tuesday, Wednesday, happy days'Director-producer Ron Howard and actor-author Henry Winkler reunited to celebrate the 50th anniversary of 'Happy Days,' a romanticized take on teenage life in the 1950s that pivoted on adolescent humor about cars and dating.Winkler, who played cool guy Fonzie with his signature 'Aaaayy!' with both thumbs up, and Howard, who played the goody-goody Richie Cunningham, became household names thanks to the sitcom, which ran from 1974–1980. Winkler went on to win an Emmy on HBO’s dark comedy 'Barry' and spread awareness about dyslexia as a best-selling author; Howard went on direct such Oscar-winners as 'Apollo 13' and 'A Beautiful Mind.'The two men met onstage in a set dressed like the diner the show was mostly set in. Winkler congratulated Howard for his Emmy-winning documentary on Jim Henson. But despite some prodding by Howard, Winkler wouldn’t sing the theme song. 'I'm out of practice,' he said. 'And it takes schooling.' So Winkler nudged the jukebox with his elbow instead and the theme played.Order & LawThe TV criminal justice system was represented Sunday by two separate but equal parts. There were the cops – Jimmy Smits of 'NYPD Blue,' Niecy Nash-Betts of 'Reno 911!' and Don Johnson of 'Miami Vice.' They appeared on a set with a New York City police car onstage. Smits noted that he died in episode one of 'Miami Vice' and later as a cast member of 'NYPD Blue.' Nash-Betts said she never died: 'I’m Black and I survived ‘Dahmer,’' she joked.And then there were the TV lawyers who took cases to court: Viola Davis of 'How to Get Away with Murder,' Gina Torres from 'Suits' and Christine Baranski from 'The Good Wife' and 'The Good Fight.' (Though, to be honest, Smits was also a good lawyer in 'L.A. Law.') 'Lawyers have seen every combination of the human condition,' Davis said. Added Torres: 'In so many ways, they try to better that human condition and uplift us.' ___For more coverage of the 2024 Emmys, visit https://apnews.com/hub/emmy-awards	https://apnews.com/article/emmy-moments-2024-7dba313a6fde0d1b53ec8de2a645f0fd	2024-09-15T16:47:34-07:00	
PSG sends support to defender Nuno Mendes after racial abuse	PARIS (AP) — Paris Saint-Germain defender Nuno Mendes was the target of abusive and racist comments on social media after a French league game.The club condemned the abuse and expressed its 'full support' Sunday for the Portugal left back, who was targeted following PSG's 3-1 win against Brest on Saturday. Mendes, who is Black, shared on his Instagram account a racist message he received. During the match, Mendes brought down Ludovic Ajorque in the box for a penalty that Romain Del Castillo converted to give Brest the lead.'Paris Saint-Germain doesn't tolerate racism, antisemitism or any other form of discrimination,' the club said.

The Life of Chuck' wins the Toronto Film Festival's People's Choice Award	The Toronto International Film Festival's People's Choice Award went to 'The Life of Chuck,' handing Mike Flanagan's Stephen King adaptation one of the most-watched prizes of the fall film festival circuit. The award for 'The Life of Chuck' was announced Sunday as North American's largest film festival drew to a close. 'The Life of Chuck,' based on King's 2020 novella of the same name, stars Tom Hiddleston as Charles 'Chuck' Krantz, an ordinary man living through apocalyptic cataclysms. Mark Hamill, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Karen Gillan and Jacob Tremblay co-star. TIFF's People's Choice Award is regarded as a reliable Oscar harbinger. Since 2012, every winner of the festival's top prize has gone on to be nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards. Last year, Cord Jefferson's 'American Fiction' won, and went on to be a major awards contender. But 'The Life of Chuck' could test that track record. The film is up for sale and doesn't yet have distribution. It could be acquired and quickly readied for release this fall, or it might end up a 2025 release. 'The Life of Chuck' drew mixed — though mostly positive reviews — out of Toronto, though audiences were clearly charmed by the uplifting drama. Runners-up for the People's Choice Award, which is voted on by festival attendees, were both films that first premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The first was Jacques Audiard's 'Emilia Pérez.' The second runner-up was Sean Baker's 'Anora,' the Palme d'Or winner at Cannes. The audience award for top documentary went to Mike Downie's 'The Tragically Hip: No Dress Rehearsal.' In the festival's Midnight Madness section, the prize went to Coralie Fargeat's 'The Substance,' starring Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley.	https://apnews.com/article/peoples-choice-toronto-film-life-of-chuck-11715166a6ce8d9b5b9af90ac52768e7	2024-09-15T07:23:18-07:00	
A boat capsizes in Nigeria drowning at least 40 people, president says	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — A boat carrying mostly farmers capsized on a river in northwest Nigeria, drowning at least 40 people, President Bola Tinub u said Sunday.The accident happened in Zamfara state, as farmers were trying to get to their land, Tinubu said in a statement. The president promised support for the victims and directed emergency agencies to assess the incident.Yazid Abubakar, a police spokesperson in Zamfara, told The Associated Press the accident happened on Saturday and that five people were rescued, but 40 are still missing. It was not immediately clear how many people were on the boat when it went down. The boat was carrying mostly farmers who use the crossing regularly to sell produce at the markets and locals say they’re often overloaded.Zamfara state is rampant with armed groups who kidnap for ransom, steel cattle and engage in illegal mining.Boat accidents are common in remote communities across Nigeria because of overloading and boats that are in poor condition.In August, more than 20 people died in a boat accident on a river in southern Nigeria after the engine exploded.Most boats don’t carry life jackets or have proper safety measures in place, say locals.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-boat-capsizes-zamfara-bola-tinuba-332d71ac1828e9ba817e70693dd58353	2024-09-15T06:59:20-07:00	
Army to guard a hospital in Italy after a spate of attacks on medical staff across the country	ROME (AP) — Italy's army will guard medical staff at a hospital in the southern Calabria region starting Monday, after a string of violent attacks on doctors and nurses by enraged patients and relatives across Italy, local media reported.Prefect Paolo Giovanni Grieco approved a plan to reinforce the surveillance services already operated by soldiers on sensitive targets in the Calabrian town of Vibo Valentia, including the hospital, the reports said. Recent attacks on health care workers have been particularly frequent in southern Italy, prompting the doctors’ national guild to request that the army be deployed to ensure medical staff safety.The turning point was an assault at the Policlinico hospital in the southern city of Foggia in early September. A group of about 50 relatives and friends of a 23-year-old woman — who died during emergency surgery — turned their grief and rage into violence, attacking the hospital staff.Video footage, widely circulated on social media, showed doctors and nurses barricading in a room to escape the attack. Some of them were punched and injured. The director of the hospital threatened to close its emergency room after denouncing three similar attacks in less than a week.With over 16,000 reported cases of physical and verbal assaults nationwide in 2023 alone, Italian doctors and nurses have called for drastic measures.'We have never seen such levels of aggression in the past decade,' said Antonio De Palma, president of the Nursing Up union, stressing the urgent need for action.'We are now at a point where considering military protection in hospitals is no longer a far-fetched idea. We cannot wait any longer,' he said.The Italian Federation of Medical-Scientific Societies has also proposed more severe measures for offenders, such as suspending access to free medical care for three years for anyone who assaults healthcare workers or damages hospital facilities.Understaffing and long waiting lists are the main reasons behind patients' frustration with health workers. According to Italy’s largest union for doctors, nearly half of emergency medicine positions remained unfilled as of 2022. Doctors lament that Italy’s legislation has kept wages low, leading to overworked and burned out staff at hospitals.These problems have been further aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has pushed many health workers to leave Italy in search of better opportunities abroad.In 2023, Italy was short of about 30,000 doctors, and between 2010 and 2020, the country saw the closure of 111 hospitals and 113 emergency rooms, data from a specialized forum showed.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-hospitals-attacks-medical-staff-army-calabria-patients-families-27e4684e40df9dd73264e02f4f39573d	2024-09-15T06:37:31-07:00	
US-China military leaders hold routine talks to discuss South China Sea tensions and other issues	BANGKOK (AP) — Military leaders from the U.S. and China met in Beijing for routine talks that only resumed in January after being suspended for two years as ties between the two countries soured. The meetings ended on Sunday and officials discussed ongoing issues such as Taiwan, the Russia-Ukraine war and clashes in the South China Sea. Michael Chase, deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia led a delegation to engage in the bilateral Defense Policy Coordination Talks, which were last held in January.. While the talks weren't expected to resolve long-standing differences in stances over issues ranging from South China Sea claims to Taiwan, the U.S. has continued to push for the discussions as a way to avoid conflict. The meetings were held after Chase attended the Xiangshan forum in Beijing, a defense forum that is China's answer to the Shangri-La Dialogue.Hub peek embed (Taiwan) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Communication between the two militaries broke off in 2021, as U.S.-China tensions ratcheted up over widening differences on issues such as Taiwan's sovereignty, the origin of COVID-19 and economic issues.Beijing has ignored U.S. requests to engage in the past, especially over intercepts between U.S. and Chinese aircraft and ships. While communications resumed after U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in San Francisco last November, it is unclear whether the talks could continue as the U.S. is poised for a presidential election. In the bilateral talks, the two sides discussed China's support for Russia during the ongoing Ukraine war, as well as China's actions in the South China Sea, said a U.S. senior defense official briefing reporters on the meetings. On Sunday, the Philippine ship at a disputed shoal, BRP Teresa Magbanua, had left in order to resupply and provide medical care to its crew members. The defense official said that they were 'watching further developments there very closely.'China's claims over the South China Sea have become increasingly assertive, with increasing clashes with the Philippine coast guard. In August, both sides accused each other over a collision between their ships which left gaping holes in the Philippine ships.The maritime claims have meant clashes at sea, such as at the Sabina Shoal, which both China and the Philippines claim. China had blocked attempts to resupply the BRP Teresa Magbanua, in August, with a force of 40 ships. The Philippines said it would replace the ship immediately, but the departure of the ship raises questions of whether China would seize the shoal. Filipino scientists had previously found submerged piles of crushed corals in its shallows, leading to concern that China may be preparing to build a structure to stake its claim.China confirmed the departure of the ship, which it said 'infringed on China's territorial sovereignty.''During this period, China had taken control measures against the ship in accordance with the law and multiple attempts by the Philippine side to forcibly resupply the ship had failed,' China Coast Guard spokesperson Liu Dejun said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-philippines-south-china-sea-talks-6669213d7c6452c48fc6118e17c5737f	2024-09-15T04:29:15-07:00	
A high-level US delegation in Dhaka to foster economic growth with interim government	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — A high-level U.S. delegation met Sunday with the head of Bangladesh's interim government, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, to affirm 'dedication to fostering inclusive economic growth,' according to the American embassy in Dhaka.Yunus took over after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country last month amid a mass uprising. She was accused of corruption, violation of human rights and excessive use of force against the protesters.During her 15-year rule, Hasina enjoyed close relations with India, China and Russia who have heavily invested in the country’s infrastructure development, trade and investment. The U.S. has also become the single largest foreign investor in Bangladesh under Hasina.Yunus on Sunday said he sought U.S. support 'to rebuild the country, carry out vital reforms, and bring back stolen assets,' his press office said in a statement after he met the delegation at the State Guest House Jamuna in Dhaka.Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) He told the U.S. representatives his interim administration has moved fast to 'reset, reform, and restart' the economy, initiate reforms in financial sectors, and fix institutions such as the judiciary and police, the statement said.The U.S. delegation, led by Brent Neiman, assistant secretary for International Finance at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, had representatives from the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Donald Lu, assistant secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, joined the delegation after visiting India. They met with several officials in Dhaka, including Touhid Hossain, the country’s adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The USAID also signed an agreement to provide $202.25 million in aid to Bangladesh.The U.S. embassy on X underscored how American companies are entrenched in the South Asian country.'With the right economic reforms in place, the American private sector can help unlock Bangladesh’s growth potential through trade and investment,' the embassy wrote on its official account.The delegation also met representatives of the American companies under the American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh (AmCham) operating in Bangladesh upon arriving Saturday. Concerns over safety and lack of order in Bangladesh were relayed by the companies' agents.AmCham President Syed Ershad Ahmed said at the meeting that while there were improvements after the interim government was installed, 'there are some bottlenecks too.' Profit repatriation amid the ongoing crisis of U.S. dollars and challenges in the supply chain resulting from congestion at ports were among the issues he raised.The meeting came as unrest took hold of the country's major garment industry with workers walking out, leaving factories shuttered, as they demanded better benefits including higher wages. The factory owners, the government and workers’ leaders are holding meetings to ease the tension. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate-induced disasters. The U.S. embassy on its official Facebook page said the United States wanted to help it 'mitigate climate risks.'	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-us-delegation-yunus-hasina-economy-4c1ab22b419aba4373f9d094b100b69d	2024-09-15T03:48:50-07:00	
Leading Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury dies at 76	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury who dedicated much of his writings to the Palestinian cause and taught at universities around the world, making him one of Lebanon’s most prominent intellectuals, has died. He was 76.Khoury, a leading voice of Arab literature, had been ill for months and admitted and discharged from hospital several times over the past year until his death early Sunday, Al-Quds Al-Arabi daily that he worked for said.The Lebanese writer, born and raised in Beirut, was outspoken in defense of freedom of speech and harsh criticism of dictatorships in the Middle East.In addition to his novels, Khoury wrote articles in different Arab media outlets over the past five decades making him well known throughout the Arab world.Two days after the Israel-Hamas war broke out on Oct. 7, Khoury wrote an article in Al-Quds A-Arab daily titled 'It’s Palestine.' Khoury wrote then that 'the biggest open-air prison, the besieged Ghetto of Gaza, has launched a war against Israel, occupied settlements and forced settlers to flee.' Born in Beirut on July 12, 1948, Khoury had been known for his political stances from his support of Palestinians to his harsh criticism of Israel and what he called its 'brutal' settling policy in Palestinian territories. He studied at the Lebanese University and later at the University of Paris, where he received a PhD in social history.'The Catastrophe began in 1948 and it is still going on,' he once wrote referring to Israel’s settlement policies in occupied Palestinian territories. The 'nakba,' or 'catastrophe' is a term used by many Arabs to describe the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians when Israel was created in 1948.Khoury was an outspoken supporter of Arab uprisings that broke out in the region starting in 2011 and toppled several governments.'The question is not why the Arab revolts broke out,' Khoury wrote after uprisings that toppled long-serving leaders such as Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Tunisia’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. 'The question is not how people tore down the wall of fear but how fear built Arab kingdoms of silence for five decades.'Khoury, who belonged to a Greek Orthodox Christian family, took part in Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war and was wounded in one of the battles.From 1992 until 2009, Khoury was the editor of the cultural section of Lebanon’s leading An-Nahar newspaper. Until his death, he was the editor-in-chief of the Palestine Studies magazine, a bulletin issued by the Beirut-based Institute for Palestine Studies.His first novel was published in 1975, but his second, Little Mountain, which he released in 1977 and was about Lebanon’s devastating civil war was very successful.Bab al-Shams, or Gate of the Sun, released in 2000, was about Palestinian refugees in Lebanon since 1948. A movie about the novel was made in Egypt.His novels were translated to several languages including Hebrew.Khoury also taught at different universities including New York University, Columbia, Princeton and Houston, as well as the University of London.	https://apnews.com/article/elias-khoury-lebanon-novelist-palestinian-cause-israel-1b6e79f6a17f5d9f5dbdaf809b728653	2024-09-15T03:15:56-07:00

Shanghai cancels hundreds of flights as Typhoon Bebinca draws near	BANGKOK (AP) — Shanghai's airports are canceling hundreds of flights Sunday as they brace for impact from Typhoon Bebinca, which is due to make landfall in the early hours of Monday morning, the authorities said. Flights past 8 p.m. local time will be canceled at Hongqiao and Pudong airports in the city, the airport officials said in a statement, affecting more than six hundred flights. The city also announced that it was suspending travel on some bridges while restricting that on other highways. Typhoon Bebinca is currently a few hundred kilometers away from the coast. The typhoon's winds are expected to reach 151 km (94 miles) per hour by Sunday night, according to the China Meteorological Administration, which has categorized it as a strong typhoon.State media reported that 9,318 people had been evacuated from one district in Shanghai. Meanwhile, in the nearby city of Zhoushan, restaurants, supermarkets and shops shut down early for the day, and public transportation services were halted. The storm is expected to bring up to 10 inches (254 millimeters) of rain in parts of the eastern coast that will be hardest hit, according to state media.	https://apnews.com/article/typhoon-bebinca-shanghai-china-597e96f6362db31e8c9dbcb5cfc4cc0a	2024-09-15T02:30:19-07:00	
Rising floodwaters trigger evacuations in Czech Republic and Poland	PRAGUE (AP) — Another night of torrential rains pounding Central Europe forced massive evacuations in the hardest hit areas in the Czech Republic, where floods reached extreme levels on Sunday.Meteorologists have warned the situation still might get worse as waters in most rivers are rising, the flood wave made its way through the country and more heavy rains could return overnight.Authorities declared the highest flood warnings in almost 90 places across the country and in two northeastern regions that recorded the biggest rainfall in recent days, including the Jeseniky mountains near the Polish border.In the city of Opava, up to 10,000 people out of a population of some 56,000 have been asked to leave their homes for higher ground. Rescuers used boats to transport people to safety in a neighborhood flooded by the raging Opava River.'There’s no reason to wait,' Mayor Tomáš Navrátil told the Czech public radio. He said the situation was worse than during the last devastating floods in 1997, known as the 'flood of the century.'Hub peek embed (Floods) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) 'We have to focus on saving lives,' Prime Minister Petr Fiala told the Czech public television Sunday. His government was to possibly meet Monday to assess the damages.At least four missing and villages cut off Thousands of others also were evacuated in the towns of Krnov and Cesky Tesin. The Oder River that flows to Poland was expected to reach extreme levels in the city of Ostrava and later in Bohumin.Towns and villages in the Jeseniky mountains, including the local center of Jesenik, were inundated and isolated by raging waters that turned roads into rivers. The military sent a helicopter to help with evacuations. Four people who were swept away by waters were missing, police said. About 260,000 households were without power Sunday morning in the entire country while traffic was halted on many roads, including the major D1 highway.A firefighter dies as Lower Austria declared a disaster zoneA firefighter died after 'slipping on stairs' while pumping out a flooded basement in the town of Tulln, the head of the fire department of Lower Austria Dietmar Fahrafellner told reporters on Sunday.Authorities declared the entire state of Lower Austria a disaster zone. The situation remains tense, especially at the water reservoir of Ottenstein, which is expected to reach its maximum capacity on Sunday.Romania reports another flooding victimRomanian authorities said Sunday that another person had died in the hard-hit eastern county of Galati after four were reported dead there a day before following unprecedented rain.Dramatic flooding in Poland In Poland, one person was presumed dead in floods in the southwest, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday. Tusk said the situation was 'dramatic' around the town of Klodzko, with some 25,000 residents, located in a valley in the Sudetes mountains near the border with the Czech Republic.In Glucholazy, rising waters overflowed a river embankment and flooded streets and houses. Mayor Paweł Szymkowicz said, 'we are drowning' and appealed to residents to evacuate to high ground. Energy supplies and communications were cut off in some flooded areas and regions may resort to using the satellite-based Starlink service, Tusk said.Several Central European nations have been hit by severe flooding, including Romania, Austria, Germany, Slovakia and Hungary, as a result of a low-pressure system from northern Italy dumping heavy rainfall in the wide region. The weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region. Scientists have documented Earth’s hottest summer, breaking a record set just a year ago.A hotter atmosphere, driven by human-caused climate change, can lead to more intense rainfall.___Associated Press writer Monika Scislowska in Warsaw, Poland, video journalist Philipp-Moritz Jenne in Vienna and Stephen McGrath in Bucharest, Romania, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/floods-central-europe-289648d14b39da5883b9f48fffa2d817	2024-09-15T00:42:28-07:00	
New Delhi's chief minister announces resignation two days after he was released on bail	NEW DELHI (AP) — One of India's main opposition figures and New Delhi’s chief minister said he would resign from office Sunday, two days after he was granted bail in a bribery case.Arvind Kejriwal, a fierce critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was arrested nearly six months ago ahead of national elections on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. India's top court released him on bail Friday.Kejriwal has consistently denied the accusations and called them a political conspiracy.'Today I have come to ask the public whether you consider Kejriwal honest or a criminal,' he said in a public address Sunday at the headquarters of his Aam Aadmi Party, which governs New Delhi. 'I will resign from the post of chief minister two days from today.'Kejriwal said his party — a part of a broad alliance of opposition parties called INDIA and was the main challenger to Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in June's elections — will hold a meeting later to decide who will take over his position. He also demanded the New Delhi elections, scheduled for February next year, be held in November instead. Opposition parties widely condemned Kejriwal’s arrest. They accused Modi's government of misusing federal investigation agencies to harass and weaken its political opponents. They pointed to several raids, arrests, and corruption investigations of key opposition figures in the months before the elections.Kejriwal's supporters celebrated his release by lighting firecrackers and dancing in the rain outside his New Delhi residence, with many carrying placards with photos of the popular politician. Some leaders from Modi's party warned that he was released on bail and not acquitted. Government agencies have accused Kejriwal’s party and ministers of accepting 1 billion rupees ($12 million) in bribes from a liquor distributor nearly two years ago in return for revising a liquor sales policy in New Delhi, allowing private companies greater profits.Kejriwal, a former civil servant, launched the Aam Aadmi Party in 2012. He promised to rid the Indian political system and governance of corruption and inefficiency.The party’s symbol — a broom — and its promise to sweep the administration of graft struck a chord with New Delhi’s residents, fed up with runaway inflation and slow economic growth.	https://apnews.com/article/arvind-kejriwal-chief-minister-resigns-bail-bribery-0be22faffd411c30861f3c6399429ce9	2024-09-15T00:25:50-07:00	
A least 8 people have died trying to cross the English Channel, French authorities say	NICE, France (AP) — At least eight people died during a failed attempt to cross the English Channel from northern France, French maritime authorities said Sunday.The incident occurred Saturday just before midnight when authorities spotted a boat, carrying dozens, in distress near a beach in the northern town of Ambleteuse.A French rescue ship was deployed to the area, but could not offer assistance at sea. Once the vessel reached the beach, rescue services offered medical assistance to 53 migrants, a statement from the French maritime authorities in charge of the Channel and the North Sea said.'Despite the emergency care provided, eight people have died,' the statement said.No people were discovered during the search at sea, it added. Six people were taken to hospitals in Boulogne and Calais 'in relative emergency,' including a 10-month-old baby with hypothermia, Jacques Billant, the Pas-de-Calais prefect, told French media on Sunday. He said survivors of the accident come from Eritrea, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt and Iran. Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) The deceased were all male adults, Billant said. Survivors of the tragedy have been taken to the sports hall in Ambleteuse, according to a statement from the prefecture of Pas-de-Calais region. Prosecutor's office in Boulogne-sur-mer has opened an investigation into the accident. The incident Saturday occurred nearly two weeks after a boat carrying migrants ripped apart in the English Channel as they attempted to reach Britain from northern France, plunging dozens into the treacherous waterway and leaving 12 dead. British officials were quick to express sadness over another English Channel incident.'It’s awful,’’ Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC. 'It’s a further loss of life.'The new Labour Party government has pledged to crack down on criminal gangs plying the migrant boats trade in the channel and had discussed with European partners 'how we go after those gangs, in co-operation upstream.’’ UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer will be in Italy on Monday for talks with counterpart Giorgia Meloni about her efforts to tackle the problem 'and the work they have done, particularly, with Albania.’’Starmer is interested in the policy, under which Tirana will accept asylum seekers on Italy’s behalf while their claims are processed.Europe’s increasingly strict asylum rules, growing xenophobia and hostile treatment of migrants have been pushing them north. Before Saturday’s accident, at least 43 migrants had died or gone missing while trying to cross to the U.K. this year, according to the International Organization for Migration.Other surveillance and rescue operations are underway Sunday along the entire Pas-de-Calais coast amid stormy weather conditions and agitated sea, French maritime authorities said. They warned anyone who tries to cross the Channel on flimsy and overloaded boats and in often difficult weather conditions of 'significant risks.' On Saturday, French coast guard and navy vessels rescued 200 people from the treacherous waters in the Pas-de-Calais area, according to a report sent by French maritime authorities in charge of the Channel and the North Sea. The French coast guard and other naval services have rescued people from four different boats, one carrying 61 and the other 55 people. The other two boats carried 48 and 36 people each, authorities said. They said they observed 18 attempts of boat departures from France to Britain on Saturday. In July, four migrants died while attempting the crossing on an inflatable boat that capsized and punctured. Five others, including a child, died in another attempt in April. Five dead were recovered from the sea or found washed up along a beach after a migrant boat ran into difficulties in the dark and winter cold of January.——Associated Press journalist Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/france-migrants-english-channel-5b3b36a0ea06b85d89e8ccd22d1d864f	2024-09-15T00:17:09-07:00	
Two people die in Ukraine's Odesa after Moscow and Kyiv exchange drone and missile attacks	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Two people died in a missile attack on the Ukrainian Black Sea port city of Odesa, local officials said, as Moscow and Kyiv exchanged drone and missile attacks.The Ukrainian air force said Sunday it shot down 10 of the 14 drones and one of the three missiles Russia launched overnight.Oleh Kiper, Odesa's regional governor, said the two who died in the suburbs of Odesa on Saturday night were a married couple, and that another person was wounded in the attack.At least 28 people were wounded Sunday afternoon when a Russian aerial bomb struck a multi-story residential building in Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said it downed 29 Ukrainian drones overnight into Sunday over western and southwestern regions, with no damage caused by the falling debris. It also said another Ukrainian drone was shot down Sunday morning over the western Ryazan region.While Ukraine and Russia regularly launch overnight drone raids on each other’s territory, Ukrainian officials generally do not confirm or deny attacks within Russia’s borders.The latest attacks came after Ukraine made a new call Saturday on the West to allow it to use the long-range missiles they have provided to strike targets deep inside Russia, as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. So far, the U.S. has allowed Kyiv to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia’s border with Ukraine.Kyiv officials argue the weapons are vital to weaken Russia’s ability to strike Ukraine and force it to move its strike capabilities further from the border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took to social media on Sunday to again appeal for a shift in the West's policy on the use of long-range weapons, noting that Russia had launched 'around 30 missiles of various types, more than 800 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 300 strike drones against Ukraine' this week.'Ukraine needs strong support from our partners to defend lives against Russian terror—air defense, long-range capabilities, support for our warriors. Everything that will help force Russia to end this war,' Zelenskyy wrote on X.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-odesa-missiles-0bbd98f8c894490ccb1f0c486325d209	2024-09-14T23:24:43-07:00

Air Canada and pilots union reach a tentative agreement to avoid a shutdown	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Air Canada and the union representing its pilots have come to terms on a labor agreement that is likely to prevent a shutdown of Canada’s largest airline.Talks betwen the company and the Air Line Pilots Association produced a tentative, four-year collective agreement, the airline announced in a statement early Sunday.The prospective deal recognizes the contributions of the pilots flying for Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge while setting a new framework for company growth. The terms will remain confidential until ratification by union members and approval by the airline’s board of directors over the next month, the airline said.The pilots association said its Air Canada Master Executive Council voted to approve the tentative agreement on behalf of more than 5,400 Air Canada pilots. After review and ratification by a majority of members, the deal is expected to generate an additional $1.9 billion for the pilots over the period of the agreement, the union said in a statement.'While it has been an exceptionally long road to this agreement, the consistent engagement and unified determination of our pilots have been the catalyst for achieving this contract,' Charlene Hudy, the executive council's chair, said in the statement. 'After several consecutive weeks of intense round-the-clock negotiations, progress was made on several key issues including compensation, retirement, and work rules.'Federal Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon confirmed the agreement on Sunday and lauded the company and the union.'Thanks to the hard work of the parties and federal mediators, disruptions have been prevented for Canadians,' MacKinnon said in a statement. 'Negotiated agreements are always the best way forward and yield positive results for companies and workers.'The airline and its pilots have been in contract talks for more than a year. The pilots have sought wages competitive with their U.S. counterparts, but Air Canada continues to post record profits while expecting pilots to accept below-market compensation, the union saidThe two sides could have issued a 72-hour notice of a strike or lockout beginning Sunday. The airline said the notice would have triggered its three-day wind down plan and started the clock on a full work stoppage as soon as Sept. 18.Air Canada spokesman Christophe Hennebelle previously said the airline was committed to negotiations, but faced union wage demands that the company could not meet.The airline was not seeking federal intervention, but cautioned the government should be prepared to help avoid major disruptions from the possible shutdown of an airline carrying more than 110,000 passengers daily, Hennebelle said.Business leaders had urged the federal government to intervene in the talks earlier in the week, but MacKinnon said there was no reason the sides should not have been able to reach a collective agreement.In August, the Canadian government asked the country’s industrial relations board to issue a back-to-work order to end a railway shutdown.Leaders of numerous business groups including the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Business Council of Canada convened in Ottawa on Thursday to call for action, including binding arbitration, to avoid the widespread economic disruptions of an airline shutdown.NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Thursday his party would not support efforts to force pilots back to work.'If there’s any bills being proposed on back to work legislation, we’re going to oppose that,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/air-canada-pilots-association-labor-agreement-d5bf01ec58293fe381b8eca22dfb9c58	2024-09-14T22:54:14-07:00	
A missile fired by Yemen's rebels lands in Israel and triggers sirens at international airport	JERUSALEM (AP) — A missile fired by Yemen's Iran-backed rebels landed in an open area in central Israel early Sunday and triggered air raid sirens at its international airport, in the latest reverberation from the nearly yearlong war in Gaza. Israel hinted that it would respond militarily.There were no reports of casualties or major damage, but Israeli media aired footage showing people racing to shelters in Ben Gurion International Airport. The airport authority said it resumed normal operations shortly thereafter.A fire could be seen in a rural area of central Israel, and local media showed images of what appeared to be a fragment from an interceptor that landed on an escalator in a train station in the central town of Modiin.The Israeli military said it made several attempts to intercept the missile using its multitiered air defenses but had not yet determined whether any had been successful. It said the missile appeared to have fragmented midair, and that the incident is still under review. The military said the sound of explosions in the area came from interceptors.Hub peek embed (Israel-Hamaswar) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) The Yemeni rebels, known as Houthis, have repeatedly fired drones and missiles toward Israel since the start of the war in Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, but nearly all of them have been intercepted over the Red Sea.In July, an Iranian-made drone launched by the Houthis struck Tel Aviv, killing one person and wounding 10 others. Israel responded with a wave of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas of Yemen, including the port city of Hodeidah, a Houthi stronghold.Israel indicates it will respond to attackIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted at a similar response in remarks at a Cabinet meeting after Sunday's attack. 'The Houthis should have known by now that we exact a heavy price for any attempt to harm us,' he said. 'Anyone who needs a reminder is invited to visit the port of Hodeidah.' Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a military spokesman for the rebels, said they fired a ballistic missile targeting 'a military target' in the area of Tel Aviv.The Houthis have also repeatedly attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea, in what the rebels portray as a blockade on Israel in support of the Palestinians. Most of the targeted ships have no connection to Israel.On Sunday, a European Union naval mission operating in the Red Sea said salvagers had begun towing a tanker that had been on fire for weeks after a Houthi attack. Operations Aspides said the Greek-flagged Sounion was being taken to a 'safe location.'The war in Gaza, which began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel, has rippled across the region, with Iran and allied militant groups attacking Israeli and U.S. targets and drawing retaliatory strikes from Israel and its Western allies. On several occasions, the strikes and counterstrikes have threatened to trigger a wider conflict.International carriers have canceled flights into and out of Israel on a number of occasions since the start of the war, adding to the war's economic toll on the country.Iran supports militant groups across the region, including Hamas, the Houthis and Lebanon's Hezbollah, its most powerful ally, which has traded fire with Israel on a near-daily basis since the war in Gaza began. Iran and its allies say they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians.Rockets fired from LebanonThe military said around 40 projectiles were fired from Lebanon early Sunday, with most intercepted or falling in open areas.In a separate incident, Israeli forces dropped leaflets over the Lebanese border town of al-Wazzani calling on residents to evacuate. The military later said there were no such evacuation orders, and that a local commander had acted without the approval of his superiors. It said the incident was under investigation.It was not clear if anyone had evacuated the town, or if any message had been conveyed to residents that the leaflets were dropped in error.The strikes along the Israel-Lebanon border have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides. Israel has repeatedly threatened to launch a wider military operation against Hezbollah to ensure its citizens can return to their homes.'The status quo will not continue,' Netanyahu said at the Cabinet meeting. 'This requires a change in the balance of power on our northern border. We will do everything necessary to return our residents safely to their homes.'Gaza smuggling tunnels blockedHezbollah has said it would halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza. The United States and Arab mediators Egypt and Qatar have spent much of this year trying to broker a truce and the release of scores of hostages held by Hamas, but the talks have repeatedly bogged down.In recent weeks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted on lasting Israeli control over the Gaza side of the border with Egypt, which Israeli forces captured in May. He has said Hamas used a network of tunnels beneath the border to import arms, allegations denied by Egypt, which along with Hamas is opposed to any lasting Israeli presence there.An Israeli military official said late Saturday that of the dozens of tunnels discovered along the border, only nine entered Egypt, and all were found to have been sealed off. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence, said it was not clear when the tunnels were sealed.The discovery appeared to weaken Netanyahu’s argument that Israel needs to keep open-ended control of the corridor to prevent cross-border smuggling.Egypt has said it sealed off the tunnels on its side of the border years ago, in part by creating its own military buffer zone along the frontier.___Melzer reported from Nahariya, Israel.

87 and hobbled, Pope Francis goes off-script in Asia and reminds world he can still draw a crowd	DILI, East Timor (AP) — It was the farthest trip of his pontificate and one of the longest papal trips ever in terms of days on the road and distance traveled. But Pope Francis, age 87, hobbled by bad knees and bent over with sciatica, appeared to be having the time of his life.With half of East Timor’s population gathered at a seaside park, Francis couldn’t help but oblige them with a final good night and languid loops in his popemobile, long after the sun had set and the field was lit by cellphone screens.It was late, the heat and humidity had turned Tasitolu park into something of a sauna, and most of the journalists had already gone back to their air-conditioned hotel to watch the Mass on TV. But there was Francis, defying the doubters who had questioned if he could, would or should make such an arduous trip to Asia given everything that could go wrong.'How many children you have!' Francis marveled to the crowd of 600,000, which amounted to the biggest-ever turnout for a papal event as a proportion of the population. 'A people that teaches its children to smile is a people that has a future.'Hub peek embed (PopeFrancis) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) The moment seemed to serve as proof that, despite his age, ailments and seven hours of jet lag, Pope Francis still could pope, still likes to pope and has it in him to pope like he used to at the start of his pontificate.That’s never truer than when he’s in his element: in the peripheries of the world, among people forgotten by the big powers, where he can go off-script to respond to the spirit of the moment.And it was certainly the case on his 11-day trip through Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore, during which he clocked nearly 33,000 kilometers (20,505 miles) in air travel alone. It was a trip that he had originally planned to make in 2020 but COVID-19 intervened.Four years and a handful of hospitalizations later (for intestinal and pulmonary problems), Francis finally pulled it off. He seemed to relish getting out of the Vatican and away from the weighty grind of the Holy See after being cooped up all year, much of it battling a long bout of bronchitis.Francis does tend to rally during foreign trips, though he usually sticks to a script when he’s in the protocol meetings with heads of state, dutifully delivering speeches that were written in advance by Vatican diplomats.But when he’s meeting with young people or local priests and nuns, he tends to show his true colors. He’ll ditch his prepared remarks and speak off-the-cuff, often engaging in back-and-forth banter with the faithful to make sure his message has stuck.Doing so thrills the crowd, terrorizes his translators and complicates the work of journalists, but you always know Francis is enjoying himself and feels energized when he goes rogue. And he went rogue plenty of times in Asia — and on the in-flight press conference coming back to Rome, during which he urged American Catholics to vote for who they think is the 'lesser evil' for president.Francis started in Indonesia, arguably the most delicate destination on his itinerary given the country is home to the world’s largest Muslim population. The Vatican would be loathe to say or do anything that might cause offense.And yet from his very first encounter with President Joko Widodo, Francis appeared in a feisty mood, praising Indonesia’s relatively high birthrate while lamenting that in the West, 'some prefer a cat or a little dog.'Francis has frequently made the same demographic quip at home in Italy, which has one of the world’s lowest birthrates. But the high-profile trip meant that his trademark sarcasm got amplified. American commentators immediately assumed Francis had entered the 'childless cat ladies' debate roiling U.S. politics, but there was no indication he had JD Vance in mind. Even in the most delicate moment in Jakarta, at Southeast Asia's biggest mosque, Francis threw protocol aside and kissed the hand of the grand imam and brought it to his cheek in gratitude.In Papua New Guinea, Francis was similarly jazzed after pulling off a visit to a remote jungle outpost that had seemed impossible for him to reach: The airport in Vanimo, population 11,000, doesn’t have an ambulift wheelchair elevator that Francis now needs to get on and off planes, and bringing one in just for him was out of the question.The stubborn pope, who really, really wanted to go to Vanimo, ended up rolling on and off the back ramp of a C-130 cargo plane that Australia had offered to get him, and the metric ton of medicine and other supplies he brought with him, to the town.Despite the considerable security concerns of entering a region torn by tribal rivalries, Francis seemed to relish the jungle visit, perhaps because he felt so much at home. A dozen Argentine missionary priests and nuns have lived in Vanimo with the local community for years and had invited him to come. They decorated the simple stage in front of the church with a statue of Argentina’s beloved Virgin of Lujan, to whom Francis is particularly devoted, and had a gourd of mate, the Argentine tea, waiting for him.In East Timor Francis had to negotiate perhaps the most sensitive issue clouding the visit: the case of Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, the revered national hero who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent independence campaign. The Vatican revealed in 2022 that it had sanctioned Belo, who now lives in Portugal, for having sexually abused young boys and ordered him to cease contact with East Timor.Francis didn’t mention Belo by name and didn’t meet with his victims, but he did reaffirm the need to protect children from 'abuse.' There was nary a mention of Belo’s name in any official speech during a visit in which East Timor’s traumatic history and independence fight were repeatedly evoked.In Singapore, his final stop, Francis once again ditched his remarks when he arrived at the last event, a meeting of Singaporean youth on Friday morning.'That’s the talk I prepared,' he said, pointing to his speech and then proceeding to launch into a spontaneous back-and-forth with the young people about the need to have courage and take risks.'What’s worse: Make a mistake because I take a certain path, or not make a mistake and stay home?' he asked them.He answered his own question, with a response that could explain his own risky decision to embark on the Asia trip in the first place.'A young person who doesn’t take a risk, who is afraid of making a mistake, is an old person,' the 87-year-old pope said.'I hope all of you go forward,' he said. 'Don’t go back. Don’t go back. Take risks.'___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Shogun,' 'The Bear' and 'Baby Reindeer' are at the top of the queue as the Emmys arrive	LOS ANGELES (AP) — 'Shogun' could be in for an epic night, 'The Bear' could clean up for the second time in less than a year, and 'Baby Reindeer' has gone from dark horse to contender as the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards arrive on Sunday. Back in their traditional mid-September spot after a single strike-delayed edition in January, the Emmys will air live on ABC from the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The father and son duo of Eugene and Dan Levy, the winning stars of the 2020 Emmys with their show 'Schitt's Creek,' will host.Here's a look at the how the evening could play out across the major categories. How to watch and stream the EmmysThe show begins at 8 p.m. Eastern and is being shown live on ABC, which is available with an antenna or through cable and satellite providers. The Emmys can be also streamed live through live TV streaming services that include ABC in their lineup, like Hulu+ Live TV, YouTube TV and FuboTV. For those without a live TV streaming service, the show will be streaming Monday on Hulu.Who's nominated for drama series at the EmmysHub peek embed (EmmyAwards) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) It may be impossible to slow the roll of 'Shogun.'With its 14 wins at the precursor Creative Arts Emmy Awards last weekend, the FX series about lordly politicking in feudal Japan has already set a record for most Emmys for a single season of a series. On Sunday night it can extend its record by six, and industry prognosticators are predicting it will get them all. The show seized all the Emmy power in the top categories by shifting from the limited series to the drama category in May when it began developing more seasons. And it was in some ways Emmy royalty from the start. During the golden age of the miniseries, the original 1980 'Shogun,' based on James Clavell's historical novel, won three including best limited series. If it faces any competition at all for the best drama prize, it could come for the sixth and final season of 'The Crown,' the only show among the nominees that has won before in a category recently dominated by the retired 'Succession.' Veteran screen star Hiroyuki Sanada, up for best actor, and Anna Sawai, up for best actress, are in position to become the first Japanese actors to win Emmys. Sanada could face a challenge from Gary Oldman, who has been quietly creating one of his career defining roles on Apple TV+ as schlubby spy chief Jackson Lamb on 'Slow Horses.'Sawai's competition comes from Emmy luminary Jennifer Aniston of 'The Morning Show,' who has only won once before in 10 nominations. Imelda Staunton could win her first for playing Queen Elizabeth II on 'The Crown.'The comedy landscape at the EmmysThis looks to be the year of FX, which is also in for a likely victory lap for 'The Bear.' 'The Bear' took most of the big comedy Emmys home in January for its first season, and is expected to do the same Sunday for its second, which includes nominations for best comedy series, best actor for Jeremy Allen White and best supporting actor for Ebon Moss-Bachrach. Ayo Edebiri, reigning best supporting actress, moves to the lead actress category for a character who is essentially a co-lead on the culinary dramedy. That means she'll be up against Jean Smart, a two-time winner in the category for 'Hacks' who is back in the competition after a year off.Meryl Streep, among several Academy Award winners among the night's nominees, could win her fourth Emmy to go with her three Oscars. She's up for best supporting actress in a comedy for 'Only Murders in the Building.'Limited series categories at the EmmysAnother multiple Oscar winner, Jodie Foster, could get her first Emmy for best actress in a limited series for 'True Detective: Night Country.'The HBO show that features Foster as a police chief investigating mysterious deaths in the darkness of a north Alaskan winter was the top nominee among limited or anthology series. Kali Reis could become the first Indigenous woman to win an Emmy in the supporting actress category. A few months ago it looked as though the show would vie with 'Fargo' for the top prizes, but Netflix's darkly quirky 'Baby Reindeer' surged on the eve of nominations and is now the popular pick for best limited series, best actor for creator and star Richard Gadd and best supporting actress for the woman who plays his tormentor, Jessica Gunning.Gadd's category also includes Andrew Scott for Netflix's 'Ripley,' and Jon Hamm, who has two shots at winning his second Emmy between his nomination here for 'Fargo' and for supporting actor in a drama for 'The Morning Show.' ___For more on this year’s Emmy Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/emmy-awards	https://apnews.com/article/2024-emmy-awards-show-8588922c128c775092509b70a599a6d0	2024-09-14T19:04:30-07:00	
The presidential campaign season in Tunisia is officially underway a day after protests	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — The official start of the presidential campaign season in Tunisia began on Saturday, a day after Tunisians took their anger to the streets of the capital to decry what protesters say is the deteriorating state of the country.In what appeared to be the largest protest since authorities began a monthslong wave of arrests earlier this year, hundreds of Tunisians marched peacefully on Friday and called for an end to what they called a police state.'We’re here to say no and show that we don’t all agree with what’s really happening in the country,' Khaled Ben Abdeslam, a father and urban development consultant, told The Associated Press.In 2011, longtime Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was toppled by nationwide protests that unleashed revolt across the Arab world.More than a decade later, Ben Abdelslam said he was worried about the growing number of political figures who’ve been thrown in jail under President Kais Saied and said he wants to ensure Tunisia 'turns the page' for the good of his kids.'Nobody dares to say or do anything anymore today,' he said as protesters neared Tunisia’s powerful Interior Ministry.He and other demonstrators slammed both Tunisia’s economic and political woes, carrying signs that grouped together the growing costs of staple items and growing concerns about civil liberties.'Where is sugar? Where is oil? Where is freedom? Where is democracy?' signs read.Some carried posters telling the government that 'human rights are not optional' while others revived the popular slogans that mobilized Tunisia’s masses against Ben Ali.This time though, they directed scorn toward Saied.The protests capped off a week in which the North African country’s largest opposition party, Ennahda, said its senior members had been arrested en masse, at a scale not previously seen.They come as Saied prepares to campaign for reelection on Oct. 6, when he will ask voters to grant him a second term.When first elected in 2019, Saied used anti-corruption promises to win over people disillusioned with the political controversies that plagued Tunisia’s young democracy in the years that followed the Arab Spring.Since taking office, the 66-year-old former law professor has gone to lengths to consolidate his own power, freezing the country’s parliament and rewriting the constitution. Throughout his tenure, authorities have arrested journalists, activists, civil society figures and political opponents across the ideological spectrum.And though he promised to chart a new course for the country, its unemployment rate has steadily increased to one of the region’s highest at 16%, with young Tunisians hit particularly hard.The economy continues to face significant challenges, yet Saied has managed to energize supporters with populist rhetoric, often accusing migrants from sub-Saharan Africa of violence and crime and aiming at changing the country’s demography.In the months leading up to his reelection bid, the political crackdown has expanded.His opponents have been arrested, placed under gag order or faced criminal investigations that observers have called politically motivated. Figures who said they planned to challenge him have been sentenced for breaking campaign finance laws. Others have been ruled ineligible to challenge him by Tunisia’s election authority.Even those the authority approved have later faced arrest.Ayachi Zammel, a businessman planning to challenge Saied, was promptly arrested after being announced as one of the two candidates approved to appear on the ballot alongside Saied. His attorney, Abdessattar Messaoudi, told The Associated Press that she feared a court may bar him from politics for life as it had done to other Saied challengers.The Tunisian Network for the Defense of Rights and Freedoms — a newly formed coalition of civil society groups and political parties — organized Friday’s protest to draw attention to what it called a surge of authoritarianism.Outrage swelled among many members of the network after the country’s election authority — made up of Saied appointees — dismissed a court ruling ordering it to reinstate three challengers to Saied.The authority has defied judges who have ruled in favor of candidates who have appealed its decisions and pledged not to allow Mondher Zenaidi, Abdellatif El Mekki and Imed Daimi to appear on the ballot alongside Saied next month.​​In less than a month, Tunisian voters are expected to cast their choice in the Oct. 6 poll, amid spreading worrying and doubts about the country’s political future.Hajer Mohamed, a 33-year-old law firm assistant said that she and her friends were terrified about the direction Tunisia was heading in ways they couldn’t have imagined when people rejoiced the freedoms won 13 years ago.'We never thought that after the 2011 revolution we’d live to see the country’s suffocating situation,' she said. 'even under former dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the situation wasn’t as scandalous as it is today.'___Sam Metz contributed to this report from Rabat, Morocco.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-election-president-campaign-season-protests-f7f6c0fdaadacbdf56b46d351c2ce7dc	2024-09-14T11:12:18-07:00	
Nigerian army rescues 13 hostages from extremist group	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigerian troops have rescued 13 hostages who were kidnapped by an extremist group in the northwestern state of Kaduna, the country's army said on Saturday. The army said in a statement that 'the troops successfully overwhelmed the terrorists, forcing them to abandon their captives.'Several kidnappers were killed and others captured, the military added. It didn't specify what armed group the kidnappers belonged to.The rescued hostages were taken to a military facility for a medical assessment before being reunited with their families. Weapons, ammunition, solar panels and cash were also discovered during the rescue operation.Kidnappings have become common in parts of northern Nigeria, where dozens of armed groups take advantage of a limited security presence to carry out attacks in villages and along major roads. Most victims are released only after the payment of ransoms that sometimes run into the thousands of dollars. At least 1,400 students have been taken from Nigerian schools since the 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram militants in the village of Chibok in Borno state shocked the world. Boko Haram, Nigeria’s homegrown jihadi rebels, launched its insurgency in 2009 to establish Islamic Shariah law in the country. At least 35,000 people have been killed and 2.1 million people displaced as a result of the extremist violence, according to U.N. agencies in Nigeria.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-army-hostages-rescued-extremist-group-10a4aa1503cf9cb92567bc0aace267cb	2024-09-14T10:22:13-07:00	
Roadside explosions in Somali capital Mogadishu kill 5, official says	MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Roadside explosions in the Somali capital killed five people and wounded eight others Saturday, according to a city official. An explosive device had been planted at a spot in a street where many young people had gathered to take photos, Abdullahi Sheikh Abdirahman, district commissioner of Mogadishu's Kahda district, told reporters.'I saw several people lying on the street minutes after the first explosion, and when rescuers came to assist, another blast happeneed, causing most of the casualties,' witness Abdisamad Osman told The Associated Press. No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack. But the Islamic extremist group al-Shabab, which opposes Somalia’s federal government, frequently carries out such assaults. The attack comes just weeks after a similar explosion at a beach where more than 30 people were killed and over 60 others wounded. That attack, one of the deadliest in recent months, raised concern over the increasing frequency of violent attacks in Mogadishu.	https://apnews.com/article/somalia-mogadishu-roadside-explosion-956278334ebf751244263623eda0c0df	2024-09-14T09:42:05-07:00	
NATO military committee chair, others back Ukraine's use of long range weapons to hit Russia	PRAGUE (AP) — The head of NATO's military committee said Saturday that Ukraine has the solid legal and military right to strike deep inside Russia to gain combat advantage — reflecting the beliefs of a number of U.S. allies — even as the Biden administration balks at allowing Kyiv to do so using American-made weapons. 'Every nation that is attacked has the right to defend itself. And that right doesn’t stop at the border of your own nation,' said Adm. Rob Bauer, speaking at the close of the committee's annual meeting, also attended by U.S. Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Bauer, of Netherlands, also added that nations have the sovereign right to put limits on the weapons they send to Ukraine. But, standing next to him at a press briefing, Lt. Gen. Karel Řehka, chief of the General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces, made it clear his nation places no such weapons restrictions on Kyiv.'We believe that the Ukrainians should decide themselves how to use it,' Řehka said.Hub peek embed (Kyiv) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Their comments came as U.S. President Joe Biden is weighing whether to allow Ukraine to use American-provided long-range weapons to hit deep into Russia. And they hint at the divisions over the issue.Biden met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday, after this week’s visit to Kyiv by their top diplomats, who came under fresh pressure to loosen weapons restrictions. U.S. officials familiar with discussions said they believed Starmer was seeking Biden’s approval to allow Ukraine to use British Storm Shadow missiles for expanded strikes in Russia. Biden’s approval may be needed because Storm Shadow components are made in the U.S. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share the status of private conversations, said they believed Biden would be amenable, but there has been no decision announced yet.Providing additional support and training for Ukraine was a key topic at the NATO chiefs’ meeting, but it wasn't clear Saturday if the debate over the U.S. restrictions was discussed. Many of the European nations have been vigorously supportive of Ukraine in part because they worry about being the next victim of an empowered Russia.At the opening of the meeting, Czech Republic President Petr Pavel broadly urged the military chiefs gathered in the room to be 'bold and open in articulating your assessments and recommendations. The rounder and the softer they are, the less they will be understood by the political level.'The allies, he said, must 'take the right steps and the right decisions to protect our countries and our way of life.'The military leaders routinely develop plans and recommendations that are then sent to the civilian NATO defense secretaries for discussion and then on to the nations' leaders in the alliance.The U.S. allows Ukraine to use American-provided weapons in cross-border strikes to counter attacks by Russian forces. But it doesn’t allow Kyiv to fire long-range missiles, such as the ATACMS, deep into Russia. The U.S. has argued that Ukraine has drones that can strike far and should use ATACMS judiciously because they only have a limited number.Ukraine has increased its pleas with Washington to lift the restrictions, particularly as winter looms and Kyiv worries about Russian gains during the colder months.'You want to weaken the enemy that attacks you in order to not only fight the arrows that come your way, but also attack the archer that is, as we see, very often operating from Russia proper into Ukraine,' said Bauer. 'So militarily, there’s a good reason to do that, to weaken the enemy, to weaken its logistic lines, fuel, ammunition that comes to the front. That is what you want to stop, if at all possible.'Brown, for his part, told reporters traveling with him to the meeting that the U.S. policy on long-range weapons remains in place.But, he added, 'by the same token, what we want to do is — regardless of that policy — we want to continue to make Ukraine successful with the capabilities that have been provided' by the U.S. and other nations in the coalition, as well as the weapons Kyiv has been able to build itself.'They’ve proven themselves fairly effective in building out uncrewed aerial vehicles, in building out drones,' Brown told reporters traveling with him to meetings in Europe.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has made similar points, arguing that one weapons system won't determine success in the war.'There are a number of things that go into the overall equation as to whether or not you know you want to provide one capability or another,' Austin said Friday. 'There is no silver bullet when it comes to things like this.'He also noted that Ukraine has already been able to strike inside Russia with its own internally produced systems, including drones.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-nato-military-chiefs-d020f72aaa3abec8e5fa971f7123ffe1	2024-09-14T09:27:07-07:00	
Fuel truck explosion kills at least 15 people in Haiti	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A tanker truck carrying gasoline in Haiti on Saturday flipped and exploded, killing at least 15 people and seriously injuring 40 others, officials said.Prime Minister Garry Conille provided the figures in an X post. Earlier, Radio Caraibes reported that 17 people had been killed.Haiti’s hospitals are poorly equipped to treat victims of severe burns. The nation of 12 million people has also been struggling with fuel shortages, as fighting between gangs makes it more difficult to import goods into the country. Saturday's explosion happened in Miragoane, a city of 60,000 people that was hit by a strong earthquake three years ago. In 2021, 75 people were killed in Haiti's second largest city Cap Haitien, when another fuel truck overturned and unleashed a fireball that swept through several homes and businesses that were built closely next to each other. Some of those killed were onlookers who had rushed to the truck to try and scoop up fuel.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-truck-explosion-gasoline-3b2f50d848224dbfcb3ef842ef06e023	2024-09-14T09:25:31-07:00	
Death toll in Myanmar from Typhoon Yagi reaches 74. Dozens of other people are missing	BANGKOK (AP) — The death toll in Myanmar from flooding and landslides caused by Typhoon Yagi has reached at least 74, with 89 people missing, Myanmar’s state television said Saturday. Difficulties in compiling information have raised fears that the number of casualties may be higher.The new official death toll announced by the country’s military government was more than double the 33 reported on Friday. Typhoon Yagi earlier hit Vietnam, northern Thailand and Laos, killing more than 260 people and causing major damage.The new totals were announced after state media reported that Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the ruling military council, said that Myanmar was requesting relief aid from foreign countries.Nearly 240,000 people have been displaced, according to the reports. There were already 3.4 million displaced people in Myanmar at the beginning of September, according to the U.N. refugee agency, mostly because of war and unrest in recent years.Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) In Myanmar, low-lying areas in the central regions of Mandalay and Bago, as well as eastern Shan state and the country’s capital, Naypyitaw, have been inundated by water since Wednesday. Min Aung Hlaing and other military officials inspected flooded areas and reviewed rescue, relief and rehabilitation efforts in Naypyitaw on Friday, the state-run Myanma Alinn newspaper reported. Its report said that he instructed officials to contact foreign countries, as other countries affected by the storm did, to receive rescue and relief aid for the victims.'It is necessary to manage rescue, relief and rehabilitation measures as quickly as possible,' he was quoted as saying.The exact extent of the damage still wasn't clear, but there were fears that the death toll may rise sharply. Local news outlets reported more than 100 people missing. Efforts to tally casualties and damage and provide relief are complicated. Myanmar is in a state of civil war that began in 2021, after the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Independent analysts believe the military controls much less than half of the country’s territory.Myanmar experiences extreme weather virtually every year during the monsoon season. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis killed more than 138,000 people. In that case, the military government then in power delayed accepting international assistance, and when it finally relented, tightly controlled its distribution, with little or no oversight by aid donors.Saturday evening’s state television news said that 24 bridges, 375 school buildings, one Buddhist monastery, five dams, four pagodas, 14 electrical transformers, 456 lampposts and more than 65,000 houses were damaged by floods in central and eastern parts of the country.Naypyitaw is one of the areas that was hit hardest by the floods. Myanmar’s Eleven Media group reported on Friday that record rainfall had damaged several pagodas in Bagan, the country’s ancient capital that is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The rain, said to be the heaviest in 60 years, collapsed walls at several centuries-old old temples, it said.	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-typhoon-yagi-floods-dead-missing-f41b7e73b7ed72bd58e1221e7f620456	2024-09-14T08:35:26-07:00	
Ukraine renews calls on the West to approve long-range strikes on Russian territory	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine made a new call Saturday on the West to allow it to strike deeper into Russia after a meeting between U.S. and British leaders a day earlier produced no visible shift in their policy on the use of long-range weapons.The renewed appeal came as Kyiv said Russia launched more drone and artillery attacks into Ukraine overnight.'Russian terror begins at weapons depots, airfields and military bases inside the Russian Federation,' Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak said Saturday. 'Permission to strike deep into Russia will speed up the solution.'Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called on allies to greenlight the use of Western-provided long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory. So far, the U.S. has allowed Kyiv to use American-provided weapons only in a limited area inside Russia’s border with Ukraine.Discussions on allowing long-range strikes were believed to be on the table when U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met in Washington on Friday but no decision was announced immediately.Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pressing the U.S. and other allies to allow his forces to use Western weapons to target air bases and launch sites farther afield as Russia has stepped up assaults on Ukraine’s electricity grid and utilities before winter. He did not directly comment on the meeting Saturday morning, but said that more than 70 Russian drones had been launched into Ukraine overnight. The Ukrainian air force later said that 76 Russian drones had been sighted, of which 72 were shot down.'We need to boost our air defense and long-range capabilities to protect our people,' Zelenskyy wrote on social media. 'We are working on this with all of Ukraine’s partners.'Other overnight attacks saw one person killed by Russian artillery fire as energy infrastructure was targeted in Ukraine’s Sumy region. A 54-year-old driver was killed and seven more people were hospitalized, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said.Another three people died Saturday in a Russian strike on an agricultural enterprise in the front-line town of Huliaipole in the Zaporizhzhia region, Gov. Ivan Fedorov said.Moscow warns Western nations Meanwhile, officials in Moscow have continued to make public statements warning that long-range strikes would provoke further escalation between Russia and the West. The remarks are in line with the narrative the Kremlin has promoted since early in the war, accusing NATO countries of de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told state news agency Tass on Saturday that the U.S. and British governments were pushing the conflict, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, toward 'poorly controlled escalation.'Biden on Friday brushed off similar comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said on Thursday that allowing long-range strikes 'would mean that NATO countries, the United States and European countries, are at war with Russia.' Asked what he thought about Putin’s threat, Biden answered, 'I don’t think much about Vladimir Putin.'POWs exchanged Russian and Ukrainian officials also announced on Saturday a prisoner swap brokered by the United Arab Emirates. It included 206 prisoners on both sides, including Russians captured in Ukraine’s incursion in the Kursk region.The swap is the eighth of its kind since the beginning of 2024, and puts the total number of POWs exchanged at 1,994. Previous exchanges were also brokered by the UAE. Both sides released images of soldiers traveling to meet friends and family, with Zelenskyy commenting, 'Our people are home.'Elsewhere, Russia’s Defense Ministry said that 19 Ukrainian drones had been shot down over the country’s Kursk and Belgorod regions. A woman also died Saturday after a Ukrainian shell hit her home in the border village of Bezlyudovka, Belgorod regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-long-distance-missile-biden-starmer-e4c7b590e8f89167f639969f75762fbb	2024-09-14T03:12:10-07:00	
Salvagers launch new attempt to tow an oil tanker blown up by Yemen's Houthi rebels	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A new attempt has begun to try to salvage an oil tanker burning in the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, a European Union naval mission said Saturday.The EU’s Operation Aspides published images dated Saturday of its vessels escorting three ships heading to the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion.The mission has 'been actively involved in this complex endeavor, by creating a secure environment, which is necessary for the tugboats to conduct the towing operation,' the EU said.A phone number for the mission rang unanswered Saturday. However, satellite images taken Saturday morning by Planet Labs PBC and later analyzed by The Associated Press showed what appeared to be the three salvage vessels close to the Sounion. A warship could be seen nearby.The Greek state news agency ANA-MPA later reported the Aigaion Pelagos, a Greek-flagged tugboat, was involved in the effort. It said 'three frigates, helicopters and a special forces unit' backed the salvagers.'Despite challenging conditions, with temperatures reaching up to 400 degrees Celsius (752 degrees Fahrenheit) due to the fire, the specialized salvage team successfully secured the tanker to the Aigaion Pelagos,' the report said. The Sounion came under attack from the Houthis beginning Aug. 21. The vessel had been staffed by a crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, who were taken by a French destroyer to nearby Djibouti.The Houthis later planted explosives aboard the ship and detonated them. That’s led to fears the ship’s 1 million barrels of crude oil could spill into the Red Sea.The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. One of the sunken vessels, the Tutor, went down after the Houthis planted explosives aboard it and after its crew abandoned it due to an earlier attack, the rebel group later acknowledged.Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets.The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.	https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-red-sea-tanker-e56669ea8ea5ea9f9658cdd262c07b29	2024-09-14T00:37:01-07:00	
4 people found dead in eastern Romania as rainstorms leave hundreds stranded	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Four people in eastern Romania have been found dead after torrential storms dumped unprecedented rain, leaving hundreds stranded in flooded areas, emergency authorities said Saturday.Rescue services scrambled to save people in the hard-hit eastern counties of Galati and Vaslui. The bodies of three older women and one man were found in four localities, the Department for Emergency Situations said. Emergency authorities released video footage showing teams of rescuers evacuating people using small lifeboats through muddy waters and carrying some older people to safety. Some of the most significant flood damage was concentrated in Galati where 5,000 households were affected. A Black Hawk helicopter was also deployed there to help with the search and rescue efforts. The storms battered 19 localities in eight counties in Romania, with strong winds downing dozens of trees that damaged cars and blocked roads and traffic. Authorities sent text message alerts to residents to warn them of adverse weather as emergency services rushed to remove floodwaters from homes. Hub peek embed (Floods) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) By 1 p.m. local time on Saturday, more than 250 people had been evacuated with the help of 700 interior ministry personnel deployed to affected communities, authorities said.Romanian Environment Minister Mircea Fechet told The Associated Press that in some of the badly flooded areas, more than 160 liters (42 gallons) of rain fell per square meter (about 10.7 square feet), which he said is a rare occurrence. 'What we are trying to do right now is save as many lives as possible,' said the minister, who was on his way to Galati to assess the situation. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis offered his condolences to the victims' bereaved families, writing on Facebook: 'We must continue to strengthen our capacity to anticipate extreme weather phenomena.''Severe floods that have affected a large part of the country have led to loss of lives and significant damage,' Iohannis said. 'We are again dealing with the effects of climate change, which are increasingly present throughout the European continent, with dramatic consequences on people.'Central Europe braces for intense floodingThe stormy weather comes as several central European nations anticipate severe flooding to hit the Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary over the weekend. In the Czech Republic, river waters reached dangerously high levels in dozens of areas, prompting the authorities to evacuate hundreds of people, including from a hospital in the second-largest city of Brno, to escape raging floods. A 54-year-old man was missing, police said, after he fell in a flooded stream in the southeast of the country, while another three people were swept away in a car by a river in the northeast.By Saturday evening, Czech authorities had declared the highest flood warnings in more than 70 areas across the country, and said that thousands more people should be prepared to be evacuated as the rains continued to slam down. The Czech Hydrometeorological Institute said such 'extreme floods' in those regions only occur about once a century. In neighboring Austria, authorities declared 24 villages in the northeast Lower Austria province 'disaster zones' on Saturday afternoon and began evacuating residents from those areas. 'The coming hours will be the hours of truth for flood protection, for our emergency forces and numerous compatriots,' said the province’s state governor, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, adding that in one area 'we expect challenges of historical dimensions.'The torrential downpours have also caused a sharp rise in water levels on the Danube River in Austrian capital Vienna, where special flood relief channels were built in the 1970s and ’80s, and are likely to be tested over the weekend. The Kamp River, a tributary of the Danube, is also swelling because of the unprecedented weather event. Heavy rain also hit Moldova on Saturday, where emergency workers pumped floodwater from dozens of peoples’ homes in several localities, and 13 localities in three districts suffered partial electricity outages, authorities said. Meteorologists say a low-pressure system from northern Italy was predicted to dump heavy rainfall in most parts of the Czech Republic, including the capital and border regions with Austria and Germany in the south, and Poland in the north.'We have to be ready for worst-case scenarios,' Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said after the government’s central crisis committee met. 'A tough weekend is ahead of us.'In Poland, dozens of people were evacuated as a precautionary measure on Saturday from two villages near the town of Nysa, in the Nysa River basin, after meteorologists warned of unprecedented rainfall. Some farms were flooded. Water levels continued to rise in rain Saturday and some roads and streets in the cities of Krakow and Katowice were flooded, and water penetrated the basement of a hospital in Krakow though firefighters quickly pumped it out. Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said that 'the worst is yet to come.' Polish authorities appealed to residents on Friday to stock up on food and to prepare for power outages by charging power banks.The weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region, including in Romania. Scientists have documented Earth’s hottest summer, breaking a record set just a year ago.A hotter atmosphere, driven by human-caused climate change, can lead to more intense rainfall.___Stephen McGrath reported from Sighisoara.

An American activist killed by Israeli fire is buried in Turkey as Israel strikes Gaza	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) — A Turkish-American activist who was killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank was laid to rest on Saturday in her hometown in Turkey with thousands lining the streets and anti-Israeli feelings in the country rising from a conflict that threatens to spread across the region.Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, a 26-year-old woman from Seattle, was shot dead Sept. 6 by an Israeli soldier during a demonstration against Israeli West Bank settlements, according to an Israeli protester who witnessed the shooting. Thousands of people lined the streets in the Turkish coastal town of Didim on the Aegean Sea, as Eygi was buried in a coffin draped in a Turkish flag, which was taken from her family home. A portrait of her wearing her graduation gown was propped against the coffin as people paid their respects.Her body was earlier brought from a hospital to her family home and Didim’s Central Mosque. Hub peek embed (Israel-Hamaswar) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Turkey condemned the killing and announced it will conduct its own investigation into her death. 'We are not going to leave our daughter’s blood on the ground and we demand responsibility and accountability for this murder,' Numan Kurtulmus, the speaker of Turkey’s parliament told mourners at the funeral. On Friday, an autopsy had been carried out at Izmir Forensic Medicine Institute. Kurtulmus said the examination showed Eygi was hit by a round that struck her in the back of the head below her left ear.The Israeli military said Tuesday that Eygi was likely shot 'indirectly and unintentionally' by Israeli forces. Her death was condemned by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken as the United States, Egypt and Qatar push for a cease-fire in the 11-month-long Israel-Hamas war and the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. Talks have repeatedly bogged down as Israel and Hamas accuse each other of making new and unacceptable demands.The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding around 100 hostages after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire in November. Around a third of the remaining hostages are believed to be dead.Israelis are growing increasingly frustrated with the government for not reaching a cease-fire with Hamas to bring the remaining captives home. On Saturday night, thousands of Israelis streamed into the streets in Tel Aviv demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu bring the hostages back. At one of the rallies, Anat Angrest, mother of kidnapped soldier Matan Angrest, shared a voice recording from her son while in captivity asking Netanyahu to make a deal. 'I want to see my family and friends,' said Matan in the message. Angrest then addressed the head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency. 'Where are you, negotiation team? There is no deal for over eight months, so what are you doing?'Anger has spiked since the bodies of six hostages were found in a tunnel beneath the southern Gaza city of Rafah earlier this month. The military said the six were killed shortly before Israeli forces were to rescue them.Many blame Netanyahu for failing to reach a deal, which opinion polls show a majority of Israelis favor. However, the country is also extremely divided and Netanyahu has significant support for his strategy of 'total victory' against Hamas, even if a deal for the hostages has to wait.Israeli airstrikes hit Gaza Israeli airstrikes pounded central and southern Gaza overnight into Saturday, killing at least 14 people.The strikes in Gaza City hit one home housing 11 people, including three women and four children, and another strike hit a tent in Khan Younis with Palestinians displaced by the Israel-Hamas war, Gaza's Civil Defense said. They followed airstrikes earlier this week that hit a tent camp on Tuesday and a United Nations school sheltering displaced on Wednesday.The Israeli army on Saturday ordered Palestinians sheltering in the northern neighborhoods of Manshiyeh, Beit Lahia and Sheikh Zayed to evacuate south toward Gaza City. The order came after projectiles were fired from the area, the Israeli army said in a post on X. It remains unclear how many people are sheltering in those areas.First phase of anti-polio campaign ends Meanwhile, a campaign to inoculate children in Gaza against polio drew down and the World Health Organization said about 559,000 under the age of 10 have recovered from their first dose, seven out of every eight children the campaign aimed to vaccinate. The second doses are expected to begin later this month as part of an effort in which the WHO said parties had already agreed to.'As we prepare for the next round in four weeks, we’re hopeful these pauses will hold, because this campaign has clearly shown the world what’s possible when peace is given a chance,' Richard Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative in Gaza and the West Bank, said in a statement on Saturday.The war has caused vast destruction and displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, often multiple times, and plunged the territory into a severe humanitarian crisis. Gaza’s Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count, but says women and children make up just over half of the dead. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 militants in the war.__Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.

Iran says it successfully launched a satellite in its program criticized by West over missile fears	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran launched a satellite into space Saturday with a rocket built by the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, state-run media reported, the latest for a program the West fears helps Tehran advance its ballistic missile program. Iran described the launch as the second such launch to put a satellite into orbit with the rocket. Independent scientists later confirmed the launch and that the satellite reached orbit.Footage later released by Iranian media showed the rocket blast off from a mobile launcher. An Associated Press analysis of the video and other imagery later released suggested the launch happened at the Guard’s launch pad on the outskirts of the city of Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) east of the capital, Tehran. The launch comes amid heightened tensions gripping the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, during which Tehran launched an unprecedented direct missile-and-drone attack on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium to nearly weapons-grade levels, raising concerns among nonproliferation experts about Tehran's program. Hub peek embed (Spacelaunches) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Iran identified the satellite-carrying rocket as the Qaem-100, which the Guard used in January for another successful launch. Qaem means 'upright' in Iran's Farsi language. The solid-fuel, three-stage rocket put the Chamran-1 satellite, weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds), into a 550-kilometer (340-mile) orbit, state media reported. The rocket bore a Quranic verse: 'That which is left by Allah is better for you, if you are believers.'A state-owned subsidiary of Iran's Defense Ministry and experts at the Aerospace Research Institute built the satellite with others to 'test hardware and software systems for orbital maneuver technology validation,' state media said, without elaborating.Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of the Guard, praised the launch in a statement and said scientists successfully overcame 'the atmosphere of extensive and oppressive international sanctions.'Responding to questions from The Associated Press, the U.S. State Department said it has 'long made clear our concern that Iran’s space launch vehicle programs provide a pathway to expand its longer-range missile systems.''We continue to use a variety of nonproliferation tools, in coordination with our allies and partners, to counter the further advancement of Iran’s ballistic missile program and its ability to proliferate missiles and related technology,' it added.The United States had previously said Iran’s satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran’s ballistic missile program expired last October.Under Iran’s relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. Hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a protege of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, has pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May. It's unclear what Iran's new president, the reformist Masoud Pezeshkian, wants for the program as he was silent on the issue while campaigning. The U.S. intelligence community’s worldwide threat assessment this year said Iran's development of satellite launch vehicles 'would shorten the timeline' for Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology.Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for 'several' nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned.Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.The launch also came ahead of the second anniversary of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, which sparked nationwide protests against Iran's mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law and the country's Shiite theocracy. ___Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-satellite-chamran-space-52022a743be4e3ffca5df9d30de7b04c	2024-09-13T22:30:02-07:00	
Tropical Storm Ileana weakens to a depression	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Storm Ileana has weakened to a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center said Sunday.The tropical storm formed Thursday off Mexico’s Pacific coast as it moved ashore, making landfall on the coast of the Mexican state of Sinaloa Saturday, a day after it pounded the resort-studded Los Cabos.On Sunday, wind speed dropped to 35 mph (55 kph), NOAA said in an advisory, as Ileana was nearly 30 miles (45 kilometers) southwest of Los Mochis, Mexico, and moving west-northwest at 2 mph (4 kph). It also forecasts the storm to become a remnant low — a post-tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds less than 34 knots.On Friday, a warning had been in effect for portions of the Baja California Peninsula, including Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Juan Manuel Arce Ortega, from Los Cabos Civil Protection, said the municipalities of La Paz and Los Cabos had suspended classes in schools due to the storm. Hub peek embed (Weather) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) Authorities prepared 20 temporary shelters in San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas, according to Los Cabos Civil Protection.At the Hacienda Beach Club and Residences in Cabo San Lucas, valet worker Alan Galvan said the rain arrived late Thursday night and has been constant. 'The rain isn’t very strong right now, but the waves are choppy,' he said.'The guests are very calm and already came down for coffee,' Galvan said. 'There’s some flights canceled but everything is ok at the moment.'The rain remained consistent through Los Cabos Friday afternoon, with several roads flooded and some resorts stacking up sandbags on their perimeters. Some people were still walking around boat docks with their umbrellas.'The priority has to be safety, starting with the workers. We always have to check on our colleagues who live in risk areas,' said Lyzzette Liceaga, a tour operator at Los Cabos.Ileana was the only active tropical storm in the National Weather Service’s Eastern Pacific basin on Friday. In the Atlantic basin, post-tropical cyclone Francine was bringing heavy rain to parts of the southern United States, and Tropical Storm Gordon formed on Friday in the Atlantic Ocean, with forecasters saying it is expected to remain over open water for several days.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-ileana-cabo-san-lucas-970c4df9c396c98286a5abcb10b87ed4	2024-09-13T22:03:32-07:00	
Women in Iran are going without hijabs as the 2nd anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death approaches	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — On the streets of Iranian cities, it's becoming more common to see a woman passing by without a mandatory headscarf, or hijab, as the second anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini and the mass protests it sparked approaches. There's no government official or study acknowledging the phenomenon, which began as Iran entered its hot summer months and power cuts in its overburdened electrical system became common. But across social media, videos of people filming neighborhood streets or just talking about a normal day in their life, women and girls can be seen walking past with their long hair out over their shoulders, particularly after sunset. This defiance comes despite what United Nations investigators describe as 'expanded repressive measures and policies' by Iran's theocracy to punish them — though there's been no recent catalyzing event like Amini's death to galvanize demonstrators. Hub peek embed (Iran) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) The country's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on a promise to halt the harassment of women by morality police. But the country's ultimate authority remains the 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in the past said 'unveiling is both religiously forbidden and politically forbidden.' For some observant Muslim women, the head covering is a sign of piety before God and modesty in front of men outside their families. In Iran, the hijab — and the all-encompassing black chador worn by some — has long been a political symbol as well.'Meaningful institutional changes and accountability for gross human rights violations and crimes under international law, and crimes against humanity, remains elusive for victims and survivors, especially for women and children,' warned a U.N. fact-finding mission on Iran on Friday. Amini, 22, died on Sept. 16, 2022, in a hospital after her arrest by the country’s morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab to the liking of the authorities. The protests that followed Amini’s death started first with the chant 'Women, Life, Freedom.' However, the protesters’ cries soon grew into open calls of revolt against Khamenei.A monthslong security crackdown that followed killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained.Today, passersby on the streets of Tehran, whether its tony northern suburbs for the wealthy or the working-class neighborhoods of the capital's southern reaches, now routinely see women without the hijab. It particularly starts at dusk, though even during the daylight on weekends women can be seen with their hair uncovered at major parks. Online videos — specifically a sub-genre showing walking tours of city streets for those in rural areas or abroad who want to see life in the bustling neighborhoods of Tehran — include women without the hijab. Something that would have stopped a person in their tracks in the decades follwing the 1979 Islamic Revolution now goes unacknowledged. 'My quasi-courage for not wearing scarves is a legacy of Mahsa Amini and we have to protect this as an achievement,' said a 25-year-old student at Tehran Sharif University, who gave only her first name Azadeh out of fear of reprisal. 'She could be at my current age if she did not pass away.'The disobedience still comes with risk. Months after the protests halted, Iranian morality police returned to the streets. There have been scattered videos of women and young girls being roughed up by officers in the time since. In 2023, a teenage Iranian girl was injured in a mysterious incident on Tehran’s Metro while not wearing a headscarf and later died in hospital. In July, activists say police opened fire on a woman fleeing a checkpoint in an attempt to avoid her car being impounded for her not wearing the hijab. Meanwhile, the government has targeted private businesses where women are seen without their headscarves. Surveillance cameras search for women uncovered in vehicles to fine and impound their cars. The government has gone as far as use aerial drones to monitor the 2024 Tehran International Book Fair and Kish Island for uncovered women, the U.N. said. Yet some feel the election of Pezeshkian in July, after a helicopter crash killed Iranian hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, is helping ease tensions over the hijab. 'I think the current peaceful environment is part of the status after Pezeshkian took office,' said Hamid Zarrinjouei, a 38-year-old bookseller. 'In some way, Pezeshkian could convince powerful people that more restrictions do not necessarily make women more faithful to the hijab.'On Wednesday, Iran’s Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi Azad warned security forces about starting physical altercations over the hijab. 'We prosecuted violators, and we will,' Movahedi Azad said, according to Iranian media. 'Nobody has right to have improper attitude even though an individual commits an offense.'While the government isn't directly addressing the increase in women not wearing hijabs, there are other signs of a recognition the political landscape has shifted. In August, authorities dismissed a university teacher a day after he appeared on state television and dismissively referred to Amini as having 'croaked.'Meanwhile, the pre-reform newspaper Ham Mihan reported in August on an unpublished survey conducted under the supervision of Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance that found the hijab had become one of the most important issues in the country — something it hadn't seen previously. 'This issue has been on people’s minds more than ever before,' sociologist Simin Kazemi told the newspaper. ___Associated Press writers Nasser Karimi and Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-hijab-protests-mahsa-amini-anniversary-59641e9254eea45c069b54d590c7e818	2024-09-13T20:10:09-07:00	
In Belarus, the native language is vanishing as Russian takes prominence	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — When school started this year for Mikalay in Belarus, the 15-year-old discovered that his teachers and administrators no longer called him by that name. Instead, they referred to him as Nikolai, its Russian equivalent.What's more, classes at his school — one of the country's best — are now taught in Russian, not Belarusian, which he has spoken for most of his life.Belarusians like Mikalay are experiencing a new wave of Russification as Moscow expands its economic, political and cultural dominance to overtake the identity of its neighbor.It's not the first time. Russia under the czars and in the era of the Soviet Union imposed its language, symbols and cultural institutions on Belarus. But with the demise of the USSR in 1991, the country began to assert its identity, and Belarusian briefly became the official language, with the white-red-white national flag replacing a version of the red hammer and sickle.But all that changed in 1994, after Alexander Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm official, came to power. The authoritarian leader made Russian an official language, alongside Belarusian, and did away with the nationalist symbols.Now, with Lukashenko in control of the country for over three decades, he has allowed Russia to dominate all aspects of life in Belarus, a country of 9.5 million people. Belarusian, which like Russian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, is hardly heard on the streets of Minsk and other large cities anymore.Official business is conducted in Russian, which dominates the majority of the media. Lukashenko speaks only Russian, and government officials often don't use their native tongue.The country depends on Russian loans and cheap energy and has created a political and military alliance with Moscow, allowing President Vladimir Putin to deploy troops and missiles on its soil, which was used as a staging area for the war in Ukraine.'I understand that our Belarus is occupied. … And who is the president there? Not Lukashenko. The president is Putin,' said Svetlana Alexievich, who won the 2015 Nobel Prize for literature and lives in Germany in effective exile. 'The nation has been humiliated and it will be very difficult for Belarusians to recover from this.' Belarusian cultural figures have been persecuted and hundreds of its nationalist organizations have been closed. Experts say Moscow is seeking to implement in Belarus what the Kremlin intended to do in neighboring Ukraine when the war there began in 2022.'It is obvious that our children are being deliberately deprived of their native language, history and Belarusian identity, but parents have been strongly advised not to ask questions about Russification,' said Mikalay’s father, Anatoly, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition his last name not be used, for fear of retribution.'We were informed about the synchronization of the curriculum with Russia this year and were shown a propaganda film about how the Ukrainian special services are allegedly recruiting our teenagers and forcing them to commit sabotage in Belarus,' he said.Mikalay's school was one of the few where paperwork and some courses were conducted in Belarusian. In recent years, however, dozens of teachers were fired and the Belarusian-language section of its website vanished.Human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski, convicted in 2023 on charges stemming from his Nobel Peace Prize-winning work, demanded his trial be conducted in Belarusian. The court rejected it and sentenced him to 10 years.Lukashenko derides his native language, saying 'nothing great can be expressed in Belarusian. … There are only two great languages in the world: Russian and English.'Speaking to Russian state media, Lukashenko recounted how Putin once thanked him for making Russian the dominant language in Belarus.'I said, ‘Wait, what are you thanking me for? ... The Russian language is my language, we were part of one empire, and we're taking part in (helping) that language develop,'' Lukashenko said.Belarus was part of the Russian empire for centuries and became one of 15 Soviet republics after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Daily use of the Belarusian language decreased and continued only in the country's west and north and in rural areas. In 1994, about 40% of students were taught in Belarusian; it's now down to under 9%. Although Belarusian, like Russian, is an eastern Slavic language, its vocabulary is considerably different. In 1517, Belarusian publisher Francysk Skaryna was one of the first in eastern Europe to translate the Bible into his native language.Even speaking Belarusian is seen as a show of opposition to Lukashenko and a declaration of national identity. That played a key role in the mass protests after the disputed 2020 election gave the authoritarian leader a sixth term. In the harsh crackdown that followed, a half-million people fled the country.'The Belarusian language is increasingly perceived as a sign of political disloyalty and is being abandoned in favor of Russian in the public administration, education, culture and the mass media, upon orders from the hierarchy or out of fear of discrimination,' said Anaïs Marin, the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights in Belarus.At the same time, 'more people want to speak Belarusian, which has become one of the symbols of freedom, but they're afraid to do it in public,' said Alina Nahornaja, author of 'Language 404,' a book about Belarusians who experienced discrimination for speaking their native language.Like Ukraine, Belarusians had a desire for rapprochement with Europe that accompanied their nationalist sentiment, said Belarusian analyst Valery Karbalevich.'But the Kremlin quickly realized the danger and began the process of creeping Russification in Belarus,' he added.That prompted pro-Russian organizations, joint educational programs and cultural projects to spring up 'like mushrooms after the rain — against the backdrop of harsh repressions against everything Belarusian,' Karbalevich said.Censorship and bans affect not only contemporary Belarusian literature but also its classics. In 2023, the prosecutor’s office declared as extremist the 19th-century poems of Vincent Dunin-Martsinkyevich, who opposed the Russian Empire.When the Kremlin began supporting Lukashenko against the anti-government protests in 2020, it ensured his loyalty and received carte blanche in Belarus.'Today, Lukashenko is paying Putin with our sovereignty,' said exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. 'Belarusian national identity, cultures and language are our strongest weapons against the Russian world and Russification.'Four cities in Belarus now host a 'Russia House' to promote its culture and influence, offering seminars, film clubs, exhibitions and competitions.'The goal is to plant Russian narratives so that as many Belarusians as possible view Russian as their own,' said analyst Alexander Friedman. 'The Kremlin spares no expense and acts on a grand scale, which could be especially effective and dangerous in a situation where Belarus has found itself in information isolation, and there is almost no one left inside the country to resist the Russian world.'Almost the entire troupe of the Yanka Kupala Theater, the country’s oldest, fled Belarus amid the political crackdown. Its former director, Pavel Latushka, now an opposition figure abroad, said the new management couldn't recruit enough new actors, and had to invite Russians, 'but it turned out that no one knew the Belarusian language.''Putin published an article denying the existence of an independent Ukraine back in 2021, and even then we understood perfectly well that he was pursuing similar goals in Belarus,' Latushka said.'The main course was supposed to be Ukraine,' he added, with a Russified Belarus 'as a dessert.'	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-language-russia-lukashenko-russification-bcc4eb1881ca6c93f98ef9951068dde7	2024-09-13T19:18:49-07:00	
US hits Russian state media with sanctions for raising money for Moscow's troops in Ukraine	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. State Department announced new sanctions on Russian state media Friday, accusing a Kremlin news outlet of working hand-in-hand with the Russian military and running fundraising campaigns to pay for sniper rifles, body armor and other equipment for soldiers fighting in Ukraine.While the outlet, RT, has previously been sanctioned for its work to spread Kremlin propaganda and disinformation, the new allegations suggest its role goes far beyond influence operations. Instead, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, RT is a key part of Russia's war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic adversaries.'RT wants its new covert intelligence capabilities, like its longstanding propaganda disinformation efforts, to remain hidden,' Blinken told reporters. 'Our most powerful antidote to Russia’s lies is the truth. It’s shining a bright light on what the Kremlin is trying to do under the cover of darkness.'Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) RT has also created websites posing as legitimate news sites to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere, officials said. They say the outlet has also expanded its use of cyber operations with a new unit with ties to Russian intelligence created last year.The crowd-sourcing effort ran on Russian social media platforms and sought to raise funds for military supplies, some of which were procured in China, officials said. There were no obvious connections between RT and the fundraising campaign, or any indication that Chinese officials knew their products were being sold to Russia. The list of supplies also included night-vision equipment, drones, radios and generators.RT's actions show 'it's not just a firehouse of disinformation, but a fully-fledged member of the intelligence apparatus and operation of the Russian government,' said Jamie Rubin, who heads the State Department's Global Engagement Center.President Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press that the allegations were 'nonsense.' RT is 'media' and 'quite effective,' Peskov said.The sanctions announced Friday target RT’s parent organization, TV-Novosti, as well as a related state media group called Rossiya Segodnya and its general director Dmitry Kiselyov. A third organization and its leader, Nelli Parutenko, were also sanctioned for allegedly running a vote-buying scheme in Moldova designed to help Moscow’s preferred candidates in an upcoming election.Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova suggested the sanctions against RT were unnecessary because it has already been sanctioned.'I think a new profession should appear in the United States — a specialist in sanctions already imposed against Russia,' she wrote on her Telegram channel.Russia's global propaganda work is receiving extra scrutiny in the months leading up to the U.S. election. Last week, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two RT employees with covertly paying a Tennessee company nearly $10 million for its content. The company then paid several popular far-right influencers, whose content often mirrored Russian talking points. Two of the influencers said they had no idea their work was being supported by Russia.This summer, intelligence officials warned that Russia was using unwitting Americans to spread its propaganda by disguising it in English on sites popular with Americans. Officials say Russia seeks to divide Americans ahead of the election as a way of reducing support for Ukraine. Russia's influence operations also appear designed to support former President Donald Trump, who has criticized Ukraine and the NATO alliance while praising Russian President Vladimir Putin.___Associated Press writer Emma Burrows contributed to this report from London.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-trump-sanctions-harris-rt-f7e3ff262fdf24695048cffe2529b937	2024-09-13T08:54:03-07:00
