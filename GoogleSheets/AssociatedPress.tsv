Pro Women's Hockey League announces it could add as many as 2 teams for 2025-26 season	The six-team Professional Women’s Hockey League is launching its expansion process with plans to add as many as two franchises for the start of the 2025-26 season, a league executive announced Tuesday. Speaking at the ESPNW Summit in New York, senior vice president of business operations Amy Scheer said the league will begin sending requests for proposals to several markets starting as early as next week, while also accepting applications. '(We’re) looking for the right market size, right fan base, right facilities, right economic opportunity — so a lot of research to be done over the next couple months,' Scheer said, without specifying which markets the league might be targeting. 'But yeah, looking to continue to build the league and grow the number of teams.' Among the U.S. expansion candidates are Detroit and Pittsburgh, where the PWHL hosted neutral site games during its inaugural season last year. Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia would also be regarded as candidates after both were considered before the league established teams in Boston, New York and Minnesota. Denver and Seattle are also considered potential candidates. In Canada, where the league has teams in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, Quebec City has already announced its intention of being a candidate for an expansion franchise. Calgary would be a potential option with the city previously being home to the Inferno from 2011 to 2019, before the Canadian Women's Hocky League folded. Scheer also announced the league plans to hold neutral site games in nine markets across North America, and is considering holding an outdoor game. Scheer added the league is also working on holding games in Europe, without specifying when that might happen. The PWHL’s second season opens on Nov. 30, and features an expanded schedule with each team playing 30 games — up from 24 last year. The league has yet to announce where it’s neutral site games will be played. Quebec City councilor Jackie Smith announced earlier on Tuesday that the PWHL has agreed to play a neutral site game at the city’s Videotron Centre on Jan. 19. The PWHL’s schedule has Ottawa playing Montreal on that day, with the site yet to be determined. Smith called the development the first step in Quebec City landing an expansion team. ___ AP Women’s Hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey	https://apnews.com/article/womens-hockey-pwhl-expansion-20e84fec388fd3b29a0c54ee0c5c7a33	2024-10-29T09:43:55-07:00	
Judge tosses GOP congressmen's lawsuit over Pennsylvania's overseas and military votes	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday threw out a lawsuit by six Republican members of Congress seeking to make Pennsylvania election officials institute new checks confirming the identity of soldiers, sailors, and others who vote from overseas and to make sure they're eligible. U.S. District Judge Christopher Conner said he agreed with the defendants — Secretary of State Al Schmidt and one of his top deputies — who argued there were no grounds to sue and that the case was launched too late and too close to Election Day. The Pennsylvania congressmen 'provide no good excuse for waiting until barely a month before the election to bring this lawsuit,' Conner wrote. More than 25,000 overseas ballots had already been sent out when the case was filed in late September, the judge noted. The lawsuit was filed by six of the state’s eight Republican members of the U.S. House: Reps. Guy Reschenthaler, Dan Meuser, G.T. Thompson, Lloyd Smucker, Mike Kelly and Scott Perry. The other plaintiff is PA Fair Elections, a group led by Heather Honey, an election researcher whose work has fueled right-wing attacks on voting procedures. Messages seeking comment were left Tuesday with their lawyers. During a streamed update on election matters Tuesday, Schmidt said his agency 'is pleased that this frivolous lawsuit was dismissed.' Conner said the plaintiffs were asking 'to impose new verification procedures the contours of which plaintiffs themselves have been unable to fully flesh out three weeks into this litigation.' He said an injunction now 'would upend the commonwealth's carefully laid election administration procedures to the detriment of untold thousands of voters.' During oral arguments on Oct. 18, Conner asked why the plaintiffs had not sued earlier over procedures that have been in place for years. He also pressed their lawyers to show how their clients were directly harmed by the current policies, as required for such claims. The order issued Tuesday said the Republican congressmen had only 'hypothetical concerns' about the impact overseas votes might have on their own reelection contests. 'Their status as candidates, without more, gets them nowhere,' the judge wrote. The case could have affected thousands of ballots in Pennsylvania, a pivotal swing state in the presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. The plaintiffs had asked the judge to declare current practices illegal under federal law and to order that the secretary of state's office confer with the congressmen and PA Fair Elections about how to verify the identity and eligibility of people casting votes under the U.S. Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. They also asked to have overseas and military ballots segregated during the current election season pending the additional verification. Lawyers for Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's administration, representing Schmidt and his deputy, had argued that the plaintiffs were saying valid votes could be diluted by improper ones, which they said would not be sufficient grounds for the judge to act. They said federal laws exempt overseas voters 'from identification requirements imposed on other voters who register to vote by mail.' Military voters are more likely to be Republican, while other overseas voters tend to lean Democratic. The Democratic Party is spending money this year in an effort to boost their turnout.	https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-military-overseas-ballots-1cb8e5b1b4e564482125e1633642c06b	2024-10-29T09:17:47-07:00	
The EU will impose duties on electric vehicle imports from China by Thursday	BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union is set to impose duties on imports of electric vehicles from China by Thursday after talks between Brussels and Beijing failed to find an amicable solution to their trade dispute. Electric vehicles have become a major flashpoint in a broader trade dispute over the influence of Chinese government subsidies on European markets and Beijing’s burgeoning exports of green technology to the bloc. 'By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we’re standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,' European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday. 'In parallel, we remain open to a possible alternative solution that would be effective in addressing the problems identified and (World Trade Organization)-compatible,' he added. The duties would stay in force for five years, unless an amicable solution is found. According to the commission, which manages trade disputes on behalf of the 27 EU member countries, sales of Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices. The duties on Chinese manufacturers will be 17% on cars made by BYD, 18.8% on those from Geely and 35.3% for vehicles exported by China’s state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden’s Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain’s MG, one of Europe’s bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China, including Western companies such as Volkswagen and BMW, would be subject to duties of 20.7%. The commission has an 'individually calculated' rate for Tesla of 7.8%. The EU’s retaliatory duties have run into opposition in Germany, which has Europe’s biggest economy and is home to major automakers. The head of Germany’s auto industry association, VDA, said the imposition of the tariffs is 'a setback for free global trade and so for prosperity, the preservation of jobs and Europe’s growth.' Hildegard Müller said the move increases the risk of a far-reaching trade conflict. 'The industry is not naive in dealing with China, but the challenges must be resolved in dialogue' Müller said in a statement. The commission says China boosted its EU market share with the help of subsidies across the production chain. These ranged from cheap land for factories provided by local governments, to cut-price supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises, to tax breaks and easy financing from state-controlled banks. The rapid growth in China's market share has sparked concern in the EU that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU’s ability to produce its own green technology to combat climate change. Business groups and unions also fear that the jobs of 2.5 million auto industry workers could be put in jeopardy, as well those of 10.3 million more people whose employment depends indirectly on EV production. ——— Associated Press correspondent Geir Moulson contributed from Berlin.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-china-trade-electric-vehicles-duties-ev-9c720558b83316fdb6e1a0f9c2b55a15	2024-10-29T08:11:52-07:00	
Election 2024 Latest: With 1 week to go, Harris heads to Washington and Trump stumps in Pennsylvania	Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver her campaign’s 'closing argument' Tuesday from the same spot in Washington where former President Donald Trump helped incite a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. One week out from Election Day, Harris’ address from the grassy Ellipse near the White House is designed to encourage Americans to visualize their alternate futures if she or Trump takes over the Oval Office in less than three months. Trump opened his remarks to reporters at Mar-a-Lago Tuesday morning by saying Harris is running on a 'campaign of destruction' and 'of absolute hate,' accusing her team of 'perhaps even trying to destroy our country.' He will head to Pennsylvania later in the day for a Building America's Future event in Drexel and a rally Tuesday night in Allentown. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: What is The Ellipse? The Ellipse, where Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver her closing message against former President Donald Trump, is a grassy park between the White House and the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. The area, which is administered by the National Park Service, has long played host to a range of political events and national traditions. Most recently, it was where then-President Trump delivered a lie-filled speech on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before hundreds stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress met to certify to 2020 election. While the White House is often the backdrop for events on the Ellipse, expressly political events are allowed in the park, unlike at the White House. The park was first developed in the 1850s and was part of landscape architect Pierre Charles L’Enfant’s plans for the nation’s capital. However, its development was cut short by a lack of funds and the Civil War, according to the National Park Service. During the conflict, soldiers were housed on the site, and the area had also been used as horse pens, a slaughterhouse and a trash dump, according to the Park Service. Harris’ closing argument against Trump is far from her final event Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver what her campaign is touting as her closing argument against former President Donald Trump on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. But the event, a large gathering on the Ellipse park just south of the White House, will be far from her last rally. Harris is slated to crisscross the country in the final days of the campaign, hitting all key battleground states as she makes her last pitch to voters. Harris’ campaign has crafted the Tuesday event as both a physical and rhetorical counter to Trump. She will urge voters to 'turn the page' toward a new era and away from Trump, lambasting both the kind of rhetoric Trump has used and what it would mean to give him four more years as president. Physically, Harris will be standing in the same park where Trump delivered a lie-filled speech on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before hundreds stormed the Capitol as Congress met to certify to 2020 election. ‘We are on track to win a very close election,’ Harris campaign chair says Harris’ campaign chair says early voting returns in key states suggest the vice president’s supporters are turning out in numbers she needs to win. In an online video running nearly three and a half minutes, Jen O’Malley Dillon says a lot of Republican-leaning voters were voting early in strong numbers as well — but those tended to be folks who would have otherwise voted on Election Day. By contrast, she said, the Harris campaign believes low-propensity voters are breaking for the vice president. O’Malley Dillion said the campaign’s polling shows that late-breaking undecided voters 'are more open to supporting' Harris if they find out 'more information' about her in the campaign’s closing days. 'It’s OK to be worried,' before Election Day, she said, but added, 'We are on track to win a very close election.' ‘This truly is a margin of error race’ Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon has released a video telling supporters, 'Why you don’t have to feel anxious and you can feel good' about next week’s election. As the campaign has been arguing for months, O’Malley Dillon says Harris has 'multiple pathways' to get to the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the White House. She said seven states remain in play — the 'blue wall' of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. O’Malley Dillon said that, rather than conceding any of those, as sometimes happens late in races, Harris is still campaigning hard in all of them because 'this truly is a margin of error race.' Hundreds of Miami-Dade County ballots were found on the side of the road The elections department in Florida’s largest county confirmed Tuesday that a sealed bin and a sealed bag had been found by a driver and the ballots inside had already been scanned and tabulated at an early voting site on Monday, according to reporting by the Miami Herald. A county employee forgot to lock the back of a truck and the containers fell out when they drove off, according to county elections supervisor Christina White, who said election workers confirmed nothing was damaged or tampered with. A video posted by the popular South Florida social media account Only in Dade shows a passing driver apparently stopping to pick up the containers labeled with county barcodes and drive them to a police station. The employee driving the truck has since been fired. Harris campaign takes over Las Vegas’ Sphere to help get out the vote The vice president’s team says her campaign is the first to advertise on the entertainment venue, which opened in 2023. The exterior of the Sphere features a rotating series of messages encouraging people to vote for Harris and running mate Tim Walz by Election Day, Nov. 5. The messages include her slogan, 'When we fight, we win,' and other phrases. Nevada is among the handful of battleground states that the Democrat and Republican rival Donald Trump are trying hard to win. Harris’ team says the Sphere advertising is a 'critical piece' of their efforts in Nevada, which also include taking over the homepages of top newspapers and mobile billboards in Reno, Carson City and Las Vegas. Harris is scheduled to campaign in Reno and Las Vegas on Thursday. Trump on his Madison Square Garden rally: ‘There’s never been an event so beautiful’ While he didn’t mention a comedian’s controversial remarks about Puerto Rico, Trump expounded at length about his Madison Square Garden rally, which he called a 'lovefest,' a term he has also used to reference the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. At Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, Trump noted 'there’s never been an event so beautiful' as the Sunday night rally in his hometown of New York City. Trump called it 'terrible to say,' as some of his critics have pointed out, that the same arena was host to a gathering of Nazis in 1939. More than 20,000 people attended a Feb. 20, 1939 rally at the Garden organized by the German American Bund, a pro-Nazi group that hung swastikas alongside a huge portrait of George Washington. Several of the speakers on Sunday referenced that event, including former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, who said, 'I don’t see no stinkin’ Nazis in here.' 'Nobody’s ever had love like that,' Trump said of the hourslong Sunday event that featured speakers including some of his children, wife Melania and high-level surrogates and supporters including TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. 'It was really love for our country.' Trump wraps his remarks without referencing comments of a comedian at his New York rally Trump has yet to address the controversy, also not mentioning it during his appearances in Georgia on Monday. On Tuesday, he did reference the event overall, calling it 'an absolute lovefest' in his hometown. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage' during the Sunday event at Madison Square Garden. His remark has drawn wide condemnation and highlighted the rising power of a key Latino group in the swing state of Pennsylvania. He also made demeaning jokes about Black people, other Latinos, Palestinians and Jews during his routine before Trump’s appearance. The Harris campaign has released an ad that will run online in battleground states targeting Puerto Rican voters and highlighting the comedian’s remarks. The comments landed Harris a show of support from Puerto Rican music star Bad Bunny and prompted reactions from Republicans in Florida and Puerto Rico. Head of Puerto Rico’s Republican Party calls Hinchcliffe remarks ‘totally reprehensible’ The president of Puerto Rico’s Republican Party, Ángel Cintrón, rejected the comments of a comedian at a Trump rally in New York where he called the U.S. territory 'a floating island of garbage.' Cintrón said the 'poor attempt at comedy' by Tony Hinchcliffe on Sunday was 'disgraceful, ignorant and totally reprehensible.' 'There is no room for absurd and racist comments like that. They do not represent the conservative values of republicanism anywhere in our nation,' Cintrón said in a statement. He noted that there are 3 million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico and nearly 6 million in the U.S. mainland. 'Whether we are Republicans or Democrats, we are American and Puerto Rican citizens proud of our roots and incalculable contributions to American democracy for more than one hundred years,' Cintrón said. Harris will have to ‘get herself a job someplace,’ Trump says A week away from the end of voting in the general election, Trump is reflecting on his presidential run, saying, 'We’ve had a great campaign' and predicting that Harris will have to go home and 'get herself a job someplace, who knows.' Trump is featuring speakers who say they were harmed by policies under Harris’ time in office Tammy Nobles talked about the death of her daughter, saying the perpetrator was an MS-13 gang member in the country illegally. Michael Koppy, owner of Go Green Dry Cleaners, talked about how he has had to help other small businesses unable to keep up with inflation and rising costs. Christy Shamblin, whose daughter-in-law Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee was killed during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, said Donald Trump 'demonstrates peace through strength.' Trump: Anything positive about the economy during Harris’ time in office was ‘fake’ Saying that the economy under Harris’ time in office has caused destruction, Trump said that any boon was 'fake.' He then cited 'one of the most respected people on Wall Street' as saying that 'the economy is only good' because 'people think Trump is going to get elected.' Trump says he would create ‘compensation fund’ for the ‘victims of migrant crime’ As he has many times along the campaign trail, Trump is decrying federal authorities for dropping plane-loads of migrants 'all over the Midwest,' mentioning Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio. Saying he was announcing the intent 'for the first time,' Trump said that as president he would be 'seizing the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartels,' and using those assets 'to create a compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime.' Trump calls immigration reform ‘the single biggest issue’ for his campaign Immigration reform — and blaming Democrats for issues caused by an influx of immigrants across the U.S.-Mexico border — has long been Trump’s signature campaign issue, and a week out from Election Day, he is sticking to that. Saying that 'we talk about inflation and the economy,' Trump added, 'To me, there’s nothing more important than the fabric of our country being destroyed,' calling the border 'the single biggest issue.' Trump plays video featuring mother of 12-year-old found dead in Texas Trump is playing a video featuring comments from the mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old Texas girl who was found dead in a creek not far from her home. Police charged two Venezuelan men who had entered the U.S. illegally with the girl’s murder. Alexis Nungaray said that her daughter is 'six feet in the ground based off of' Harris’ decisions and called for Trump’s reelection. Trump alleges Harris ‘keeps talking about Hitler and Nazis because her record is horrible’ Trump accused Harris of not caring about the impact of her actions in what he called her 'campaign of absolute hate,' saying that she intends to 'keep this misery going, and she’s going to keep it going for as long as she can.' Trump alleged that Harris 'keeps talking about Hitler and Nazis because her record is horrible.' Trump said that the 'three great people' on stage with him would share their own stories about 'how their lives have been shattered' by Harris’ policies. Trump says he is ‘running on a plan to save America’ The GOP nominee said his Democratic rival, now Harris, is running on a 'campaign of destruction' and 'of absolute hate,' accusing her team of 'perhaps even trying to destroy our country.' Trump again said Democrats 'stole the presidency of the United States' by ousting Biden from their ticket this year. As he spoke, Trump was flanked on stage by three people, none of whom he has identified thus far. Trump has arrived at his Mar-a-Lago event Supporters cheered his name and raised cellphones in the air as he walked into the room, exactly one week before Election Day. Two days ahead of Halloween, the former president walked out just after the playing of Michael Jackson’s 'Thriller,' which has become a staple at many of his campaign rallies. Trump began his remarks by saying that things are 'going very well' but noted some 'bad spots in Pennsylvania where some serious things have been caught or are in the process of being caught.' Reading from paper on the podium in front of him, Trump began by criticizing Kamala Harris, saying she 'has obliterated our borders' and has 'caused so much destruction and death at home and abroad.' Musk’s pro-Trump super PAC uses vulgarity demeaning women to describe Harris as a ‘communist’ Elon Musk’s super political action committee created an ad attacking Vice President Kamala Harris that includes multiple references to a vulgarity often used to demean women before calling her a 'communist.' The 35-second video from America PAC begins with a warning that it 'contains multiple instances of the C-word.' Calling Harris 'a big ole C-word,' a narrator describes the Democratic nominee as a 'tax-hiking, regulation-loving, gun-grabbing communist,' over images of her, as well as an illustration of a cat in a Soviet-style military uniform. Musk endorsed Trump earlier this year and has appeared both at his rallies and at his own pro-Trump events throughout the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Both Musk and Trump have repeatedly referenced Harris as 'Comrade Kamala,' implying that as president she would seek to implement socialist policies in the U.S. The post is getting attention as Trump and his allies use increasingly inflammatory language in the final stretch of the campaign. Trump has repeatedly ridiculed Harris, at one point calling her 'mentally impaired.' He has referred to CNN’s Anderson Cooper with a woman’s name, evoking the trope of gay men as effeminate. A Trump rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday featured multiple crude and racist jokes, including one from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe who called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' A spokesperson for the PAC declined to comment on the video. Puerto Rico’s archbishop calls on Trump to disavow comedian’s rally comments SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The archbishop of Puerto Rico, Roberto O. González Nieves, has joined a long list of Puerto Ricans decrying the comments a comedian made at a Donald Trump rally on Sunday that disparaged the island. González said in a letter that he was 'dismayed and appalled' after hearing Tony Hinchcliffe say, 'I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.' González called on Trump to disavow the comments, saying it was insufficient that his campaign issued a brief apology. 'It is important that you, personally, apologize for these comments,' González wrote. The archbishop said that while he enjoys a good joke, humor has its limits. 'It should not insult or denigrate the dignity and sacredness of people,' he wrote. 'These kinds of remarks should not be a part of the political discourse of a civilized society.' Trump’s event at Mar-a-Lago has gotten underway with operatic and Broadway musical selections Dozens of supporters, many clad in pro-Trump gear, stood near their seats and craned their necks to see if the GOP nominee and former president were about to enter an ornate Mar-a-Lago room set up for his remarks. Several American flags and a screen with the words, 'TRUMP WILL FIX IT!' were set up along the platform from which Trump was expected to speak. ‘We have to forgive and let it go,’ Trump supporter says Madison Square Garden rally remarks A supporter of Trump who attended his event at Mar-a-Lago and heads the Republican Latino Club of Palm Beach said in Spanish it was important to clarify that the former president was not the one who made the crude comments about Puerto Rico. 'He is a comedian. He tries to be funny and says a lot of nonsense. The man is dumb. He has no clue about Puerto Rico and doesn’t know our culture. He screwed up. We have to forgive and let it go,' said Lydia Maldonado, who is Puerto Rican. 'Our economy needs a change. Enough of this.' The Allentown School District is closed ahead of Trump’s Pennsylvania visit The district said in a statement that schools will be closed 'out of an abundance of caution' since the rally is 'expected to bring large crowds, heavy traffic and potential disruptions that may impact the safety and security of our students and staff.' Trump is due to speak at the PPL Center in downtown Allentown at 7 p.m. ET. Podcast host Joe Rogan polls listeners on a potential interview with Harris In a post on the social platform X, Rogan says the Democrat’s campaign offered a date for Tuesday for an hourlong conversation, but that he would have had to meet her on the road. Rogan said he feels strongly that the conversation is best when done in his studio in Austin, Texas. He headlined the post: '!! Austin TX podcast or let her walk. Thoughts?' Asked for comment, a Harris campaign official said they were willing to sit down with Rogan when Harris was in Texas last week, but Rogan couldn’t accommodate. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign’s internal deliberations, said Rogan was offered the option of joining Harris on the road but that Rogan has insisted that the conversation be taped in Austin. Trump sat down with Rogan for three hours last Friday in Texas. Harris aide says Washington speech will focus on the ‘clear choice voters are facing this election’ Vice President Kamala Harris, who spent years working as a prosecutor, has spent her campaign for president laying out the case to voters for why she should be elected, a top aide said Tuesday. Cedric Richmond says over the past three months Harris has given her opening statement and laid out evidence and the facts for voters. On Tuesday, she’ll deliver a speech meant to sum it all up. 'She’ll make her closing argument directly to the American people — or the jury — and that’s who’s going to decide the outcome of this election,' he said. 'And that’s how it should be.' Richmond says the speech will be about the 'clear choice voters are facing this election between Trump and his obsession with himself versus her new generation of leadership that is focused on the American people.' Harris to focus on what her generation of leadership ‘really means’ in Washington speech Vice President Kamala Harris chose the area near the White House and Washington Monument to speak on Tuesday because 'it’s a reminder of the gravity of the job,' her campaign chairwoman says. Campaign leader Jen O’Malley Dillon says the location, where Donald Trump helped incite a violent mob on Jan. 6, 2021, is a visual reminder of how much a president can do for good — or for ill. It’s a 'stark visualization of probably the most infamous example of Donald Trump and how he’s used his power for bad,' she said. But Harris won’t spend a lot of time rehashing the violence of that day or recounting Trump’s continued efforts to lie about the election and sow doubt over voting. O’Malley Dillon says Harris will focus on talking about what her generation of leadership 'really means,' and how much she will work to shape the country and impact people’s lives for the better. Harris to sit for interviews in Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and elsewhere on Tuesday Vice President Kamala Harris is doing five interviews Tuesday, including one with a Spanish-language radio in Pennsylvania aimed at Latino voters, in particular Puerto Ricans. The interviews come after a comic at Donald Trump’s rally on Sunday made racist and vile jokes that singled out Puerto Ricans among other groups. Trump did not denounce the racist jokes. But he claimed he didn’t know the comic who gave a live performance at the venue before the Republican nominee took the stage. Harris is also doing interviews in Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. That’s before she gives a speech in Washington later Tuesday where she’ll lay out her closing arguments. ‘I don’t know him,’ Trump says of comedian from New York rally without denouncing his remarks Donald Trump said he doesn’t know the comic who made racist and vile jokes at his big Madison Square Garden rally. But he’s not denouncing the comments either. 'I don’t know him, someone put him up there. I don’t know who he is,' Trump told ABC News in an interview Tuesday ahead of his remarks at Mar-a-Lago, according to the network. The comedian, Tony Hinchcliffe, had told a series of raunchy and crude jokes, including calling Puerto Rico an 'island of floating garbage.' The comments have drawn outrage from Puerto Rican leaders with just a week to go before the election. In the interview, Trump also insisted he hadn’t heard Hinchcliffe’s comments, according to ABC. But, 'When asked what he made of them, he did not take the opportunity to denounce them, repeating that he didn’t hear the comments.' Trump supporters are gathering near the entrance of Mar-a-Lago’s main ballroom The former president has arrived at his private club and residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He is set to meet with reporters at 10 a.m. ET. It is unclear whether the Republican will take questions. Harris calls Los Angeles Times and Washington Post decisions not to endorse in the presidential race ‘disappointing’ The Democratic presidential nominee commented during an interview with Charlamagne tha God, DJ Envy, and Loren LoRosa for 'The Breakfast Club' that aired Tuesday morning. Both newspapers announced last week that they will not make endorsements in the presidential contest between Harris and Republican Donald Trump. Harris sought to tie the decisions to billionaires in 'Donald Trump’s club.' Both publications are owned by wealthy executives, Jeff Bezos at the Post and Patrick Soon-Shiong at the Times. Arab American voters make their choice — Harris, Trump or neither — in the election’s final days DEARBORN, Mich. — Bowls of labneh and platters of za’atar bread covered the tables in a Lebanese restaurant near Detroit, yet no one seemed to have much of an appetite. On one side were Kamala Harris ’ top emissaries to the Arab American community. On the other were local leaders who were explaining — once again — why many in the community couldn’t vote for the vice president because of the war in Gaza. 'I love this country, but I’ll tell you, we have never been so disappointed in this country as we are now,' said Nabih H. Ayad, chairman of the Arab American Civil Rights League. 'We wanted to give the Democratic Party the opportunity to do something, and they haven’t.' 'The one line we can’t cross,' Ayad said, 'is genocide.' ▶ Read more on what Arab Americans are saying about the election GOP works to turn out pro-Trump Jewish voters in swing states to trim Democrats’ edge WEST BLOOMFIELD, Mich. — Rachel Weinberg calls herself a religious Jew first, then a proud American. She said she has only one choice for president: Donald Trump. 'I don’t like everything he says,' the 72-year-old retired preschool teacher from Michigan said after volunteer canvassers for the Republican Jewish Coalition knocked on her door Sunday. 'But I vote for Israel. It is our life. I support Israel. Trump supports Israel with his mouth and his actions.' Weinberg’s home in West Bloomfield, in vote-rich Oakland County, was among more than 20 that the Republican Jewish Coalition was visiting that morning. She has voted for Trump in previous elections as well. The door-to-door outreach to Jewish voters with a history of backing Republicans is part of a new effort the group is undertaking this year in five presidential battleground states in hopes of boosting Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election. ▶ Read more about Republicans' outreach to Jewish voters	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-election-2024-4d54837e83d91f1d200f56a6948a96b8	2024-10-29T05:12:01-07:00	
Care for a sweet treat during Mexico's Day of the Dead? Have a bite of 'pan de muerto'	MEXICO CITY (AP) — The first bite is an assault to the senses. A sugary, citric, fluffy delight. 'Pan de muerto' or 'bread of the dead' is baked in Mexico every year, from early October to mid-November, amid Day of the Dead celebrations. Shaped like a bun, decorated with bone-like bread pieces and sugar on top, pan de muerto can be seen at coffee shops, dinner tables or home-made altars, which Mexicans build to remember their deceased loved ones and welcome them back for a night on Nov. 2. Its date of origin can’t be specified, but pan de muerto can be thought of as a fusion of Mesoamerican and Spanish traditions, said Andrés Medina, a researcher at the Anthropological Research Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Mexicans have remembered the dead with festivities and food for centuries Since pre-Hispanic times, festivities for the dead have existed and skull-shaped products have been made. But in the 1500s, when the Spaniards arrived, new elements such as sugar and bread were incorporated into Indigenous offerings. Those early celebrations, Medina said, coincided with the crop season, which provides pan de muerto a spiritual, symbolic meaning. If its decorations resemble bones, it’s because Mesoamerican worldviews regarded them as the origin of life. According to an ancient myth, Quetzalcóatl created humankind out of bones. Details vary from one source to another, but soon after the god apparently stole them from the underworld, he fell. And from his blood, the seed of life was born. 'Under this worldview, the human body’s bones, just like the fruit’s insides, are seeds,' Medina said. 'So, in a way, altars are offerings to fertility. And Day of the Dead is a celebration of the life contained in each seed.' Pan de muerto’s shape, ingredients and preparations differ from one Mexican state to another, but is enjoyed all over the country. 100 and counting: One man’s quest to try every variation of 'pan de muerto' In Mexico City, hundreds of bakeries make their own version. Rodrigo Delgado has spent years trying to taste them all. For fun, he challenges himself to try as many as possible and review them on his Instagram account. On his first quest, a decade ago, he tried 15. In 2023, he had a bite of 100. This year, he expects to taste at least 110. 'I like pan de muerto because of what it means during Day of the Dead season,' said Delgado, who also reviews local restaurants on his blog, Godínez Gourmet. 'The mix of flavors of the bread, as much as its texture, are very comforting.' He can’t remember the first time he tried pan de muerto, but he treasures the memories of his mother baking it at home. He and his brother used to knead the dough, he said, and shape the bone-like decorations of its top. Baking pan de muerto is not an easy task. At Panadería Dos Veinte, in Mexico City's San Rafael neighborhood, owner Manu Tovar said that having these sweet buns ready for sale takes three days of work: one to extract the infusions that will provide the bread with its flavor, another to incorporate them into the dough and one more day to knead and shape the buns. There’s no secret in his recipe, Tovar said. The ingredients — although seasonal — are simple: orange blossom, tangerine zest, anise and butter. His special touch, what makes his bread unique, is the sourdough. 'It’s an ancestral process,' Tovar said. 'A millenary way to make bread.' The sourdough that he and four assistants use is 20 years old. He incorporates water and flour daily, to keep it alive, and mixes part of it with new dough. This gives the bread a better taste, he said, and makes it easier to digest. Pan de muertos' seasonal flavors help make it special For years, said Tovar, he resisted the temptation of baking pan de muerto in early October. The quality of the ingredients improves as November gets closer, but customers kept asking when the buns would be ready, so he caved. This season, aside from baking 90 pan de muertos per day, he came up with two new creations: a croissant roll filled with marigold cream and a bun — locally known as 'concha' — shaped like a marigold flower and prepared with tangerine instead of vanilla or chocolate. 'If you bake it in a traditional way, you can only have pan de muerto now, because that’s when the fruit is available,' Tovar said. 'That’s what I think makes it so special.' The ambience of the Day of the Dead season, he added, also plays a role. Nightfall comes earlier during this time of year and there’s certain mysticism, a particular feeling in the air. 'It probably has to do with the melancholy of what this festivity means,' he said. 'For one day a year, you can feel closer to those who are no longer with you.' ____ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Duterte’s jarring testimony into drug killings in Philippines relives a nightmare for many	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The cockiness, expletives and threats unleashed by former President Rodrigo Duterte in a Senate inquiry brought back the nightmare of the bloody 'war on drugs' for many families of the thousands of victims who were gunned down under his rule. Speaking under oath in Monday's televised hearing into the killings, a defiantly combative Duterte returned to the national spotlight for the first time since leaving office in 2022 with little show of remorse. He got away with it again, critics say. 'If I’m given another chance, I’ll wipe all of you,' Duterte, 79, who is seeking a new term as mayor of his southern home city of Davao next year, said of drug dealers and criminals. Duterte again denied that he authorized extrajudicial killings of drug suspects, saying there were no 'state-sponsored killings.' But he acknowledged that as mayor of Davao, before becoming president, he kept a small ' death squad ' of gangsters whom he had ordered to eliminate other criminals. Duterte's profanity-laced outbursts scared Randy delos Santos, who was invited by the Senate to speak about the killing of his nephew, Kian, by police under Duterte’s 'war on drugs.' It felt, he said, like a nightmare had returned. 'I had this frightening feeling that thousands of innocent people may be gunned down again,' delos Santos told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'I was wondering why he was allowed to speak with disrespect and given a stage to vent his past excuses.' Duterte has upended politics in Philippines The thousands of killings — which human rights groups estimate could exceed 20,000 — under Duterte's administration 2016-2022 were unprecedented in recent Philippine history and triggered an International Criminal Court investigation as a possible crime against humanity. They have also become a delicate fault line in the increasingly hostile rivalry between Duterte and his children, including Vice President Sara Duterte, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. They had a bitter political fallout over key issues. While Duterte had nurtured cozy ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Marcos has broadened defense and military relations with the United States and its Western allies. 'It’s unfortunate that drug-related crimes are on the rise again. Everyday you can read about children being raped, people getting killed and robbed and just recently a drug den was raided within the Malacanang complex,' Duterte said, referring to the presidential palace in Manila. 'Purveyors of this menace are back in business.' Duterte has previously accused Marcos of being a drug addict and weak leader. Marcos had retorted that Duterte was a user of fentanyl, a painkiller and powerful opioid. Looking frail and misstating his age as 73 at one point, the daylong Senate hearing also served as the latest reality check on the political restraints that Duterte and his family face after he relinquished his grip on power. Duterte was one of Asia’s most unorthodox leaders and carved a controversial political name for his deadly campaign against criminality, expletives-laced outbursts and disdain for human rights and the West. He once called the pope a 'son of a bitch' for setting off a monstrous traffic jam during a Manila visit and told then-President Barack Obama to 'go to hell' for criticizing his brutal anti-drugs crackdown. Duterte’s profanities became a trademark of his political persona and some regarded him as Asia’s Trump. During a heated exchange on Monday, Duterte raised his voice at Sen. Risa Hontiveros, a staunch human rights activist, who said that his campaign had killed 122 children, including a baby. Hontiveros asked the chairman overseeing the hearing to restrain the increasingly volatile Duterte, who rambled on as she spoke. He later stopped and apologized. 'You’re trying to pin me down on semantics,' Duterte blurted out at Hontiveros, who shot back: 'You’re pinned by your own words.' 'You were never a mayor, prosecutor … I was a prosecutor, mayor, president and I know my job. You should talk like, `Son of a bitch, you stop, or I will kill you,’' Duterte told the senators. The killings left deep scars A Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Flavie Villanueva, showed during the hearing a list of more than 300 victims, many of them breadwinners of poor families, who were killed under Duterte’s crackdown. A roll of white paper with the victims’ names that the priest unfurled was so long it touched the carpeted floor. Former Sen. Leila de Lima, one of the most vocal critics of Duterte who was arrested and detained for years during his presidency, confronted him during the hearing. The drug charges against her, she said, were fabricated by Duterte and his officials to stop her investigation of the drug killings. She was cleared of the charges and freed last year. 'This man … for so long has evaded justice and accountability,' de Lima said of Duterte, who sat near her. Sen. Jinggoy Estrada asked why de Lima failed to file any criminal complaint against Duterte for so long. Witnesses against Duterte, she said, were afraid to come out during his presidency when larges-cale killings were unfolding. 'There was an atmosphere of fear, a culture of fear and impunity,' she said. 'I hope many more will come out now.'	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-duterte-drug-killings-testimony-448d440e057506e5a9cbe615372ccd45	2024-10-29T02:18:09-07:00	
Germany recalls ambassador from Iran as it protests the execution of an Iranian German prisoner	BERLIN (AP) — Germany protested to Iran on Tuesday over the execution of Iranian German prisoner Jamshid Sharmahd, who lived in the U.S. and was kidnapped in Dubai in 2020 by Iranian security forces, and recalled its ambassador to Berlin for consultations. The Foreign Ministry wrote on the social network X that Iran's charge d'affaires in Berlin was summoned to hear 'our sharp protest' against Tehran's action and added that it reserves the right to take 'further measures.' It didn't elaborate. At the same time, German Ambassador Markus Potzel 'protested in the strongest terms against the murder of Jamshid Sharmahd' to the Iranian foreign minister, it said. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock then recalled him to Berlin for consultations. Sharmahd, 69, was put to death in Iran on Monday on terrorism charges, the country’s judiciary said. That followed a 2023 trial that Germany, the U.S. and international rights groups dismissed as a sham. He was one of several Iranian dissidents abroad in recent years either tricked or kidnapped back to Iran as Tehran began lashing out after the collapse of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers including Germany. Iran accused Sharmahd, who lived in Glendora, California, of planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people — including five women and a child — and wounded over 200 others, as well as plotting other assaults through the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing. Iran also accused Sharmahd of 'disclosing classified information' on missile sites of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard during a television program in 2017. His family disputed the allegations and had worked for years to see him freed. Sharmahd had been in Dubai in 2020, trying to travel to India for a business deal involving his software company. He hoped to get a connecting flight despite the coronavirus pandemic disrupting global travel. Sharmahd’s family received their last message from him on July 28, 2020. It’s unclear how the abduction happened. But tracking data showed that Sharmahd’s mobile phone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman. On July 30, tracking data showed the mobile phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped. Two days later, Iran announced it had captured Sharmahd in a 'complex operation.' The Intelligence Ministry published a photograph of him blindfolded. Germany expelled two Iranian diplomats in 2023 over Sharmahd’s death sentence.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-iran-sharmahd-execution-protest-ambassador-ac9afe1d2b1a5949f0b578c69763a6b8	2024-10-29T01:53:46-07:00	
Russia's embassy in Pakistan says it is verifying reports that one of its citizens was abducted	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Russia's embassy in Pakistan said Tuesday it is attempting to verify reports that one of its citizens was abducted in the South Asian nation's troubled northwest. The embassy provided no further details in a post on the social media platform X. The announcement by the embassy came days after a small militant group headed by commander Gul Bahadur said it captured a Russian national in Dera Ismail Khan, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The group released a photo showing a man sitting with two bearded men. Local police said they have not been approached by the Russian Embassy about the reported abduction. Insurgents often attack Pakistani security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese working on Chinese-funded projects across the country, but Russians have not previously been targeted. Most Russians who travel to Pakistan are climbers who scale mountains in the scenic north.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-russia-abduction-northwest-f5900ab5b0bdca5889af0af5d88b89c2	2024-10-29T01:31:57-07:00	
Russia strikes Ukraine's 2 biggest cities in its latest barrage, officials say	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian drones, missiles and bombs smashed into Kyiv and Kharkiv, Ukraine’s biggest cities, in nighttime attacks, killing four people and wounding 15 in a continuing aerial onslaught, authorities said Tuesday. Russia has bombarded civilian areas of Ukraine almost daily since its full-scale invasion of its neighbor almost three years ago, causing thousands of casualties. The Russian army is also pushing hard against front-line defenses in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine. In another worrying development for Kyiv officials, Western countries say North Korea has sent some 10,000 soldiers to help Russia’s military campaign. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was expected to speak about that new threat at a meeting Tuesday in Reykjavik with the leaders of Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden. A Russian aerial attack struck Kharkiv, in Ukraine’s northeast, at around 3 a.m., hitting a house and killing four people, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Nearly 20 houses were damaged in the attack, he said. Several hours earlier, Russia dropped a glide bomb on the landmark Derzhprom building in Kharkiv city center, injuring seven people, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Derzhprom, also known as the Palace of Industry, is included in UNESCO’s World Heritage List as an example of modernist architecture. Terekhov said that Russia has concentrated attacks on Kharkiv in recent days. He urged people not to ignore air raid warnings. Authorities in Kyiv said debris from intercepted Russian drones fell on two city districts, injuring six people. Ukraine has also used long-range drones to disrupt Russia’s war machine and embarrass the Kremlin by striking targets on Russian soil. A special forces academy in the Russian province of Chechnya was hit by drones, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished, according to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who is close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was the first drone attack of the war on Chechnya, which lies about 800 kilometers (500 miles) east of Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-attacks-zelenskyy-north-korea-1b327a2d85d4ce9faf321dd27992f568	2024-10-29T01:27:18-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: River and air pollution in India's capital pose a severe health threat to residents	NEW DELHI (AP) — One of India’s most sacred rivers, the Yamuna in New Delhi, is covered with white toxic foam, with vast sections frothing as a result of pollutants discharged from industries around the city. The pollution poses a severe health threat to residents since the river provides more than half of the Indian capital's water. New Delhi also has some of the world’s most polluted air every year, and the current festival season is exacerbating the situation. On Tuesday, the air-quality index deteriorated to 'a very poor' reading of 273, 18 times more than the World Health Organization’s quality guidelines. The tiny PM 2.5 particulate matter can enter deep into the lungs and cause diseases. Still, Hindu devotees have not given up their religious practices at the Yamuna. On Tuesday morning, a young couple was among a group that visited the river bank, had a dip, and then left. Jasraj, a 70-year-old retired government clerk, said he has been visiting the river for a bathing ritual since 1980. 'I worship the river as a mother, and there is no question of its being clean or dirty. It's dirty on the surface but clean below the top,' said Jasraj, who uses one name. Imran Khan, a student, said one can't breathe properly in Delhi's polluted air. 'People are here for jogging, and they are facing problems, too. Our environment should be cleaner,' he said. Shishupal Kumar, a contract worker, said people visit the river from far-off places to perform religious rituals. 'The river has become completely dirty. It is full of chemicals. It looks like snowfall has happened here, like it happens on mountains,' Kumar said. The 1,376-kilometer (855-mile) Yamuna is one of the holiest rivers for Hindus. It is also among the most polluted in the world. Dangerously unhealthy waterways are a concern for many, especially with pollution expected to worsen during the upcoming Chhath Puja, a Hindu festival. The river has become dirtier over the years as sewage, farm pesticides and industrial effluents flow into the waterway despite laws against polluting and authorities setting up dozens of sewage treatment plants. The New Delhi government said officials were using defoamers to tackle the problem. Authorities have deployed dozens of motorboats to disperse the toxic foam and erected bamboo barricades to keep people away from the river banks. The officials worry that thousands of Hindu devotees next month will stand knee-deep in its frothy, toxic waters, sometimes even immersing themselves in a holy dip to mark Chhath Puja. Winters, in particular, have become a time of health woes in India’s capital, which is home to more than 20 million people. The city during winter is covered with a toxic haze that obscures the sky. Pollution levels soar as millions of Hindus celebrate 'Diwali,' the festival of light, amid emissions from massive firecrackers. Diwali will be celebrated on Thursday. Farmers in neighboring agricultural regions also set fire to their land after harvests to clear it for the next crop season. India's Supreme Court earlier this month slammed northern Indian states for not taking stricter action against people burning crop residues ahead of the winter season and aggravating the region's air pollution. Authorities each year shut construction sites, restrict diesel-run vehicles and deploy water sprinklers and anti-smog guns to control the haze and smog enveloping the skyline of the capital region. ___ Videojournalist Piyush Nagpal contributed to this report from New Delhi.	https://apnews.com/article/india-river-air-pollution-6c0a891de6fd1ce35c5689831b9220bc	2024-10-29T00:56:25-07:00	
Middle East latest: Hezbollah chooses new leader and vows to continue 'until victory'	Lebanon’s Hezbollah has chosen Sheikh Naim Kassem to succeed longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month, as the militant group vowed Tuesday to continue 'until victory is achieved.' Kassem, 71, who had been Nasrallah’s deputy leader for over three decades, was elected the new secretary-general of Hezbollah by its decision-making Shura Council, the group said in a statement. Lebanon’s Health Ministry reported that more than 2,700 people had been killed and nearly 12,600 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of October. The death toll from more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has passed 43,000, Palestinian officials reported Monday, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli strikes in the Lebanese city of Sidon kill at least one person, state media says BEIRUT — At least one person was killed by two Israeli strikes in Sidon in south Lebanon, marking the second such attack on the historic coastal city since the recent escalation between Hezbollah and Israel, Lebanese state media reported. According to the National News Agency, the strikes hit an area housing displaced people that was adjacent to a Hezbollah complex called Sayyed Shohada, located a few hundred meters from a Lebanese army barracks. Four other people were wounded in the strike. The intended target of the strikes remains unclear and the number of casualties is expected to rise. Earlier Tuesday, the Israeli military had issued evacuation orders for 16 villages in South Lebanon, instructing residents to move north of the Awali River; however there was no warning issued prior to the strikes in Sidon. Rights group criticizes Israeli law to restrict UN agency's aid efforts to Palestinians JERUSALEM – Rights group Amnesty International slammed the Israeli parliament’s decision to restrict operations of the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees. 'This unconscionable law is an outright attack on the rights of Palestinian refugees. It is clearly designed to make it impossible for the agency to operate in the occupied Palestinian territory,' Amnesty's secretary-general, Agnès Callamard, said. 'It amounts to the criminalization of humanitarian aid and will worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis.' Callamard said UNRWA plays an indispensable role in providing food, water, medical services, shelter and education in Gaza. She urged the international community to condemn the legislation and press for its repeal. 'This appalling, inhumane law will only exacerbate the suffering of Palestinians, who have endured unimaginable hardship since the horrific attacks by Hamas and other armed groups in southern Israel one year ago, and whose need for global support is greater than ever,' she said. UN agencies warn that Israel's ban on UNRWA would leave big gaps in support for Palestinians GENEVA — Multiple United Nations agencies rallied Tuesday around their fellow organization that provides aid to Palestinian refugees after Israel’s parliament took steps to ban it in the coming months. The World Food Program is deeply concerned about the restrictions, spokeswoman Abeer Etefa said Tuesday when asked whether the WFP might take up the work of UNRWA. 'The World Food Program’s mandate is to deliver food assistance to people in need,' she said. 'WFP cannot replace the equally important critical functions of UNRWA in Gaza, including the running of shelters and health clinics.' Spokesman Tarik Jasarevic of the World Health Organization said 3,000 of UNRWA’s roughly 13,000 staff are health workers. Those health staff have provided more than 6 million medical consultations from its centers over the last year. Activities include immunizations, disease surveillance, and screening for malnutrition, and UNRWA’s work 'couldn’t be matched by any agency — including WHO.' Spokespeople from U.N. agencies for children, health and migration were among those who stressed that UNRWA is the 'backbone' of the world body’s operations in Gaza, Jeremy Laurence, spokesman for the U.N. human rights office, said that 'without UNRWA, the delivery of food, shelter, health care, education, amongst other things, to most of Gaza’s population would grind to a halt.' 'Civilians have already paid the heaviest price of this conflict over the past year,' he said. 'Cruelly, this decision will only make matters worse for them' Hezbollah-Israel conflict threatens Lebanon's fragile economy, report says BEIRUT — Analysis from a humanitarian group working in Lebanon forecasts two scenarios in its report on the Hezbollah-Israel conflict, both predicting a severe economic contraction in Lebanon by early 2025. Mercy Corps’ Lebanon Crisis Analysis Team says Israel’s continued strikes on suspected Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, without blocking key infrastructure, will still bring severe economic and humanitarian risks. Lebanon’s economy could contract by 12.81% , or $2.305 billion by January 2025, with impacts hitting agriculture, manufacturing, and services hard in the South and Bekaa Valley. Agriculture in South Lebanon, which drives 80% of its economy, may come to a halt, while factories face shutdowns, the report says. 'The Bekaa Valley, responsible for 2% of national GDP, will see similar disruptions, with 70% of farmland under threat and many Syrian laborers fleeing,' it adds. The service sector, particularly tourism, stands to lose $1.256 billion, potentially crippling a vital part of the economy. If Israel imposes a stricter blockade and expands bombings to key infrastructure, Lebanon’s economic loss could rise to 21.9% of GDP, or $3.938 billion, according to the report. Over 1.5 million people could be displaced, with political and intercommunal tensions intensifying as Shia Muslims flee to diverse religious regions that are majority Christian, Druze or Sunni Muslim, the report adds. Already, 1.2 million people have been displaced from villages in southern and eastern Lebanon as well as Beirut’s southern suburbs. Lebanon, already enduring a five-year economic crisis marked by a severe currency collapse, had just begun showing signs of recovery before the war erupted. France says Israel's UNRWA ban will have serious consequences for Gaza PARIS — France 'deeply deplores' the adoption by the Israeli Parliament of two bills aimed at banning the activities of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees on Israeli soil, the French foreign ministry said. 'The implementation of these bills would have very serious consequences on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which is already catastrophic, but also throughout the occupied Palestinian territories, depriving hundreds of thousands of civilians of essential aid in terms of shelter, care, education and food,' the statement said. France 'reaffirms its support to UNRWA' and will continue to 'ensure that the reforms needed' to ensure its neutrality are implemented, the French foreign ministry said. Austrian soldiers in UN Lebanon force are lightly injured by missile strike VIENNA — Eight Austrian soldiers serving in the U.N. force in Lebanon were lightly injured in a missile strike at the Naqoura camp on Tuesday, Austrian authorities said. Defense Ministry spokesperson Michael Bauer wrote on social network X that the incident happened Tuesday lunchtime. He said it wasn’t immediately clear who was responsible for the strike. The injuries were 'light and superficial scrapes,' Bauer said. UNIFIL said in a statement that the rocket that hit its headquarters in Naqoura this afternoon was fired from the north, 'likely by Hezbollah or an affiliated group.' 'Peacekeepers were not in bunkers at the time. While some peacekeepers suffered minor injuries, fortunately, no one was seriously injured,' the statement added. UNIFIL spokesperson Dany Ghafary confirmed to the Associated Press that it was the same episode that injured eight Austrian U.N. peacekeepers. 'We have opened an investigation into the incident. We remind Hezbollah and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property,' the statement said. 4 Israeli soldiers killed in northern Gaza, military says TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said that four soldiers were killed Tuesday in battle in the northern Gaza Strip. The military did not disclose the exact circumstances behind the deaths. Israel has refocused its offensive in Gaza on the territory’s hard-hit north, which was an early target of the war. Soldiers have been conducting raids and strikes to target what the military says are pockets of militancy. More than 360 soldiers have been killed since Israel launched its ground invasion in Gaza last year in response to Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel. Foreign ministers of Cyprus and Luxembourg say UNRWA is ‘indispensable’ NICOSIA, Cyprus — The foreign ministers of Cyprus and Luxembourg say the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees is 'indispensable' to providing food, education and health care to Palestinians and that the international community must do whatever it can to enable the agency to continue its work. Cyprus’ top diplomat Constantinos Kombos said after talks with his Luxembourgian counterpart Xavier Bettel on Tuesday that the work of UNRWA is 'extremely valuable' throughout the Middle East, calling its delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza 'imperative.' Bettel said 'there is no alternative' to UNWRA’s work to help people in Palestine because without the agency, 'there is no education, there is no health, there is no food.' The diplomats made the remarks after the Israeli parliament on Monday passed two laws that could prevent UNRWA from being able to continue its work. The laws ban the agency from operating and cut all ties between it and the Israeli government. Bettel said his country would continue to support UNWRA and would raise the issue in his meetings with his Israeli counterpart and the president of the Israeli parliament when he visits Israel later Tuesday. He will also meet with the Palestinian prime minister and UNWRA officials. UNICEF spokesman sharply criticizes Israeli parliament's move to ban UNRWA GENEVA — A UNICEF spokesman says the move by Israeli’s parliament to ban the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees 'means that a new way has been found to kill children.' James Elder says an inability for the refugee agency, UNRWA, to operate 'would likely see the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza' and the U.N. children’s agency 'would become effectively unable to distribute lifesaving supplies.' He said that would impede deliveries of vaccines, winter clothes, hygiene kits, health kits, water, and ready-to-use therapeutic food to combat malnutrition. Elder said a decision like the one by the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, 'suddenly means that a new way has been found to kill children.' IOM head says the migration agency unable to fill a gap left by UNRWA GENEVA — The director-general of the International Organization for Migration, Amy Pope, said that the United Nations body is not capable of fully filling a gap left by UNRWA, which she described as 'absolutely essential.' 'They provide, education. They provide health care. They provide some of the most basic needs, for people who have been living there for decades,' Pope said of UNRWA. 'That’s not something that IOM does what IOM does well.' She said IOM is able to assist with ongoing humanitarian support, such as offering help to displaced people and providing shelter and hygiene kits. 'There’s no way for IOM to step in to do what UNRWA has done. UNRWA is absolutely essential to the people of Gaza, and I don’t want to leave anyone with the misimpression that IOM can play that role, because we cannot,' she said. Projectile launched from Lebanon kills 1 in northern Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli authorities said Tuesday one person was killed after a projectile launched from Lebanon slammed into a northern city. The Israeli military said about 50 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel. It said some of the launches were intercepted by Israel’s aerial defense system and others fell in the area. Israeli police said they received a number of reports of fallen projectiles, which caused damage to property, in the city of Maalot-Tarshiha. The Israeli rescue service Magen David Adom said a man was killed in the strike. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it fired rockets toward the area. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israel since Oct. 8, 2023, when it began attacking Israel in solidarity with Hamas a day after its cross-border attack. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has intensified in recent weeks after Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon. Turkey slams Israeli decision to ban UNRWA activity violates international law ISTANBUL — Turkey’s Foreign Ministry called Israel’s decision to ban the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East a 'clear violation of international law.' In a statement Tuesday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said the move undermines efforts toward a two-state solution and obstructs the right of return for Palestinian refugees. 'By targeting UNRWA, Israel aims to eliminate the two-state solution and prevent the return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland,' the statement read. Israel accuses the agency of turning a blind eye to staff members it says belong to Hamas, divert aid and use UNRWA facilities for military purposes. Israel says around a dozen of the agency's 13,000 employees in Gaza participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The agency denies it knowingly aids armed groups and says it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants among its staff. The agency is the major distributor of aid in Gaza and provides education, health and other basic services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region, including in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. 'It is the legal and moral obligation of the international community to take a strong stance against attempts to ban the activities of UNRWA,' the ministry added, noting that the agency was created by a U.N. General Assembly resolution. Turkey, which currently chairs the UNRWA’s Working Group on Financing, pledged to continue its support for the agency. British charity Christian Aid criticizes Israeli parliament's move to restrict UNRWA's work JERUSALEM — Christian Aid, a British charity, criticized the Israeli parliamentary decision to restrict the work of UNRWA. 'Severing this lifeline in Gaza as winter threatens to exacerbate an already desperate situation is cruel and dangerous,' the group’s Middle East head, William Bell, said in a statement Tuesday. Israeli lawmakers passed two laws Monday that could threaten the work of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees. UNRWA is the largest aid provider in Gaza, but the laws would sever Israel’s ties with the agency and bar it from operating on Israeli soil, raising concerns about whether it could continue to provide basic services in both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Bell alleged that the move is part of Israel’s 'ongoing challenge to the eligibility of Palestinian refugees to claim the right of return' in Israel and occupied Palestinian territories. 'Once again international leaders have either been unable or unwilling to protect the most basic rights of Palestinians, including their existence as a sovereign people,' he said. Lebanon’s Hezbollah says it has chosen Naim Kassem to replace slain leader Hassan Nasrallah BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group says it has chosen Naim Kassem to replace its slain leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in September in an Israeli airstrike. Kassem, a longtime deputy to Nasrallah, has served as the militant group’s acting leader since Nasrallah’s death. His appointment to replace Nasrallah was announced Tuesday. Dozens are killed or wounded in an Israeli strike on a building housing displaced Palestinians in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike on a five-story building where displaced Palestinians were sheltering in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 60 people early Tuesday, according to health officials. Dr. Marwan al-Hams, director of the field hospitals’ department at the Gaza Health Ministry, announced the toll from Tuesday’s strike in the northern town of Beit Lahiya at a news conference. He says another 17 people are missing. The ministry’s emergency service says the dead include at least 12 women and 20 children, including babies. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been waging a large-scale operation in northern Gaza for more than three weeks, targeting what it says are pockets of Hamas militants who have regrouped there. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, said it was overwhelmed by the wave of wounded people from the strike. Israeli forces raided the medical facility over the weekend, detaining dozens of medics. Israel says it detained scores of Hamas militants in the raid. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months, saying it carried out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tried to avoid harming civilians. The strikes have often killed women and children. United Nations chief warns Israel against barring UNRWA from its work UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations chief is warning that if two laws adopted by Israel’s parliament are implemented, the U.N. agency providing essential services to Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the West Bank would likely be prevented from continuing work that is mandated by the U.N. General Assembly. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the work of the agency known as UNRWA 'indispensable,' and said implementing the laws 'could have devastating consequences for Palestinian refugees in the occupied Palestinian territories, which is unacceptable.' 'There is no alternative to UNRWA,' he said in a statement issued Monday night. UNRWA was established by the General Assembly in 1949 to provide relief for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes before and during the 1948 war that followed Israel’s establishment, as well as their descendants. The laws adopted Monday by Israel’s parliament, which do not immediately go into effect, will sever ties with the agency and bar UNRWA from operating on Israeli soil. They were approved amid an escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, now in the second year of Israel’s military retaliation following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in southern Israel. Guterres called on Israel 'to act consistently with its obligations' under the U.N. Charter and international law, as well as the privileges and immunities of the United Nations. 'National legislation cannot alter those obligations,' Guterres stressed. He said implementing the laws would be detrimental to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and more broadly for peace and security in the region.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-29-october-2024-18bf8e25ae51c6e608346b0ef8b125c4	2024-10-29T00:47:35-07:00	
Hungary's Orbán boosts Georgia's ruling party over election despite an outcry the vote was rigged	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán gave a boost Tuesday to Georgia’s ruling party, saying its victory in a parliamentary election in the South Caucasus nation was free and democratic despite a massive opposition protest that denounced the vote as rigged and illegitimate. Orbán, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest partner in the European Union, is the first foreign leader to visit Georgia following Saturday's vote that the country's electoral commission said was won by the ruling Georgian Dream party. Georgia's president and opposition said the election was 'stolen' with the help of Russia, claiming there was widespread ballot fraud and violence, with the EU and the U.S. calling for a full investigation. But Orbán gave a different assessment after meeting with his counterpart, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, and congratulating him on the victory by his Georgian Dream party. 'I look at the debate that has erupted around the election, I read the evaluations of international organizations, and I see that no one dares to question that this election was a free and democratic choice,' Orbán said. People rallied outside parliament Monday night, demanding a new election under international supervision and an investigation into the alleged vote rigging. The protest underlined tensions in the country which lies between Russia and Turkey and where the Georgian Dream party has become increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. Orbán was booed after arriving at his hotel in Tbilisi on Monday evening. Protesters called him a 'political prostitute' and 'puppet' in Russian and Hungarian, using expletives to tell him to leave the country. Kobakhidze said Orbán's visit had 'particular significance' as it takes place during Hungary’s presidency of the Council of the European Union although the bloc said he doesn't have any mandate for the visit. Georgian Dream told voters it is committed to joining the EU despite the fact Brussels suspended Georgia’s membership process after the party adopted a Russian-style 'foreign influence law' in June that critics say curbs press freedom. Pursuit of EU membership and NATO is written into Georgia's constitution and many in the country of 3.7 million viewed Saturday’s vote as a pivotal referendum on the opportunity to join the bloc. Georgian Dream, established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, has adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. The party campaigned on joining Europe with 'dignity' — a principle Kobakhidze referenced Tuesday when he suggested Georgia and Hungary shared 'Christian values,' possibly alluding to similar laws passed in Hungary. Orbán said it was clear 'the opposition and the ruling party are committed to European integration,' rejecting opposition claims that Georgian Dream opposes it. 'While you are pursuing a pro-European policy, you have not allowed your country to become a second Ukraine,' Orbán said, urging Kobakhidze to ignore any criticism about the election. Orbán’s comments appeared to echo some of Georgian Dream’s campaign rhetoric that accused the opposition of trying to destabilize the country and hinted that Ukraine's fate could befall Georgia. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the election results, told The Associated Press on Monday that Georgia has fallen victim to Russian pressure against joining the EU. She said she hopes the West backs the opposition and protesters who are disputing the result of the election. 'We’ve seen that Russian propaganda was directly used,' said Zourabichvili, whose duties are mostly ceremonial president. A fierce critic of Georgian Dream, she said the government has been 'working hand-in-hand with Russia,' and 'probably' received help from Moscow’s security services. The Kremlin rejected accusations of interference. Zourabichvili said 'technology' was used to manipulate the vote and suggested some voter IDs were confiscated before the election from prisoners or people on welfare and used to vote 'up to 17 times.' Monday night's protest ended peacefully, with no clear plans for further actions from the president or opposition, and it was unclear who would investigate the alleged voting irregularities. 'There is no trust for the state to investigate these cases,' said Natia Seskuria, executive director of the Regional Institute for Security Studies in Tbilisi. 'The most immediate task that they have is to prove the elections were rigged,' she said, adding it will be difficult in a system which is 'largely run by the ruling party.' Civil society and opposition groups claim to have widespread evidence of violence, fraud and other voting irregularities but it is unclear how they will demonstrate it, Seskuria said. The Central Election Commission said Tuesday it was asked by opposition parties to provide a list of people who cast ballots. It declined, said CEC spokeswoman Natia Ioseliani, citing the risk of disclosing 'personal data,' which is 'one of the recognized fundamental principles of elections.' Accepting the election result would mean 'Georgia is lost for its people and Georgia is lost for Europe for the foreseeable future,' said Zaza Bibilashvili, founder of the Chavchavadze Center, a civil society organization. 'The stakes,' he said, 'are very high.' Zourabichvili urged the West not to abandon Georgia in the election's aftermath. Asked if she wants sanctions imposed on Georgian officials, Zourabichvili told AP that it’s up to Western leaders but that 'certainly time has not come to renew relations with authorities that are not legitimate.' EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged Georgian authorities to hold a 'transparent inquiry' and said the 'democratic backsliding in the country needs to be reversed.' In Washington, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Georgia's election environment was 'shaped by the ruling party’s policies, including misuse of public resources, vote-buying and voter intimidation.' 'We encourage Georgia’s governing officials to consider the relationship they want with the Euro-Atlantic community, rather than strengthening policies that are praised by authoritarians,' he said. The U.S. has consistently urged the Georgian government to 'walk back' its anti-democratic actions, he said, adding that 'we do not rule out further consequences,' although he did not elaborate. ___ Associated Press writer Sophiko Megrelidze in Tbilisi contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-russia-eu-protests-923b9523fb45d31d3fff655127a28c60	2024-10-29T00:15:37-07:00	
Boat carrying Egyptian migrants to Europe capsizes off Libyan coast, killing 12	CAIRO (AP) — A boat carrying 13 Egyptian migrants to Europe has capsized off Libya's coast, killing all on board except for one person, local authorities and a Libyan group said Tuesday. Al-Abreen, a group that provides humanitarian assistance to migrants in Libya, said on Facebook that the boat capsized 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of the city of Tobruk on Monday evening. One migrant survived, according to the group, which said the bodies were recovered and brought to shore. The Directorate for Combating Illegal Migration in Tobruk also confirmed the incident. In recent years, the North African nation has become the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. Last month, a migrant boat carrying 32 people capsized off the Libyan coast due to engine failure, leaving one person dead and 22 others missing, according to Libyan authorities. The coast guard in Tobruk said nine people were rescued. Al-Abreen said the boat was bound for Europe and was carrying migrants from Egypt and Syria. Human traffickers have long taken advantage of instability in Libya that escalated after a NATO-backed uprising overthrew and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Traffickers smuggle migrants on crammed, poorly equipped vessels on risky sea trips across the North African nation’s borders, which are shared with six countries. Last year, 962 migrants died and 1,563 went missing off Libya, the International Organization for Migration said. About 17,200 migrants were intercepted and sent back to Libya in 2023, the organization said.	https://apnews.com/article/libya-egyptian-migrants-boat-capsize-65a8574344deafdba6880e5461d165af	2024-10-28T23:53:20-07:00	
Israeli strike in northern Gaza kills at least 60, officials say, as Hezbollah announces new leader	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on a five-story building where displaced Palestinians were sheltering in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 60 people early Tuesday, more than half of them women and children, Gaza’s Health Ministry said. In a separate development, Lebanon's militant group Hezbollah said it has chosen Sheikh Naim Kassem as its new top leader following the killing of Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month. Israel also faced backlash from aid groups after its parliament passed legislation that could severely restrict the ability of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees to operate in the Palestinian territories. The agency, known as UNRWA, is the largest aid provider in Gaza. Hezbollah said in a statement that its decision-making Shura Council elected Kassem, who had been Nasrallah's deputy leader for over three decades, as the new secretary-general. Hezbollah vowed to continue with Nasrallah’s policies 'until victory is achieved.' Kassem, 71, a founding member of the militant group established following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, had been serving as acting leader after Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27. He has given several televised speeches vowing that Hezbollah will fight on despite a string of setbacks. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation, after Hamas’ surprise attack out of Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered the war there. Iran, which backs both groups, has also traded fire with Israel on two occasions. The tensions with Hezbollah boiled over last month, as Israel unleashed a wave of heavy airstrikes and killed Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon at the start of October. Strike in northern Gaza comes as Israel wages a major operation there Even as attention has shifted to Lebanon and Iran in recent weeks, Israel has continued to wage a large operation in northern Gaza and to carry out airstrikes across the territory. Dr. Marwan al-Hams, director of the field hospitals’ department at the Gaza Health Ministry, announced the toll from Tuesday’s strike in the northern town of Beit Lahiya at a news conference. He said another 17 people are missing. The ministry's emergency service said at least 12 women and 20 children were among the dead, including babies. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been waging the operation in northern Gaza for more than three weeks, targeting what it says are pockets of Hamas militants who have regrouped there. The dead included a mother and her five children, some of them adults, and a second mother with her six children, according to an initial casualty list provided by the emergency service. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, said it was overwhelmed by the wave of wounded people from the strike. Israeli forces raided the medical facility over the weekend, detaining dozens of medics. The army said it detained scores of Hamas militants. 'The healthcare system has completely collapsed,' Abu Safiya said in a voice message to journalists on Tuesday. He said people who arrive wounded are dying because there is no care for them. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months, saying it carried out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tried to avoid harming civilians. The strikes have often killed women and children. The military said it detained scores of Hamas militants in the raid on Kamal Adwan, the latest in a series of raids on hospitals since the start of the war. Israel's latest major operation in northern Gaza, focused on the Jabaliya refugee camp, has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes in another wave of mass displacement more than a year into the war in the tiny coastal territory. Israeli laws targeting UN agency could further restrict aid Israel has also sharply restricted aid to the north this month, prompting a warning from the United States that failure to facilitate greater aid efforts could lead to a reduction in military aid. Palestinians fear Israel is enacting a plan proposed by a group of former generals, who suggested the civilian population of the north should be ordered to evacuate, aid supplies should be cut off, and anyone remaining there should be considered a militant. The military has denied carrying out such a plan while the government has not said clearly whether it is carrying out all or part of it. On Monday, Israel's parliament passed two laws that ban UNRWA from operating on Israeli soil and cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. Israel controls access to both Gaza and the occupied West Bank, and it was unclear how the agency would continue to operate there. Israel says UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas and that the militant group siphons off aid and uses U.N. facilities to shield its activities, allegations denied by the U.N. agency. Aid groups have warned that there is no immediate replacement for UNRWA, which provides education, health care and emergency aid to millions of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation and their descendants. Refugee families make up the majority of Gaza's population. 'Severing this lifeline in Gaza as winter threatens to exacerbate an already desperate situation is cruel and dangerous,' said William Bell, the Middle East head of Christian Aid, a British charity. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced from their homes, often multiple times. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Mroue from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-10-29-2024-befe1b42ef25599539198fa04e089f04	2024-10-28T23:01:11-07:00	
Congo wants UN peacekeepers gone. But endless war around minerals is complicating that	GOMA, Congo (AP) — The end of one of the world's deadliest and yet most shadowy wars is as difficult to predict as the end of the large peacekeeping force meant to contain it. Congo desperately wants stability in its mineral-rich east, of intense interest to the global economy. But political friction means the government wants the longtime United Nations peacekeeping force there to get out. That would leave the vast region, overrun with dozens of armed groups including one affiliated with the Islamic State organization, with even less defense for millions of displaced civilians. But frustration has become so high with the peacekeepers that many Congolese want them gone, too. The Associated Press witnessed the dilemma on a rare visit and night patrol with the U.N. force now known as MONUSCO, which entered Congo more than two decades ago and has 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground. It patrols a landscape that feels far from the authority of Congo's government, with its dirt roads churned into slippery mud in pounding rains and residents long accustomed to feeling that, security-wise, they are on their own. Some of the region's armed groups are self-defense collectives. During a visit to one frontline town, Sake, about 14 miles (24 kilometers) from the regional hub of Goma, the AP spoke with militia members trying to defend the population from a resurgent group, the M23, and its sniper fire from surrounding hills. The M23 is backed by neighboring Rwanda, whose government denies it. The involvement of better-equipped Rwandan forces, with U.N. experts estimating up to 4,000 of them in Congo, has led to talk of war by Congo's government. A July truce brokered by the United States and Angola has reduced the fighting between Rwandan and Congolese forces, but clashes between M23 and other militias continue. 'We are fighting the enemy who is a foreigner in our country. They are not Congolese, but they want to take Congo,' said one fighter, Amini Bauma. Sake is one of the last main routes into Goma under government control, but fierce fighting this year forced most residents to flee, leaving boarded-up homes. About 160 civilians and soldiers came through Sake’s military hospital during the summer, most with gunshot wounds, said Omar Kalamo, a nurse. In August, a bomb exploded behind the building, he said. Some who fled are now returning, finding little safety elsewhere. Bitakuya Buhesha found his house destroyed. But he said he’d rather brave the gunfire than live in displacement camps, which have been infiltrated by fighters. 'We’ve waited a long time and we do don’t know whether our army will win this war or if it’ll be the M23 rebels,' he said. Many Congolese who once looked to the U.N. peacekeeping force with hope are now angry. Multiple protests, some of them violent, have targeted the force in recent years. Last year, at Congo’s request, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to draw down the peacekeeping force and gradually hand over its security responsibilities to Congo’s government by this December. But the soaring violence means that departure is now delayed. On a recent day, peacekeepers in armored vehicles pulled into a small base in the hazy hills outside Goma, its tents surrounded by looping razor wire and sandbags. Troops perched with a machine gun pointed in the rebels' direction. In recent months, clashes between Congo’s army and M23 came within a mile of the base. The U.N. force is trying to find new ways to repel the rebels. Last year, it established new bases between the frontlines and about 600,000 displaced people sheltering around Goma. It is training Congolese soldiers in the hope that they can fill the security void once it leaves. 'If the belligerent armed groups had come forward and attacked the civilians, the MONUSCO would have changed its stance purely from defensive to offensive operations,' said U.N’s center sector commander for North Kivu province, Brig. General Ranjan Mahajan. MONUSCO described the security challenges 'multiple and multifaceted' and said only one of its brigades is tasked to go on the offensive. That affects a single area, Beni, where deadly attacks have been especially frequent. The U.N. mission otherwise is defensive and works alongside Congolese forces and others. But some Congolese, who see the U.N. force as not aggressive enough, said any new efforts to protect them are futile. 'You can see that MONUSCO is there, but that’s in name only ... People are dying, but it does nothing,' said Maombie Aline, a displaced person in Goma. And yet, the international community has warned that the U.N. force's pullout would leave a security vacuum. More than 80% of Congo’s 7 million displaced people live in areas protected by the U.N., according to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. Last month, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the peacekeepers' pullout from South Kivu province in June left critical gaps, and the Security Council shouldn't authorize further withdrawals until there's a plan to mitigate them. The U.S. is the force's top financial supporter. Congo’s communication minister, Patrick Muyaya, said there would be a new timeline for MONUSCO’s departure, but didn't give details. He said a joint team of government and U.N. officials was evaluating the situation. Goma's streets are full of armed men, local and foreign. In addition to the U.N. force and an unknown number of Congolese forces, there are about 1,000 foreign mercenaries, a coalition of local militia and a Southern African regional force. A recently deployed East African force was kicked out amid criticism it was ineffective. 'It’s a military jungle,' said Onesphore Sematumba, a Congolese researcher for the International Crisis Group. 'There are many actors, but everyone has their own agenda ... they can’t make a difference because they are divided.' Global interest in eastern Congo's minerals is one reason the violence is so difficult to be contained, experts said. Congo is the world’s largest producer of cobalt, a mineral used to make lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and smartphones. It also has substantial gold, diamond, copper and cobalt reserves. In May, M23 fighters seized the town of Rubaya, which holds deposits of tantalum — used in electronics, including Apple devices —and extracted from coltan. The area is estimated to supply more than 15% of global production of tantalum and now generates about $300,000 a month for M23, said Bintou Keita, head of Congo's U.N. mission. U.N. experts in June said a portion of Rubaya minerals have been smuggled across the Rwandan border. Rwanda is selling minerals from eastern Congo and passing them off as conflict-free, said Darren Davids, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit — allegations documented by both U.N experts and the U.S. Davids said the international community has hesitated to meaningfully call on Rwanda to stop the fighting because it has become a reliable trading partner for the West as competition grows for the minerals. Meanwhile, the Rwandan-backed rebels are accused of obstructing and threatening the U.N. mission so it can seize more territory, and are widely expected to benefit from its departure. Rwanda’s government and M23 didn’t respond to requests for comment. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

As Israel strikes deeper into Lebanon, fear rises in communities where the displaced took refuge	AITO, Lebanon (AP) — Dany Alwan stood shaking as rescue workers pulled remains from piles of rubble where his brother’s building once stood. An Israeli airstrike destroyed the three-story residential building in the quiet Christian village of Aito a day before. His brother, Elie, had rented out its apartments to a friend who'd fled here with relatives from their hometown in southern Lebanon under Israeli bombardment. Things were fine for a few weeks. But that day, minutes after visitors arrived and entered the building, it was struck. Almost two dozen people were killed, half of them women and children. Israel said it targeted a Hezbollah official, as it has insisted in other strikes with high civilian death tolls. This strike — in northern Lebanon, deep in Christian heartland — was particularly unusual. Israel has concentrated its bombardment mostly in the country’s south and east and in Beirut's southern suburbs — Shiite-majority areas where the Hezbollah militant group has a strong presence. Strikes in the traditionally 'safe' areas where many displaced families have fled are raising fears among local residents. Many feel they have to choose between helping compatriots and protecting themselves. 'We can’t welcome people anymore,' Alwan said as rescue teams combed through the rubble in Aito. 'The situation is very critical in the village, and this is the first time something like this has happened to us.' The war brings out long-running tensions Aito is in the Zgharta province, which is split between Christian factions who are supporters and critics of Hezbollah. Some Christian legislators critical of Hezbollah have warned of the security risks that could come with hosting displaced people, mostly from the Shia Muslim community. They worry that many may have familial and social ties to Hezbollah, which in addition to its armed wing has civilian services across southern and eastern Lebanon. Some also worry that long-term displacement could create demographic changes and weaken the Christian share in Lebanon’s fragile sectarian power-sharing system. The tiny country has a troubled history of sectarian strife and violence, most notably in a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990. Lebanon for decades has struggled to navigate tensions and political gridlock within its sectarian power-sharing government system. Parliament is deeply divided among factions that back and oppose Hezbollah and has been without a president for almost two years. When Hezbollah fired rockets at northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinian ally Hamas in the war-torn Gaza Strip, the move was met with mixed feelings. Critics say it was a miscalculation that has brought the widespread devastation of Gaza here. Many have been moved to help After nearly a year of low-level fighting, the Israeli military escalated its attacks against Hezbollah a month ago, launching daily aerial bombardments and a ground invasion. Most of Lebanon’s estimated 1.2 million displaced people fled over the past month. In late September, traffic jams stretching for miles clogged streets leading to Beirut as people left, some with nothing but the clothes on their backs. For many, the violence has moved them to help their fellow residents, cutting across sectarian lines. Michella Sfeir, who was safe in the north, said she wanted to take action after seeing a picture of a driver pouring water from his bottle into a nearby driver’s empty one. 'The first thing you can think of is: How can I help immediately?' she said. She now helps prepare meals at a women’s art center that's become a community kitchen and donation dropoff center for blankets, clothes, and supplies in Aqaibe, a seaside town just north of Beirut. Displaced women who found shelter in surrounding neighborhoods regularly visit, while some people involved in other initiatives help deliver the hot meals to shelters around dinnertime. 'We get lots of questions like, ‘When you go to give the help, is there a member of Hezbollah waiting for you at the door?’' Sfeir said, citing blowback in the community from people who perceive the displaced as Hezbollah members, supporters and relatives. 'Some people ... would ask us ‘Why are you helping them? They don’t deserve it; this is because of them.'' Anxiety rises far from the border Though northern coastal cities such as Byblos and Batroun with pristine beaches and ancient ruins have not felt the direct pain of the conflict, anxiety is rising in surrounding areas. On one coastal road — the busy Jounieh highway — an Israeli drone struck a car earlier this month, killing a man and his wife. Such rare but increasing Israeli strikes have rattled residents in the north. Many feel torn: Should they risk their security by hosting displaced people, or compromise their morals and turn them away? Zeinab Rihan fled north with family and relatives from the southern Nabatiyeh province when they couldn’t bear the airstrikes approaching closer to their homes. But, Rihan said, they found many landlords quoting outlandish rent figures in an apparent attempt to turn them away. Some might have been acting out of personal prejudice, Rihan said, but it's likely most were simply afraid. 'They were scared that they might rent their place to someone who turns out to be targeted,' Rihan said. 'But this is our current reality, what can we do?' For some, helping is a sense of duty A resident of one northern town near the coast said the local government didn't want to welcome displaced people, but many residents pressured the municipality to change course. He cited the town’s common sympathy and sense of duty to help others, despite the security risks. He spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of stirring tension among residents. Elsewhere, in the hilly village of Ebrine, a stone’s throw away from Batroun, residents have been regularly visiting dozens of displaced families sheltering in two modest schools. This month, an Israeli strike hit a village a short drive away, but that hasn't stopped some residents from hiring the displaced — for some, to work in olive groves during the harvest season. Back in Aqaibe, some displaced women from nearby areas have joined Sfeir and others volunteering at the kitchen: chopping vegetables, cooking rice in vats, packaging meals in plastic containers, and having coffee together on the balcony. 'Just because we’re in an area that doesn’t have direct conflict or direct war doesn’t mean that we’re not worried about Beirut or the south,' said Flavia Bechara, who founded the center, as she took a break from chopping onions and potatoes. 'We all used to eat the olives and olive oil of the south, and we used to go there to get fruits and vegetables.' Bechara and several women finished packing dozens of meals for the day, and a group of women came to pick up winter clothes for their kids. Bechara said she isn’t phased by the criticism or questions she gets from some of her neighbors. 'There’s always anxiety,' said Bechara, who just recently could hear strikes a short drive away, in Maisra. 'There’s always (the fear) that what is happening there can happen here at any moment.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-war-displacement-hezbollah-395ccfd8ff7e230b474867b13e594b1b	2024-10-28T20:25:50-07:00

In Japan, the government reported that unemployment stood at 2.4% last month, marking an improvement of 0.1 percentage point, and the second straight month of recovery. The continuing weak yen is helping hold up Japanese stocks. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar gained to 153.32 Japanese yen from 153.23 yen. The euro cost $1.0820, inching up from $1.0817. Recently, stocks in the oil-and-gas industry have been hurt by the sinking price of oil. In energy trading in Asia Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude rose 15 cents to $67.53 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 18 cents to $71.60 a barrel. On Monday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude fell 6.1%, and Brent crude slid 6.1%. That was the first trading for them since Israel attacked Iranian military targets on Saturday, in retaliation for an earlier barrage of ballistic missiles. Israel’s attack was more restrained than some investors had feared it could be, and it raised hopes that a worst-case scenario may be avoided. Beyond the violence that is taking a human toll, the worry in financial markets is that an escalating war in the Middle East could cut off the flow of crude from Iran, which is a major oil producer. Such worries had sent the price of Brent crude up to nearly $81 per barrel in early October, despite signals that plenty of oil is available for the global economy. It’s since fallen back below $72. Financial markets are also dealing with the volatility that typically surrounds a U.S. presidential election, with Election Day one week away. Markets have historically been shaky heading into an election, only to calm afterward regardless of which party wins. Investors are eyeing the U.S. jobs report set for release Friday. They want to see more evidence of solid hiring to keep alive hopes for the economy. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-oil-prices-tech-stocks-1f348c34204ce132997defdd9a15a31a	2024-10-28T19:45:25-07:00	
North Korea sends foreign minister to Russia as its troops train to fight in Ukraine	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Tuesday its top diplomat is visiting Russia, in another sign of their deepening relations as rival South Korea and Western nations say the North has sent thousands of troops to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said a delegation led by Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui departed for Russia on Monday, but didn’t specify the purpose of the visit. In a closed-door hearing at South Korea’s parliament, the South’s spy agency said Choe may be involved in high-level discussions on sending additional troops to Russia and negotiating what the North would get in return, according to Lee Seong-kweun, a lawmaker who attended the meeting. The announcement of Choe’s visit came hours after the Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, who are expected to arrive in battlefields in Ukraine within 'the next several weeks.' South Korean and Western leaders have expressed concern that North Korean involvement could help prolong Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, and that Russia may offer technology in return that could advance the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters Monday that some of the North Korean soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine and were believed to be heading for the Kursk border region, where Russia has been struggling to push back a Ukrainian incursion. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers it’s examining the possibility that some groups of North Korea’s military personnel in Russia, including generals or other high-ranking officials, may have already moved to frontline areas. The spy agency also said the two sides appear to be struggling to resolve communication issues although the Russian military is training North Korean troops on Russian military terminology, Lee said. The agency said space-based reconnaissance is an area where North Korea is likely receiving Russian help. It said North Korea may be acquiring advanced components from Russia as it prepares to launch another military reconnaissance satellite following a failed attempt in May, said Park Sun-won, another lawmaker who attended the hearing. North Korea first placed a spy satellite in orbit last November. Its leader Kim Jong Un has described those assets as crucial for monitoring South Korean and U.S. military activities and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in telephone calls with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday shared South Korean intelligence assessments that North Korean troops could be deployed to battlefronts 'more quickly than anticipated.' He called for closer coordination with European governments aimed at 'monitoring and blocking 'illegal exchanges between Pyongyang and Moscow, Yoon’s office said in a statement. After initially denying the claims about North Korean troop deployments, Pyongyang and Moscow have adopted a vaguer stance, asserting that their military cooperation conforms with international law without directly admitting the presence of North Korean forces in Russia. North Korea has also been accused of providing millions of artillery shells and other military equipment to Russia to fuel its war in Ukraine. The United States and its partners have described Russia’s procurement of North Korean personnel and supplies as a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and raised suspicions that Moscow is helping Pyongyang to evade sanctions and unlawfully finance its weapons program. Russia, along with China, has blocked U.S.-led efforts at the Security Council to tighten sanctions on North Korea over its recent missile testing activities, which intensified after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia also vetoed a U.N. resolution to extend the mandate of a panel of monitors in March in a move that effectively abolished oversight by U.N. experts of Security Council sanctions against North Korea. It prompted Western accusations that Moscow was acting to shield its arms purchases from Pyongyang. 'The illegal military collusion between Russia and North Korea poses a significant security threat to the international community and a serious matter that could potentially harm our security. We must thoroughly examine all possibilities and prepare countermeasures,' Yoon said in a Cabinet meeting in Seoul on Tuesday. Yoon last week raised the possibility of supplying Ukraine with weapons while saying Seoul is preparing countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has provided humanitarian aid and other non-lethal support to Ukraine and joined U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. It has so far resisted calls by Kyiv and NATO to directly supply Ukraine with weapons, citing a longstanding policy of not providing arms to countries engaged in active conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-war-choe-son-hui-foreign-minister-c67d98128d06e8959aa34f21428f5081	2024-10-28T19:35:32-07:00	
Guatemalan journalist released from prison fears for the future and being targeted for his work	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — When Guatemalan journalist José Rubén Zamora returned to his home after more than two years in prison without a conviction, he found it empty. He said it smelled of abandonment after his family fled the country, fearing they would face his same fate. On Monday, one week after his release, Zamora discussed his own uncertain future in an interview with The Associated Press under the shadow of efforts to keep him behind bars and his concern for other journalists that do the kind of investigative work he did. Not only have Guatemalan journalists — including eight from the outlet El Periódico that he founded — been forced into exile under threat of prosecution, but those who remain wrestle with the fear that if they investigate 'they can end up in jail,' Zamora said. Thrust into the spotlight, the 68-year-old journalist is shy, not keen to be the target of news. He said he can still feel the aftermath of imprisonment in his bones, and also in his day-to-day life after funding his legal defense forced him to sell his belongings, only skating by through support from his children. 'Frankly, the feeling of not having any money, that is mine, is complicated and I don’t have the means to get around,' he said. The interview comes after a long journey for Zamora, who has spent the past three decades working as a journalist. Twenty-four of those years were as president of El Periódico, the news organization he founded to investigate corruption in Guatemala. It’s a dangerous topic to investigate in a country like Guatemala, where the Attorney General's Office raided electoral facilities, seized and opened ballot boxes and targeted the Seed Movement party of now-President Bernardo Arévalo in an effort to keep him from taking office. To this day, Zamora believes it was his paper's investigative work that led him to be targeted by prosecutors. In particular, it was his pointed criticism of former President Alejandro Giammattei and his ally, current Attorney General Consuelo Porras, who was sanctioned by the United States for allegedly obstructing corruption investigations. Porras' agents raided Zamora's house in July 2022 and arrested him, accusing him of money laundering after he asked a friend to deposit $38,000 that Zamora said was a donation to his news organization. Zamora said he did not put the money in the bank himself because the person who made the donation feared being retaliated against for supporting the media outlet. He was initially convicted and sentenced to six years, a ruling that was annulled due to procedural failures. He was later accused of falsifying documents and faced a second trial for allegedly lying in the first case against him. In late October, he was finally set free, after a judge cited that two years of pre-trial detention violated national and international human rights law. Upon his release, one of his first visitors was President Arévalo. 'I explained to him that in Guatemala, there have never been institutions dedicated to control or rigorous oversight,' Zamora said. 'That is why the press is so important: There is no prosecution or punishment for the corrupt, rather there are walls of impunity.' Zamora said he was happy to finally speak to his family, but it was clear he still lives with the fallout of his two years in jail and a deep sense of uncertainty over what comes next. Upon his arrest, his newspaper El Periódico disappeared. Eight of its journalists and columnists live in exile like his family for publishing articles on the abuse of power of judges and prosecutors — including about his case. Since Porras remains attorney general, Zamora worries that he could once again be thrown in jail. He said he’s been left without a job, and worries about friends, family and even people who he speaks to at the prosecutor's office when he goes for his required regular check-ins. 'I worry about people greeting me, because they may face some consequences,' he said. The only thing that remains of his old life are piles of old copies of his newspaper in his home's garage. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/guatemala-journalist-zamora-interview-jailed-23dc6016a4b3e9b7dc104c390e603b8a	2024-10-28T18:25:43-07:00	
Fans in Shohei Ohtani's Japanese hometown pack in to watch Game 3 of the World Series	OSHU CITY, Japan (AP) — Hundreds of fans filed into a public viewing center in Shohei Ohtani's hometown in northern Japan on Tuesday morning — the country is 13 hours ahead of Yankee Stadium — to cheer the country's top celebrity in Game 3 of the World Series. Fans lined up outside the Oshu City Cultural Center, a 500-seat auditorium, on a perfect fall morning to watch their local hero in a live telecast. They were there an hour before the game started. Many came dressed in Dodger Blue — caps or jerseys — and were supplied with various noisemakers, including thunder sticks. The hall was adorned with posters announcing Ohtani as 'The Pride of Oshu City.' Ohtani, playing two days after dislocating his left shoulder in Game 2, drew a walk on his first at-bat. That drew wild cheers from the 250 fans attending, who chanted 'Go, Go. Shohei.' Then came even more cheers when the Dodgers took a 2-0 lead on Freddie Freeman's home run. 'He's more like a Japanese treasure than just a local (treasure),' said fan Hiromitsu Kikuchi. 'I think he has passed beyond the hometown and is more like world-class. We have never had a star player like this before from our hometown.' Among the mostly older fans were about 20 children from the kindergarten that Ohtani attended. They came equipped with small flags emblazoned with Ohtani's smiling face. Several fans said they were worried Ohtani might not play but set out from home when they got the good news. 'I came to see Ohtani because the television news reported that he would play,' said fan Tadashi Onodera. 'It's fantastic. We are proud to have such a player from out hometown.' This is the town where Ohtani played Little League, starred as a pitcher and hitter at Hanamaki Higashi High School, and became the favorite son of Iwate Prefecture, a mountainous region abutting the Pacific Ocean. His hometown is located about 300 miles (500 kilometers) north of Tokyo, a largely rural place far from the capital, its hundreds of skyscrapers and high-end prosperity. All eyes at the viewing were on the Dodgers superstar — and his left shoulder. His injury briefly cast a pall and flipped Japan's mood from magic to morose. Then came relief. The magic returned as Dodgers manager Dave Roberts started Ohtani as the designated hitter and leadoff hitter in Game 3, what local fans and all of baseball wanted to see. 'I was concerned (about the injury), but believed it would be okay,' said Masatoshi Honmyo, another local fan. 'I would say he is a hero.' ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-shohei-ohtani-japan-03bac61f1ff62c6482cba84006c9e617	2024-10-28T16:40:37-07:00	
Thousands of soldiers fence off a Salvadoran neighborhood in pursuit of gang remnants	SAN SALVADOR (AP) — More than 2,000 soldiers and 500 police officers surrounded a populous neighborhood on the outskirts of El Salvador's capital on Monday in an effort to quash the remnants of gangs the president said were trying to set up shop in the area. 'There is a group of gang members in hiding. We have established a security fence throughout the neighborhood... to extract every last gang member in the area,' wrote Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in a post on X. Police surrounded the San Marcos neighborhood with a military fence, setting up checkpoints to prevent gang members from escaping, said Defense Minister René Francis Merino Monroy. The fence was the third of its kind to be installed in parts of San Salvador intended to find and arrest gang members still operating in the country. In March, Bukele ordered similar barricades to be put up in a northern part of the country, which he said was to dismantle a faction of the Barrio 18 gang. The blockade is the latest in the populist leader's war on gangs, announced by Bukele following a surge of violence in March 2022. Bukele's government called for a 'state of emergency' and waived constitutional rights to arrest more than 1% of El Salvador's population with little evidence. The crackdown has fueled sharp criticism from human rights groups, raising alarm about prison conditions and saying many of those arrested were innocent or only had loose ties to gangs. Other measures he's taken, like seeking re-election despite a constitutional ban of presidents serving two consecutive terms, have raised other democratic alarms. But the war on gangs also dealt a strong blow to the Barrio 18 and MS-13 gangs that have long sowed terror in much of the country, extorting money, murdering those who didn't pay and trafficking drugs. The measures resulted in a sharp dip in homicides and spurred a populist fervor for Bukele. Despite effectively declaring victory in his war, the president has continued to extend the 'state of emergency' for over two years now, claiming that such measures are needed to take out the remains of El Salvador's gangs. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-gangs-nayib-bukele-state-of-emergency-violence-1f6dcc2fad3b5fc45f724031806d2fc0	2024-10-28T14:01:45-07:00	
Treasury issues rule to block US investors from helping China develop advanced military technology	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Treasury Department, seeking to keep the Chinese military from gaining an edge in advanced technologies, issued a rule Monday to restrict and monitor American investments in China in artificial intelligence, computer chips and quantum computing. The finalized rule arises from an executive order issued in August 2023 by President Joe Biden. The order sought to limit the access that 'countries of concern'' — specifically China including Hong Kong and Macao — have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2. 'U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities''' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security. He noted the investments can mean more than just money: they can deliver 'intangible benefits,'' including managerial help and assistance finding top talent and tapping other sources of financing. Blocking China's high-tech ambitions is one of the few issues that enjoys broad support in Washington from both Republicans and Democrats. Biden in May slapped a stiff tariff on electric vehicles from China. He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the government had lodged a protest with the U.S. over the latest action. 'China strongly deplores and firmly opposes the U.S. rolling out restrictions on investment in China,' Lin Jian said at a daily briefing in Beijing. In Hong Kong, the city's leader said the move undermined normal investment and trade and would cause damage to the global supply chain. 'In pursuing their political agenda, American politicians are harming not only others but also the interests of their own country, their people and their businesses. They will have to face the consequences of their actions,' John Lee said, noting that the U.S. has enjoyed a trade surplus of $472 billion with Hong Kong in the past 10 years. The Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version. In addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve 'technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.'' Violators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater. Treasury is setting up an Office of Global Transactions to oversee the new rule. ____ Associated Press writers Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/treasury-rule-china-artificial-intelligence-chips-investment-86bae5f144e544416e0bf9ca16e7d5af	2024-10-28T13:00:27-07:00	
Shohei Ohtani leads off for Dodgers in World Series Game 3, two days after dislocating shoulder	NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani wasn't on the team bus from Dodger Stadium to Los Angeles International Airport because he was getting tests Saturday night after partially separating his left shoulder in Game 2 of the World Series. So the Japanese star reached out in a group chat with fellow Dodgers players to erase any doubts over his status. 'The text just like literally said: `I can play,'' infielder Max Muncy recalled Monday. 'I mean, there was more to it than that.' True to his word, Ohtani remained in the lineup in his regular leadoff slot as the designated hitter for Game 3 of the World Series with Los Angeles holding a 2-0 lead over the New York Yankees. Ohtani was the only Dodgers starter wearing a warmup jacket during pregame introductions and high-fived teammates with his right hand. A black wrapping was visible over his left shoulder. He didn't swing in his first plate appearance, taking four balls from Clarke Schmidt. Ohtani kept his left arm at an angle over his chest while at first base, hand holding his collar, and held it there while rounding the bases on Freddie Freeman's two-run homer. Ohtani had a swing and miss in the third, slighting grimacing, before grounding out. He held the hand to his chest as he jogged back to the dugout. Muncy said Ohtani wrote the text himself in English without assistance from interpreter Will Ireton. 'We all just put it to the side at that moment,' Muncy remembered. 'We all said: `All right, he’s got us. We'll be ready for him to be in the lineup.'' Dodgers manager Dave Roberts didn't get the text message — 'that group chat is for us — that’s for the players,' Muncy said — and wasn't aware of it until Monday. 'Would have been helpful if I was on that thread. I would have slept better Saturday night,' Roberts said with a smile. Ohtani got hurt sliding into second base when he was caught stealing to end the seventh inning of Saturday night’s 4-2 victory in Los Angeles. Roberts said Ohtani's shoulder was popped back into place by the athletic training staff at the ballpark and an MRI showed no structural damage. He wasn't sure whether the injury will heal on its own or any procedure would be needed after the Series. Asked whether Ohtani received medication, an injection or was being taped up, Roberts said 'it's all of the above on the treatment and stuff. The tape is just protecting and stabilizing, not really limiting.' Ohtani took swings off a tee in a Yankee Stadium batting cage Sunday night and was hitting balls 102 mph, which changed Roberts' mood to 'joy.' 'He was very adamant that he was going to play,' Roberts said. 'Obviously, there’s some discomfort.' A separated shoulder is subject to recurrence. Roberts said he doubted Ohtani will attempt any more stolen bases during the Series. 'If you keep the best player in the game in the lineup, that’s usually good for your team,' Muncy said. 'Obviously, it’s a big guy to have in there. It helps a lot. He’s had some big moments for us, and we’re obviously expecting a couple more big moments out of him.' With the Dodgers chasing their eighth championship and second in five years, Walker Buehler was scheduled to start Game 3 for Los Angeles in the best-of-seven Series. Ohtani was 0 for 3 with a walk in Game 2. The likely NL MVP was 1 for 8 in the first two games of the Fall Classic and batting .260 with three home runs and 10 RBIs in his first postseason in the majors. 'It was very tough in the moment to see him in pain like that,' Muncy said. 'We were two innings away from winning that ballgame. We knew we had to refocus. Obviously, it sucks seeing Sho in that kind of pain, but we still had a job to do in the moment. 'After the game we all checked on him to see how he was doing. It was like a buffet line going in there to see how he’s doing. Yeah, it was tough in the moment, but we refocused to win the game.' A two-time AL MVP with the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani joined the Dodgers last December for a record $700 million, 10-year contract. The 30-year-old slugger hit .310 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases, becoming the first player with at least 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season. The two-way star did not pitch this season while recovering from elbow surgery on Sept. 19, 2023, and has been limited to designated hitter. 'You see him walk off holding (his arm) like that, obviously that’s a concern. But hopefully he is OK,' Yankees manager Aaron Boone said before Game 3. 'We want to all be out here competing with and against the best, and obviously Shohei embodies that. So hopefully everything’s OK, and we’ll get to go compete against him.' ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-ohtani-dodgers-311bc657971726bc04028326dcf1cf72	2024-10-28T12:05:18-07:00	
World Series averaging 15.15 million viewers in Japan, including 15.9 for Game 2	LOS ANGELES (AP) — The World Series is averaging 15.15 million viewers in Japan through two games. According to Major League Baseball, the Los Angeles Dodgers' 4-2 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 2 averaged 15.9 million, making it the most-watched MLB postseason game in the nation's history. Besides the allure of superstar and presumptive NL MVP Shohei Ohtani, the game had Yoshinobu Yamamoto as the Dodgers' starting pitcher. The Los Angeles Dodgers’ dramatic 6-3 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 1 — which ended on Freddie Freeman’s walk off grand slam in the 10th inning — averaged 14.4 million. Tokyo is 16 hours ahead of Los Angeles, meaning the games started around 9 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday morning in Japan. The games are being carried through Fuji TV, NHK BS and J Sports. Combined with the United States ratings, the first two games have a combined 29.7 million average in the two countries. The World Series is averaging 14.55 million viewers in the U.S. on Fox, Fox Deportes and streaming, putting it on track for its best performance since 2017. It is also the first time since the final two games of the 2021 series between the Atlanta Braves and Houston Astros that the World Series has drawn back-to-back games of at least 13.4 million viewers. According to Nielsen, the matchup between the Yankees and Dodgers has also meant a 93% increase in viewership within the 18-34-year-old demographic.

US presses ahead with modest Mideast plans despite election uncertainty	WASHINGTON (AP) — With the U.S. presidential election just a week away, the Biden administration is not giving up hope for short-term deals for cease-fires between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. But U.S. officials are mindful that political uncertainty in the United States has made the sides reluctant to commit to any significant agreements before it is clear who has won the White House. In the meantime, the Middle East is uneasy about what happens next after Israel struck Iranian military targets over the weekend in retaliation for Iran's barrage of ballistic missile attacks on Oct. 1. U.S. officials said they believe Israel’s attack — whose targets were coordinated with Washington — will not draw an escalatory reaction from Iran. But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share sensitive diplomatic discussions, caution that nothing is certain. The Biden administration was able to persuade Israel to keep its response limited — gaining assurances it wouldn’t hit nuclear or oil sites in Iran that would have escalated the conflict — despite limited U.S. influence as Biden's term wraps up. As Israel’s closest ally and a key mediator in the Middle East, the U.S. still is pressing for any movement on a truce despite letdowns in the past and little expectation of immediate breakthroughs. 'I don’t sense that the Israelis are feeling a huge amount of urgency,' said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'I feel like they are feeling much less urgency now than a few months ago.' U.S. efforts in Gaza As conditions, particularly in Gaza, continue to deteriorate, the administration is backing an Egyptian proposal for a two-day Gaza cease-fire that would see Hamas release a limited number of hostages and potentially open more routes for badly needed humanitarian assistance to reach the enclave, the U.S. officials say. President Joe Biden said Monday that he would join his staff in discussing the proposal. 'We need a cease-fire. We should end this war. It should end. It should end. It should end,' Biden said. One of the officials said the administration would support virtually any suggestion that leads to a reduction in suffering for Palestinian civilians and the release of hostages but stressed that 'we’re not holding our breath.' Secretary of State Antony Blinken ’s visit to Israel, Saudi Arabia and Qatar last week was aimed at gauging the region’s willingness for such a deal. Officials said Blinken came away from his meetings cautiously optimistic but acknowledged that previous similar hopes have been dashed. 'What we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,' Blinken said last week. He said the killing of Hamas military chief Yahya Sinwar helped open a window for new talks on a cease-fire proposal that has been languishing for months. To underscore U.S. support for a deal, CIA Director William Burns participated in weekend talks in Doha with senior Israeli and Qatari officials on a potential path forward. There was no immediate result, but lower-level talks are expected to continue this week. The prospects for the success of even such a modest proposal — which would fall well short of previous plans for three-phase cease-fire deal — are uncertain as Hamas, despite heavy losses on the ground, has rejected calls for anything less than a full-on truce and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Hamas has yet to formally respond to the Egyptian plan, though Israel has signaled a willingness to consider the idea. Longer-term ideas for the post-conflict future of Gaza are a work in progress, according to the U.S. officials, who say that Israel’s battlefield assessments will play a major role in determining what Israel might agree to. Until now, Israel has adamantly rejected any governance or security role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, something that is a deal-breaker for both the authority and for Arab nations whose support will be critical for any plan to succeed. While the U.S. election may be a factor, even if there wasn’t the Nov. 5 vote, Israel is showing few signs it is motivated to pursue a cease-fire, said Alterman, the analyst. 'From what I know, it doesn’t feel like we are on a brink of a breakthrough,' Alterman said. U.S. push in Lebanon In Lebanon, where Israel has been intensifying military operations against Hezbollah for the past month, U.S. officials allow that a short-term fix is probably unrealistic. That’s because Lebanon’s fractured political leadership is distrusted by Israeli officials and because the Lebanese Armed Forces have yet to move convincingly to keep Hezbollah fighters from attacking Israel from southern Lebanon. Biden aide Amos Hochstein — who has been a point man on administration efforts to keep Israel and Hezbollah from entering a full-scale war — is expected in the region this week to get a sense from Israeli officials on what they would be willing to support. Depending on what he hears, he may then travel to Lebanon to explore what officials there would be willing to do to prevent further Hezbollah rocket strikes on northern and central Israel, officials said. Complicating matters in both Gaza and Lebanon is that neither Hamas nor Hezbollah have announced replacements after Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Sinwar of Hamas in recent weeks. ___ AP reporters Tara Copp in Washington, Aamer Madhani in New Castle, Delaware, and Abby Sewell in Beirut, Lebanon, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-lebanon-iran-hamas-hezbollah-a02b674e9a930313436a218da729795d	2024-10-28T10:54:34-07:00	
Brazil fines meatpacking companies, including giant JBS, for buying illegally raised cattle	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Brazil's environmental agency has levied $64 million in fines against 23 meatpacking companies and their suppliers for buying and selling cattle raised illegally on deforested land in the Amazon. The operation, dubbed Cold Meat 2, launched last week. It tracked 18,000 head of cattle raised in 100 square miles (260 square kilometers) of pasture that has been banned for commercial use due to illegal deforestation. The agents also apprehended 8,854 head of cattle found inside the restricted areas. News of the fines began emerging over the weekend. Cattle raising is the main driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, with 90% of the area cleared between 1985 and 2023 converted to pasture. That represents 227,800 square miles (590,000 square kilometers), slightly larger than France. As a result, 14% of the Amazon is covered by grazing land, according to MapBiomas, a network of nongovernmental organizations that monitors land use. 'We are inspecting the production chain to hold offenders accountable for acquiring products from deforestation and to ensure that crime does not pay,' Jair Schmitt, chief of environmental protection at Brazil’s federal environmental agency, known as Ibama, told The Associated Press. Among those fined was JBS, the world's largest meat-packing company. JBS has applied to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a move that has faced opposition from some U.S. lawmakers and environmental nonprofits. It's not clear when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may make a decision on JBS' bid. The JBS fine was $108,000 for purchasing 1,231 head of cattle, the fifth largest penalty among the fined companies. The operation followed three months of investigation by Ibama's intelligence unit and is the latest episode linking JBS to illegal deforestation. In December, AP revealed that it is facing lawsuits for allegedly purchasing cattle raised illegally in Jaci-Parana, a protected area in the Brazilian Amazon. In a statement, JBS denied buying cattle from embargoed areas and said it had already submitted documents to Ibama demonstrating their legal origin. However, the company declined to comment on the Jaci-Parana’s case despite repeated requests for clarification from AP since it published the story. 'JBS has maintained its Responsible Procurement Policy for 15 years and has a geospatial monitoring system in place to ensure that the company does not purchase animals from farms involved in illegal deforestation, encroachment on Indigenous lands or conservation areas that are under embargo by Ibama,' read the statement. Agropam, a meatpacker in Boca do Acre city, received the largest fine, $493,000, for buying 5,624 head of cattle from illegal areas. The company, which operates under the name of Frizam, sells beef only for Brazil's internal market. A message requesting comment was not returned. The other top companies targeted were Mafrico, Frigol and 163 Beef. Mafrico and Frigo did not respond to requests for comment left by phone and on their websites. Contact information for 163 Beef was not immediately available, as numbers on its Facebook page were disconnected. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

South Africa submits its main legal claim to the top UN court which accuses Israel of genocide	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The South African legal team delivered a nearly 5,000-page document to the United Nations’ top court on Monday, the latest step in a case the country brought accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The document, which the International Court of Justice will not make public until a later stage in the proceedings, puts forth the 'main case' that Israel has a 'special intent to commit genocide,' according to a statement from South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa. Israel has fiercely denied the allegations. The government called the case 'blood libel' when South Africa launched the complaint in Dec. 2023. On Monday a court official at the ICJ confirmed that they had received the document. The filing takes place as the Israeli military has called on Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza, where it has been waging a large offensive for more than three weeks. The U.N. said earlier this month at least 400,000 people are still in northern Gaza and hunger is rampant as the amount of humanitarian aid reaching the north has plummeted over the past month. The Hague-based court has so far issued three rounds of emergency measures, ordering Israel to halt a military offensive in Rafah and open more land crossings for aid into Gaza. South Africa says Israel has refused to comply. 'Israel’s continued shredding of international law has imperiled the institutions of global governance that were established to hold all states accountable,' the president’s statement said. Palestine, Spain, Chile and seven other countries have petitioned the court to join the case. Israel now has until July 2025 to reply. Israel launched its military action in Gaza after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others.	https://apnews.com/article/icj-israel-south-africa-genocide-c16b0e8ad715ac41f489d3255964a373	2024-10-28T10:15:54-07:00	
US warns of visa restrictions for people who undermine Ghana's democracy	ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — The U.S. State Department warned Monday that it would restrict U.S. visas for people who undermine Ghana's democracy, ahead of the West African country’s general election in December. Ghana has held peaceful, free, fair and transparent elections for nearly two decades. The presidential and parliamentary elections will be held concurrently on Dec. 7. It will be the ninth consecutive general election since the country’s return to multi-party democracy in 1992. But allegations of voter roll irregularities this year have created concerns about a possible democratic backslide. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was quoted as saying in a statement that the visa policy announced Monday would be directed only at people 'who undermine democracy' and not at the government or people of Ghana. Last month, Ghana’s biggest opposition party, the National Democratic Congress, or NDC, held nationwide protests demanding an audit of the voter roll, alleging it detected thousands of unauthorized transfers and erasures of voter names. Current President Akufo-Addo is stepping down this year after his second and final four-year term. Former President John Dramani Mahama of the NDC, who lost in the 2016 and 2020 elections, will face off with Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia of the New Patriotic Party in this year’s election. Last year, the U.S. State Department announced a similar policy of visa restrictions ahead of the Nigerian general election, restricting entry to people 'believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining democracy in Nigeria.'	https://apnews.com/article/us-state-department-visas-general-election-ghana-74cbf5f1a608a1c39a0f2321741e8141	2024-10-28T09:56:12-07:00	
Fitness app Strava gives away location of Biden, Trump and other leaders, French newspaper says	PARIS (AP) — An investigation by French newspaper Le Monde found that the highly confidential movements of U.S. President Joe Biden, presidential rivals Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and other world leaders can be easily tracked online through a fitness app that their bodyguards use. But the U.S. Secret Service told the newspaper that it doesn’t believe the protection it provides was in any way compromised. Le Monde found that some U.S. Secret Service agents use the Strava fitness app, including in recent weeks after the two assassination attempts on Trump, in a video investigation released in French and in English. Strava is a fitness tracking app primarily used by runners and cyclists to record their activities and share their workouts with a community. Le Monde also found Strava users among the security staff for French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In one example, Le Monde traced the Strava movements of Macron’s bodyguards to determine that the French leader spent a weekend in the Normandy seaside resort of Honfleur in 2021. The trip was meant to be private and wasn’t listed on the president’s official agenda. Le Monde said the whereabouts of Melania Trump and Jill Biden could also be pinpointed by tracking their bodyguards’ Strava profiles. In a statement to Le Monde, the U.S. Secret Service said its staff aren’t allowed to use personal electronic devices while on duty during protective assignments but 'we do not prohibit an employee’s personal use of social media off-duty.' 'Affected personnel has been notified,' it said. 'We will review this information to determine if any additional training or guidance is required.' 'We do not assess that there were any impacts to protective operations or threats to any protectees,' it added. Locations 'are regularly disclosed as part of public schedule releases.' In another example, Le Monde reported that a U.S. Secret Service agent’s Strava profile revealed the location of a hotel where Biden subsequently stayed in San Francisco for high-stakes talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2023. A few hours before Biden’s arrival, the agent went jogging from the hotel, using Strava which traced his route, the newspaper found. The newspaper’s journalists say they identified 26 U.S. agents, 12 members of the French GSPR, the Security Group of the Presidency of the Republic and 6 members of the Russian FSO, or Federal Protection Service, all of them in charge of presidential security, who had public accounts on Strava and were therefore communicating their movements online, including during professional trips. Le Monde did not identify the bodyguards by name for security reasons. It said movements trackable on Strava could lead to security breaches, especially when security agents travel in advance to places like hotels where leaders then stay and hold meetings. Macron's office said Monday the consequences of the issues reported by Le Monde 'are very slight and in no way affect the security of the President of the Republic.' Local authorities are aware of Macron's movements ahead of time and the places where Macron is staying are always fully secure, 'so the risk is non-existent,' the statement said. 'A reminder was nevertheless issued to agents by the chief of staff asking them not to use this app,' Macron's office added. Identifying the presidential bodyguards — some of them using their full name on Strava — could also help finding other details about their personal address, their family, their movements and photos they posted on various social media, all of which could possibly be used to put pressure on them for malicious purposes, the report stressed.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-macron-bodyguards-security-strava-0a48afca09c7aa74d703e72833dcaf72	2024-10-28T09:50:16-07:00	
People opt out of organ donation programs after reports of a man mistakenly declared dead	WASHINGTON (AP) — Transplant experts are seeing a spike in people revoking organ donor registrations, their confidence shaken by reports that organs were nearly retrieved from a Kentucky man mistakenly declared dead. It happened in 2021 and while details are murky surgery was avoided and the man is still alive. But donor registries in the U.S. and even across the Atlantic are being impacted after the case was publicized recently. A drop in donations could cost the lives of people awaiting a transplant. 'Organ donation is based on public trust,' said Dorrie Dils, president of the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, or OPOs. When eroded, 'it takes years to regain.' Only doctors caring for patients can determine if they're dead -- the law blocks anyone involved with organ donation or transplant. The allegations raise questions about how doctors make that determination and what’s supposed to happen if anyone sees a reason for doubt. Key is ensuring 'all doctors are doing the right tests and doing them well,' said Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, a Georgetown University bioethicist. An alleged near miss in Kentucky The 2021 case first came to light in a congressional hearing last month, with unconfirmed details in later media reports – allegations that a man who’d been declared dead days earlier woke up on the way to the operating room for organ-donation surgery and that there was initial reluctance to realize it. The federal agency that regulates the U.S. transplant system is investigating, and the Kentucky attorney general’s office said it is 'reviewing the facts to identify an appropriate response.' A coalition of OPOs and other donation groups is urging that findings be made public quickly and the public withhold judgment until then, saying any deviation from the industry's strict standards would be 'entirely unacceptable.' The number of people opting out of organ donation has spiked Donate Life America found an average of 170 people a day removed themselves from the national donor registry in the week following media coverage of the allegations – 10 times more than the same week in 2023. That doesn’t include emailed removal requests or state registries, another way people can volunteer to become a donor when they eventually die. Dils' own organ agency, Gift of Life Michigan, usually gets five to 10 calls a week from people asking how to remove themselves from that state’s list. In the last week, her staff handled 57 such calls, many mentioning the Kentucky case. The Kentucky allegations reverberated in France Unlike the voluntary U.S. donation system, French law presumes all citizens and residents will be organ and tissue donors upon death unless they clearly opt out. After the reports from Kentucky reached France, the number joining that nation’s donation refusal registry jumped from about 100 people a day to 1,000 a day in the past week, according to the French Biomedicine Agency. Dr. Régis Bronchard, an agency deputy director, said the spike 'reflects anxiety, incomprehension among the general public' that could have 'catastrophic consequences.' What’s supposed to happen after death and before organ donation Doctors can declare two types of death. What’s called cardiac death occurs when the heart stops beating and breathing stops, and they can’t be restored. Brain death is declared when the entire brain permanently ceases functioning, usually after a major traumatic injury or stroke. Ventilators and other machines keep the heart beating during special testing to tell. Only about 1% of deaths occur in a way that allows someone to become an organ donor – most people declared dead in a hospital will quickly be transferred to a funeral home or morgue. But most organ donations are from brain-dead donors. Only after that declaration does the donor agency assume responsibility for the deceased, looking for potential recipients and scheduling retrieval surgery — while typically nurses at the hospital where the person died continue care to ensure equipment properly maintains their organs until they're collected. What if something goes wrong? The donor agency and transplant surgeons arriving to retrieve organs must check records of how death was determined. Anyone – donor hospital employees, donor agency staff or surgeons – who sees anything concerning is supposed to speak up immediately. 'This is extremely rare,' Dr. Ginny Bumgardner, an Ohio State University transplant surgeon who also leads the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, said of the Kentucky case. In operating rooms 'the whole process stops' if someone sees a hint of trouble, and independent doctors are called to doublecheck the person really is dead, Bumgardner said. In her 30-year career, 'I’ve never had a case where the original declaration was wrong.' Georgetown’s Sulmasy agreed problems are infrequent. But he said there’s wide variation in what tests different hospitals perform to determine if someone’s brain-dead, whether they’re a potential organ donor or not. Doctors are debating whether to add additional test requirements. Stricter criteria could 'assure the public that we have done enormous due diligence before we determine that somebody’s dead,' he said. It could help 'to get people to stop ripping up their organ donor cards.' —- John Leicester, the AP's chief correspondent in Paris, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Israel approves two bills that could halt UNRWA's aid delivery to Gaza. What does that mean?	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Israel's parliament has passed two laws that could prevent the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, a main provider of aid to Gaza, from being able to continue its work. The laws ban the agency, UNRWA, from operating in Israel, designate it a terror organization, and cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. It's the culmination of a long-running campaign against the agency, which Israel contends has been infiltrated by Hamas. But supporters say Israel's real aim is to sideline the issue of Palestinian refugees. The agency is the major distributor of aid in Gaza and provides education, health and other basic services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region, including in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The head of the agency, Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini, called the move 'unprecedented' on X following the vote and said the bills 'will only deepen the suffering Palestinians, especially in Gaza where people have been going through more than a year of sheer hell.' Israel accuses the agency of turning a blind eye to staff members it says belong to Hamas, divert aid and use UNRWA facilities for military purposes. Israel says around a dozen of its 13,000 employees in Gaza participated in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. The agency denies it knowingly aids armed groups and says it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants among its staff. The bills severely hamper UNRWA One of the bills passed Monday evening bans all UNRWA activities and services on Israeli soil and is set to take effect in three months. The second bill designates UNRWA a terrorist organization, severs all ties between government employees and UNRWA and strips its staff of their legal immunities. Together, the bills likely bar the agency from operating in Israel and the Palestinian territories, because Israel controls access to both Gaza and the West Bank. It could force the agency to relocate its headquarters from Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. Lazzarini warned earlier this month that humanitarian operations in Gaza 'may disintegrate' if the legislation passes, disrupting the provision of food, shelter and health care as winter sets in. Gaza's population of some 2.3 million is almost entirely dependent on aid to survive. Around 90% of the population has been displaced. Hundreds of thousands live in tent camps and schools-turned-shelters, most run by UNRWA. Experts say hunger is rampant. Israel’s campaign in Gaza in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attack has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, whose count does not differentiate between civilians and militants. Israel is reportedly considering taking over aid distribution itself or subcontracting it, but it has yet to put forth a concrete plan. Any such effort would likely require a large number of troops and other resources at a time when Israel is at war on two fronts in Gaza and Lebanon. Other U.N. agencies and aid groups say there is no substitute for UNRWA, which also runs 96 schools hosting around 47,000 students, three vocational training centers and 43 health centers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. A decades-old mission rooted in the conflict’s bitter history The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East was established to help the estimated 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation, UNRWA supporters say Israel hopes to erase the Palestinian refugee issue by dismantling the agency. Israel says the refugees should be permanently resettled in other countries, and Israeli opponents of the agency have suggested ending UNRWA services would force them to do so. Palestinians say refugees and their descendants, who now number nearly 6 million, should be allowed to exercise their right under international law to return home. Israel refuses, saying the result would be a Palestinian majority inside its borders. The issue was among the thorniest in the peace process, which ground to a halt in 2009. UNRWA operates schools, health clinics, infrastructure projects and aid programs in refugee camps that have grown into urban neighborhoods in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. A long-running dispute over UNRWA’s neutrality Israel says hundreds of Palestinian militants work for UNRWA, without providing evidence, and that more than a dozen employees took part in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack. UNRWA immediately fired the employees accused of taking part in the Oct. 7 attack, in which Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250. An independent investigation earlier this year found that UNRWA had 'robust' mechanisms to ensure its neutrality but pointed to gaps in implementation, including staff publicly expressing political views and textbooks with 'problematic content' in UNRWA-run schools. UNRWA says it thoroughly investigates any allegations of wrongdoing and holds staff accountable, and that it provides lists of all of its staff to Israel and host countries. It says Israel has largely ignored its requests to provide evidence for its claims against staffers. Israel has repeatedly struck U.N. schools-turned-shelters, claiming Hamas fighters operate inside them. It also says it has uncovered tunnels running near or under UNRWA facilities. UNRWA has long been the biggest single employer in Gaza, where the population has been impoverished by years of Israeli and Egyptian blockade. Hamas has ruled the territory since 2007, and it has civilian political operations alongside its armed wing. The militant wings of Hamas and other groups are highly secretive, their members virtually unknown outside of intelligence agencies. That complicates efforts by civilian organizations to vet employees. Fatah Sharif, an UNRWA teacher in southern Lebanon, was killed last month along with his family in an Israeli airstrike. It then emerged that he was a senior Hamas commander, something he had kept secret. Lazzarini, UNRWA's head, said Sharif was suspended without pay in March after the agency learned he belonged to Hamas’ political party, and that an investigation had been launched. He said he didn’t know Sharif was a militant commander until after his death. UNRWA has strong international support Several Western countries suspended funding for UNRWA after the allegations related to the Oct. 7 attack. All except the United States, which had been its biggest donor, have since restored it. The Biden administration recently warned Israel that if it did not allow more aid into Gaza it could lose out on some of the crucial American military assistance it has relied on throughout the war. The letter sent by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to their Israeli counterparts said they shared Israeli concerns about 'the serious allegations' of UNRWA employees taking part in the Oct. 7 attack and of 'Hamas misusing UNRWA facilities.' But it said enacting the bills’ restrictions 'would devastate the Gaza humanitarian response at this critical moment ... which could have implications under relevant U.S. law and policy.' A joint statement from Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Britain last week expressed 'grave concern' over the legislation. It said the agency provides 'essential and life-saving humanitarian aid,' the provision of which would be 'severely hampered, if not impossible' without it. ___ Frankel and Lidman reported from Jerusalem. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-un-aid-refugees-16bc0524adc947b95abe25d7d9eca038	2024-10-28T09:10:09-07:00	
Albania stops a ship suspected of harboring massive amounts of toxic waste from docking	TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albania prevented Monday a ship suspected of transferring a huge amount of hazardous waste from docking at Tirana’s main port, officials said, after a watchdog group alerted authorities. The Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A ship was kept about a mile away from the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital. Prosecutors ordered the containers to be seized and stored 'at an environmentally and physically safe place' to monitor. The Seattle-based Basel Action Network nongovernmental organization, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, said it flagged the ship to authorities in August following a whistleblower's note that its '102 containers' are suspected of carrying 'an estimated 2,100 total metric tonnes of ... waste pollution control filter dust from the steel industry.' BAN said the 'massive shipment' first left Durres on July 4th, 2024, on two Maersk chartered ships with the 'intended destination of Thailand.' The group said it also alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a leading Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the shipment was loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said. The customs documentation stated the containers harbored iron oxide, according to local reports. Albanian opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material. Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment's documents were verified and that iron oxide is 'not considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.' Jim Puckett, BAN’s head, was in Durres when the ship arrived and called on authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency. The group also wants to analyze the samples in 'different labs in parallel.' He told reporters they suspected the toxic steel furnace dust was collected from pollution control filters from an Albanian company and also illegally smuggled from Kosovo and Germany. 'It is up to the Albanian government to find a solution for their elimination,' Puckett said. Puckett told The Associated Press that government officials said the prosecutor’s office in Durres has taken control of the ship at the anchorage and that he can liaise with them to get the needed samples. 'We very much hope the wastes will be properly sampled and analyzed with third parties ... so that the public can trust in the result,' a BAN statement said. Albania is looking to integrate into the European Union and the government has been keen on aligning its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, banning 'the export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.' There has been no immediate comment from the Ministry of Tourism and Environment.	https://apnews.com/article/albania-toxic-waste-environment-organization-alarm-404112bd77ec535a33d486bbd6718c82	2024-10-28T07:35:23-07:00	
The Latest: Trump and Harris enter the final stretch of the 2024 campaign	Uncertainty reigns entering the final full week of the 2024 campaign with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a fiercely competitive presidential contest. What happens in the coming days will be pivotal in deciding the winner of next week's election. Trump on Sunday held a rally at Madison Square Garden where several speakers made racist and crude remarks, including comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who described Puerto Rico as 'a floating island of garbage.' Shortly after those remarks, Puerto Rican reggaeton artist Bad Bunny endorsed Harris. Trump plans to hold a rally in Atlanta Monday evening while Harris will make several campaign stops in Michigan, including a rally with singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: ‘We cannot rest on tradition’ Vice President Kamala Harris told an audience at a semiconductor facility in Saginaw County, Michigan, on Monday that their work represents 'the best of who we are as a country,' balancing the traditions of the nation and the desire to push technology forward. 'When we understand who we are as a nation, we take great pride in being a leader on so many things. And we have a tradition of that,' she said at the Hemlock Semiconductor facility in central Michigan. 'But I think that what we know as Americans is that we cannot rest on tradition.' Harris added: 'We have to constantly be on top of what is happening, what is current, and investing in the industries of the future, as well as honoring the traditions and the industries that have built up America’s economy.' Hemlock Semiconductor recently received a $325 million federal grant for a new factory. Trump will speak to reporters at Mar-A-Lago on Tuesday The Republican nominee for president will deliver what his campaign is calling 'remarks to the press' at 10 a.m. at his private club and residence in Palm Beach, Florida. It is unclear whether the former president will take questions. Americans in Puerto Rico can’t vote for US president. Their anger at Trump is shaping the race SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A comic calling Puerto Rico garbage before a packed Donald Trump rally in New York was the latest humiliation for an island territory that has long suffered from mistreatment, residents said Monday in expressions of fury that could affect the presidential election. Puerto Ricans cannot vote in general elections despite being U.S. citizens, but they can exert a powerful influence with relatives on the mainland. Phones across the island of 3.2 million people were ringing minutes after the speaker derided the U.S. territory Sunday night, and they still buzzed Monday. ▶ Read more about Puerto Ricans’ response to the remarks Biden criticizes Musk’s $1M giveaway as ‘inappropriate’ President Joe Biden said it was 'totally inappropriate' for Elon Musk to pledge to give away $1 million a day to voters for signing his political action committee’s petition. The billionaire and owner of the social platform X has gone all-in on Republican Donald Trump. The giveaway has raised questions and alarms among some election experts who say it is a violation of the law to link a cash handout to signing a petition that also requires a person to be registered to vote. 'I think it’s totally inappropriate,' he said in Delaware where he just voted. Since Labor Day, the campaigns have made more visits to Pennsylvania than to other states The Democratic and Republican presidential tickets are heading into the final week of campaigning with a familiar strategy: Rally supporters in the handful of states that will decide the race. Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin have received the most attention from Kamala Harris, Donald Trump and their running mates since the Labor Day weekend — the point when campaigning traditionally intensifies. The Democratic ticket has been more active over the past two weeks, according to Associated Press tracking of the campaigns’ public events. From Oct. 14 through this past weekend, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held 42 campaign events over the seven swing states while Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, held 25. There has been a stark contrast in Wisconsin: Harris and Walz visited the state eight times between Oct. 14 and Sunday, compared to just one visit by Trump and Vance during that span. The Republicans are headed back to Wisconsin this week, including a rally in Milwaukee. The AP tracker shows that from Labor Day through this past weekend both campaigns have made more visits to Pennsylvania (43) than to Georgia, Arizona and Nevada combined (40).

Biden calls Trump’s New York rally ‘simply embarrassing’ In response to Donald Trump’s New York rally where speakers made crude and racist insults, President Joe Biden said: 'It’s simply embarrassing. That’s why this election is so important.' Biden was speaking after he voted Monday in Delaware. 'Most of the presidential scholars I’ve spoken to talk about the single most consequential thing about a president is character. Character,' Biden said. 'And he puts that in question every time he opens his mouth.' Biden has voted in the 2024 election President Joe Biden waited in line for about 40 minutes Monday before he cast his ballot. He handed his identification to the election worker, who had him sign and then announced: 'Joseph Biden now voting.' As Biden voted behind a black drape, some first-time voters were announced and the room erupted in cheers for them. Alaska Sen. Murkowski says neither Trump nor Harris will get her vote U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican and outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump, says she won’t vote for him or Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, in the general election. 'I want to vote for somebody and not against someone,' she told the Anchorage Daily News. She added she was disappointed with the choices from both major parties. Murkowski voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection and also called for him to resign. She said she didn’t vote for him in 2016 or 2020. 'I am going to be voting for someone and hopefully I will feel good about that, even knowing that that individual probably is not going to be in the winner column,' Murkowski said. Murkowski declined to say who would get her vote. There are six other candidates on the Alaska ballot for president, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. even though he dropped out of the race in August. Biden is waiting in line to cast his ballot When President Joe Biden arrived at the polling place at the Delaware Department of Elections on Monday, there was a long line of people lined up waiting to vote. He chatted with some and was pushing an older woman in a wheelchair who was ahead of him in line. They were all casting ballots early for the Nov. 5 election. Harris: Trump is ‘fixated on his grievances, on himself, and on dividing our country’ Kamala Harris said Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square helped prove her point about the stakes of the election. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Harris said the Sunday event 'really highlighted the point that I’ve been making throughout this campaign,' which is that Trump is 'fixated on his grievances, on himself, and on dividing our country, and it is not in any way something that will strengthen the American family, the American worker.' Harris plans to deliver her closing argument on Tuesday in Washington. 'There’s a big difference between he and I,' she said.

US voters concerned about post-election violence and efforts to overturn the results: AP-NORC poll WASHINGTON — American voters are approaching the presidential election with deep unease about what could follow, including the potential for political violence, attempts to overturn the election results and its broader implications for democracy, according to a new poll. The findings of the survey, conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, speak to persistent concerns about the fragility of the world’s oldest democracy, nearly four years after former President Donald Trump’s refusal to accept the 2020 election results inspired a mob of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol in a violent attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power. About 4 in 10 registered voters say they are 'extremely' or 'very' concerned about violent attempts to overturn the results after the November election. A similar share is worried about legal efforts to do so. And about 1 in 3 voters say they are 'extremely' or 'very' concerned about attempts by local or state election officials to stop the results from being finalized. ▶ Read more about the latest AP-NORC poll Biden breakfasts in Wilmington with Rep.

Blunt Rochester, who has served as Delaware’s lone House member since 2017, is trying to become the first Black woman elected to represent Delaware in the U.S. Senate. Biden formally endorsed Blunt Rochester in a video released on Sunday evening by the lawmaker’s campaign. He is set to cast his early-vote ballot later Monday before heading back to Washington. Harris says she’d take a cognitive test if asked to As former President Donald Trump continues to attack Vice President Kamala Harris with deeply personal insults, he has also suggested she should take a cognitive test. In an interview with CBS News, Harris said 'sure' when asked whether she’d take such a test. 'I would challenge him to take the same one,' Harris said. 'I think he actually is increasingly unstable and unhinged and has resorted to name-calling because he actually has no plan for the American people.' It’s the same line Trump used when President Joe Biden was still running for president as questions swirled about the 81-year-old’s age and mental acuity following his disastrous debate performance in June. Trump is 78 and is now the oldest candidate to run for office. Biden plans to cast an early ballot on Monday President Joe Biden plans to cast an early ballot on Monday near his home outside Wilmington, Delaware, according to the White House. For all but a few years since 1970, Biden has held office or has been running for one during election season. But this year, his hopes lie with a newer generation of Democrats, including three on the Delaware ballot looking to make history. Vice President Kamala Harris, who Biden endorsed after dropping out of the presidential race in July, is vying to become the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Meanwhile, state Sen. Sarah McBride is looking to become the first openly transgender candidate to be elected to the U.S. House. McBride is aiming to succeed Democrat Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, who is looking to become Delaware’s first Black woman to win the U.S. Senate seat. She has served as Delaware’s lone representative in the House since 2017. Biden on Sunday evening formally endorsed Blunt Rochester, cutting a video for her campaign in which he called her 'Delaware through and through.' Harris highlights costs of living, abortion rights and border security as 3 immediate priorities Kamala Harris says she has three immediate legislative priorities when she takes office, should she be elected president. In an interview with CBS News, Harris said her first priority will be reducing costs for Americans with an expanded child tax credit and efforts to reduce the cost of groceries and make homes more affordable. The second is to work to restore abortion rights protections and the third will be to work on passage of a border security bill. Harris and Republican Donald Trump are in a tight race for the White House. Harris heads to Michigan Kamala Harris will focus on manufacturing jobs Monday as she heads back to Michigan. She’s set to visit Corning’s Hemlock Semiconductor Next Gen Facility. The Saginaw company received a $325 million investment from the CHIPS and Science Act, legislation passed by the Biden administration. She’s then touring a labor training facility in Macomb County. The election is in a week and one day, and Harris is hoping to appeal to many different voting blocs in the battleground states, in a dead-heat race with Donald Trump. On Tuesday she’ll give a closing speech in Washington. Here’s what to watch in the final full week of the presidential campaign Uncertainty reigns entering the final full week of the 2024 campaign with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a fiercely competitive presidential contest. What happens in the coming days will be pivotal in deciding the winner.

Attack on a Chad military base kills 40 soldiers, presidency says	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Unidentified assailants killed at least 40 soldiers during an overnight attack on a military base in the country’s west, Chad’s presidency said Monday. President Mahamat Deby Itno visited the base in Barkaram, an island in Chad's Lake region, early morning and announced the launch of a military operation to track the assailants, according to a statement from the presidency. Chad has long battled with an insurgency in the country’s west, near the border with Nigeria. It was not immediately known who was behind the latest attack, but previous attacks in the region have been blamed by the government on the Boko Haram militant group. In March, an attack the government blamed on Boko Haram killed seven soldiers, reviving fears of violence in the Lake Chad area, after a period of peace following a successful operation launched in 2020 by the Chadian army to destroy the extremist group’s bases there. Schools, mosques and churches reopened and humanitarian organizations returned. Boko Haram, which launched an insurgency more than a decade ago against Western education, seeks to establish Islamic law in Nigeria’s northeast. The insurgency has spread to West African neighbors including Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Chad, a country of nearly 18 million people, has been reeling from political turmoil before and after a controversial presidential election that resulted in Deby Itno’s victory. He had led the country as interim president during the period of military rule that followed the death of his father in 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/chad-military-base-attack-50da737aa5f71456d19dbeaf9378d84f	2024-10-28T04:14:00-07:00	
More than 43,000 Palestinians killed in yearlong war in Gaza, Palestinian Health Ministry says	CAIRO (AP) — The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 43,000 people have been killed in the yearlong war with Israel, more than half of them were women and children. The tally includes 96 dead who arrived at hospitals in Gaza over the past two days, it said Monday. The ministry says at least 43,020 people have been killed and 101,110 others wounded since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023.

NATO confirms that North Korea has sent troops to join Russia's war in Ukraine	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO on Monday confirmed that North Korean troops have been sent to help Russia in its almost three-year war against Ukraine and said some have already been deployed in Russia’s Kursk border region, where Russia has been struggling to push back a Ukrainian incursion. 'Today, I can confirm that North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, and that North Korean military units have been deployed to the Kursk region,' NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told reporters. Rutte said that the move represents 'a significant escalation' in North Korea’s involvement in the conflict and marks 'a dangerous expansion of Russia’s war.' Adding thousands of North Korean soldiers to Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II will pile more pressure on Ukraine’s weary and overstretched army. It will also stoke geopolitical tensions in the Korean Peninsula and the wider Indo-Pacific region, including Japan and Australia, Western officials say. Russian President Vladimir Putin is keen to reshape global power dynamics. He sought to build a counterbalance to Western influence with a summit of BRICS countries, including the leaders of China and India, in Russia last week. He has sought direct help for the war from Iran, which has supplied drones, and North Korea, which has shipped large amounts of ammunition, according to Western governments. Ukraine, whose defenses are under severe Russian pressure in its eastern Donetsk region, could get more bleak news from next week’s U.S. presidential election. A Donald Trump victory could see key U.S. military help dwindle. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry announced Monday that Russian troops have captured the Donetsk village of Tsukuryne — the latest settlement to succumb to the slow-moving Russian onslaught. Rutte spoke in Brussels after a high-level South Korean delegation, including top intelligence and military officials as well as senior diplomats, briefed the alliance’s 32 national ambassadors at NATO headquarters. Rutte said NATO is 'actively consulting within the alliance, with Ukraine, and with our Indo-Pacific partners,' on developments. He said he was due to talk soon with South Korea’s president and Ukraine’s defense minister. 'We continue to monitor the situation closely,' he said. He did not take questions after the statement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, citing intelligence reports, claimed last Friday that North Korean troops would be on the battlefield within days. He previously said his government has information that some 10,000 troops from North Korea were being readied to join Russian forces fighting against his country. Days before Zelenskyy spoke, American and South Korean officials said there was evidence North Korea had dispatched troops to Russia. The U.S. said around 3,000 North Korean troops had been deployed to Russia for training. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-north-korea-nato-ukraine-war-9b7357344d988ea32d8ca21f6e22dcc5	2024-10-28T03:27:36-07:00	
In wartime Ukraine, soccer fans bury rivalries and find a moment of calm at matches	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — At soccer games in Ukraine, crowd sizes are determined by the capacity of the nearest bomb shelter. For the first time since the full-scale war began in 2022, the Ukrainian Premier League is holding a full season with fans present, as martial-law bans on public gatherings have been eased. Despite the constant threat of airstrikes, Dynamo Kyiv supporters eagerly snap up the 1,700 tickets available for each home game at the 16,000-seat Valeriy Lobanovskyi Stadium. Many fans are keen to experience a rare moment of calm, free from the country’s traditionally intense sporting rivalries. While the war forced Dynamo to relocate its home matches in the Europa League to Hamburg, Germany, it uses its home stadium in Kyiv for domestic league matches. Vitalii Kozubra brought his 9-year-old son Makar to watch Dynamo, a title contender, face mid-table Zorya Luhansk, a club displaced by Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine. 'Even though there’s a war going on, this is something people can enjoy together,' Kozubra said, noting the friendly atmosphere at the stadium, where Zorya fans mingled with locals. Makar marveled at the difference between watching a game in person and on television. As the players took the field, all 22 of them draped in Ukrainian yellow-and-blue flags, the crowd, which included servicemen and families with children, erupted in applause. The stadium was alive with the sound of players’ exertion and the thud of the ball. Children rushed to the touchline for autographs, drawn by the few foreign players from Brazil, Senegal, Ivory Coast and Panama who have chosen to remain despite the war. Zorya wasn’t booed once. Sirens and shelters Ukraine’s 16-team top-flight league has managed to continue, despite increasing challenges. Matches are scheduled for early afternoon due to frequent power outages and the logistical challenges of travelling across Europe’s second-largest country during war. When air raid sirens interrupt play – sometimes for hours – players and fans alike head to shelters as alarms blare from loudspeakers and thousands of mobile phones. 'This season, we’ve been lucky in Kyiv, with no air alarms during our home games,' said Dynamo club spokesman Andrii Shakhov. 'But it’s a different story for away games... The longest one we had lasted 4½ hours because of four air alarms.' Ukrainian soccer players are subject to the draft at age 25 but clubs can apply for exemptions under business protection rules. Two teams currently play permanently outside their home field due to the war, amid broader disruption, while two others withdrew after fighting started due to stadium damage. The country's soccer tradition dates back to its Soviet past, when it was a soccer powerhouse, producing top-tier players and coaches. In the 1980s, fan movements often became expressions of Ukrainian identity, defying Soviet authority. After Ukraine declared independence in 1991, soccer continued to be a source of national pride through years of political and financial turmoil. Ukraine reached the quarterfinals of the 2006 World Cup and co-hosted the 2012 European Championships. Rivalries have been set aside At home, supporters’ groups have set aside violent rivalries for more than a decade, ever since they united to back protesters during the deadly 2013-14 uprisings against Russian influence. Later, they organized military recruitment drives to fight in the ensuing wars. 'Dexter,' a red-bearded Dynamo supporter and civilian contractor for the military, explained why the truce among rival fan groups still holds. 'It became necessary because we needed to unite against a common enemy. These internal conflicts lost their relevance when people from rival fan groups ended up fighting together in the same military units,' he said, while walking his dog along the banks of the Dnipro River. He added that fan organizations are involved in nearly every aspect of the war effort, from active combat duty to fundraising, veteran support, and providing technical skills like computer programming to the military. He and others serving in or working alongside the armed forces spoke on the condition that they be identified only by their call signs in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol. Dynamo officials estimate that more than 80% of their pre-2022 fanbase is now serving on the front lines in eastern Ukraine or performing other military duties. Soccer fans at the front Eight hours east of Kyiv, in the Kharkiv region bordering Russia, servicemen from the 3rd Assault Brigade played a match on a field near bombed-out buildings. Many of these fighters had been recruited through soccer-related channels and acquaintances. 'Organized fans play a huge role in this war because they’re highly motivated,' said a serviceman with the call sign 'Shtahet,' a Dynamo supporter currently on deployment. Combat medic 'Poltava' noted that soccer remains a vital morale booster. 'We get together whenever we can and rent spaces to play,' he said. 'There’s not much entertainment here, so football is our only joy.' Back in Kyiv, Dynamo fan 'Escobar' was grateful to catch a game while home on leave before heading back to the front. 'This is football, it’s a game,' the soldier said, in uniform and wearing a camouflage bucket hat, after Dynamo’s 2-0 win over Zorya. 'There are no bad feelings between the teams, and it’s great to see such a friendly atmosphere.' Vitaliy Buyalskyi and Maksym Braharu scored second-half goals for Dynamo, and even though Zorya players looked dejected as they walked off the field, they were still applauded by the fans. ___ Dmytro Zhyhinas and Evgeniy Maloletka in Kyiv contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-war-soccer-football-russia-bd4904af397834c4d8fd2baa9b9f8b3a	2024-10-28T03:00:44-07:00	
Founder of far-right English Defense League gets 18 months in prison for court contempt	LONDON (AP) — The founder of the far-right English Defense League was sentenced Monday to a year and a half in prison for violating a court order barring him from repeating libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, admitted in Woolwich Crown Court that he was in contempt of court for violating a 2021 injunction by giving interviews in a podcast and shown on YouTube, and in a documentary he presented during a rally in London's Trafalgar Square in July that was also posted on his X account and widely viewed. Justice Jeremy Johnson said Robinson’s breaches of the injunction were not 'accidental, negligent or merely reckless' but a 'planned, deliberate, direct, flagrant breach of the court’s orders.' 'The defendant has not shown any remorse for his breaches of the order. It would have been surprising had he done so,' Johnson said. 'All of his actions so far suggest he regards himself as above the law.' Robinson, 41, who has been jailed in the past for assault, mortgage fraud and contempt of court, founded the nationalist street protest group EDL in 2009 in response to radical Islam preacher Anjem Choudary. Even after the group faded from view around 2013, he remained one of the most influential far-right figures in Britain and can still draw large crowds to the streets. This summer, police blamed EDL for starting what became a week of rioting across England and Northern Ireland after social media users falsely identified the suspect in a stabbing rampage that killed three young girls in the seaside community of Southport as an immigrant and a Muslim. Robinson, who was out of the country at the time of the attack, was blamed for using his social media presence to stir up the unrest. Although he was banned from Twitter in 2018, he was allowed back after Elon Musk took over the social network and now has 1 million followers on the platform now known as X. Thousands of people rallied in support of Robinson on Saturday in central London at a Unite the Kingdom rally that he planned but wasn’t able to attend because he had been jailed ahead of the hearing. Robinson was locked up Friday on a warrant issued after he failed to appear for the court contempt hearing in July and left the country for Cyprus. He had been ordered not to repeat false allegations he made in 2018 that a teen, Jamal Hijazi, was a violent thug who bullied and threatened other students at a school in West Yorkshire in northern England. Videos Robinson made about Hijazi were viewed more than 1 million times and led to abuse being directed at the boy. He dropped out of school and his family had to leave their home. Hijazi successfully sued Robinson for libel in London's High Court and was awarded 100,000 British pounds ($130,000) in damages and his court costs. An injunction was issued that prevented Robinson from repeating the allegations. But Robinson violated the injunction 10 times since 2023, most notably by airing a documentary, titled 'Silenced,' he made on the case that has been viewed more than 44 million times. Defense lawyer Sasha Wass insisted that Robinson was a journalist who believed in free speech and stood by the documentary, which she said was produced by Alex Jones, the U.S. conspiracy theorist who founded Infowars. 'He acted the way that he did, and he accepts his culpability, because he passionately believes in free speech, a free press and the overwhelming desire that he has to expose the truth,' Wass said. 'Having said all of that, he accepts the breaches as set out, but wants me to make it clear on his behalf that at all times he was following his principles.' Attorney Aidan Eardley, on behalf of the Solicitor General, said that disobeying a court order created a risk that others might not respect court orders. 'The harm here is that millions of people could see Mr. Yaxley-Lennon thumbing his nose at the court,' Eardley said. Robinson's supporters packed the gallery in court and crowded outside the courthouse during the hearing. Robinson, who stood in the dock in a gray suit and white shirt, looked at the dozens of people in the gallery and shrugged his shoulders as the sentence came down. He pounded his chest as he left the courtroom.	https://apnews.com/article/tommy-robinson-contempt-of-court-english-defense-league-2234f6eef821543feb688441c019384f	2024-10-28T02:55:09-07:00	
Philippine ex-President Duterte says he kept a 'death squad' as mayor to kill criminals	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte told a Senate inquiry Monday that he had maintained a 'death squad' of gangsters to kill other criminals when he was mayor of a southern Philippine city. Duterte, however, denied authorizing police to gun down thousands of suspects in a bloody crackdown on illegal drugs he had ordered as president and which is the subject of an investigation by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity. Duterte, 79, attended the televised inquiry in his first public appearance since his term ended in 2022. The Senate is looking into the drug killings under Duterte, which were unprecedented in their scale in recent Philippine history. Duterte acknowledged without elaborating that he once maintained a death squad of seven 'gangsters' to deal with criminals when he was the longtime Davao city mayor, before he became president. 'I can make the confession now if you want,' Duterte said. 'I had a death squad of seven, but they were not policemen, they were also gangsters.' 'I’ll ask a gangster to kill somebody,' Duterte said. 'If you will not kill (that person), I will kill you now.' Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III, who was overseeing the inquiry, and Sen. Risa Hontiveros, pressed Duterte to provide more details but the former president responded in unclear terms and said he would explain further in the next hearing. Often cursing during the hearing, Duterte said he would take full responsibility for the killings that happened while he was president from 2016 to 2022. But he said he never ordered his national police chiefs, who also attended the inquiry, to undertake extrajudicial killings. 'Did I ever tell you to kill any criminal?' Duterte asked his former police chiefs. They included Ronald Dela Rosa, the current senator who first enforced Duterte's campaign against illegal drugs as his national police chief. 'No, Mr. president,' dela Rosa responded. Aside from the International Criminal Court’s ongoing investigation, there have been no known criminal complaints filed against Duterte in Philippine courts over the killings. 'I’m puzzled why the Justice Department hasn’t filed any case,' Duterte said. 'I’ve been killing people for a long time and they haven’t filed any case up to now?' Former Sen. Leila de Lima, one of the most vocal critics of Duterte who once investigated the drug killings in Davao, said there was adequate evidence and witnesses of the extrajudicial killings but they were scared of testifying against Duterte when he was in power. De Lima was arrested early on in Duterte’s presidency on drug charges she said were fabricated to stop her from proceeding with her Senate investigation. She was cleared of the charges and released from more than six years of detention last year. 'This man, the former mayor of Davao city and the former president of the Republic of the Philippines, for so long has evaded justice and accountability,' said de Lima, sitting near the former president. 'We have not made him to account after all these years,' she said, and added that witnesses could now surface and help prosecute Duterte and his associates. Arturo Lascanas, a retired police officer who served under Duterte for many years in a unit fighting heinous crime in Davao, told The Associated Press in an interview in 2022 that as many as 10,000 suspects may have been killed in Davao city on orders of Duterte and the former mayor’s key aides, including him. Lascanas, who has gone into hiding abroad, said he had provided his testimony and other evidence to the International Criminal Court. Duterte's associates may have removed the remains of the large number of victims buried in a quarry site in Davao city but Lascanas said the remains of some victims who were buried elsewhere by his group of policemen could still be retrieved and used as key evidence against the former leader and others. Duterte sounded defiant through the hearing. 'If I’m given another chance, I’ll wipe all of you,' Duterte said of drug dealers and criminals, who he added had resumed their criminal actions after he stepped down from the presidency. One of Asia’s most unorthodox contemporary leaders, Duterte ended his turbulent six-year term in June 2022, closing out more than three decades in the country’s often-rowdy politics, where he built a political name for his expletives-laced outbursts and disdain for human rights and the West while reaching out to China and Russia. Activists regarded him as 'a human rights calamity' not only for the widespread deaths under his so-called war on drugs but also for his brazen attacks on critical media, the dominant Catholic church and political opposition.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-duterte-death-squad-killings-fc44bd8305f8e5468dcc6528825170fc	2024-10-28T01:34:11-07:00	
Georgia's president urges West to back protests against governing party after it claims election win	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgia's president on Monday urged the West to support opposition protests against the official results of a weekend parliamentary election in which the governing party was declared victorious amid voting irregularities and allegations of Russian meddling. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, who refused to recognize the official results, told The Associated Press in an interview that the South Caucasus nation has fallen victim to Russian pressure aimed at derailing its plans to join the European Union. 'We’ve seen that Russian propaganda was directly used,' said Zourabichvili, a fierce critic of the governing party. She said Georgia's government has been 'working hand-in-hand with Russia' and probably had help from the Russian security services. On Sunday, Zourabichvili stood alongside opposition leaders and urged Georgians to join a rally on the main street of the capital, Tbilisi, on Monday night to protest what she called a 'total falsification, a total stealing of your votes.' She told the AP that she expects the U.S. and the EU to back the protests. 'We need to have the firm support of our European partners, of our American partners,' Zourabichvili said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on the social media platform X that 'the Georgian people embraced democracy yesterday' and urged Georgia’s political leaders to 'respect the rule of law, repeal legislation that undermines fundamental freedoms, address deficiencies in the electoral process, and move Georgia toward its Euro-Atlantic future.' The Kremlin has rejected the accusations of interference. 'We aren't meddling in Georgia's internal affairs, and we have no intention of meddling,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. He charged that it was the West that had tried to influence the outcome of the vote. Asked about Zourabichvili's call for the Georgians to join protests, he described it as an attempt to destabilize the country. The Central Election Commission said Sunday that the governing Georgian Dream party received 54.8% of Saturday’s votes with almost all ballots counted. The party — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — has become increasingly authoritarian over the past year, adopting laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech. The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely because of a Russian-style 'foreign influence law' passed in June. Many Georgians viewed Saturday’s vote as a pivotal referendum on the opportunity to join the EU. The election campaign in the nation of 3.7 million people, which borders Russia, was marked by a bitter fight for votes and allegations of a smear campaign. European electoral observers said the election took place in a 'divisive' environment marked by intimidation and instances of vote buying, double voting and physical violence. During the campaign, Georgian Dream used 'anti-Western and hostile rhetoric ... promoted Russian misinformation, manipulations, and conspiracy theories,' said Antonio López-Istúriz White, the head of the European Parliament monitoring delegation. The election observers said instances of intimidation and electoral violations were particularly noticeable in rural areas. Georgian Dream scored its highest share of the vote — almost 90% — in the Javakheti region of southern Georgia. In the capital it received no more than 44% in any district. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, a member of Georgian Dream, on Sunday described his party’s success as 'impressive and obvious,' and that 'any attempts to talk about election manipulation ... are doomed to failure.' Initial figures suggested voter turnout was the highest since Georgian Dream was first elected in 2012. The party has vowed to continue the push toward EU accession but also 'reset' ties with Georgia's former imperial master, Russia. In 2008, Georgia fought and lost a brief war with Russia, which then recognized the independence of two breakaway Georgian regions and beefed up its military presence there. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, called on Georgian officials to 'swiftly, transparently and independently investigate' the electoral irregularities and urged the governing party to demonstrate its 'firm commitment' to the EU. Hungary’s Victor Orbán was the first foreign leader to congratulate Georgian Dream and will be the first to visit Georgia and meet the prime minister during a trip to Tbilisi on Monday and Tuesday. ___ Associated Press journalist Sophiko Megrelidze contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-russia-european-union-protests-f6667dd64b537bd2082bfc5396f4a955	2024-10-28T01:18:11-07:00	
Borissov appears winner of Bulgaria’s parliamentary election	SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — The center-right GERB party of ex-premier Boyko Borissov appears to be the winner of Bulgaria’s parliamentary election, the country’s central electoral commission said Monday, with 98% of the ballots counted. Results showed the GERB party receiving 26.5% of the vote, nearly 12 percentage points more than the pro-Western reformist bloc led by the We Continue the Change party. Seven other parties also appear to have gained seats in the 240-seat chamber, according to the latest results. The far-right, ultranationalist and populist party Vazrazhdane came in third with 13.5% of the vote. Capitalizing on pro-Russian sentiments shared by many in this former communist nation, it demands that Bulgaria lift sanctions against Russia, stop helping Ukraine, and hold a referendum on its membership in NATO. The Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which traditionally represented Bulgaria’s large ethnic Turkish minority, recently split into two rival factions, one around party founder Ahmed Dogan, and the other behind U.S.-sanctioned businessman and former media tycoon Delyan Peevski. Both factions entered parliament — the first with 7%, and the latter with 11% of the vote. The remaining seats in the chamber will be divided between four small populist and pro-Russian groups, among them the Socialist Party — heir of the once-almighty Communist Party. It could take days before the final official results are announced. If confirmed, Borissov will be handed a mandate to form his fourth government. In his first comment after the vote, Borissov described his party’s victory as 'categorical' and said that he was ready to compromise to form a coalition with all other parties except Vazrazhdane. But it seems Borissov will face an uphill struggle to cobble together a governing coalition. Political analysts predicted that the results, which do not differ significantly from the six previous elections held within the past three-and-a-half years, will be followed by difficult coalition talks. They don’t rule out another election.	https://apnews.com/article/bulgaria-parliament-election-government-borissov-russia-e280c068db463f13c458735aa212d63e	2024-10-28T00:52:57-07:00	
The trajectory of Ukraine's fight against Russia hangs on the outcome of the US election	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — There is no doubt that the U.S. election will determine the trajectory of the war in Ukraine. The status of military aid from Kyiv’s chief international backer is dependent on who becomes president, as is any prospect for a cease-fire that could benefit Ukraine. Some in Kyiv say the country's very existence hinges on who wins the White House. As Americans vote, exhausted and outmanned Ukrainian soldiers are holding defensive lines under constant Russian fire, knowing the results will dictate their future. The war in Ukraine is one of the most divisive issues of the Nov. 5 election: Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, advocate very different views on how much support the U.S. should continue to give Ukraine. After a whirlwind Western tour, Kyiv’s leaders have tried to promote their version of what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls his 'victory plan.' They hope key decisions will be made — including Ukraine’s bid for NATO membership — by the new administration. For now, they have no choice but to wait. 'We believe that regardless of the last name of the future president of the U.S., the country of the United States will not give up global dominance, global leadership as such. And this is possible only through the support of Ukraine and through the defeat of the Russian Federation,' said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy. Harris would likely continue Biden's policies Harris, who has decried President Vladimir Putin's 'brutality,' would likely carry on President Joe Biden's policy of support, albeit within the strict limits on Ukraine's ability to strike deep inside Russian territory that have frustrated Kyiv's leaders. 'President Biden has made it clear from the beginning of this conflict that his top priority has been to avoid an all-out war with Russia. I think that remains the top American priority,' said Malcom Chalmers, deputy director general at the Royal United Services Institute in London. The U.S. has provided Ukraine more than $59.5 billion in military weapons and assistance since Russia invaded in February 2022. But throughout, Kyiv has been captive to fraught American politics that often undermined its battlefield potential. Ukraine lost territory and manpower as weapons stocks dwindled during the six months it took the U.S. Congress to pass an aid package. Even promised military assistance has failed to arrive on time or in sufficient quantities. Ukraine is still hoping for Western approval of strikes inside Russian territory with longer-range weapons supplied by its allies. It also holds hundreds of square kilometers (square miles) in Russia's Kursk region after an incursion in August. Still, Biden’s commitment to support Ukraine has never wavered. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a $400 million package during his recent visit. Zelenskyy said he expects another worth $800 million, the first tranche for Ukraine’s production of long-range capabilities. Still another $8 billion is expected by the end of the year. But for some, all that is too late. 'If the amount of aid that was promised but not delivered had been fulfilled, we could have entered negotiations in a stronger position with Russia,' said Gen. Lt. Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff. Trump's vague vows and praise for Putin Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine, made vague vows to end the war and has praised Putin. He also is considered highly unpredictable. Some Ukrainian officials even privately welcome this quality, saying it could bring about results quicker. But so much is unknown about what decisions Trump would make. 'He has emphasized that he has a very different approach to Ukraine than Kamala Harris. And if what he’s saying now is translated into action, then it’s going to be a very rocky period for Ukraine,' Chalmers said. 'Donald Trump is raising the very distinct probability that the United States will cut off most if not all military aid to Ukraine, which given that the situation on the ground, although deadlocked, is one which Russia currently has the advantage, could tip the balance in Russia’s favor,' he added. Podolyak said Trump 'understands the logic' of Zelenskyy’s plans after meeting with him. 'Mr. Trump realized that there is no way to agree on something in this war, because it is necessary to ensure Russia’s compulsion to understand what a war is, what consequences Russia will have in this war. That is, Russia can be forced to do something, but not asked.' Faced with Trump’s harsh rhetoric, some Ukrainian officials say that despite his stated views, his actions as president at times benefited Ukraine. Some of the toughest sanctions fell on Russia’s elite during his administration. Trump also approved the sale of lethal weapons to Ukraine, something President Barack Obama fell short of doing. Most Ukrainians fear Trump will halt all military aid to Kyiv, and no other country can match the U.S. support. Ukrainian soldiers remain defiant, saying they'll continue to hold the line, no matter what. But the practical implications would be dire, and Kyiv may be forced to accept devastating cease-fire terms, with a fifth of its territory under Russian control. 'If the aid is stopped, the situation will become more complicated,' Romanenko said. 'In this case, the seizure of Ukrainian land will continue, but we do not know how fast, because their offensive potential is not unlimited.' Zelenskyy's plans hang in the balance Zelenskyy has presented his vision for ending the war to both Trump and Harris, arguing for its necessity. He said Ukraine hopes for a post-election response from Washington, particularly on the question of NATO membership, insisting that such an invitation be irreversible. Both Ukraine and Russia are feeling considerable economic and societal strain to maintain the war effort. For the first time, Zelenskyy has openly discussed the potential for a partial cease-fire. But important questions remain about the fate of Russian-occupied territories. Russia has allocated a large part of its government budget to defense spending and continues to lose thousands of men. The potential introduction of what Zelenskyy has put at 10,000 North Korean troops signals that Moscow is having issues with mobilizing new conscripts. Ukraine's battered energy infrastructure and struggling mobilization drive is under far more pressure than Russia, however. Kyiv must find a way to de-escalate the intensity of the war and attacks on shipping and energy assets. 'In the end, it’s only going to happen if both sides calculate that they will get a net benefit from doing so,' Chalmers said. 'My concern would be in the uncertainty of the coming months when the Russians may believe that one last push and they can really get much larger concessions from the Ukrainians,' he added. Zelenskyy’s plans were developed with this reality in mind. It's why his team insists Russia must be forced to talk rather than convinced to do so. Without nuclear weapons to serve as a deterrent, NATO is the only logical alternative. 'I said, ‘We don’t have nuclear weapons, and we are not in NATO, and we will not be in NATO during the war. That’s why I need this package. And you cannot be against it,’' Zelenskyy said, describing his argument to reporters. ___ Follow AP's coverage of Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine#	https://apnews.com/article/election-ukraine-war-russia-harris-trump-b709d17bf1e81531853bd85fb8414ece	2024-10-27T21:58:12-07:00	
France's president is visiting Morocco after his Western Sahara change brings a 'new honeymoon'	RABAT, Morocco (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron arrives Monday in Morocco, where he is expected to meet with the North African kingdom’s leaders and discuss partnerships regarding trade, climate change and immigration. During the president’s three-day visit to Rabat, he is scheduled to meet with King Mohammed VI and Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch and address Morocco’s Parliament. It comes months after Macron changed France’s longstanding public position and backed Morocco’s autonomy plan for the disputed Western Sahara. The move endeared the country to Morocco and alienated it from Algeria, which hosts refugee camps governed by the pro-independence Polisario Front and has long pushed for a U.N.-organized referendum to solve the conflict. In the days leading up to the visit, Moroccan publications lauded the 'warm reunion' and a 'new honeymoon' between the two countries while French flags were hung throughout Rabat. France and Morocco have historically partnered on issues ranging from counterterrorism to Western Sahara. Morocco is the top destination for French investment in Africa and France is Morocco’s top trade partner. Morocco imports French cereals, renewable energy infrastructure like turbines and weapons. Morocco exports goods to France including tomatoes, cars and airplane parts. Moroccans are among the largest foreign-born communities in France, where North African immigrants are a key political constituency and a focal point of debates about the roles of Islam and immigration in French society. In recent months, France’s new Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has pushed for the country to take a hard-line approach toward immigration and seek deals with countries like Morocco to better prevent would-be migrants from crossing into Europe. On Macron’s last visit to Morocco, he and King Mohammed VI inaugurated Al Boraq, Africa’s first high-speed rail line, made possible by French financing and trains manufactured by the French firm Alstrom. Despite close ties, relations have at times been fragile between France and Morocco, which was a French protectorate from 1912 to 1956. In 2021, Morocco suspended consular relations France momentarily reduced the number of visas offered to Moroccans in protest of its refusal to provide documents needed to deport people who migrated to France without authorization. Relations between the two countries soured further that year when a 2021 report revealed Morocco’s security services had used Israeli spyware to infiltrate the devices of activists and politicians, including Macron. Morocco denied and sued over the allegations.	https://apnews.com/article/morocco-france-macron-visit-rabat-76c3a7d87b0a86d89d7749909c69e4c8	2024-10-27T21:12:59-07:00	
Developers begin cutting trees in a Tokyo park that environmentalists want to protect	TOKYO (AP) — Tree-cutting began Monday in the Jingu Gaien park district of central Tokyo, a flashpoint for more than a year between environmentalists and real estate interests. Developers led by real-estate company Mitsui Fudosan have a 10-year, multi-billion-dollar plan to build three skyscrapers on the coveted land and to raze a historical baseball stadium, replacing it with a new stadium. A small group of protesters gathered Monday. They object to the destruction of trees in a city that lacks green space and is seeing many parks handed over to commercial interests. The plan is backed by Tokyo Gov. Yuiko Koike, who once was Japan’s environmental minister.	https://apnews.com/article/developers-destruction-park-tokyo-japan-tree-cutting-1dd27843bb70d1b2b6fe1285dd27d5fa	2024-10-27T21:10:14-07:00	
Woman charged with assaulting Australian senator who shouted at the king	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A woman appeared in an Australian court on Monday charged with a May assault on the Indigenous senator who shouted at King Charles III during a royal reception last week. The assault allegedly occurred on May 25, when independent Sen. Lidia Thorpe attended an Australian Rules Football match in her hometown of Melbourne. Ebony Bell, 28, appeared by a video link in Melbourne Magistrates’ Court. She has been charged with two counts of recklessly causing injury and three counts of unlawful assault at a stadium. A police statement described the 51-year-old senator’s injuries from the alleged assault as 'minor.' But she said in a statement to the AP on Monday she had 'sustained serious nerve and spinal injuries in my neck, which required spinal surgery and a plate to be inserted.' The assault was reported to police the next day and Bell was arrested on July 25. The women knew each other, but the motive for the alleged attack was not explained in court. Bell’s lawyer Manny Nicolosi told Magistrate Belinda Franjic the prosecution case had 'real deficiencies.' He said the prosecution had on Friday made an 'offer,' an apparent reference to a plea deal. 'I haven’t had enough time to really consider it,' Nicolosi told the court. Nicolosi explained that his Indigenous client hadn’t appeared in court in person because of 'recent threats.' The lawyer did not elaborate on those threats. Bell remains free on bail until she appears in court next on Nov. 22. The magistrate agreed to allow her to appear again by video. Thorpe made her first public statement about the alleged assault after she launched an expletive-laden rant at Charles during a reception in Australian Parliament House in Canberra last week. 'You are not our king. You are not sovereign,' Thorpe yelled at Charles as she was led by security guards from the reception. 'You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us: our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people,' she added. The main opposition party has called for Thorpe to resign from the Senate due to her attitude toward Charles, who is Australia’s head of state, and have requested legal advice. Thorpe is renowned for high-profile protest action. When she was affirmed as a senator in 2022, she wasn’t allowed to describe the then-monarch as 'the colonizing Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.' She briefly blocked a police float in Sydney’s Gay and Lesbian Madri Gras last year by lying on the street in front of it. Last year, she was also banned for life from a Melbourne strip club after video emerged of her shouting abuse at male patrons. She revealed her injuries after The Australian newspaper reported she had missed 16 of the Senate's 44 sitting days this year. 'I was ordered by the doctor not to travel and could not attend parliament after I sustained the injury and during recovery from surgery. My doctor told me to take time off work,' her statement said. 'I would have preferred to keep this matter private and I will not be commenting on it further at this stage,' she added. Thorpe was widely criticized for being disrespectful to the monarch during her outburst last week. She faces a further backlash next week when senators sit for the first time since the royal visit. Her office said Monday she has not decided whether she plans to attend senate committee meetings in person or remotely. She also raised questions about the validity of her appointment to the Senate when she recently said she had deliberately affirmed her allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II and her 'hairs,' rather than 'heirs,' during her affirmation ceremony in 2022 to exclude Charles. Thorpe later walked back that statement, saying the mispronunciation was accidental. Lawyers agree that a mispronunciation did not invalidate an affirmation and that Thorpe also signed a written version of the affirmation of allegiance with the correct wording. Sydney University constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey said the Senate's ability to discipline Thorpe was limited because her outburst occurred outside the chamber in Parliament's Great Hall.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-senator-assaulted-king-charles-lidia-thorpe-6433e69a991a429b7e26587bec7ac485	2024-10-27T20:36:14-07:00	
A French court postpones Gérard Depardieu's sex assault trial because of his health	PARIS (AP) — A criminal court in Paris on Monday postponed French actor Gérard Depardieu's trial on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a film set because of concerns about his health, shifting the start of the proceedings to March. Depardieu, who has denied any wrongdoing, is accused of using 'violence, coercion, surprise or threat' in the alleged sexual assaults that prosecutors say took place in 2021 on the set of 'Les Volets verts' ('The Green Shutters.') The court also ordered an expert to assess the 75-year-old actor's health issues. Depardieu’s lawyer Jérémie Assous requested the postponement, saying that the actor has heart trouble and diabetes-related issues. Assous said that doctors decided the actor was not well enough to attend the proceedings even though he was eager to appear in court. 'He is anxious to defend himself, because for over three years, a huge number of inaccuracies, false information and lies have been systematically disseminated and relayed,' Assous told The Associated Press. 'Now, finally, we’re going to be able to have the word of the defense.' Lawyers for both women also argued in favor of the postponement, saying that their clients want to hear Depardieu’s explanations. Prosecutors say that in both cases, women reported that the actor trapped them between his legs and groped their buttocks, genitals, chest and breasts over their clothes. Outside the courtroom, one of the plaintiffs, a 53-year-old production designer, said 'it was extremely difficult to listen to all this violence,' after hearing Depardieu's lawyer defending his client. 'He questioned everything … There were a lot of lies, about almost everything actually.' The Associated Press doesn’t generally identify victims of sexual assault without their consent. Feminist activists protest outside the court France continues to reckon with sexual violence in the wake of the #MeToo movement that initially struggled to find traction, especially in the cinema industry. Depardieu 'is a coward,' French actor Anouk Grinberg told the AP outside the courtroom. Grinberg, who played in 'The Green Shutters,' said she showed up to court 'because I can’t take it anymore... And the impunity, it’s got to stop, society can’t allow it'. About 100 people gathered outside the court on Monday, some holding signs, responding to a call from several feminist groups to show support for victims of sexual violence. Some activists made their way into the courtroom and sat among other members of the general public attending the hearings. Blanche Sabbah, a women’s rights activist, said 'we’re here even though Gérard Depardieu will not show up.' The plaintiffs 'have shown up. They’re here and I am here to support them. That’s why all of these feminists are here.' Prosecutors say there were witnesses on the film set According to Paris prosecutors, the production designer told investigators that Depardieu had earlier made sexual remarks and then one day, as she walked past him, he 'grabbed her, pulled her toward him, blocked her with his legs, and groped her waist, hips and chest, accompanying his gestures with obscene remarks.' Prosecutors said three people witnessed it, and that the woman made an attempt to break away from Depardieu’s grip and seemed 'shocked.' A psychiatrist examined her and granted her a seven-day leave, they said. After the incident, it was arranged for Depardieu to apologize. But in a TV interview that aired Saturday, the woman said the actor was furious and blamed her for causing trouble. Prosecutors said witnesses confirmed that what Depardieu had said did not constitute an apology. In the interview with French online news site Mediapart, the production designer — who spoke on camera but only gave her first name — said the incident had taken a toll on her personal and professional life for at least 18 months. She said she could not sleep well, suffered anxiety attacks and lost weight. The month before the incident, another woman working on the film set had complained about Depardieu, prosecutors said. A director’s assistant told investigators that Depardieu had touched her buttocks on several occasions. She said she had expressed her disapproval and in return Depardieu had been insulting toward her. She was also given a six-day leave by a psychiatrist. Members of the film industry back Depardieu Many have come out in support of Depardieu, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who later expressed 'regret' about not having spoken about the importance for victims to speak out. Late last year, 56 French performers, writers and producers published an essay defending the film star, saying that when 'Gérard Depardieu is targeted this way, it is the art (of cinema) that is being attacked.' Their call came just weeks after national broadcaster France 2 put out a documentary outlining accusations of sexual misconduct by 16 women against Depardieu, and showed the actor making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea. In the footage, Depardieu can be seen making groaning sounds and sexual comments in front of women, including a girl about 10 years old who is riding a horse. He can also be seen posing for a photo, saying he was 'touching the bottom' of a North Korean interpreter by his side. Depardieu was charged in 2020 with rape and sexual assault following allegations from actor Charlotte Arnould. In an open letter, Depardieu said last year, 'I have never, ever abused a woman.' The actor was long seen as a national icon in France. He has been a global ambassador for French film and enjoyed international fame with several roles in Hollywood. —- AP Journalists Nicolas Garriga and Marine Lesprit contributed to the story.	https://apnews.com/article/depardieu-france-sexual-assault-film-d4f9a91e413483ceb49394e754e46d73	2024-10-27T19:42:09-07:00	
Myanmar's civil war reshaped in past year with coordinated offensive by powerful resistance groups	BANGKOK (AP) — Three well-armed militias launched a surprise joint offensive in northeastern Myanmar a year ago, breaking a strategic stalemate with the regime’s military with rapid gains of huge swaths of territory and inspiring others to attack around the country. Before the offensive, the military’s control had seemed firmly ensconced with its vast superiority in troops and firepower, and aided with material support from Russia and China. But today it is increasingly on the back foot, with the loss of dozens of outposts, bases and strategic cities that even its leaders concede will be challenging to regain. How did the offensive unfold? The military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, giving rise to intensified fighting with long-established armed groups associated with Myanmar’s ethnic minority groups, and sparking the formation of new pro-democracy militias. But until the launch of Operation 1027, eponymously named for its Oct. 27 start, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, had largely been able to prevent major losses around the country. Operation 1027 brought coordinated attacks from three of the most powerful ethnic armed groups — the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, together known as the Three Brotherhood Alliance — and they were able to quickly capture towns and overrun military bases and outposts along the Chinese border in northeastern Shan state. Two weeks later the Arakan Army launched attacks in its home western state of Rakhine, and since then other militia groups and PDFs have joined in around the country. A year later into the offensive, resistance forces now fully or partially control a vast horseshoe of territory that reaches from Rakhine state in the west, across the north, and then south into Kayah and Kayin states along the Thai border. The Tatmadaw has pulled back toward the center around the capital Naypyidaw and largest city of Yangon. What comes next? Many expect the military to launch a counteroffensive when the rainy season soon comes to an end, bolstered with the influx of some 30,000 new troops since activating conscription in February and its continued complete air superiority. But at the same time, resistance groups are closing in on Mandalay, Myanmar’s second largest city in the center of the country. Facing threats from all around the country, 'it doesn’t look like there’s any viable route back for the military to recapture any of the territory that it’s lost,' said Connor Macdonald of the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar advocacy group. 'The military is on the defensive all over the country, and every time it puts its energy into one part of the country, it basically has to shift troops and then is vulnerable in other parts,' he said. What has happened to Myanmar's civilian population? As the military has faced setbacks in the fighting on the ground, it has been increasingly relying on indiscriminate air and artillery strikes, resulting in a 95% increase in civilian deaths from airstrikes and a 170% increase in civilians killed by artillery since the 1027 offensive began, according to a report last month by the United Nations’ Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Tatmadaw has been accused of deliberately targeting civilians in retribution for perceived support for the resistance militias, something it denies. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting, and there are now more than 3 million internally displaced people in Myanmar overall, and some 18.6 million people in need, according to the U.N. What happens if the military regime falls? As the front has expanded it has seen militias advancing out of their own ethnic areas, like when Rakhine-based Arakan Army in January seized the Chin town of Paletwa, which has given rise to some friction between groups — foreshadowing possible future problems should the Tatmadaw eventually fall. At the moment there is a degree of solidarity between the disparate ethnic groups with the focus on a common enemy, but Aung Thu Nyein, director of communications for the Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar think tank said that does not translate to common aspirations. Should the Tatmadaw fall, that could lead to the fragmentation of Myanmar unless the groups work hard to resolve political and territorial differences. 'The resistance being able to bring down the junta is unlikely, but I cannot discount this scenario,' he said. 'If we cannot build trust and common goals, it could lead to the scenario of Syria.' Complicating the political picture is the influence of neighboring China, which is believed to have tacitly supported the 1027 offensive in what turned out to be a successful bid to shut down organized crime activities that had been flourishing along its border. In January, Beijing used its close ties with both the Tatmadaw and the Three Brotherhood groups to negotiate a ceasefire in northern Shan, which lasted for five months until the ethnic alliance opened phase two of the 1027 offensive in June, accusing the military of violating the ceasefire. China has been displeased with the development, shutting down border crossings, cutting electricity to Myanmar towns and taking other measures in a thus-far unsuccessful attempt to end the fighting.	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-civil-war-militia-1027-offensive-takeaways-63b33397204b8ff78ede24f1e699ceef	2024-10-27T19:34:44-07:00	
Resistance forces push military regime close to brink in Myanmar	BANGKOK (AP) — Three well-armed militias launched a surprise joint offensive in northeastern Myanmar a year ago, breaking a strategic stalemate with the regime's military with rapid gains of huge swaths of territory and inspiring others to attack around the country. The military's control had seemed firmly ensconced with vast superiority in troops and firepower, plus material support from Russia and China.

'To us it doesn't look like there's any viable route back for the military to recapture any of the territory that it's lost.' The military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, triggering intensified fighting with long-established armed militias organized by Myanmar's ethnic minority groups in its border regions, which have struggled for decades for more autonomy. The army's takeover also sparked the formation of pro-democracy militias known as People's Defense Forces. They support the opposition National Unity Government, which was established by elected lawmakers barred from taking their seats after the army takeover. But until the launch of Operation 1027, eponymously named for its Oct. 27 start, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, had largely been able to prevent major losses around the country. Operation 1027 brought coordinated attacks from three of the most powerful ethnic armed groups, known as the Three Brotherhood Alliance: the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army. The alliance quickly captured towns and overran military bases and outposts along the Chinese border in northeastern Shan state. Two weeks later, the Arakan Army launched attacks in its western home state of Rakhine, and since then other militia groups and PDFs have joined in around the country. Myanmar's military has been pushed back to the country's center A year after the offensive began, resistance forces now fully or partially control a vast horseshoe of territory. It starts in Rakhine state in the west, runs across the north and then heads south into Kayah and Kayin states along the Thai border. The Tatmadaw has pulled back toward central Myanmar, around the capital Naypyidaw and largest city of Yangon. 'I never thought our goals would be achieved so quickly,' Lway Yay Oo, spokesperson for the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, told The Associated Press. 'We only thought that we would attack the military council together to the extent we could, but it has been easier than expected so we’ve been able to conquer more quickly.' Along the way, the Tatmadaw has suffered some humiliating defeats, including the loss of the city of Laukkai in an assault in which the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army captured more than 2,000 troops, including six generals; and of the city of Lashio, which had been home to the military's Northeast Command. 'The 1027 offensive was a highly impressive operation, quite complex, and the use of drones played a big role because basically they were able to dismantle the military's network of fire-support bases across northern Shan,' said Morgan Michaels, a Singapore-based analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies who runs its Myanmar Conflict Map project. 'And then, once the military's artillery support eroded, they were able to overrun harder targets like towns and battalion headquarters.' A year later, the military is 'substantially weakened,' he said, but it's too early to write it off. The military has been weakened, but not defeated The Tatmadaw has managed to claw back the town of Kawlin in the Sagaing region, which had fallen in the first days of the 1027 offensive, stave off an attack by three ethnic Karenni militias on Loikaw, the capital of Kayah state, and has retained administrative control of Myawaddy, a key border crossing with Thailand, after holding off an assault by one ethnic group with the assistance of a rival militia. Many expect the military to launch a counteroffensive when the rainy season soon comes to an end, bolstered by some 30,000 new troops since activating conscription in February and its complete air superiority. But at the same time, resistance groups are closing in on Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city, in the center of the country. And where they might be out-gunned, they have gained strength, hard-won experience and confidence over the last year, said the Ta’ang National Liberation Army's Lway Yay Oo. 'We have military experience on our side, and based on this experience we can reinforce the fighting operation,' she said. Thet Swe, a spokesperson for the military regime, conceded it will be a challenge for the Tatmadaw to dislodge the Three Brotherhood Alliance from the territory it has gained. 'We cannot take it back during one year,' he told the AP in an e-mailed answer to questions. 'However, I hope that I will give you a joyful message ... in (the) coming two or three years.' Civilian casualties rise as the military turns more to indiscriminate strikes As the military has faced setbacks in the fighting on the ground, it has been increasingly relying on indiscriminate air and artillery strikes, resulting in a 95% increase in civilian deaths from airstrikes and a 170% increase in civilians killed by artillery since the 1027 offensive began, according to a report last month by the United Nations' Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Tatmadaw has been accused of deliberately targeting civilians whom it believes support the resistance militias, a tactic that is only turning more against them, said Isabel Todd, coordinator for the SAC-M group. 'It doesn't seem to be having the effect that they want it to have,' she said. 'It’s making them even more hated by the population and really strengthening the resolve to ensure that this is the end of the Myanmar military as it’s known.' Military spokesperson Thet Swe denied targeting civilians, saying it was militia groups that were responsible for killing civilians and burning villages. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting, and there are now more than 3 million internally displaced people in Myanmar overall, and some 18.6 million people in need, according to the U.N. At the same time, the 2024 humanitarian response plan is only 1/3 funded, hindering the delivery of aid, said Sajjad Mohammad Sajid, head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs operation in Myanmar. 'The humanitarian outlook for the next year is grim, and we anticipate that the deteriorating situation will have a massive impact on the protection of civilians,' he said in an interview. In some areas, however, the offensive has eased pressure, like northwestern Chin state, which borders Bangladesh and India and had previously been the focus of many of the Tatmadaw's operations, said Salai Htet Ni, a spokesperson for the Chin National Front whose armed wing has been involved in fighting the military. 'In October of last year the military convoys that were going up into the Chin mountains were withdrawn,' he said. 'As a result of the 1027 operation there have been almost no major military activities.' Success brings new tensions between resistance groups As the front has expanded it has seen militias advancing out of their own ethnic areas, like when Rakhine-based Arakan Army in January seized the Chin town of Paletwa, which has given rise to some friction between groups, foreshadowing possible future strife should the Tatmadaw eventually fall. In the case of Paletwa, Salai Htet Ni said his group was happy that the AA took it from the Tatmadaw, but added that there should have been negotiations before they began operating in Chin territory and that the AA should now bring Chin forces in to help administer the area. 'Negotiations are mandatory for these regional administration issues,' he said. 'But we will negotiate this case through dialogue, not military means.' At the moment there is a degree of solidarity between the different ethnic groups as they focus on a common enemy, but Aung Thu Nyein, director of communications for the Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar think tank said that does not translate to common aspirations. Should the Tatmadaw fall, it could lead to the fragmentation of Myanmar unless the groups work hard to resolve political and territorial differences. 'As far as I see, there is no established mechanism to resolve the issues,' he said. 'The resistance being able to bring down the junta is unlikely, but I cannot discount this scenario, (and) if we cannot build trust and common goals, it could lead to the scenario of Syria.' Chinese interests and ties with both sides complicate the picture Complicating the political picture is the influence of neighboring China, which is believed to have tacitly supported the 1027 offensive in what turned out to be a successful bid to largely shut down organized crime activities that had been flourishing along its border. In January, Beijing used its close ties with both the Tatmadaw and the Three Brotherhood groups to negotiate a ceasefire in northern Shan, which lasted for five months until the ethnic alliance opened phase two of the 1027 offensive in June, accusing the military of violating the ceasefire. China has been displeased with the development, shutting down border crossings, cutting electricity to Myanmar towns and taking other measures in a thus-far unsuccessful attempt to end the fighting. Its support for the regime also seems to be growing, with China's envoy to Myanmar urging the powerful United Wa State Army, which wasn't involved in the 1027 offensive or related fighting, to actively pressure the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and Ta’ang National Liberation Army to halt the renewed offensive, according to leaked details of an August meeting widely reported by local media. There is no evidence that the UWSA has done that, however. 'The idea that the northern groups and the Three Brotherhood Alliance etc. are somehow just agents of China is a complete misconception,' Todd said. 'They have their own objectives which they are pursuing that are independent of what China may or may not want them to do, and that's apparent in the incredible amount of pressure that China has put on them recently.' Because of the grassroot support for the resistance, it is less vulnerable to outside influence, said Kyaw Zaw, a spokesperson for the opposition National Unity Government. 'No matter who is putting pressure on us, we are winning because of the power of the people,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-civil-war-militia-1027-offensive-60c0edaed37153fde75b1b838670c441	2024-10-27T19:33:56-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares rise and the yen dips after Japan's ruling party loses majority	TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares rose Monday, as the yen dipped in the midst of political uncertainty after Japan's ruling party lost its majority in Parliament's lower house in weekend elections. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 153.76 Japanese yen from 152.24 yen. It was trading at 140-yen levels last month. The euro cost $1.0796, down form $1.0803. The weak yen is a boon for Japan's giant exporters like Toyota Motor Corp., whose stock gained 3.7% in Tokyo trading. Nintendo Co. gained 2.6%, while Sony Corp. rose nearly 2.0%. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is still the top party, but several members failed to win reelection in Sunday's vote after a scandal involving unreported campaign funding. All told, the ruling coalition with junior partner Komeito secured 215 seats, down sharply from the majority of 279 it previously held, according to Japanese media. A change of government is not expected but the LDP may need a third coalition partner. Tokyo stocks rose. Analysts say the ruling party defeat had been greatly expected and factored into markets from before. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 surged 1.6% in morning trading to 38,527.52. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained nearly 0.1% to 8,217.80. South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.6% to 2,598.73. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.1% to 20,614.74, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.3% to 3,310.63. On Wall Street, U.S. stock indexes finished last week, drifting to a mixed finish, giving the market its first losing week since early September. The S&amp;P 500 closed little changed after having been up 0.9% earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% and also posted its first weekly loss after six straight gains. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.6%. Company earnings reports, which have been mostly solid, continue to be a key focus for investors. More than a third of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 index have reported their latest quarterly financial results. Most of the results have beat analysts' forecasts. Companies from around the world are scheduled to report earnings in coming weeks. Treasury yields ended last week broadly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.24% Friday from 4.21% late Thursday. Yields have generally climbed following reports showing the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. Wall Street will have more updates next week on consumer confidence, jobs and inflation. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in two decades in an effort to tame inflation back to 2%, without sinking the economy into a recession. A key report on U.S. consumer spending is expected later this week, called the PCE. Analysts expect it to show that the rate of inflation has eased to 2%. The central bank started cutting interest rates in September and economists expect another cut at its meeting in November. Russia’s central bank on Friday raised its key interest rate by two percentage points to a record-high 21%. Moscow is trying to combat growing inflation sparked by military spending after its invasion of Ukraine. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude fell $3.19 to $68.59 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell $3.25 to $72.80 a barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Damian J. Troise and Alex Veiga contributed to this report.

Middle East latest: Social platform X suspends new account on behalf of Iran's supreme leader	The social platform X has suspended a new account on behalf of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that posted messages in Hebrew. The account was suspended early Monday with a brief note appended to it saying: 'X suspends accounts which violate the X Rules.' It wasn’t immediately clear what the violation was. The Elon Musk-owned social media company did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. The move came after Israel openly attacked Iran for the first time this weekend. Khamenei said in a speech on Sunday that Israel’s strikes — in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack this month — 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for retaliation. The X account opened Sunday with a message in Hebrew reading: 'In the name of God, the most merciful,' a standard Islamic greeting. Khamenei’s office has maintained multiple accounts for the 85-year-old supreme leader on X for years and has sent messages in a variety of languages in the past. A second message corresponded to a speech Khamenei gave on Sunday and was sent on his English account as: 'Zionists are making a miscalculation with respect to Iran. They don’t know Iran. They still haven’t been able to correctly understand the power, initiative, and determination of the Iranian people.' The message referred to Israel’s attack Saturday on Iran. This isn’t the first time Khamenei has seen a suspension or removal from social media. In February, Meta removed Facebook and Instagram accounts for the supreme leader over his support of the militant group Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Social media platforms like X and Facebook have been blocked in Iran for years, requiring Iranians to use virtual private networks to access them. ___ Here’s the latest: UN Security Council schedules emergency meeting at Iran's request UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting Monday afternoon at Iran’s request on Israel’s air strikes against the country. Switzerland, which holds the council’s rotating presidency, announced the meeting on Sunday and said the Iranian request was supported by Russia, China and Algeria, the Arab representative on the council. Iranian president vows to respond ‘appropriately’ to Israeli strikes TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian says his country will respond to Israel 'appropriately,' after Israel openly attacked Iranian military sites for the first time this weekend. 'We are not seeking war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country and will respond appropriately to the Zionist regime’s aggression,' Pezeshkian was quoted by state TV on Sunday as saying. Pezeshkian also said the U.S. had promised Iran to stop the war in Gaza and Lebanon if Iran restrained. 'They had promised to end the war in response to our restraint, but they did not keep their word,' he said. The Iranian president also warned tensions will escalate if Israel’s aggression continues, adding, 'We know that the United States is encouraging Israel to commit these atrocities.' Iran says a civilian was killed in Israel's attack DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran announced Sunday that a civilian had been killed in Israel’s attack on the country, without offering any details on the circumstances of his death. The state-run IRNA news agency identified the dead man as Allahverdi Rahimpour and said he lived in a suburban area of southwestern Tehran. While offering no details on what he was doing or where he was killed, IRNA made a point to say he was not a member of Iran’s armed forces. Iran has offered few details on the attack and the damage caused by them so far.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-28-october-2024-6e9675722f26251037569ee8ae655088	2024-10-27T18:55:06-07:00	
Brazilian soccer fan dies after ambush by rival supporters	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian authorities said a Cruzeiro soccer fan has died after a roadside ambush by rival supporters in São Paulo state on Sunday morning. The fan was confirmed dead at a hospital in the city of Mairipora, 46 kilometers (28 miles) north of Sao Paulo. Local media reports said at least 12 fans were injured in the same attack. The Cruzeiro fans were traveling back to Belo Horizonte by bus after their team's 3-0 loss at Athletico Paranaense in the top-tier Brazilian league on Saturday. Brazil's federal road police told journalists the victim was a 30-year-old man, but did not provide more details. São Paulo’s public security secretariat said the attack was carried out by ultra supporters of rival Palmeiras. Footage on Brazilian TV showed a bus on fire and several Cruzeiro fans lying on the sidewalk as Palmeiras supporters punched them and hit them with sticks. Cruzeiro said on its social media channels that it 'deeply regrets yet another incident of fan violence' in Brazil. The club also said 'several fans were wounded.' Sao Paulo-based Palmeiras has not commented so far. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-cruzeiro-fan-death-ambush-0cb52ae9343a350a289a6c40764e605e	2024-10-27T12:23:41-07:00	
Shohei Ohtani set to play for Dodgers in Game 3 of World Series following shoulder injury	NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani is set to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 3 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium on Monday night despite a partially dislocated left shoulder. Ohtani got hurt sliding into second base when he was caught stealing to end the seventh inning of Saturday night’s 4-2 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 2 at Los Angeles. 'I just don’t see him not playing Game 3,' Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before Sunday night's workout at Yankee Stadium. 'If he feels good enough to go, then I see no reason why he wouldn’t be in there.' Ohtani did not travel with the team to New York in order to undergo imaging. He was on a separate flight. 'As far as test results, we’ve got doctors scrambling everywhere. I don’t have them,' Roberts said. 'This is more me going by the training staff, Shohei feeling good this morning, range of motion, strength.' Ohtani was due to arrive at the ballpark in time for the workout, which started at 6 p.m. EDT. Roberts said Ohtani had taken dry swings since the injury and was going to hit off a tee and take batting practice in an indoor cage. 'That’s going to be telling,' the manager said. 'He’s got to still go through the workout and swing the bat, but, again, today feels better than yesterday, and our assumption is tomorrow’s going to feel better than today.' Roberts said the injury causes pain but 'it's just everyone’s tolerance.' 'I don’t see him being compromised,' he added. 'It’s the left shoulder, which is the back shoulder. So I don’t see how that affects his hitting, if he’s able to go.' Seeking their eighth title and second in five years, the Dodgers lead 2-0 in the best-of-seven Series. Walker Buehler starts Game 3 for Los Angeles against Clarke Schmidt. Ohtani hits leadoff, and Roberts is counting on his presence. 'If he is able to play, willing to play, he’s going to play,' the manager said. 'Schmidt will know that Shohei’s in the box, so that means everything.' Ohtani clutched his left forearm after being tagged by shortstop Anthony Volpe for the final out in the seventh on a feetfirst slide. He laid near the bag for a couple of minutes before being tended to by athletic trainers and leaving the field. The likely NL MVP was 0 for 3 with a walk in Game 2. He is 1 for 8 in the first two games of the Fall Classic and is batting .260 with three home runs and 10 RBIs in his first postseason in the majors. A two-time AL MVP with the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani joined the Dodgers last December for a record $700 million, 10-year contract. The 30-year-old Ohtani hit .310 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases, becoming the first player with at least 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season. The two-way star did not pitch this season while recovering from elbow surgery on Sept. 19, 2023, and has been limited to designated hitter. 'Any time you have probably the best baseball player in the world, I think it’s going to help and frees up some of the other guys to kind of play with a little less pressure or a little more freedom,' Buehler said. 'He’s been awesome for the clubhouse and awesome for our team, so it’s been a cool year watching him with the 50-50, just kind of the day to day and the kind of human he is, as well.' Ohtani had been one of the few players on the Dodgers roster who got through the season without a major injury. Nearly every member of the starting rotation spent time on the injured list and the team led the majors in injured list placements with 36 and days on the injured list with 2,342. Among the position players, Mookie Betts was out for nearly two months due to a broken left hand, and Max Muncy was out nearly half the season due to a right oblique strain. Freddie Freeman is playing in the postseason with a sprained right ankle. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-ohtani-dodgers-yankees-e9ad1f46a4a6f12b9aeb99c1dee08db6	2024-10-27T11:36:38-07:00	
British chef Jamie Oliver urges followers to help solve the 'grate cheese robbery'	LONDON (AP) — British chef Jamie Oliver is on the case of the stolen cheddar. Oliver, who rose to fame as 'The Naked Chef' on TV by stripping food down to its essentials, got cheeky in an otherwise serious plea to his social media followers to help solve the mystery of the missing 22 metric tons (48,488 pounds) of award-winning cheddar worth 300,000 British pounds ($390,000) that was stolen in a scam. Calling it the 'grate cheese robbery,' Oliver told his 10.5 million Instagram fans to be on the lookout for 'lorry loads of very posh cheese.' Nearly 1,000 wheels of cloth-wrapped artisanal cheddar were swiped from Neal’s Yard Dairy by a con artist posing as a wholesale distributor for a major French retailer, the company said. The cheese was gone before the company realized it had been scammed and reported the theft Oct. 21. 'If the deal seems too gouda to be true, it probably is! Let’s find these cheese stealers,' Oliver wrote. Cheddar, which is named for the village in southwest England where it originated, is the world's best-known cheese because it does not have the protected status of other regional products like champagne and, thus, is produced in many countries. But there are only a small number of real British cheddar makers, Oliver said. 'These are some of the cheeses, or most of them, that got nicked,' he said in a video accompanying his post. The cheeses were from three makers: Hafod Welsh organic cheddar, Westcombe cheddar, and Pitchfork cheddar. Detectives at Scotland Yard and international authorities are searching for the culprits. Neal's Yard Dairy, a distributor, wholesaler, and retailer of British artisanal cheese, has asked international cheesemongers to be on the lookout for the stolen cheese, particularly in 10-kilogram (22-pound) and 24-kilogram (52-pound) blocks. 'If anyone hears anything about posh cheese going for cheap, it’s probably some wrong’uns,' Oliver said.	https://apnews.com/article/great-cheese-theft-london-cheddar-jamie-oliver-fbaf6d697cd5c7e00de1c95d33837d52	2024-10-27T11:00:10-07:00	
Destruction of Lebanon-Syria border crossings in Israeli airstrikes creates difficulties	QUSAIR, Syria (AP) — A stream of refugees fleeing Lebanon to Syria crossed a narrow makeshift bridge on foot Sunday in the Qusair area of Syria’s Homs province after the official border crossing was put out of commission by an Israeli strike two days earlier. Only three functioning crossings remain between the countries, which share a border 375 kilometers (233 mi) long. In late September, an Israeli airstrike hit the border crossing of Matraba in Lebanon’s northeast, forcing it to close. A few weeks later came a strike on Masnaa, the main crossing between the two countries, putting it out of service. The Jousieh crossing was struck on Friday. The Israeli military has accused the Hezbollah militant group of using the crossings to move weapons and military equipment from Syria to Lebanon. But humanitarian officials say that the closure of the crossings have intensified an already severe humanitarian crisis by blocking key routes for supplies and impeding access for those fleeing to safety. 'The situation is a tragedy,' said Ghossoun Mubarak, who fled with her three children from the city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, describing the bombardment that pushed her to leave her home. They crossed via the makeshift foot bridge on Sunday. The United Nations refugee agency, or UNHCR, said this week that around 430,000 people had crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the past month since Israel launched a major aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Lebanon as part of its push against Hezbollah. Lebanese officials give a higher estimate of more than half a million people. Rula Amin, a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, voiced concern over the damage to the crossings, calling them 'a main lifeline for people escaping the conflict.' 'Today, it was better,' said Omar Abu Jabal, 29, who was returning to Lebanon Sunday via the Jousieh crossing after a work trip. 'No issues along the way. But before, there were bombings, which stopped people from moving.' Nabil Aakoul, director of transportation for the Homs province, said the recent strikes destroyed a bridge over the Orontes River, disrupting movement between vital agricultural areas. Aakoul estimated that rebuilding the bridge will cost around 35 billion Syrian pounds (around $2.5 million dollars at the official exchange rate), while the damage has severed access to agricultural areas and isolated communities dependent on cross-river trade and travel. Yahya Abu Youssef, who lives near the damaged bridge, described the strike as 'inhumane' and reported injuries to children and livestock nearby. 'All that’s here is a bridge connecting villages and farms,' he said, noting that villagers now face an additional 10 kilometers (6 miles) of travel to reach the city of Homs.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-israel-border-crossing-qusayr-hezbollah-051cf8de4bf5bb5a9448e562ec06fb19	2024-10-27T10:28:48-07:00	
Russian forces thwart attempted cross-border assault from Ukraine, official says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces thwarted an attempt at another cross-border incursion by Ukraine into southwestern Russia, a local official reported Sunday, months after Kyiv staged a bold assault on its nuclear-armed enemy that Moscow is still struggling to halt. An 'armed group' sought Sunday to breach the border between Ukraine and Russia’s Bryansk region, its governor, Aleksandr Bogomaz, said but was beaten back. Bogomaz did not clarify whether Ukrainian soldiers carried out the alleged attack, but claimed on Sunday evening that the situation was 'stable and under control' by the Russian military. There was no immediate acknowledgement or response from Ukrainian officials. The region neighbors Kursk province, where Ukraine launched a surprise push on Aug. 6 that rattled the Kremlin and constituted the largest attack on Russia since World War II. Hundreds of Russian prisoners were blindfolded and ferried away in trucks in the opening moments of the lightning advance, and Ukraine’s battle-hardened units swiftly pressed on across hundreds of square miles (square kilometers) of territory. Responsibility for previous incursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Bryansk regions has been claimed by two murky groups: the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion. Russian officials and state media have sought to downplay the significance of Kyiv’s thunderous run in Kursk, but the country’s forces have so far been unable to dislodge Ukrainian troops from the province. Western officials have speculated that Moscow may send troops from North Korea to bolster its effort to do so, stoking the almost three-year war and bringing geopolitical consequences as far away as the Indo-Pacific region. Russian lawmakers Thursday ratified a pact with Pyongyang envisioning mutual military assistance, a move that comes as the U.S. confirmed the deployment of 3,000 North Korean troops to Russia. North Korean units were detected Wednesday in Kursk, according to Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate, known by its acronym GUR. The soldiers had undergone several weeks of training at bases in eastern Russia and had been equipped with clothes for the upcoming winter, GUR said in a statement late Thursday. It did not provide evidence for its claims. Moscow warns West against approving long-range strikes against Russia Also on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow is working on ways to respond if the U.S. and its NATO allies allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with long-range Western missiles. Putin told Russian state TV that it was too early to say exactly how Moscow might react, but the defense ministry has been mulling a range of options. Russia has repeatedly signaled that it would view any such strikes as a major escalation. The Kremlin leader warned on Sept. 12 that Moscow would be 'at war' with the U.S. and NATO states if they approve them, claiming military infrastructure and personnel from the bloc would have to be involved in targeting and firing the missiles. He reinforced the message by announcing a new version of the nuclear doctrine that considers a conventional attack on Russia by a nonnuclear nation that is supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack on his country — a clear warning to the U.S. and other allies of Kyiv. Putin also declared the revised document envisages possible nuclear weapons use in case of a massive air attack, opening the door to a potential nuclear response to any aerial assault — an ambiguity intended to deter the West. Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly said they need permission to strike weapons depots, airfields and military bases far from the border to motivate Russia to seek peace. In response, U.S. defense officials have argued that the missiles are limited in number, and that Ukraine is already using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. That capability was evidenced by a Ukrainian drone strike in mid-September that hit a large Russian military depot in a town 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border. The U.S. allows Kyiv to use American-provided weapons in more limited, cross-border strikes to counter attacks by Russian forces. Civilian deaths reported in Kherson as warring sides trade drone strikes In a separate update, Bryansk Gov. Bogomaz claimed that over a dozen Ukrainian drones were shot down over the region on Sunday. Separately, a total of at least 16 drones were downed over other Russian regions, including the Tambov province some 450 kilometers (290 miles) north from the border, officials reported. There were no reports of casualties from any of the alleged attacks. In Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson, Russian shelling killed three civilians on Sunday, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin claimed. Another Kherson resident died in a blaze sparked by shells hitting a high-rise, according to Ukraine’s Emergency Service. Air raid sirens wailed for over three hours in Kyiv overnight into Sunday, and city authorities later reported that 'around 10' drones had been shot down. They said no one had been hurt. Ukraine’s air force on Sunday reported that it had shot down 41 drones launched by Russia across Ukrainian territory. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-incursion-kursk-5e37bb46493fa704f942e21c9203334c	2024-10-27T09:41:47-07:00	
Iran’s imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate hospitalized with severe health issues	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian authorities have allowed imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi to be hospitalized after almost nine weeks of feeling sick, a group campaigning for the activist said Sunday. The Free Narges Coalition said in a statement that Mohammadi must be granted a medical furlough to receive comprehensive treatment for multiple conditions. It said that just transferring her to the hospital will not address the severe health issues caused by months of neglect and deprivation. Mohammadi is being held at Iran’s notorious Evin Prison, which houses political prisoners and those with Western ties. She already had been serving a 30-month sentence, to which 15 more months were added in January. On Saturday, Iranian authorities issued an additional six-month sentence against her after she staged a protest against the execution of another political prisoner in the women’s ward of Evin Prison on Aug. 6. Mohammadi suffers from heart disease, and according to her medical report issued in September, the main artery of her heart has again developed a serious complication. The coalition said that they continue to demand the unconditional release of Mohammadi and her full access to medical care. Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi in 2003. Mohammadi, 52, has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and years behind bars.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-nobel-narges-mohammadi-hospital-71e1ed0c26b0cfa43c521caa619dab99	2024-10-27T07:34:22-07:00	
Bolivia's former President Evo Morales claims his car was shot at in attempted assassination	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Former President Evo Morales of Bolivia claimed he survived an assassination attempt on Sunday after unidentified men opened fire on his car. He was not injured and there was no immediate confirmation of the attack from authorities. Morales alleged the shots were fired while he was being driven in Bolivia’s coca leaf-growing region of Chapare, the ex-president's rural stronghold whose residents have blockaded the country’s main east-west highway for the past two weeks. The roadblocks — protesting what Morales' supporters decry as President Luis Arce’s attempts to sabotage his former mentor and bitter political rival — have isolated cities and disrupted food and fuel supplies. Morales, who led Bolivia from 2006-2019, emerged unscathed from the alleged attack Sunday, appearing on his weekly radio show in his usual calm manner to recount what happened. He told the radio host that as he was leaving home for the radio station, hooded men fired at least 14 shots at his car, wounding his driver. Morales was quick to blame his successor, President Arce, with whom he is fighting to be the candidate of governing socialist party in next year’s presidential election. He claimed that Arce's government resorted to physical force having been unable to defeat him politically. 'Arce is going to go down as the worst president in history,' Morales said. 'Shooting a former president is the last straw.' Officials in Arce's government did not respond to requests for comment on the incident. Cellphone video circulating online shows Morales' driver bleeding from the back of his head. Morales can be seen in the passenger's seat holding a phone to his ear as the vehicle swerves and a woman's voice shrieks 'Duck!' The footage shows the car’s front windshield cracked by at least three bullets and its rear windshield shattered. Morales can be heard saying, 'Papacho has been shot in the head,' apparently referring to his driver. 'They are shooting at us,' Morales continues on the phone. 'They shot the tire of the car and it stopped on the road.' Morales' claim deepens political tensions in Bolivia at a volatile moment for the cash-strapped Andean nation of 12 million. In June there was an alleged attempted coup by a rogue general. Last month Morales led a massive march against the government's mismanagement of the economy that quickly devolved into street clashes with pro-government mobs. Imported goods are scarce and prices are rising. Drivers wait for hours to fill up at gas stations. The gap between the official and black-market exchange rates is widening. Earlier this month, the feud between Morales and Arce moved to the courts as Bolivian prosecutors launched an investigation into accusations that Morales fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl in 2016, classifying their relationship as statutory rape. Morales has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated and refused to testify in the case. Since reports surfaced of a possible arrest warrant against him, the ex-president has been holed up in the Chapare region, in central Bolivia, where supportive coca growers have kept vigilant watch to protect him from arrest. President Arce accuses Morales of trying to undermine his administration to advance his own ambitions. —— DeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-morales-assassination-attempt-fdddc18fb237d6030782dc49bc4df9cb	2024-10-27T06:30:25-07:00	
On Navajo Nation, a push to electrify more homes on the vast reservation	HALCHITA, Utah (AP) — After a five-year wait, Lorraine Black and Ricky Gillis heard the rumblings of an electrical crew reach their home on the sprawling Navajo Nation. In five days' time, their home would be connected to the power grid, replacing their reliance on a few solar panels and propane lanterns. No longer would the CPAP machine Gillis uses for sleep apnea or his home heart monitor transmitting information to doctors 400 miles away face interruptions due to intermittent power. It also means Black and Gillis can now use more than a few appliances — such as a fridge, a TV, and an evaporative cooling unit — at the same time. 'We’re one of the luckiest people who get to get electric,' Gillis said. Many Navajo families still live without running water and electricity, a product of historic neglect and the struggle to get services to far-flung homes on the 27,000-square-mile (70,000-square-kilometer) Native American reservation that lies in parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Some rely on solar panels or generators, which can be patchy, and others have no electricity whatsoever. Gillis and Black filed an application to connect their home back in 2019. But when the coronavirus pandemic started ravaging the tribe and everything besides essential services was shut down on the reservation, it further stalled the process. Their wait highlights the persistent challenges in electrifying every Navajo home, even with recent injections of federal money for tribal infrastructure and services and as extreme heat in the Southwest intensified by climate change adds to the urgency. ______ EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change. ______ 'We are a part of America that a lot of the time feels kind of left out,' said Vircynthia Charley, district manager at the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, a non-for-profit utility that provides electric, water, wastewater, natural gas and solar energy services. For years, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority has worked to get more Navajo homes connected to the grid faster. Under a program called Light Up Navajo, which uses a mix of private and public funding, outside utilities from across the U.S. send electric crews to help connect homes and extend power lines. But installing power on the reservation roughly the size of West Virginia is time-consuming and expensive due to its rugged geography and the vast distances between homes. Drilling for power poles there can take several hours because of underground rock deposits while some homes near Monument Valley must have power lines installed underground to meet strict regulations around development in the area. About 32% of Navajo homes still have no electricity. Connecting the remaining 10,400 homes on the reservation would cost $416 million, said Deenise Becenti, government and public affairs manager at the utility. This year, Light Up Navajo connected 170 more families to the grid. Since the program started in 2019, 882 Navajo families have had their homes electrified. If the program stays funded, Becenti said it could take another 26 years to connect every home on the reservation. Those that get connected immediately reap the benefits. Until this month, Black and Gillis' solar panels that the utility installed a few years ago would last about two to three days before their battery drained in cloudy weather. It would take another two days to recharge. 'You had to really watch the watts and whatever you’re using on a cloudy day,' Gillis said. Then a volunteer power crew from Colorado helped install 14 power poles while the tribal utility authority drilled holes six feet deep in which the poles would sit. The crew then ran a wire about a mile down a red sand road from the main power line to the couple's home. 'The lights are brighter,' Black remarked after her home was connected. In recent years, significantly more federal money has been allocated for tribes to improve infrastructure on reservations, including $32 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 — of which Navajo Nation received $112 million for electric connections. The Navajo tribal utility also received $17 million through the Biden administration's climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, to connect families to the electric grid. But it can be slow to see the effects of that money on the ground due to bureaucracy and logistics. Next spring, the tribal utility authority hopes to connect another 150 homes, including the home of Priscilla and Leo Dan. For the couple, having grid electricity at their home near Navajo Mountain in Arizona would end a nearly 12 year wait. They currently live in a recreational vehicle elsewhere closer to their jobs, but have worked on their home on the reservation for years. With power there, they could spend more time where Priscilla grew up and where her dad still lives. It would make life simpler, Priscilla said.

Analysis: Iran faces tough choices in deciding how to respond to Israeli strikes	JERUSALEM (AP) — It's Iran's move now. How the Islamic Republic chooses to respond to the unusually public Israeli aerial assault on its homeland could determine whether the region spirals further toward all-out war or holds steady at an already devastating and destabilizing level of violence. In the coldly calculating realm of Middle East geopolitics, a strike of the kind that Israel delivered before dawn Saturday would typically be met with a forceful response. Retaliating militarily would allow Iran's clerical leadership to show strength not only to its own citizens but also to Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon's Hezbollah, the militant groups battling Israel that are the vanguard of Tehran's so-called Axis of Resistance. It is too soon to say whether Iran's leadership will follow that path. Tehran may opt to hold back from forcefully retaliating directly for now, not least because doing so might reveal its weaknesses and invite a more potent Israeli response, analysts say. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are in fact quite serious,' said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in' by military and economic constraints, and the uncertainty caused by the U.S. election and its impact on American policy in the region. Even while the Mideast wars rage, Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been signaling his nation wants a new nuclear deal with the U.S. to ease crushing international sanctions. A carefully worded statement from Iran’s military issued Saturday night appeared to offer some wiggle room for the Islamic Republic to back away from further escalation. It suggested that a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon was more important than any retaliation against Israel. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's ultimate decision-maker, was also measured in his first comments on the strike Sunday. He said the attack 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' and he stopped short of calling for an immediate military response. Saturday's strikes targeted Iranian air defense missile batteries and missile production facilities, according to the Israeli military. With that, Israel has exposed vulnerabilities in Iran’s air defenses and can still step up its attacks, analysts say. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press indicate Israel's raid damaged facilities at the Parchin military base southeast of Tehran that experts previously linked to Iran's onetime nuclear weapons program and another base tied to its ballistic missile program. Current nuclear facilities were not struck, however. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, confirmed that on X, saying 'Iran’s nuclear facilities have not been impacted.' Israel has been aggressively bringing the fight to the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah, killing its leader and targeting operatives in an audacious exploding pager attack. 'Any Iranian attempt to retaliate will have to contend with the fact that Hezbollah, its most important ally against Israel, has been significantly degraded and its conventional weapons systems have twice been largely repelled,' said Ali Vaez, the Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, who expects Iran to hold its fire for now. That's true even if Israel held back, as appears to be the case. Some prominent figures in Israel, such as opposition leader Yair Lapid, are already saying the attacks didn't go far enough. Regional experts suggested that Israel's relatively limited target list was intentionally calibrated to make it easier for Iran to back away from escalation. As Yoel Guzansky, who formerly worked for Israel’s National Security Council and is now a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, put it: Israel's decision to focus on purely military targets 'allows them to save face.' Israel's target choices may also be a reflection at least in part of its capabilities. It is unlikely able to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities on its own and would require help from the United States, Guzansky said. Besides, Israel still has leverage to go after higher-value targets should Iran retaliate — particularly now that nodes in its air defenses have been destroyed. 'You preserve for yourself all kinds of contingency plans,' Guzansky said. Thomas Juneau, a University of Ottawa professor focused on Iran and the wider Middle East, wrote on X that the fact Iranian media initially downplayed the strikes suggests Tehran may want to avoid further escalation. Yet it faces a dilemma. 'If it retaliates, it risks an escalation in which its weakness means it loses more,' he wrote. 'If it does not retaliate, it projects a signal of weakness.' Vakil agreed that Iran's response was likely to be muted and that the strikes were designed to minimize the potential for escalation 'Israel has yet again shown its military precision and capabilities are far superior to that of Iran,' she said. One thing is certain: The Mideast is in uncharted territory. For decades, leaders and strategists in the Middle East leaders have speculated about if and how Israel might one day openly strike Iran, just as they wondered what direct attacks by Iran, rather than by its proxy militant groups, would look like. Today, it's a reality. Yet the playbook on either side isn't clear, and may still be being written. 'There appears to be a major mismatch both in terms of the sword each side wields and the shield it can deploy,' Vaez said. 'While both sides have calibrated and calculated how quickly they climb the escalation ladder, they are in an entirely new territory now, where the new red lines are nebulous and the old ones have turned pink,' he said. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE — Adam Schreck, the Asia-Pacific news director for The Associated Press, spent years covering the Mideast and has reported from countries across the region, including both Iran and Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-war-attack-retaliation-analysis-80a619146abd4f8aee2a7776a8f134d1	2024-10-27T05:04:26-07:00	
More than 120 killed in paramilitary rampage in east-central Sudan, UN and a doctors group say	CAIRO (AP) — Fighters from the notorious paramilitary Rapid Support Forces ran riot in east-central Sudan in a multi-day attack that killed more than 120 people in one town, a doctors group and the United Nations said. It was the group's latest attack against the Sudanese military after suffering a series of setbacks, losing ground to the military in the area. The war, which has been going on for more than a year and a half, has wrecked the African country, displacing millions of its population and pushing it to the brink of a full-blown famine. RSF fighters went on a rampage in villages and towns on the eastern and northern sides of the province of Gezira between Oct. 20-25, shooting at civilians and sexually attacking women and girls, the United Nations said in a statement Saturday, adding that they looted private and public properties, including open markets. The attack displaced more than 4,000 people in the city of Tambiuk and other villages in eastern Gezira, according to the International Organization for Migration’s Tracking Matrix. 'The killings and appalling human rights violations in Gezira province intensify the unacceptable human toll this conflict has taken on the people of Sudan,' IOM Director General Amy Pope told The Associated Press ahead of her trip to the country next week. She called for concerted international efforts to stop the conflict, saying: 'There is no time to lose. Millions of lives are in the balance.' 'These are atrocious crimes,' Clementine Nkweta-Salami, U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, said in a statement on Saturday. 'Women, children, and the most vulnerable are bearing the brunt of a conflict that has already taken far too many lives.' She said the attacks resembled the horrors committed during the Darfur genocide in the early 2000s, including rape, sexual violence, and mass killings. The RSF was born out of Arab militias, commonly known as Janjaweed, mobilized by ex-Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir against populations in Darfur that identify as Central or East African. At the time, the Janjaweed were accused of mass killings, rapes and other atrocities, and Darfur became synonymous with genocide. Janjaweed groups still aid the RSF. The Sudanese Doctors’ Union said in a statement that at least 124 people were killed and 200 others were wounded in the town of Sariha, adding that the group rounded up at least 150 others. It called on the U.N. Security Council to pressure the RSF to open 'safe corridors' to enable aid groups to reach people in impacted villages. 'There is no way to help the injured or evacuate them for treatment,' the statement said. Footage circulating online, some shared by RSF fighters themselves, showed members of the paramilitary group abusing detained people. One video showed a man wearing a military uniform grabbing an old man by the chin and dragging him around as other armed men chanted in the background. The RSF didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Coordination of Civilian Democratic Forces, an alliance of pro-democracy parties and groups, also accused the RSF of storming villages, and opening fire on civilians as well as rounding up and mistreating 'a large number of residents.' In a statement, the alliance held the RSF 'responsible for these massive violations,' and called for holding the preparators accountable. The attack on Gezira came as the military had successfully taken back areas held by the RSF. In September, the military launched a massive operation in and around the capital city of Khartoum, reclaiming large swaths of areas from the RSF. Also, earlier this month, it seized control of Jebel Moya, a strategic mountainous area in Gezira province, as well as areas in Gezira and nearby Sinnar province, driving out RSF forces. In October, a top RSF commander, Abu Aqlah Keikel, the de facto ruler of Gezira, defected and surrendered himself to the military. That prompted RSF fighters to attack villages and towns in Gezira seen as loyal to Keikel, according to local reports. The war in Sudan began in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in Khartoum, before spreading across the country. The war has been marked by atrocities such as mass rape and ethnically motivated killings. The U.N. and international rights groups say these acts amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, particularly in the western region of Darfur, which has been facing a bitter onslaught by the RSF. The conflict has killed more than 24,000 people so far, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group monitoring the conflict since it started.	https://apnews.com/article/sudan-war-military-rsf-6693a4a8c10baa49e8bc70506bc170d6	2024-10-27T05:03:52-07:00	
A Philippine town in the shadow of a volcano is hit by landslides it never expected	TALISAY, Philippines (AP) — As a storm pounded his rural home, Raynaldo Dejucos asked his wife and children to stay indoors and keep safe from possible lightning strikes, slippery roads or catching a fever. One thing the 36-year-old didn't mention was landslides. In the lakeside town of Talisay in the northeastern Philippines, the 40,000 inhabitants have never experienced them in their lifetime. But after leaving home last Thursday to check his fish cages in nearby Lake Taal, an avalanche of mud, boulders and toppled trees cascaded down a steep ridge and buried about a dozen houses, including his. Talisay, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of Manila, was one of several towns ravaged by Tropical Storm Trami, the deadliest of 11 storms to hit the Philippines this year. The storm veered toward Vietnam across the South China Sea after leaving at least 152 people dead and missing. More than 5.9 million people were in the storm's path in northern and central provinces. 'My wife was breastfeeding our 2-month-old baby,' Dejucos told The Associated Press on Saturday in a municipal basketball gym, where the five white coffins of his entire family were laid side by side with those of a dozen other victims. 'My children were holding each other on the bed when we found them.' 'I was calling out the names of my wife and our children repeatedly. Where are you? Where are you?' Disasters and migration to danger zones are a deadly mix It's the latest reality check in the Philippines, long regarded as one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, in the era of climate change extremes. Located between the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea, the Philippine archipelago is regarded as the doorway for about 20 typhoons and storms that barrel through its 7,600 islands each year, some with devastating force. The nation of more than 110 million people also lies in the Pacific 'Ring of Fire,' where many volcanic eruptions and most of the world’s earthquakes occur. A deadly mix of increasingly destructive weather blamed on climate change, and economic desperation that has forced people to live and work in previously off-limits disaster zones, has made many communities across Southeast Asia disasters waiting to happen. Villages have sprouted in landslide-prone mountainsides, on active volcano slopes, on earthquake fault lines and on coastlines often inundated by tidal surges. U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Kamal Kishore, who heads the U.N. disaster-mitigation agency, warned during a recent conference in the Philippines that disasters, including those caused by increasingly ferocious storms, were threatening more people and could derail the region’s economic progress if governments don’t invest more in disaster prevention. A volcano town bears the brunt of calamity The picturesque resort town of Talisay lies north of Taal, one of the country's 24 most active volcanoes nestled on an island in the middle of a lake. Fruit and vegetable farms have flourished on the fertile land, which is also a key tourist destination. Thousands of poor settlers like Dejucos have descended on Talisay over the decades, and its villages have expanded inland away from the lake toward a 32-kilometer (20-mile) long ridge with an average height of 600 meters (2,000 feet). Fernan Cosme, a 59-year-old village councilor, told the AP that the towering ridge at Talisay’s northern fringes had never posed any major risks, at least in his lifetime. The key worry has always been the volcano, which has been restive on and off since the 1500s. 'Many take the risks,' Cosme said of Talisay villagers, who have grown accustomed to Taal's volatility and survived in its shadow. In 2020, Taal's eruption displaced hundreds of thousands and sent clouds of ash all the way to Manila, shutting the main international airport. Kervin de Torres, a carpenter, wanted a safer community for his daughter Kisha, a high school student, but he and his wife separated and she bought a house close to the Talisay ridge, where she lived with Kisha. His daughter was in the house when she was buried by the landslide. The mother survived. A distraught de Torres showed his daughter's picture to police officers who on Saturday searched for the last two missing people — Kisha and a baby from another family. Three hours later, a backhoe dug up school uniforms dangling from plastic hangers, in a spot where Kisha was believed to have been entombed by the debris. Dozens of police and volunteers dug furiously with shovels until a foot was seen in the mud. De Torres wept when the remains of a young girl were placed in a black body bag. He nodded when asked if it was his daughter. Teary-eyed residents expressed their sympathies. Doris Echin, a 35-year-old mother, said she nearly died when the mudslide swamped her up to the waist as she darted out of her hut, carrying her two daughters. She said she prayed hard and managed to plod through. Standing beside her hut, which was half-buried in mud as police and emergency personnel searched the area with backhoes and sniffer dogs, Echin worried about her family's fate. 'If we relocate, where will we get the money to build a new house? Which employer will give us jobs?' she asked. 'If we get to rebuild and stay, we’ll be living between a volcano and a crumbling mountain.' ___ Associated Press journalists Aaron Favila and Vicente Gonzales contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-talisay-volcano-landslide-trami-e18e6d928e8d8233c521c378ff58c1b1	2024-10-27T03:17:12-07:00	
Satellite images show damage from Israeli attack at 2 secretive Iranian military bases	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Israeli attack on Iran damaged facilities at a secretive military base southeast of the Iranian capital that experts in the past have linked to Tehran's onetime nuclear weapons program and at another base tied to its ballistic missile program, satellite photos analyzed Sunday by The Associated Press show. Some of the buildings damaged sat in Iran's Parchin military base, where the International Atomic Energy Agency suspects Iran in the past conducted tests of high explosives that could trigger a nuclear weapon. Iran long has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an active weapons program up until 2003. The other damage could be seen at the nearby Khojir military base, which analysts believe hides an underground tunnel system and missile production sites. Iran's military has not acknowledged damage at either Khojir or Parchin from Israel's attack early Saturday, though it has said the assault killed four Iranian soldiers working in the country's air defense systems. Iran announced Sunday a civilian also had been killed, but provided no details. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Israeli military declined to comment. However, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday told an audience that the Israeli attack 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for an immediate retaliatory strike. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu separately said Sunday that Israel’s strikes 'severely harmed' Iran and that the barrage 'achieved all its goals.' Damage spread across three Iranian provinces It remains unclear how many sites in total were targeted in the Israeli attack. There have been no images of damage so far released by Iran's military. Iranian officials have identified affected areas as being in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces. Burned fields could be seen in satellite images from Planet Labs PBC around Iran's Tange Bijar natural gas production site in Ilam province on Saturday, though it wasn't immediately clear if it was related to the attack. Ilam province sits on the Iran-Iraq border in western Iran. The most telling damage could be seen in Planet Labs images of Parchin, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of downtown Tehran near the Mamalu Dam. There, one structure appeared to be totally destroyed while others looked damaged in the attack. At Khojir, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from downtown Tehran, damage could be seen on at least two structures in satellite images. Analysts including Decker Eveleth at the Virginia-based think tank CNA, Joe Truzman at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former United Nations weapon inspector David Albright, as well as other open-source experts, first identified the damage to the bases. The locations of the two bases correspond to videos obtained by the AP showing Iranian air defense systems firing in the vicinity early Saturday. Base linked to Iran's onetime nuclear weapons program At Parchin, Albright's Institute for Science and International Security identified the destroyed building against a mountainside as 'Taleghan 2.' It said an archive of Iranian nuclear data earlier seized by Israel identified the building as housing 'a smaller, elongated high explosive chamber and a flash X-ray system to examine small-scale high explosive tests.' 'Such tests may have included high explosives compressing a core of natural uranium, simulating the initiation of a nuclear explosive,' a 2018 report by the institute says. In a message posted to the social platform X early Sunday, the institute added: 'It is not certain whether Iran used uranium at ‘Taleghan 2,’ but it is possible it studied the compression of natural uranium hemispheres, which would explain its hasty and secretive renovation efforts following the IAEA’s request to access Parchin in 2011.' It's unclear what, if any, equipment would have been inside of the 'Taleghan 2' building early Saturday. There were no Israeli strikes on Iran's oil industry, nor its nuclear enrichment sites or its nuclear power plant at Bushehr during the assault. Rafael Mariano Grossi, who leads the IAEA, confirmed that on X, saying 'Iran’s nuclear facilities have not been impacted.' 'Inspectors are safe and continue their vital work,' he added. 'I call for prudence and restraint from actions that could jeopardize the safety &amp; security of nuclear &amp; other radioactive materials.' Damage seen at facilities for Iran's ballistic missile program Other buildings destroyed at Khojir and Parchin likely included a warehouse and other buildings where Iran used industrial mixers to create the solid fuel needed for its extensive ballistic missile arsenal, Eveleth said. In a statement issued immediately after the attack Saturday, the Israeli military said it targeted 'missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the state of Israel over the last year.' Destroying such sites could greatly disrupt Iran's ability to manufacture new ballistic missiles to replenish its arsenal after the two attacks on Israel. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which oversees the country's ballistic missile program, has been silent since Saturday's attack. Iran's overall ballistic missile arsenal, which includes shorter-range missiles unable to reach Israel, was estimated to be 'over 3,000' by Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, then-commander of the U.S. military's Central Command, in testimony to the U.S. Senate in 2022. In the time since, Iran has fired hundreds of the missiles in a series of attacks. There have been no videos or photos posted to social media of missile parts or damage in civilian neighborhoods following the recent attack — suggesting that the Israeli strikes were far more accurate that Iran’s ballistic missile barrages targeting Israel in April and October. Israel relied on aircraft-fired missiles during its attack. However, one factory appeared to have been hit in Shamsabad Industrial City, just south of Tehran near Imam Khomeini International Airport, the country's main gateway to the outside world. Online videos of the damaged building corresponded to an address for a firm known as TIECO, which advertises itself as building advanced machinery used in Iran's oil and gas industry. Officials at TIECO requested the AP write the company a letter before responding to questions. The firm did not immediately reply to a letter sent to it. ___ Associated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-attack-satellite-photos-gaza-lebanon-wars-0c6ee6a8544268612cb7d49727d8449d	2024-10-27T02:14:29-07:00	
In Beirut, a photographer's frozen moments slow down time and allow the contemplation of destruction	We watch video after video, consuming the world on our handheld devices in bites of two minutes, one minute, 30 seconds, 15. We turn to moving pictures — 'film' — because it comes the closest to approximating the world that we see and experience. This is, after all, 2024, and video in our pocket — ours, others', everyone's — has become our birthright. But sometimes — even in this era of live video always rolling, always recording, always capturing — sometimes the frozen moment can entrance the eye like nothing else. And in the process, it can tell a larger story that echoes long after the moment was captured. That's what happened this past week in Beirut, through the camera lens of Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein and the photographs he captured. When Hussein set up his camera outside an evacuated Beirut apartment building Tuesday after Israel announced it would be targeted as part of military operations against Hezbollah, he had one goal in mind — only one. 'All I thought of,' he says, 'was photographing the missile while it was coming down.' He found a safe spot. He ensured a good angle. He wasn't stressed, he said; like many photographers who work in such environments, he had been in situations like this one before. He was ready. When the attack came — a bomb, not a missile in the end — Hussein swung into action. And, unsurprisingly for a professional who has been doing this work for two decades, he did exactly what he set out to do. Time slowed down The sequence of images he made bursts with the explosive energy of its subject matter. In one frame, the bomb hangs there, a weird and obtrusive interloper in the scene. It is not yet noticed by anyone around it, ready to bring its destruction to a building that, in moments, will no longer exist. The building's balconies, a split-second from nonexistence, are devoid of people as the bomb finds its mark. These are the kind of moments that video, rolling at the speed of life or even in slow motion, cannot capture in the same way. A photo holds us in the scene, stops time, invites a viewer to take the most chaotic of events and break it down, looking around and noticing things in a strangely silent way that actual life could not. In another frame, one that happened micromoments after the first, the building is in the process of exploding. Let's repeat that for effect, since even as recently as a couple generations ago photographs like this were rare: in the process of exploding. Pieces of building are shooting out in all directions, in high velocity — in real life. But in the image they are frozen, outward bound, hanging in space awaiting the next seconds of their dissolution — just like the bomb that displaced them was doing milliseconds before. And in that, a contemplation of the destruction — and the people it was visited upon — becomes possible. Tech gives us new prisms to see the world The technology to grab so many images in the course of little more than one second — and do it in such clarity and high resolution — is barely a generation old. So to see these 'stills,' as journalists call them, come together to paint a picture of an event is a combination of artistry, intrepidity and technology — an exercise in freezing time, and in giving people the opportunity to contemplate for minutes, even hours, what took place in mere seconds. This holds true for positive things that the camera captures — and for visitations of violence like this one as well. Photography is random access. We, the viewers of it, choose how to see it, process it, digest it. We go backward and forward in time, at will. We control the pace and the speed at which dizzying images hurtle at us. And in that process, something unusual for this era emerges: a bit of time to think. That, among many other things, is the enduring power of the still image in a moving-picture world — and the power of what Bilal Hussein captured on that clear, sunny day in Beirut. ___ Ted Anthony is the director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation for The Associated Press.

Georgia's crucial vote was marred by intimidation, European monitors say	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — European observers said Sunday that Georgia's election took place in a 'climate of hatred and intimidation' with multiple election violations and cases of violence, undermining the outcome of the vote that could decide the country's future in Europe. The country's Central Election Commission said the ruling Georgian Dream won 54.8% of Saturday’s vote with almost all the ballots counted. Following a divisive pre-election campaign, initial figures suggested turnout is the highest since the ruling party was first elected in 2012. There were multiple concerns about the conduct of the election, including 'the widespread climate of pressure, and party-organized intimidation,' vote buying and the impartiality of state institutions, said Julian Bulai, head of the PACE delegation monitoring the polls. Georgian Dream has become increasingly authoritarian over the past year, adopting laws similar to those used by Russia to crack down on freedom of speech. Brussels suspended Georgia’s EU membership process indefinitely because of a 'Russian law,' passed in June. Many Georgians viewed Saturday's vote as a referendum on the opportunity to join the European Union. During the campaign, Georgian Dream used 'anti-Western and hostile rhetoric ... promoted Russian misinformation, manipulations, and conspiracy theories,' said Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White, the head of the European Parliament monitoring delegation. 'Paradoxically, the government further claimed that it was continuing Georgia’s European integration,' he added. The conduct of the polls, he said, is more evidence that points to the ruling party's 'democratic backsliding.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze on Sunday described Georgian Dream's victory as 'impressive and obvious,' and said 'any attempts to talk about election manipulation ... are doomed to failure.' Georgian electoral observers, who were stationed across the country, also reported multiple violations and said the results do not reflect 'the will of the Georgian people.' In the capital Tbilisi, Tiko Gelashvili, 32, said, 'The results that were published are just lies and rigged.' Bidzina Ivanishvili, the billionaire founder of Georgian Dream who made his fortune in Russia, claimed victory almost immediately after polls closed Saturday. 'It is rare in the world for the same party to achieve such success in such a difficult situation,' he said. He had vowed ahead of the election to ban opposition parties should his party win. Tina Bokuchava, the chair of the United National Movement opposition party, accused the election commission of carrying out Ivanishvili’s 'dirty order' and said that he 'stole the victory from the Georgian people and thereby stole the European future.' She indicated the opposition would not recognize the results and 'will fight like never before to reclaim our European future.' The UNM party said its headquarters was attacked on Saturday while Georgian media reported two people were hospitalized after being assaulted outside polling stations. 'The most important question is whether or not these elections will be recognized by the international community,' said Natia Seskuria, executive director of the Regional Institute for Security Studies in Tbilisi. Georgia's 'economic and political prospects' hinge on the election, she said. Many Georgians are concerned the EU may close the door on them and fear the country will be more vulnerable to Russia if Georgian Dream remains in power, she said. Georgians have a complex relationship with Russia, which ruled over it from Moscow until Georgia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia and Georgia fought a short war in 2008, and Moscow still occupies 20% of Georgia's territory. Despite that, Georgian Dream has adopted Russia-style laws and many Georgians fear the govermment is distancing the country from the West and into Moscow's orbit. The election observers said instances of intimidation and electoral violations were particularly noticeable in rural areas. Georgian Dream scored its highest share of the vote — polling almost 90% — in the Javakheti region of southern Georgia, 135 kilometers (83 miles) west of the capital Tbilisi, where it got less than 44% of the vote in any district. The region is predominantly agricultural and many people are ethnic Armenians who speak Armenian, Russian and limited Georgian. Before the election, the AP traveled to the region where voters suggested they were instructed how to vote by local officials. Several questioned why Georgia needed a relationship with Europe and suggested it would be better off allied with Moscow. Around 80% of Georgians favor joining the EU, according to polls, and the country’s constitution obliges its leaders to pursue membership in that bloc and NATO. — Associated Press producer Sophiko Megrelidze contributed to this report	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-russia-election-european-union-8f040cb30e1d9c9e778383cbcbb7b2c1	2024-10-27T01:01:03-07:00	
Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes have killed 22 people in northern Gaza	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes on northern Gaza have killed at least 22 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Sunday, as its offensive in the hard-hit and isolated north entered a third week and aid groups described a humanitarian catastrophe. The Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service said that 11 women and two children were among those killed in the strikes late Saturday on several homes and buildings in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. It said another 15 people were wounded and that the death toll could rise. It listed the names of those killed, who mostly came from three families. The Israeli military said it carried out a precise strike on militants in a structure in Beit Lahiya and took steps to avoid harming civilians. It disputed what it said were 'numbers published by the media,' without elaborating or providing evidence for its own account. Israel is still carrying out daily strikes across Gaza, even as it wages and air and ground war with the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon. Two people were wounded after an explosive drone launched from Lebanon slammed into a building in an industrial area of northern Israel, authorities said. An Israeli airstrike on a southern neighborhood of Beirut sent flames and smoke climbing into the air. On Saturday, Israeli warplanes attacked military targets in Iran — which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah — in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack earlier this month. Iran’s parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, followed other senior officials in downplaying the strikes, which state media said had killed four Iranian soldiers. But he said 'a response to this act of aggression is certain, with necessary considerations.' The cascading conflicts have raised fears of an all-out regional war pitting Israel and the United States against Iran and its militant proxies, which also include the Houthi rebels in Yemen and armed groups in Syria and Iraq. Red Cross describes ‘horrific circumstances’ in northern Gaza Israel has been waging a massive air and ground offensive in northern Gaza since Oct. 6, after saying that Hamas militants had regrouped there. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Gaza City in the latest wave of displacement in the yearlong war. Israel says its strikes on Gaza only target militants, and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militants fight in densely populated areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Aid groups have warned of a catastrophic situation in northern Gaza, which was the first target of Israel's ground offensive and had already suffered the heaviest destruction of the war. Israel has severely limited the entry of basic humanitarian aid in recent weeks, and the three remaining hospitals in the north — one of which was raided over the weekend — say they have been overwhelmed by waves of wounded people. The International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday said that ongoing Israeli evacuation orders and restrictions on the entry of essential supplies to the north had left the civilian population in 'horrific circumstances.' 'Many civilians are currently unable to move, trapped by fighting, destruction or physical constraint and now lack access to even basic medical care,' it said. Hospital reels after Israeli raid detains dozens of medics Israeli troops raided the Kamal Adwan Hospital in the north on Friday, detaining dozens of medical staff and causing heavy damage, according to the Health Ministry. Footage circulated online showing the courtyard bulldozed and the wards ransacked. Israeli troops withdrew on Saturday. The head of the World Health Organization said 44 male staff members were detained at the hospital. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said only female staff, the hospital director and one male doctor were left to care for almost 200 patients. Among those detained and taken away was Dr. Mohamed Obeid, head of the orthopedics’ department at nearby Al-Awda Hospital, according to Al-Awda Hospital. His whereabouts are unknown. Throughout the yearlong Israel-Hamas war, Israeli forces have stormed and bombarded a number of hospitals including the strip’s largest medical facility, Shifa Hospital. Israel accuses Hamas of using medical facilities across Gaza for military purposes, allegations denied by hospital staff, who say the raids have recklessly endangered sick and wounded civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's border wall and stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the local Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The offensive has devastated much of the impoverished coastal territory and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people have crowded into squalid tent camps along the coast, and aid groups say hunger is rampant. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Bulgarians vote with little hope of breaking a political deadlock	SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgarians were voting Sunday in a seventh general election in just over three years with little hope that a stable government will be formed to stop the country’s further slide into political instability. Voter fatigue and disillusionment with politicians have created an environment where radical political voices, aided by Moscow’s widespread disinformation, are successfully undermining public support for the democratic process and boosting the popularity of pro-Russian and far-right groups. The never-ending election spiral has a serious impact on Bulgaria’s economy and its foreign policy. The country risks losing billions of euros in EU recovery funds due to lack of reforms. Full integration into the open-border Schengen area and joining the eurozone are likely to be delayed further. Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) on Sunday. Initial exit poll results will be announced after polls close at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) and preliminary results are expected on Monday. According to latest opinion polls, Bulgarians’ lack of confidence in elections will result in a record low voter turnout. Gallup World Poll data show only 10% of Bulgarians trust the integrity of their elections — the lowest proportion in the EU, where the average is 62%. Some observers have labelled the past few years as a period of 'revolving-door governments,' which has additionally fueled voters’ apathy. There was no clear winner in the latest vote, held in June, and the seven groups elected to the fragmented legislature were unable to put together a viable coalition. Observers suggest that Sunday’s vote will produce more of the same. These early elections are not expected to break a protracted political stalemate, Teneo, a political risk consultancy, said in a report last week. Although former prime minister Boyko Borissov’s center-right GERB party is set to win a plurality of seats, it will likely struggle to form a majority government in a fragmented parliament, Teneo predicted. 'As a result, a technocratic government or another early election are the most likely outcomes. Political instability and a surging budget deficit are key challenges to Bulgaria’s accession to the eurozone,' the consultancy added. The Balkan country of 6.7 million has been gripped by political instability since 2020, when nationwide protests erupted against corrupt politicians that had allowed oligarchs to take control of state institutions. Bulgaria is one of the poorest and most corrupt European Union member states. Attempts to fight graft are an uphill battle against an unreformed judiciary widely accused of serving the interests of politicians. Despite a fall in support for GERB in recent elections, it is tipped to finish first with a quarter of the votes. It will be a hard task for Borisov, however, to secure enough support for a stable coalition government. Analysts believe that the main pro-Russia party in Bulgaria, Vazrazhdane, could emerge as the second-largest group in parliament. The far-right, ultra-nationalist and populist party demands that Bulgaria lift sanctions against Russia, stop helping Ukraine, and hold a referendum on its membership in NATO. The reformist, pro-EU We Continue the Change/Democratic Bulgaria bloc is tipped to come in third. The Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which traditionally represented Bulgaria’s large ethnic Turkish minority, recently split into two rival factions, one around party founder Ahmed Dogan, and the other behind U.S.-sanctioned businessman and former media tycoon Delyan Peevski. Both factions are tipped to enter parliament, gaining between 7 and 9 percent each, Up to four smaller groups could also pass the 4-percent threshold for entering parliament, which would even more complicate the forming of a government.	https://apnews.com/article/bulgaria-parliament-election-government-russia-borissov-a5f340a55ca3f3d3c520b7ea7c9732e8	2024-10-26T21:05:30-07:00	
A Lebanese family was holding a Sunday gathering when an Israeli strike toppled their building	AIN EL DELB, Lebanon (AP) — It was Sunday, family time for most in Lebanon, and Hecham al-Baba was visiting his sister. She insisted he and their older brother stay for lunch, hoping to prolong the warm gathering in stressful times. The brother declined. Like many in Lebanon, he hadn’t been sleeping because of Israel’s intensifying airstrikes, so he left to take a nap. The 60-year-old al-Baba, on his annual visit from Germany to see his family in Lebanon, stayed. His sister Donize even convinced him to call an old flame over for coffee. He excitedly stepped into the bathroom to clean up before his visitor arrived. Within seconds, a huge boom shook the basement apartment. Al-Baba fell to the floor. Something hit him in the chest, knocking the breath out of him. He pulled himself up and reached for the door, screaming his sister’s name. A second explosion threw him back to the floor. The bathroom ceiling — and the whole building above it — collapsed on his back. An Israeli air raid hit the six-story residential building in Ain el Delb, a neighborhood outside the coastal city of Sidon. The entire building tipped over down a hillside and landed on its face, taking with it 17 apartments full of families and visitors. More than 70 people were killed, and 60 injured. Israel said the Sept. 29 strike targeted a Hezbollah commander and claimed the building was a headquarters for the group. It could not be independently confirmed whether any of the residents belonged to Hezbollah. In a video that surfaced online mourning one of the people believed to be residing in the building, he appeared in an old photo wearing military fatigues, a sign of affiliation with Hezbollah. Either way, experts say the strike illustrates Israel’s willingness to kill significant numbers of civilians in pursuit of a single target. That tactic has fueled the high death toll among Palestinians in Gaza in Israel’s year-old campaign against Hamas. Israel has intensified bombardment of Lebanon since Sept. 23, vowing to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah members and infrastructure and says the group places military assets in civilian areas. Some 2,000 people have been killed, including Hezbollah fighters and commanders — but also hundreds of civilians, often in strikes on homes. 'It seems to be a feature so similar to Gaza in that these are families being killed together in single strikes,' said Emily Tripp, director of the London-based group Airwars, which monitors conflicts. In the first week of Israel's escalation, it hit a home in Tyre province, killing a family of 15, all of them women and children except for a Hezbollah member. A strike in Byblos killed six family members of a Hezbollah fighter, who had already died in fighting a month before — raising questions about the quality of intelligence used in the strikes. A hit on a shack housing Syrian migrant worker families killed 23. The strike in Ain el Delb was one of the deadliest of the Israeli campaign. Among those killed were al-Baba’s sister, her husband and two of their children, a daughter in her 20s and a teenage boy. Al-Baba was trapped for hours, with the rubble pressing him in an agonizing, kneeling position, his neck twisted, his face stuck to the bathroom floor, unable to feel his legs. He knew his sister’s family was dead from the constant, unanswered ringing of their phones. 'No one said a word. I didn’t hear a movement,' he said. 'People don't know. Israel knows' The Israeli military said it enacted evacuation procedures before acting on confirmed intelligence in the Ain el Delb strike. Residents who spoke to The Associated Press said they received no warning. 'I wish we had. We would have left,' said Abdul-Hamid Ramadan, who lived on the top floor and whose wife Jinan and daughter Julia were killed. 'I would have lost my home. But not my wife and daughter.' Israel says it often issues evacuation orders before striking. But in Lebanon, as in Gaza, rights groups say the advance warnings are often inadequate and come in the middle of the night or through social media. Ramadan, a retired army officer, said he knew of no Hezbollah members or weapons in the building, where he has lived for more than 20 years. No one thought the neighborhood — where most residents are Sunni Muslims and Christians — would be on the list of Israeli targets. In the building, 15 out of the 17 apartments were occupied by longtime residents who all knew each other. Displaced people from the south had begun arriving a week earlier, seeking shelter with relatives in the building. Al-Baba said his sister confided in him before she was killed that she was concerned about a much-loved Shiite tenant, mainly because he had been receiving guests. She feared he may be a target of Israel and asked her brother if she should leave. She decided to stay because she had no idea where to go. Neither al-Baba nor his sister knew anything about the tenant being linked to Hezbollah. Israeli strikes have stoked fears among Lebanese over the possibility their building could be hit for hosting someone who Israel claims, rightly or wrongly, to be connected to Hezbollah. Building administrations have asked tenants to declare the names of displaced sheltering with them. Some have refused to take in people from the south. The first strike hit the building's lower floors around 4 p.m. The Ramadan family were shocked but didn’t think the building was collapsing. Only Ramadan's wife, Jinan, ran for the stairs. A few moments passed, long enough for Ramadan’s son Achraf to bring his sister Julia a glass of water to calm her. Then the second missile hit. The building swayed, then collapsed. Ramadan fell off the couch, which along with a nearby cabinet protected him from the falling ceiling. Achraf, a fitness trainer and former soldier, took cover under a door frame. Julia fell to the floor. For what seemed like two hours, the three communicated through the rubble. Ramadan said Julia was only two meters (yards) away, her voice faint but audible. He called for help using his mobile phone still in his hands. When help came, Achraf got out first; then his father, about six hours after the strike. In the chaos, they thought Julia had been pulled out. But the rescuers returned to find the 28-year-old dead. Her mother died in the hospital from internal bleeding. 'I lost the cornerstone of the house: my wife, my partner and friend,' Ramadan said. 'I lost my daughter Julia ... She was my joy, my smile, the future.' They are buried in unmarked graves in a section of the Sidon cemetery dedicated to the Ain el Delb building victims. Like in Gaza, there is concern that the number of civilian casualties is 'quite high' given that the alleged military target is often unstated or relatively small, said Rich Weir, the senior conflict, crisis and arms researcher at Human Rights Watch. He said there has been an 'escalation in terms of the amount of damage ... the taking down of entire buildings in densely packed residential neighborhoods, which brings inherent risks to civilians.' Israel has also expanded the scope of its targets, hitting Hezbollah financial institutions, he said. Ramadan was not surprised at the killing of so many people for one possible Hezbollah member. It has happened before, he said. 'We hear in the news an apartment was targeted. And people wonder who it was,' he said. 'People don’t know. Israel knows.' ‘Worse than a coffin’ At the bottom of the building’s wreckage, Hecham al-Baba was trapped in pitch black darkness for four hours, squeezed with his legs bent under him. The falling door had broken two of his ribs. It was difficult to breathe. All he could think about was that he might lose his legs. 'There was no blood going to my legs,' he said. 'I couldn’t feel them. I couldn’t move. I tried to stay strong. I don’t want to remember. It upsets me.' Finally, he heard movement: people removing bricks, a bulldozer. He started screaming. His lungs and chest hurt. They called to him to shout louder. 'I told them I can’t.' Then through a hole, a beam of light flashed in the darkness. At the sight of him, a rescuer cried out, 'What a way to be stuck! It’s worse than a coffin.' It took another four hours before the rescuers pulled him out head-first through the floor beneath him, covered in dust and soot. The entire rescue operation took more than 43 hours. The Health Ministry put the death toll at 45, but the civil defense chief for Sidon, Mohamed Arkadan, said first responders pulled 73 bodies from the rubble. Five bodies remain unaccounted for, he said. Doctors told al-Baba his ribs will heal with time. But not his pain. He said he will wear black all his life to mourn his sister. Past conflicts never stopped him from returning to Lebanon to visit family. This time, it may be a while before he comes back. 'There will be no peace,' he said, thinking of his family tragedy and the wars in both Lebanon and Gaza. 'No one will bring me justice. No one.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-war-civilian-casualties-families-israel-airstrikes-963fceb3514518420b579a4a381ac286	2024-10-26T20:09:33-07:00	
Uruguay's elections buck the Latin American trend, offering voters a choice between 2 moderates	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) — Voters in the small South American nation of Uruguay headed to the polls to choose a new president on Sunday in a race between two moderates that defies regional trends of bitter division and democratic erosion. The contest between Uruguay's incumbent conservative coalition and its challenger, a center-left alliance, got underway with some 2.7 million eligible voters also casting ballots for Parliament and a contentious referendum on overhauling the social security system. The pension vote — which would expand the fiscal deficit in one of Latin America’s wealthiest countries — has consumed more media attention in recent weeks than other top campaign issues, such as child poverty, education and security. With the candidates in broad agreement over many issues, no one expects the outcome of the presidential vote to herald drastic change in this nation of 3.4 million people, long considered a model democracy and bastion of stability in the region. 'In a way, Uruguay has been boring, but boring in this sense is very good,' said Juan Cruz Díaz, a political analyst who runs the Cefeidas consultancy group in Buenos Aires. 'We’ve seen so many dramatic changes in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and suddenly we face elections in Uruguay in which there is a general consensus, there’s stability.' While in neighboring Brazil and Argentina, voters recently vented their rage at the status quo, Uruguay's electorate remains largely satisfied with the government's business-friendly policies and the economy's steady growth. The current center-right president, Luis Lacalle Pou, enjoys a 50% approval rating. The presidential campaigns have played out without the vitriol or personal attacks seen elsewhere, such as the United States, Argentina or Brazil. As constitutional term limits bar Lacalle Pou from running for a second consecutive term, the governing party's candidate is Álvaro Delgado, 55, a congressman and Lacalle Pou's former chief of staff, who started his career as a veterinarian. 'This government leaves us with a very solid first level to continue building the future,' Delgado said at his closing campaign rally. His main challenger is Yamandú Orsi, 57, a center-left former mayor and history teacher with humble roots from the Frente Amplio (or Broad Front) coalition, which governed for 15 years before Lacalle Pou’s 2019 victory. From 2005-2020, Frente Amplio oversaw progressive laws, such as the legalization of same-sex marriage. Uruguay became the first country to legalize cannabis for recreational use and developed one of the world's greenest grids, powered by 98% renewable energy. The latest polls show Orsi in a comfortable lead at 44%, but not winning outright, which would send the country to a run-off on Nov. 24. Orsi has benefited from the support of popular former President José 'Pepe' Mujica, the eccentric former guerrilla who helped spearhead Uruguay's transformation into the continent's most socially liberal country during his 2010-2015 presidency. Now 89, Mujica is battling esophageal cancer, but he still managed to cast his ballot in Montevideo, the capital, on Sunday. Arriving to vote in a wheelchair, he was quickly swarmed by reporters. 'We need to support democracy, not because it is perfect, but because humans have not yet invented anything better,' he told journalists after exiting the polling station. Like Mujica, who lives in a modest farmhouse on the outskirts of Montevideo, Orsi says he wouldn't live in the presidential palace if elected. In a distant third is Andrés Ojeda, 40, a muscular and media-savvy lawyer who has tried to energize apathetic young voters with splashy campaign videos showing him lifting weights at the gym and describing himself as a classic Capricorn. 'I want to be the candidate who inspires and enthralls people,' he said at his campaign event Thursday. He told The Associated Press that his unconventional style draws inspiration from other charismatic 'leaders of the new politics' in Latin America wielding social media to amass fans, like El Salvador's populist Nayib Bukele and Argentina's radical libertarian Javier Milei. But he backs the ruling coalition and promises no radical change. The electoral contest has largely focused on the rise in homicides and robberies, with the governing coalition advocating a tough-on-crime approach and the liberal coalition vowing to increase the state's role in security matters. Voters are also concerned about the one in five Uruguayan children living in poverty and the low rate of high school graduations. But the overlap between the party platforms has left much of the Uruguayan electorate indifferent. 'It was a presidential campaign far removed from the people that did not achieve the levels of engagement that Uruguay historically has,' said Montevideo-based political analyst Julián Kanarek. Perhaps more pressing than the presidential race is the constitutional referendum that would overhaul Uruguay's social security system. If approved by more than 50% of voters, the $23 billion scheme backed by the country's powerful leftist unions would lower the retirement age, boost payouts and transfer Uruguayans' privately managed savings to a government-run trust. Both leading candidates have spoken out against the proposal, which has already sent tremors through global markets. Shrugging off the fiscal consequences, supporters say it would redistribute Uruguay’s resources more fairly. There is also a referendum on allowing nighttime police raids on homes. Uruguayans are not obliged to vote in the plebiscites, but voting in the congressional and presidential races is compulsory. ___ DeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina	https://apnews.com/article/uruguay-election-politics-leftwing-president-rightwing-86984f87bb0607d9c061c293ec11fe71	2024-10-26T20:02:00-07:00	
Yamamoto shuts down Yankees, Freeman homers again as Dodgers win 4-2 for 2-0 World Series lead	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Yoshinobu Yamamoto walked back to his dugout and made the slightest tip of his cap to cheering fans. He left Japan for moments like this, an opportunity to put the Los Angeles Dodgers in control of the World Series. Yamamoto allowed one hit over 6 1/3 innings, Freddie Freeman homered for the second straight night and Los Angeles beat the New York Yankees 4-2 on Saturday for a 2-0 Series lead. But the Dodgers will head to New York uncertain whether Shohei Ohtani can play after their biggest star partially dislocated his left shoulder on a slide at second base. 'We’re going to get some tests at some point tonight, tomorrow, and then we’ll know more in the next couple days,' manager Dave Roberts said. 'The strength was great. The range of motion good. So we’re encouraged.' Tommy Edman and Teoscar Hernández also went deep off starter Carlos Rodón, who tied a Yankees World Series record by allowing three home runs. New York was held to one hit before the ninth, when the Yankees closed to 4-2 on Giancarlo Stanton's one-out RBI single against Blake Treinen. Anthony Volpe struck out with the bases loaded, and Alex Vesia came in to retire pinch-hitter Jose Trevino on a first-pitch flyout for his first postseason save. 'Thinking back to my front yard at my house, that’s what we would envision,' Vesia said. Game 3 is Monday night at Yankee Stadium. Forty-five of 56 teams holding 2-0 World Series leads have gone on to win the title. 'No one said it’s going to be easy,' Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. 'It’s a long series, and we need to make it a long series now. We won’t flinch.' Yankees star Aaron Judge went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts. He is 1 for 9 in the Series and is hitting .150 with six RBIs and 19 strikeouts in 40 postseason at-bats. 'Just expanding the zone. That’s really what it really comes down to,' Judge said. 'I think it's trying to make things happen instead of letting the game come to you. ... Plain and simple, I've got to start swinging at strikes.' Yamamoto turned down the Yankees last December and joined the Dodgers for a $325 million, 12-year contract, a record for pitchers, teaming with Ohtani to create record interest in Major League Baseball back in Japan. The rookie right-hander threw seven scoreless innings at Yankee Stadium on June 7 but was sidelined from June 15 to Sept. 10 because of a strained rotator cuff. This was his finest start since the injury. Yamamoto gave up Juan Soto's third-inning homer, then retired his last 11 batters. 'He was made for those moments,' Hernández said. 'He was doing it in Japan before he got here, and as soon as he got here, he was doing it here.' Yamamoto struck out four and walked two with a five-pitch array that included curveballs, splitters, sliders and cutters. He improved to 2-0 in four postseason starts. 'It was kind of a mixed feeling because I was very (much) looking forward to it and happy, but then after I felt that I started trying to focus,' Yamamoto said through a translator. Soto’s fourth postseason homer, on an inside fastball, was the only run Yamamoto permitted in two starts and 13 1/3 innings against the Yankees this year. Soto also singled off the right-field wall in the ninth and scored on Stanton's one-out base hit off the third-base bag. Jazz Chisholm Jr. singled and Anthony Rizzo was hit by a pitch for the second time in the game, loading the bases. But the rally ended there. 'This is everything to me, playing on the highest stage with literally the two biggest teams you can play for, biggest franchises, most history,' Vesia said. A night after Freeman hit the first walk-off grand slam in Series history to transform a 3-2 deficit with two outs in the 10th inning into a 6-3 win, Edman put the Dodgers ahead with a solo shot in the second. After Soto tied the score, Mookie Betts singled with two outs in the bottom half and Hernández, in a 3-for-27 slide, homered into the right-center pavilion. Freeman, who before Friday hadn’t gone deep since since Sept. 16, worked the count full and homered to right-center again. Playing on a sprained right ankle, Freeman has homered in four straight Series games dating to Atlanta’s last two games against Houston in 2021. That is one shy of the record held by Astros outfielder George Springer. Freeman had six days off entering the World Series. 'I was able to calm my ankle down,' he said. 'So hopefully with the flight tonight — I’ve been swelling a lot on flights — so, hopefully tomorrow we can get it down and get in a good spot for Game 3.' All three Dodgers homers came on fastballs from Rodón, whose 31 longballs allowed during the regular season tied for second-most in the major leagues. Los Angeles had back-to-back Series homers for just the second time, after Pedro Guerrero and Steve Yeager connected against Yankees lefty Ron Guidry for a 2-1 win in Game 5 in 1981. Rodón gave up four runs and six hits in 3 1/3 innings. He got just one swing and miss on his fastball. Los Angeles took a 2-0 Series lead for the first time since 1988, when Kirk Gibson’s walk-off homer against Oakland’s Dennis Eckersley won the opener and Orel Hershiser followed with a three-hit shutout. The Yankees are 0-2 for the first time since 2001, when they rebounded to win three straight at home and lost Games 6 and 7 at Arizona. Ohtani's MRI and a determination of his availability will be anxiously awaited by the Dodgers and their fans. 'Not only the dugout, but the whole stadium went silent,' Hernández said. 'Hopefully he’s OK and the day off tomorrow will help him get back on the field Monday.' UP NEXT Yankees RHP Clarke Schmidt and Dodgers RHP Walker Buehler start on Monday. Schmidt has a 3.86 ERA in a pair of postseason starts, no-decisions in Game 3s against Kansas City and Cleveland. Buehler also has started a pair of Game 3s, allowing six runs over five innings in a 6-5 loss to San Diego and pitching four innings in an 8-0 win at the New York Mets. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-yankees-dodgers-game-2-score-yamamoto-d672c41e864884be79f2629a749363a6	2024-10-26T19:18:40-07:00	
Shohei Ohtani partially dislocates left shoulder during World Series Game 2, status TBD	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani partially dislocated his left shoulder during the seventh inning of Saturday's Game 2 of the World Series against the New York Yankees when he tried to steal second base. Ohtani's status for Monday's Game 3 in New York is unclear. Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said Ohtani 'had a little left shoulder subluxation' and would get image testing either Saturday night or Sunday. Ohtani clutched his left forearm after being tagged by shortstop Anthony Volpe for the final out in the inning on a feetfirst slide. He laid near the bag for a couple minutes before being tended to by trainers and leaving the field. 'We’ll know more in the next couple days,' Roberts said. 'The strength was great. The range of motion good. So we’re encouraged. But obviously I can’t speculate because we don’t get the scans yet. So once we get the scans, we’ll know more. Again, with the strength, the range of motion good, that’s certainly a positive.' The Dodgers held on for a 4-2 victory and lead the Series 2-0. The Japanese slugger — and presumptive National League MVP — was 0 for 3 with a walk in the game. He is 1 for 8 in the first two games of the Fall Classic and is batting .260 with three home runs and 10 RBIs in his first postseason in the majors. 'That was tough. You never like seeing the best player in the game get injured like that,' Yankees superstar Aaron Judge said. 'Trying to steal a base like that there, and something like that happens. But hopefully it’s all good news. We’ll see what happens.' Ohtani had been one of the few players on the Dodgers roster who got through the season without a major injury. The pitching staff has been beset by injuries, with nearly every member of the starting rotation spending time on the injured list. Among the position players, Mookie Betts was out for nearly two months due to a broken left hand, and Max Muncy was out nearly half the season due to a right oblique strain. Freddie Freeman is playing in the postseason with a badly sprained right ankle. Betts is optimistic about the Dodgers persevering if Ohtani is sidelined, especially after the team overcame its injuries while earning the most wins in the majors during the regular season and reaching the World Series for the fourth time in eight seasons. 'We've got a great group of guys in here and I believe we can take care of business for sure. I believe in us all,' Betts said. Most of Ohtani's injuries since coming to the majors in 2018 have been pitching-related, including major operations on his right elbow in 2018 and last year. The two-way phenomenon has not pitched this year but became the first player in major league history with at least 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season. In September 2019, he had surgery on his left kneecap due to a rare condition. The procedure was on his bipartite patella, or a two-part kneecap that didn’t fuse together at birth. Ohtani missed the 2017 World Baseball Classic after having ankle surgery because of an injury he suffered during the 2016 Japan Series. 'When you have a group like this, they picked me up when I have been down. We’ll try to do the same for him,' Freeman said. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-dodgers-yankees-ohtani-332dfab365b16f5f8ae607fcb5147a01	2024-10-26T18:51:05-07:00	
Indonesian forests pay the price for the growing global biomass energy demand	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Enormous swathes of pristine forest are being cut down across Indonesia to supply the rapidly rising international demand for biomass material seen as critical to many countries' transitions to cleaner forms of energy. Nearly all of the biomass from forests destroyed for wood pellet production since 2021 has been shipped to South Korea and Japan, The Associated Press found in an examination of satellite images, company records and Indonesian export data. Both countries have provided millions of dollars to support the development of biomass production and use in Indonesia. Indonesia's state-run utility also has plans to dramatically increase the amount of biomass it burns to make electricity. Experts and environmentalists fear the rising international and domestic demand, coupled with weak domestic regulation, will accelerate deforestation at the same time it prolongs the use of highly polluting fossil fuels. Biomass is organic material like plants, wood and waste, and many coal-fired power plants can be easily modified to burn it alongside coal to make energy. 'Biomass production — which is only recently starting to be seen on an industrial scale in Indonesia — is a dire new threat to the country's forests,' said Timer Manurung, director of Auriga Nusantara, an environmental and conservation organization in Indonesia. As countries accelerate their energy transitions, demand for biomass is growing: The use of bioenergy has increased an average of about 3% per year between 2010 and 2022, the International Energy Agency said. Experts including the IEA say it's important for that demand to happen in a sustainable way, such as using waste and crop residue rather than converting forest land to grow bioenergy crops. Deforestation contributes to erosion, damages biodiverse areas, threatens wildlife and humans who rely on the forest and intensifies disasters from extreme weather. And many scientists and environmentalists have rejected the use of biomass altogether. They say burning wood-based biomass can emit more carbon than coal and tree-cutting greatly reduces forests' ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Critics also say that using biomass to co-fire, instead of transitioning directly to clean energy, simply prolongs the use of coal. In Indonesia, biomass production is causing deforestation across the archipelago. Auriga Nusantara reports that more than 9,740 hectares (24,070 acres) of forest have been cleared in areas where biomass production is permitted since 2020. Permits have been issued for over 1.4 million hectares (3,459,475 acres) of energy plantation forests in Indonesia, with over one-third of that land being undisturbed forest. Over half of these concession areas are the habitat of flagship species such as sumatran rhino, elephants, orangutans and tigers, said Manurung. In the carbon-rich forests of Gorontalo, Sulawesi, the felling, shredding and shipping of old trees to make energy-dense wood pellets has been streamlined. Over 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) of forest have been razed in a concession owned by Banyan Tumbuh Lestari, from 2021 to 2024, according to satellite analysis shared with AP by international environmental organization Mighty Earth. An additional 2,850 hectares (7,040 acres) were cleared for logging roads. After trees are cut down, they're turned into wood pellets at a facility near the concessions owned by Biomasa Jaya Abadi, the largest exporter of wood pellets from Indonesia from 2021-2023, according to data Auriga Nusantara compiled from the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry database. The database has no records of wood pellet exports prior to 2020. Biomasa Jaya Abadi did not respond to repeated requests for interviews or comment. Banyan Tumbuh Lestari do not have contact information publicly available; AP contacted their main shareholders seeking comment but got no response. Indonesia’s ministries of Environment and Forestry; Energy and Mineral Resources and Maritime Affairs and Investment did not respond to requests for comment. Nearly all of Indonesia's wood pellet production is shipped overseas to meet international demand, said Alloysius Joko Purwanto, an energy economist at the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia. Most of Indonesia's wood pellets went to South Korea (61%) and Japan (38%) from 2021-2023, according to government data. 'It's clear that Japan and South Korea's governments are trying to buy more biomass from Indonesia to lower their own domestic emissions,' said Bhima Yudhistira, executive director of the Indonesia-based Center of Economic and Law Studies. Both countries have provided millions of dollars of financial support toward the development of biomass in Indonesia through research, policy, construction and other support, according to a review of publicly available business and government agreements by AP. South Korea's Forest Service, which drives South Korea's biomass expansion and policy, did not reply to requests for comment. Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries also did not respond to a request for comment. The promotion of biomass production and use has coincided with the ramping-up of Indonesia's domestic biomass use. The country's state electricity company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), plans to implement 10% biomass co-firing for 52 coal plants across the country. PLN estimates that would take 8 million tons of biomass a year — far greater than the wood pellet industry's capacity at the end of 2023 of less than 1 million tons, according to Indonesian civil society organization Trend Asia. To achieve PLN’s ambitions, a 66% increase in forest plantation land would be needed — 'which would likely come at the expense of intact, carbon-rich and carbon-absorbing forests,' according to a report by Mighty Earth. PLN spokesperson Gregorius Adi Trianto told AP that the company's plan relied on biomass from 'organic waste such as tree branches, rice waste, and wood industry waste ... rather than from actively logged forests.' With Indonesia lacking clear regulations and oversight of its expanding biomass industry, experts fear deforestation is likely to spike for years to come. 'We're already far behind when it comes to monitoring and regulating issues around biomass production in Indonesia,' said Yudhistira. 'There's definitely a lack of due diligence, and forests are suffering.' ___ Associated Press journalist Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Japan's ruling party braces for a blow to its comfortable majority in the lower house in elections	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’ s conservative ruling party braced for a blow to its comfortable majority in the lower house of parliament in Sunday’s elections amid public rage over the party’s financial scandals and discontent over a stagnant economy. The results could weaken Ishiba's grip on power, possibly leading Japan into political uncertainty, though a change of government was not expected. Ishiba took office on Oct. 1, replacing his predecessor Fumio Kishida who resigned after failing to pacify the public over widespread slush fund practices among Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers. Ishiba immediately ordered a snap election in hopes of shoring up support by using his outspoken, reformist image. Voting began Sunday morning across Japan, where 1,344 candidates, including a record 314 women, are running for office. Polls close at 8 p.m., with early results expected within hours. Ishiba has set a goal of retaining 233 seats for the ruling coalition between the LDP and its Buddhist-backed junior partner Komeito, a majority in the 465-member lower house, the more powerful of Japan’s two-chamber parliament. Ishiba, in his final speeches Saturday in Tokyo, apologized over his party’s mishandling of funds and pledged 'to restart as an equal, fair, humble and honest party.' He said only the LDP’s ruling coalition can responsibly run Japan with its experience and dependable policies. Once a popular politician known for his criticism of even his own party's policies, Ishiba has also seen support for his weeks-old Cabinet plunge. The biggest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, is led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda who briefly served as prime minister during the LDP’s 2009-2012 descent from power. Noda's party is expected to make significant gains. Noda says Sunday’s election is a rare chance for a change of government, which will be the most effective political reform, though his party has trouble finding other opposition groups with which to cooperate. At a downtown Tokyo polling station early Sunday, a number of voters said they considered the corruption scandal and economic measures. A 77-year-old man said his biggest concern was rising prices and wondered if the LDP should win despite the wrongdoings. Another resident in her 60s said she would vote in hope of making a change. Analysts suggest Ishiba could fall short of reaching his target, though his LDP was expected to remain the top party in Japan’s parliament as voters are skeptical about the opposition's ability and inexperience. Losing a majority would mean Ishiba would have difficulty establishing policies and could face calls from within his party for a replacement ahead of next summer’s election in the upper house, experts say. 'The public’s criticisms against the slush funds scandal has intensified, and it won’t go away easily,' said Izuru Makihara, a University of Tokyo professor of politics and public policy. 'There is a growing sense of fairness and people are rejecting privileges for politicians.' Makihara suggested Ishiba needs bold political reform measures to regain public trust. Ishiba pledged to revitalize the rural economy, address Japan’s falling birth rate and bolster defense. But his Cabinet has old faces, only two women and was seen as alienating members of the scandal-tainted faction led by late premier Shinzo Abe. Ishiba quickly retreated from earlier support for a dual surname option for married couples and legalizing same-sex marriage, an apparent compromise to the party’s influential ultra-conservatives. His popularity fell because of 'the gap in what the public expected him to be as prime minister versus the reality of what he brought as prime minister,' said Rintaro Nishimura, a political analyst at The Asia Group. The LDP is also being tested Sunday for its ability to break from the legacy of Abe, whose policies focused on security, trade and industry but largely ignored equality and diversity, and its nearly eight-year long rule led to the corruption, experts say. There could be regrouping attempts among opposition parties to decide whether to cooperate among themselves or join the ruling coalition, political watchers say. Potential new partners for the LDP include the Democratic Party of the People, a breakaway group from the CPDJ, which calls for lower taxes, and a conservative Japan Innovation Party, though both are currently denying a possible coalition with the LDP. The LDP, whose dissolution of most factions that used to help bring together support for pushing through on elections and on policy, is less cohesive and could enter the era of short-lived prime ministers. Ishiba is expected to last at least until the ruling bloc approves key budget plans at the end of December. ___ AP video journalist Mayuko Ono contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-ishiba-parliament-election-ldp-opposition-5c6509c7b83963ffe40588c50998967c	2024-10-26T15:12:09-07:00

Supporters of far-right British figure rally as anti-racism demonstrators mount counter-protest	LONDON (AP) — Thousands of supporters of jailed far-right activist Tommy Robinson marched through London on Saturday as anti-racism demonstrators mounted a nearby counter-protest. The so-called Unite the Kingdom march — planned by Robinson and supposed to feature him as speaker — led to calls for his freedom after his arrest Friday on a warrant for contempt of court. 'We want Tommy out,' the crowd of mostly white men chanted. The sea of marchers toted Union and England flags and some waved 'Make America Great' banners as they gathered near a fenced-off statute of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the square opposite the Houses of Parliament. The march was countered by thousands of people organized by the group Stand Up to Racism who held signs saying 'Refugees welcome' and 'Oppose Tommy Robinson.' Robinson, 41, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is the founder of the nationalist and anti-Islamist English Defense League and remains one of the most influential far-right figures in Britain. He has been blamed for stirring up protests that turned into a week of violent disorder across England and Belfast, Northern Ireland this summer after social media users falsely identified the suspect in a stabbing rampage that killed three young girls in the seaside community of Southport as an immigrant and a Muslim. Robinson supporters railed against the jailing of hundreds of rioters who assaulted police officers, set cars ablaze, screamed racist epithets and attacked hotels housing asylum seekers. Some participants wore 'I am Peter Lynch' badges and one man held a fishing pole with a sign reading 'Peter Lynch RIP patriot.' They were referring to a 61-year-old man who died in prison after pleading guilty for his role as part of an angry mob that smashed windows at a hotel in the northern town of Rotherham housing migrants and injured dozens of riot police. A separate march of several hundred family members, friends and supporters of those who have died in police custody also took place. Some of those activists seemed to echo the anti-racism marchers by holding signs that said 'No to hatred, no to fascism.' At least five people were arrested at the main rallies, the Metropolitan Police said. Two were arrested on suspicion of assault, including one allegedly on a police officer, at the anti-racism march. One person was arrested at the Unite the Kingdom march for a public order offense and another on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offense. A fifth person was arrested for allegedly directing a racist remark at an officer, but the Met hadn't confirmed which protest the person attended. Robinson, who has been jailed in the past for assault, contempt of court and mortgage fraud, faces a hearing Monday in a contempt-of-court proceeding for allegedly violating a 2021 High Court order barring him from repeating libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him. While Robinson was banned from Twitter in 2018, he was allowed back after Elon Musk took over the social network and rebranded it X. He now has 1 million followers.	https://apnews.com/article/farright-rally-london-tommy-robinson-counterprotest-537a682347e1286e05aa49cdcfdcf2b3	2024-10-26T10:20:43-07:00	
Foreign threats to the US election are on the rise, and officials are moving faster to expose them	WASHINGTON (AP) — A presidential candidate's phone is hacked. A fake video falsely shows ballots burned in Pennsylvania. National security officials warn that U.S. adversaries may incite violent protests after Election Day. These developments — all revealed in the past week — show how Russia, China and Iran have increased the pace of efforts to meddle in American politics ahead of next month's election, just as intelligence officials and security analysts had predicted. At the same time, officials, tech companies and private researchers have adopted a more aggressive defense by swiftly exposing foreign election threats, highlighting the lessons learned from past election cycles that revealed America's vulnerability to disinformation and cyberespionage. Officials say the U.S. election system is so secure that no foreign nation could alter the results at a scale necessary to change the outcome. Nevertheless, authoritarian adversaries have leveraged disinformation and cyberespionage to target campaigns and voters while stoking distrust and discord. Here's what to know as the presidential election approaches: Russia is the top threat Russia is the most active and sophisticated nation working to manipulate the U.S. election, using fake websites, state-controlled media and unwitting Americans to spread misleading and polarizing content aimed at undermining confidence in elections. The Kremlin's disinformation apparatus seizes on contentious issues like immigration, crime, the economy or disaster relief. The goal is to weaken the U.S., erode support for Ukraine as it fights off Russian invaders and reduce America's ability to counter Russia's growing ties to China, North Korea and Iran, officials have said. Intelligence officials and private security analysts have determined that Russia supports former President Donald Trump, and is using disinformation — sometimes AI-generated — to smear his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested cutting funds to Ukraine and repeatedly criticized the NATO military alliance. In one particularly audacious campaign, Russia staged a video that falsely accused Harris of paralyzing a woman in a car crash years ago. Another video made fictitious allegations against Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. On Friday, the FBI confirmed Moscow's role in creating a third video supposedly showing the destruction of mail ballots in Pennsylvania. Local election officials quickly debunked the video as false. Russia also has tried to pay American influencers who spread the Kremlin’s preferred narratives. Last month, U.S. authorities accused two Russian state media employees of funneling $10 million to a Tennessee company to create pro-Russian content. The company then paid several popular right-wing influencers, who have said they had no idea their work was being supported by Russia. Moscow’s campaign won’t end on Election Day. Instead, intelligence officials and private security analysts predict Russia will exploit claims of election irregularities to suggest the results can’t be trusted. A recently declassified intelligence memo said Russia may also encourage violent protests after the election. 'Putin’s aim is to foment chaos, division and polarization in our society,' said Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia who now teaches at Stanford University. Russia has rejected claims that it seeks to influence the U.S. election. A message left with Russia's embassy in Washington was not immediately returned Saturday. Iranian hack-and-leak operations Iran has been a particularly brazen player in foreign interference this year. It's accused of hacking Trump campaign associates and offering the stolen communications to media organizations and Democrats in hopes that damaging stories would emerge that could hurt the Republican's prospects. Emails dangling dirt were sent to people associated with President Joe Biden’s campaign, but there’s no indication anyone replied, officials have said. The Justice Department last month charged three Iranian hackers who remain at large, accusing them of a yearslong operation targeting a vast array of victims. U.S. officials have described the hacking as part of a broader effort to interfere in an election that Iran perceives as particularly consequential. Iran, they say, has made clear its opposition to the Trump campaign. His administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act prompting Iran's leaders to vow revenge. In addition to the cyberoperations, U.S. officials have repeatedly expressed concern about the potential for Iran to carry out violence on U.S. soil against Trump or other members of his administration. Officials in 2022 brought charges in a foiled Iranian plot to kill Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, and this year charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a plot to carry out political assassinations in the U.S., including potentially of Trump. Leaders in Tehran also may try to encourage violent protests after the election, according to the declassified intelligence memo. Authorities say Iran also covertly funded and supported protests in the U.S. over Israel's war in Gaza. Iranian authorities have dismissed allegations that the country is seeking to influence the election. Iran's mission to the United Nations released a statement this week saying, 'Iran neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the U.S. election.' A neutral China? U.S. intelligence officials believe China is taking a more neutral stance in the election and is focused on down-ballot races, targeting candidates from both parties based on their positions on issues of key importance to Beijing, including support for Taiwan. But the Chinese government has for years operated a sophisticated hacking operation targeting all manners of Western life and industry that goes well beyond election influence. 'From city council to president, they want access,' said Adam Darrah, a former CIA political analyst who is now vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm ZeroFox, which tracks foreign online threats. On Friday, news broke that Chinese hackers as part of a much broader espionage effort had targeted cellphones used by Trump, his running mate JD Vance and people associated with Harris' campaign. It was not immediately clear what data, if any, had been accessed. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said they were unfamiliar with the details and couldn't comment but contended that China is routinely victimized by cyberattacks and opposes the activity. Are these tactics new? Hardly. Foreign adversaries, including the same ones blamed for meddling now, have sought to interfere in the last several election cycles — with varying degrees of success. But the U.S. government, blamed for sitting on information about the scope of Russian interference in the 2016 election, has worked this year to aggressively call out foreign threats as part of an effort to reduce their impact and assure Americans that the election is secure. In 2016, Russian military intelligence officers hacked into the email accounts of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman and the Democratic Party and released tens of thousands of communications in an effort to boost Trump's successful presidential campaign. Russia also engaged that year in a huge but hidden social media trolling campaign aimed at sowing discord on hot-button social issues, creating division in the American electoral process and harming Clinton's bid for president. The antics continued in the 2020 election cycle when a Ukrainian lawmaker described at the time by U.S. officials as an 'active Russian agent ' released audio recordings of Democrat Joe Biden, who was then running for president. That same year, Iranian hackers were blamed for emails purported to come from the far-right group The Proud Boys that officials said were designed to harm Trump's candidacy.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-russia-iran-china-disinformation-election-6f4cb99be3facb08c58cecd11b2c5d41	2024-10-26T09:56:41-07:00	
Tens of thousands of demonstrators march across Italy calling for an end to war worldwide	ROME (AP) — Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in seven Italian cities on Saturday calling for an immediate cease-fire in the Middle East, Ukraine and all global conflicts. Peaceful rallies were held in Rome, Turin, Milan, Florence, Bari, Palermo and Cagliari, with the support of hundreds of associations committed to peace, disarmament and human rights. The marches came in response to escalating violence in the Middle East and growing conflicts worldwide and denounced the diminished role of the United Nations on the global scene. In Rome, a few thousand demonstrators marched waving a giant rainbow flag in front of the Colosseum and a banner with the slogan: 'Let’s stop wars. The time for peace is now!' 'The war in Ukraine has been going on for years now and what was the result? Nothing. … There are only a lot of Ukrainian and Russian people who died, many soldiers and many children,' said Daniela Ferraci, a demonstrator in the Italian capital. 'The same is happening in Gaza, in Israel, in Lebanon.' Giulio Marcon, one of the organizers of the Rome rally, said 'wars are never resolving problems.' 'War brings more war, weapons bring more weapons. We must choose the path of negotiation, cease-fire and diplomacy. This is the message from this square,' he said. Maurizio Landini, leader of Italy's CGIL trade union, called for the role of international diplomacy to be reaffirmed. 'Our strongest request is a ceasefire to let governments open a real peace conference, because the new world’s balance can’t be decided by wars,' he said on stage.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-peace-rallies-wars-mideast-ukraine-un-b3f127bcff3d1cb3065590fd06e01e4e	2024-10-26T07:48:22-07:00	
Catholic church reform process expected to disappoint hopes of more equity for women	VATICAN CITY (AP) — A yearslong process to reform the Catholic Church closes Saturday with recommendations that are expected to fall far short of hopes that women would be given more equity but that reflect the pope’s aims for a church that at least listens more to its flock. The Vatican’s top doctrinal officer, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, told the extraordinary assembly of bishops and laypeople this week that Pope Francis said the moment for allowing ordination of women as deacons in the church 'is not ripe.' The multi-year synod process had sparked great hopes for change, especially for women, who have long complained that they are treated as second-class citizens in the church. Women are barred from the priesthood and the highest ministerial positions in the Catholic Church, yet do the lion’s share of the work running Catholic hospitals and schools and passing the faith onto future generations. Speaking to the synod on Thursday, Fernandez explained that a special working group would continue beyond the closing of the meeting, but that its focus would be on discussing the role of women in the church — not in the diaconate. He added that while working with women in previous pastoral roles, 'most did not ask for or want the diaconate, which would be cumbersome for their lay work.' He did not respond directly to a request to define what would determine 'ripeness' for a greater role for women. The outcome is shaping up to be a disappointment for Catholics who have been campaigning for recognition that women share a spiritual calling that is no different than a man’s. They also noted that despite the inclusion of women in the synodal process, the working group that is guiding discussions on women’s role is being run by the Roman curia, operating outside the synod. 'I think it is very clear that ordained men get to decide when the time is right, and they get to decide what baptismal equality amounts to. It is very frustrating, but they laid it all out,’’ said Kate McElwee, the executive director of the Women’s Ordination Conference. The first phase of the synod process ended last year by concluding it was 'urgent' to guarantee fuller participation by women in church governance positions, and calling for theological and pastoral research to continue about allowing women to be deacons. Deacons perform many of the same functions as priests, such as presiding over baptisms, weddings and funerals, but they cannot celebrate Mass. If before the synod the idea of allowing women to be deacons was a fringe proposal pushed by Western progressives, the idea gained attention during the debate. It became something of a litmus test of how far the church was going to go, or not, to address demands of women for greater equality and representation in the highest ranks of the church. Francis, though, had other ideas, insisting that ordaining women would just 'clericalize' them and that there were plenty of other ways to empower women in the church, even leading Catholic communities, without resorting to ordination. Advocates say allowing women to be deacons would help offset the shortage of Catholic priests and address longstanding complaints about their second-class status. Opponents say ordaining women to the deaconate would signal the start of a slippery slope toward ordaining women to the priesthood. The Catholic Church reserves the priesthood for men. Francis has repeatedly reaffirmed the all-male priesthood and has sharply criticized 'obtuse' agitators pressing for a female diaconate.	https://apnews.com/article/vatican-reforms-women-equity-ordination-synod-francis-5cdd62a4d191b77ec71b30440c59e75e	2024-10-26T05:58:12-07:00	
EU leader denounces Russia's 'hybrid war' aiming to destabilize Western Balkan democracies	PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday denounced Russia's hybrid attacks against democracies, saying the European Union is fighting daily to debunk misinformation. Von der Leyen was in Kosovo as part of a trip this week to aspiring EU member states in the Western Balkans to assure them that EU enlargement remains a priority for the 27-nation bloc. Von der Leyen denounced Russia's efforts 'to destabilize these democracies,' adding that Brussels works to unveil propaganda 'to the benefit of a whole region.' 'It is possible for us to stand up with the truth and with transparency and with very clear messaging. So here we are really countering a hybrid attack that Russia is leading against democracies,' she said at a news conference in the capital, Pristina. Von der Leyen came to Kosovo from neighboring Serbia, which has close ties to Russia and has refused to join international sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. She did not mention the 13-year old EU-led dialogue to normalize ties between Serbia and its former province, Kosovo, instead focusing on the bloc's efforts to promote the region's economy. Kosovo-Serbia ties remain tense, even 25 years after NATO’s 78-day bombing campaign in 1999 that ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which left about 13,000 people dead, mainly ethnic Albanians. Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008, which Belgrade has not recognized. Last year EU officials offered a 6-billion-euro (about $6.5 billion) growth plan to the Western Balkan countries in an effort to double the region’s economy over the next decade and accelerate their efforts to join the bloc. That aid is contingent on reforms that would bring their economies in line with EU rules. The Western Balkan countries — Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia — are at different stages in their applications for EU membership. The countries have been frustrated by the slow pace of the process, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has propelled European leaders to push the six to join the bloc. The Commission on Wednesday approved the reform agendas of Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia following a green light from EU member states. That was a key step to allow payments under the growth plan upon completion of agreed reform steps. Von der Leyen's trip concludes with a visit to Montenegro.	https://apnews.com/article/european-commission-von-der-leyen-balkans-kosovo-russia-04edfec4d473d88620793c5b9f9d6ed3	2024-10-26T04:29:28-07:00	
At least 126 dead and missing in massive flooding and landslides in Philippines	TALISAY, Philippines (AP) — The number of dead and missing in massive flooding and landslides wrought by Tropical Storm Trami in the Philippines has reached nearly 130 and the president said Saturday that many areas remained isolated with people in need of rescue. Trami blew away from the northwestern Philippines on Friday, leaving at least 85 people dead and 41 others missing in in one of the Southeast Asian archipelago’s deadliest and most destructive storms so far this year, the government’s disaster-response agency said. The death toll was expected to rise as reports come in from previously isolated areas. Dozens of police, firefighters and other emergency personnel, backed by three backhoes and sniffer dogs, dug up one of the last two missing villagers in the lakeside town of Talisay in Batangas province Saturday. A father, who was waiting for word on his missing 14-year-old daughter, wept as rescuers placed the remains in a black body bag. Distraught, he followed police officers, who carried the body bag down a mud-strewn village alley to a police van when one weeping resident approaching him to express her sympathies. The man said he was sure it was his daughter, but authorities needed to do checks to confirm the identity of the villager dug up in the mound. In a nearby basketball gym at the town center, more than a dozen white coffins were laid side by side, bearing the remains of those found in the heaps of mud, boulders and trees that cascaded Thursday afternoon down the steep slope of a wooded ridge in Talisay's Sampaloc village. President Ferdinand Marcos, who inspected another hard-hit region southeast of Manila Saturday, said the unusually large volume of rainfall dumped by the storm — including in some areas that saw one to two months’ worth of rainfall in just 24 hours — overwhelmed flood controls in provinces lashed by Trami. 'The water was just too much,' Marcos told reporters. 'We’re not done yet with our rescue work,' he said. 'Our problem here, there are still many areas that remained flooded and could not be accessed even big trucks.' His administration, Marcos said, would plan to start work on a major flood control project that can meet the unprecedented threats posed by climate change. More than 5 million people were in the path of the storm, including nearly half a million who mostly fled to more than 6,300 emergency shelters in several provinces, the government agency said. In an emergency Cabinet meeting, Marcos raised concerns over reports by government forecasters that the storm — the 11th to hit the Philippines this year — could make a U-turn next week as it is pushed back by high-pressure winds in the South China Sea. The storm was forecast to batter Vietnam over the weekend if it would not veer off course. The Philippine government shut down schools and government offices for the third day on Friday to keep millions of people safe on the main northern island of Luzon. Inter-island ferry services were also suspended, stranding thousands. Weather has cleared in many areas on Saturday, allowing cleanup work in most areas. Each year, about 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines, a Southeast Asian archipelago which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and flattened entire villages.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-trami-philippines-vietnam-ee57cf85bc41683260f416f38ed3de30	2024-10-26T03:47:07-07:00	
Five things to know about Israel's attack on Iran	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel delivered its long-expected response to Iranian missile attacks early Saturday by carrying out a series of airstrikes against the Islamic Republic. Here's what to know: Multiple targets were struck Under the cover of darkness early Saturday, Israel struck multiple sites in different parts of Iran. Explosions were heard in the capital, Tehran, which sits deep inside the country. The Israeli military said its 'precise and targeted strikes' hit missile air defense systems and 'aerial capabilities' as well as missile manufacturing facilities used to produce weapons that have been used against Israel. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage.' It was not immediately clear how hard of a blow Israel dealt, with neither country providing detailed assessments of the destruction. Iran said the strikes targeted military bases in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran. Israel appeared confident in its battering of Iran's air defenses, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying that 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' What wasn't hit also matters The strikes did not appear to target facilities that would all but ensure a harsh Iranian response. Those most notably include Iran's oil infrastructure, the backbone of the OPEC member's economy, and its nuclear facilities. President Biden earlier this month said he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. officials felt they had secured agreement from Israel not to hit nuclear or oil sites after dispatching another air-defense missile battery and associated troops, though those assurances were not set in stone. This attack has finished Israel signaled that the pre-dawn bombardment was the end of this attack. 'The retaliatory strike has been completed, and its objectives have been achieved,' Hagari said early Saturday, still the Sabbath in Israel. Not long after, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization said commercial flights would resume after being halted because of the airstrikes. Tehran's shops were open and streets were calm, though lines grew at gas stations as residents stocked up on fuel. The Israeli attacks aimed to deter future aggression and 'show we won’t be silent,' but to do so in a way that would minimize the embarrassment for Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. Outrage and calls for restraint The White House indicated that it wants the strikes to end the direct exchanges of fire between Israel and Iran, and warned Iran against responding. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there was a 'need to avoid further regional escalation' and called on all sides to show restraint. Reactions in the region were tougher. Saudi Arabia, Iran's main Arab rival, condemned the strike, calling it a threat to regional security and 'a violation of international laws and norms.' Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' and said 'putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty.' Syria and Iraq were among other countries in the region condemning the strikes. So did Hamas, which along with other militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 hostages into Gaza. Israel's retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up for more than half the deaths. Iran's response will be key The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would respond to the airstrikes, calling them a clear violation of international law as it asserted Tehran's right to self-defense. Israel characterized Saturday's attack as a response to previous aerial assaults by Iran using missiles and exploding drones in April and another missile attack this month. Many of those projectiles were shot down before reaching their targets. Iran could attempt another direct bombardment, though doing so risks provoking yet another direct Israeli attack on its territory at a moment when its defenses are weakened. It could also encourage allied militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon to intensify their attacks, though both have suffered serious blows in their ongoing wars with Israel. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are in fact quite serious,' predicted Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in by their own military limitations, economic constraints from sanctions and by the U.S. election outcome,' which could affect the course of further escalation or diplomatic outreach.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-attack-israel-strikes-mideast-war-tehran-35a2b1474e5feedbb200c3aaa557fe60	2024-10-26T03:29:46-07:00	
Attack on a police convoy in a restive southeastern province of Iran kills 10 officers	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An attack on an Iranian police convoy Saturday in the country's restive southern province of Sistan and Baluchestan killed at least 10 officers, authorities said. Details remain scarce over the attack in Gohar Kuh, some 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) southeast of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Initially, reports simply described an attack by 'miscreants' without more information. But shortly after, Iranian state media said 10 officers had been killed. HalVash, an advocacy group for the Baluch people of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, posted photos and video of what appeared to be a disabled truck painted with the green stripe used by Iranian police vehicles. One graphic photo shared by the group showed what appeared to be the corpses of two police officers in the front seat of the truck. HalVash said the attack appeared to target two security force vehicles and all those riding in them were killed. The truck appeared to have only damage from bullets, rather than any explosive being used. The state-run IRNA news agency said that Eskandar Momeni, the country's interior minister, ordered an investigation into the incident that it described as causing the 'martyrdom of a number of police.' Authorities identified no immediate suspects for the attack, nor did any group claim responsibility. The assault came after Israel launched a major attack across Iran early Saturday morning. The Baluch regions across the three nations have faced a low-level insurgency by Baluch nationalists for more than two decades. Verifying information remains difficult in Iran's Sistan and Baluchistan, which for decades has been home to violence involving heroin traffickers. The province is one of the least developed parts of Iran. Relations between the predominantly Sunni Muslim residents of the region and Iran’s Shiite theocracy have long been strained. Typical attacks involve hit-and-run assaults by militants in the region, like the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, that kill a few security officials at a time. However, there have been mass casualty attacks by militants in the past. In April, gunmen wearing explosive vests attacks several sites in the province, killing 10 before security forces gunned down 18 militants. Last December, another assault killed 11 and wounded eight others. Meanwhile, the Taliban said they are investigating reports that Afghan migrants had been killed by Iranian security forces in the region earlier in October, an incident that threatened to further strain relations between the nations. ___ Associated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-police-shooting-sistan-baluchestan-province-8e1ea2c0c73606ffd189eb97efaaf05d	2024-10-26T02:24:47-07:00	
US approves $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan including advanced missile defense system	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — The United States has approved $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, including the first-time delivery to the self-ruled island of an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system, in a move sure to anger China. Taiwan’s presidential office on Saturday thanked Washington for greenlighting the potential arms sales. Under the island's new president, Lai Ching-te, Taiwan has been stepping up defense measures as China increased its military threats against the territory it claims as its own. Beijing last week held war games encircling Taiwan for the second time since Lai took office in May. The U.S. is Taiwan’s strongest unofficial ally and its laws bound it to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. 'Strengthening Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities is the foundation for maintaining regional stability,' Taiwan's presidential spokesperson Karen Kuo said. The potential sales package includes three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) and related equipment valued at up to $1.16 billion, according to the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. It also includes radar systems worth an estimated $828 million. The Chinese government did not immediately comment on the potential arms sales. The NASAMS system has been battle-tested in Ukraine and will help to strengthen the Taiwanese army’s air defense capabilities, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said. China’s war games last week were aimed at practicing the 'sealing off of key ports and key areas' around Taiwan, according to Chinese officials. Taiwan counted a record one-day total of 153 aircraft, 14 navy vessels and 12 Chinese government ships.	https://apnews.com/article/us-taiwan-china-arms-sale-missile-defense-bd14986ada9cfc894c5b1168aea27d02	2024-10-26T02:23:44-07:00	
The Menendez brothers built a green space in prison. It’s modeled on this Norwegian idea	COPENHAGEN (AP) — Nearly 30 years after they killed their parents, Erik and Lyle Menendez launched a beautification project in the California prison where they're serving life sentences. Their project was inspired by the Norwegian approach to incarceration that believes rehabilitation in humane prisons surrounded by nature leads to successful reintegration into society, even for those who have committed terrible crimes. Norway is a long, narrow country in northern Europe, running 1,100 miles (1,750 kilometers) from north to south. It has set up small prisons across the country, which allows people to serve their sentences close to home, said Kristian Mjåland, a Norwegian associate professor of sociology at the University of Agder in Kristiansand. The entire country has about 3,000 people in prison, he said, putting Norway’s per-capita incarceration rate at roughly one-tenth that of the United States. Norway has some of the world’s lowest levels of recidivism. Government statistics give the proportion of people reconvicted within two years of release in 2020 as 16%, with the figure falling each year. Meanwhile, a U.S. Department of Justice survey carried out over a decade found that 66% of people released from state prisons in 24 states were rearrested within three years, and most of those were incarcerated again. Mjåland said Norway's incarceration system is based on the principles that people should be 'treated decently by well-trained and decent staff' and have 'opportunities for meaningful activities during the day' — something he called the 'principle of normality' — and that they should retain their basic rights. Mjåland, whose research has focused on punishments and prisons, said that, for instance, prisoners in Norway retain the right to vote and access services such as libraries, health care and education delivered by the same providers working in the wider community. Norway also operates open prisons, some on islands where there is a lot of farm work and contact with nature. The most famous is on the island of Bastoey, 'which is very beautifully located in the Oslo Fjord,' Mjåland said. Even Anders Behring Breivik — who killed eight people in the 2011 bombing of a government building in Oslo, then gunned down 69 more at a holiday camp for left-leaning youth activists — has a dining room, fitness room and TV room with an Xbox. His cell wall is decorated with a poster of the Eiffel Tower and parakeets share his space. The idea of creating normal, humane conditions for people in prison is starting to spread in the U.S. as well. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, for instance, has in recent years been trying to apply certain elements of the Nordic approach, and unveiled a program it calls 'Little Scandinavia' in a prison in Chester in 2022. The Menendez brothers’ case was again in the public spotlight Thursday when the Los Angeles County district attorney recommended that their life-without-parole sentences be thrown out. Prosecutors hope a judge will resentence them so they can be eligible for parole. If the judge agrees, a parole board must then approve their release. The final decision rests with the California governor. Their lawyer and the LA district attorney argued that they have served enough time, citing evidence that they suffered physical and sexual abuse at the hands of their entertainment executive father. They also say that the brothers, now in their 50s, are model prisoners who have committed themselves to rehabilitation and redemption. Both point to the brothers' years of efforts to improve the San Diego prison where they have lived for six years. Before that, the two had been held in separate prisons since 1996. In 2018, Lyle Menendez launched the beautification program, Green Space, at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility. His brother, Erik Menendez, is the lead painter for a massive mural that depicts San Diego landmarks. 'This project hopes to normalize the environment inside the prison to reflect the living environment outside the prison,' Pedro Calderón Michel, deputy press secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, told the AP in an email Friday. The Menendez brothers' work is ongoing, with the ultimate goal of transforming the prison yard 'from an oppressive concrete and gravel slab into a normalized park-like campus setting surrounded by a majestic landscape mural,' according to the project's website. The final product will include outdoor classrooms, rehabilitation group meeting spaces and training areas for service dogs. The prison system recently launched the 'California Model' in the hopes of bringing similar projects across the state to build 'safer communities through rehabilitation, education and reentry,' Calderón Michel wrote. The brothers' lawyer, Mark Geragos, said he believes Lyle Menendez learned about the Norwegian model during his university classes. Lyle Menendez is currently enrolled in a master's program where he's studied urban planning and recidivism, and Geragos said his client hopes the beautification will make reintroduction into society easier for people who are paroled. 'When you’re there in a gray space that is not very welcoming, it’s disorienting to some degree,' Geragos told The Associated Press on Friday. 'And also you have the issue that the terrain is not something that’s welcoming or helpful in terms of being acclimated and being re-acclimated into a community.' Dominique Moran, a professor at the University of Birmingham in the U.K. said she found in her research that introducing green spaces in prisons improves the wellbeing of prisoners as well as correctional staff. 'Green spaces in prisons reduce self-harm and violence, and also reduces staff sickness,' said Moran, author of 'Carceral Geography: Spaces and Practices of Incarceration.' Moran has studied prisons around the world, and said in an emailed statement that in the Scandinavian approach, 'people go to prison AS punishment, not FOR further punishment.' 'The deprivation of liberty is itself the punishment,' she said. 'There should not be further punishment through the nature of the environment in which people are held.' ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland, and Dazio from Los Angeles.

A suicide attack kills 4 security personnel in northwest Pakistan	PESHWAR, Pakistan (AP) — A suicide attack at a checkpoint killed four Pakistani security personnel and injured five in the country’s northwest on Saturday, police said. The car bombing took place in the Mir Ali area of ​​North Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, police officer Amjad Khanand said, adding that the injured were in critical condition. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, who operate out of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and target security personnel. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to the families of the victims. In a separate incident, a remote-controlled bomb struck a military convoy in Tank district, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. No casualties were reported. ___ This story corrects the type of vehicle used in bombing.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-suicide-attack-checkpoint-northwest-64329aedc9b41612738e556fa185d0ef	2024-10-26T02:15:00-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli airstrikes hit military sites in Iran	Israel unleashed a series of pre-dawn airstrikes against military sites in Iran on Saturday, saying it targeted facilities used to make the missiles fired at Israel and surface-to-air missile locations. The attack risks pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel. Lebanon’s Health Ministry says the total toll over the past year is over 2,600 killed and 12,200 wounded. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the United Nations children’s agency. Israeli strikes have killed much of Hezbollah’s top leadership since fighting ramped up in September. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here's the latest: EgyptAir cancels flights to Iraq and Jordan CAIRO — Egypt’s flagship airliner has canceled Saturday flights from Cairo to Baghdad and Erbil in Iraq and Amman, Jordan. EgyptAir blamed the cancellations on 'the ongoing developments in the region.' The flight cancellations came hours after Israel launched a series of pre-dawn airstrikes against military sites in Iran. Turkey accuses Israel of pushing the Mideast to the brink of a greater war ISTANBUL — Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' following its strikes on Iran. 'Putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty in terms of establishing international security and peace,' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It called on the international community to take 'immediate action to enforce the law and stop the Netanyahu government.' Turkey has been a harsh critic of Israel’s military operations in Gaza and Lebanon while voicing support for Hamas. Israeli troops detain people at a Gaza hospital, Palestinian health officials say CAIRO —Israeli troops withdrew from Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza after holding a number of people inside detained for hours, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. Those held included medical staff and patients, the ministry said, and women were held separately 'with no water or food.' The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The troops later withdrew from the hospital, leaving behind massive damage, the ministry said. Footage circulated online showing the courtyard bulldozered and the wards vandalized. Among those detained and taken away was Dr. Mohamed Obeid, head of the orthopedics’ department at nearby Al-Awda Hospital, according to Al-Awda Hospital. His whereabouts are unknown. The Israeli army began raiding the hospital, located in the Beit Lahiya area, on Friday as part of its weekslong ground offensive on the northern parts of Gaza. Kamal Adwan is one of three hospitals in northern Gaza that has been left largely inaccessible because of the fighting. Earlier this week, the director of the hospital told The Associated Press that the facility is facing a 'catastrophic' shortage of basic supplies and that ambulances can no longer service the site. Throughout the yearlong Israel-Hamas war, Israeli forces have stormed and bombarded a number of hospitals including the strip’s largest medical facility, Shifa Hospital. Israel accuses Hamas of using medical facilities across Gaza for military purposes, an accusation the militant group has denied. Egypt says a cease-fire in Gaza the only way to de-escalate tensions CAIRO — Egypt said it's following with 'great concern the rapid and serious escalation' in the region, including Israel’s attack on Iran, and warned about 'serious confrontations' across the Middle East. The Foreign Ministry said that a cease-fire deal in Gaza 'is the sole means to de-escalate' tensions in the Middle East. Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been leading efforts to reach a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which includes the release of hostages held by Hamas as well as Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. UK prime minister urges restraint APIA, Samoa — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Iran should not respond to Israeli airstrikes and urged all sides to show restraint. His comments at the Commonwealth Summit in Samoa came after Israel attacked Iran with a series of pre-dawn airstrikes Saturday in what it said was a response to the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon Israel earlier this month. Starmer said Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression. 'This is a live situation, and we are obviously monitoring it closely alongside our partners,' Starmer said. 'We need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond. We will continue to work with allies to de-escalate the situation across the region.' Iran vows response to Israel's strikes TEHRAN, Iran — Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the Israeli attacks on military bases and said Iran will respond. A statement by the Foreign Ministry called the attacks a clear violation of international law and the U.N. Charter, particularly regarding the prohibition against threats or the use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations. The ministry emphasized Iran’s inherent right to self-defense, as reflected in Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, saying it has an obligation to respond to foreign aggression. Israel's opposition leader says the military should've hit Iran harder JERUSALEM — Israel’s opposition leader Yair Lapid praised the work of the military but said Israel should have struck harder. 'The decision not to attack strategic and economic targets in Iran was wrong. We could and should have exacted a much heavier price from Iran,' Lapid wrote in a post on X. He said the air force actions showed its operational capabilities, and that Israel’s enemies know that its military is strong and can attack anywhere. Iranian army says 2 soldiers died in Israeli bombing TEHRAN, Iran — The Iranian army said two soldiers were killed in Israeli strikes. The army statement was carried by the Arabic-language channel of the state TV, Al-Alam. The report did not elaborate. Iran says Israeli strikes targeted military bases in 3 provinces, causing ‘limited damage’ DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s military said early Saturday that Israeli strikes on the country targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, causing 'limited damage.' The statement from Iran’s armed forces was read aloud on state television, which showed no images of the damage described. Iran’s military claimed its air defenses limited the damage done by the strikes, without providing additional evidence. Israel said it launched attacks targeting missile manufacturing plants and other sites in the country. Israel says it has completed its strikes on Iran, including missile plants DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Israel said early Saturday it had completed its strikes targeting Iran. The Israeli military issued a statement saying its planes 'have safely returned home.' Its aircraft 'struck missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the state of Israel over the last year,' the military said. 'These missiles posed a direct and immediate threat to the citizens of the state of Israel.' It added that it also 'struck surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities, that were intended to restrict Israel’s aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' It offered no damage assessment. Iran acknowledged only 'limited damage' to military facilities. The early Saturday airstrikes on Iran were in retaliation for a ballistic missile assault Oct. 1, Israeli officials said. The attack, threatened for weeks by Israel, comes as the Middle East sits on the precipice of a regional war more than a year after an initial attack by the militant group Hamas on Israel. In the time since, Israel has launched a devastating ground offensive in the Gaza Strip and an invasion of neighboring Lebanon, targeting militants long armed and aided by Tehran.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-26-october-2024-41d99530f6f6b728e828198f53d62b6c	2024-10-26T00:30:32-07:00	
Russian strikes on Kyiv and central Ukraine kill 2 teenagers and injure dozens	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian drone strike killed a teenager in Kyiv during a nighttime barrage on the Ukrainian capital that lasted for hours, officials said, while five people were reportedly killed in a missile attack on central Ukraine that also left at least 21 injured. According to Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko, the drone slammed into a 25-story apartment block Friday night in the city's west, killing a 15-year-old girl and injuring five others. Ukraine's Emergency Service said 100 people were evacuated following the strike, which damaged several apartments on the building's upper floors. Serhii Popko, who heads Kyiv's local military administration, said that Russian forces overnight pummeled the city for 7 1/2 hours. Air raid sirens wailed throughout the night, and Popko said that Ukrainian air defense shot down up to a dozen Russian drones. Also late Friday, a Russian missile hit a residential area in the central city of Dnipro, killing a 14-year-old and four others, said regional Gov. Serhii Lysak, adding that at least 21 others were injured including an 8-year-old and teenagers. The wife and teenage daughter of a local policeman were pulled dead from the rubble, police reported. The attack damaged over a dozen apartment buildings, private houses and a medical facility. A man and woman died after a Russian drone dropped explosives on a village in the southern Kherson region, local prosecutors said, while two people in their 60s were killed by shelling in the Kharkiv province in the northeast. In the Kyiv province, which surrounds but does not include the capital, flying debris from a drone attack killed a woman, Ukraine’s Emergency Service reported. A 13-year-old boy was wounded elsewhere in the region, it said. Russian forces overnight launched a total of 91 drones and seven missiles at Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s air force said Saturday in the latest of regular media updates. It said 44 of the drones were shot down. In Russia, air defense brought down 17 Ukrainian drones over four regions near the border, the defense ministry in Moscow reported Saturday. Also according to the Russian defense ministry, Moscow's troops have continued eking out battlefield gains in Ukraine's industrial east, capturing the hamlet of Oleksandropil in the Donetsk region. Russia has been conducting a ferocious monthslong campaign along the eastern front in Ukraine, gradually compelling Kyiv to surrender ground. But Russia has struggled to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk border region following an incursion almost three months ago.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-attack-drone-4325c6b695c010cb2556e48f2efa275c	2024-10-25T23:45:20-07:00	
Israel attacks Iran in series of pre-dawn airstrikes targeting military infrastructure	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel attacked Iran with a series of pre-dawn airstrikes Saturday in what it said was a response to the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon Israel earlier in the month. The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted facilities that Iran used to make missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. There was no immediate indication that oil or missile sites were hit — strikes that would have marked a much more serious escalation — and Israel offered no immediate damage assessment. Explosions could be heard in the Iranian capital, Tehran, though the Islamic Republic insisted they caused only 'limited damage' and Iranian state-run media downplayed the attacks. Still, the strikes risk pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel. 'Iran attacked Israel twice, including in locations that endangered civilians, and has paid the price for it,' said Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari in a video statement. 'We are focused on our war objectives in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. It is Iran that continues to push for a wider regional escalation.' Photos and video released by Israel showed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wearing a casual black jacket, and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant meeting with military advisors and others in a conference room at a military command and control center in the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv. The strikes filled the air for hours until sunrise in Iran. They marked the first time Israel's military has openly attacked Iran, which hasn't faced a sustained barrage of fire from a foreign enemy since its 1980s war with Iraq. It came as part of Israel's 'duty to respond' to attacks on it from 'Iran and its proxies in the region,' Hagari said. 'The Israel Defense Forces has fulfilled its mission,' Hagari said. 'If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond.' The United States warned against further retaliation, indicating that the overnight strikes should end the direct exchange of fire between the Israel and Iran. Nuclear facilities and oil installations were all seen as possible targets for Israel’s response to Iran’s Oct. 1 attack, before U.S. President Joe Biden's administration won assurances from Israel in mid-October that it would not hit such targets, which would be a more severe escalation. Iran’s military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, without elaborating. Iran’s state-run media acknowledged blasts that could be heard in Tehran and said some of the sounds came from air defense systems around the city. But beyond a brief reference, Iranian state television for hours offered no other details. Iran's move to quickly downplay the attack may offer an avenue for it not to respond, averting further escalation. Iran fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel in April after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike in Syria on an Iranian diplomatic post. The missiles and drones caused minimum damage, and Israel — under pressure from Western countries to show restraint — responded with a limited strike it didn't openly claim. Dozens were killed and thousands wounded in September when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded in two days of attacks attributed to Israel. A massive Israel airstrike the following week outside Beirut killed Hezbollah’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders. On Oct. 1, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel in retaliation, sending Israelis scrambling into bomb shelters but causing only minimal damage and a few injuries. Netanyahu immediately said Iran had 'made a big mistake.' Israel then ratcheted up the pressure on Hezbollah by launching a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. More than a million Lebanese people have been displaced, and the death toll has risen sharply as airstrikes hit in and around Beirut. Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear program. During their yearslong shadow war, a suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists and Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks on shipping in the Middle East in recent years, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. The shadow war has increasingly moved into the light since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas and other militants attacked Israel. They killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a devastating air and ground offensive against Hamas, and Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until all of the hostages are freed. Some 100 remain and roughly a third are believed to be dead. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say more than half of the dead have been women and children. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

3 dead after light planes collided in Australia	SYDNEY (AP) — Three men died after two light planes collided midair and crashed into a forested area southwest of Sydney on Saturday. Australian police, fire and ambulance crews reached the two wreckage sites, located in a semirural bushland area about 55 miles southwest of Sydney, on foot. One plane had burst into flames on impact. New South Wales Police Acting Superintendent Timothy Calman confirmed that a Cessna 182 carrying two people collided with an ultralight aircraft from a nearby airfield carrying one. Further details of the victims have not been disclosed. Witnesses saw 'debris coming from the sky' and tried to help, but 'there was probably not much that could’ve been done,' Calman said to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation . He noted both crashes, about one kilometer apart, were 'not survivable.' NSW Ambulance Inspector Joseph Ibrahim, part of the emergency response team, said to the ABC, 'unfortunately, there was nothing they could’ve done.' The cause of the crash will be investigated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-plane-crash-8c3ff11001d29ab480a1daa7146be40e	2024-10-25T22:22:20-07:00	
Nick Harkaway steps into his father John le Carré's footsteps with spy thriller 'Karla's Choice'	LONDON (AP) — George Smiley, the subtle fictional spymaster navigating treacherous Cold War currents, is back. And so, somewhat surprisingly, is his creator, John le Carré. Four years after the spy writer’s death at the age of 89, comes a new thriller, 'Karla’s Choice.' Billed as 'a John le Carré novel,' it was written by Nick Harkaway, whose qualifications for the job include seven published novels, a lifetime of reading le Carré — and the fact he is the late author’s son. After decades avoiding his famous father’s shadow, like Smiley trying to leave the intelligence agency known as the Circus, he was drawn back in. Apprehensive author Le Carré left a note asking his family, as custodians of his estate, to help his works live on and find new readers. They took that as permission to write new books. But Harkaway, who made his name with sci-fi thrillers including 'The Gone-Away World,' 'Angelmaker' and 'Titanium Noir,' was apprehensive about being the one to do it. 'I would go so far as to say terrified,' said 51-year-old Harkaway, whose real name is Nicholas Cornwell. Le Carré was the pen name of his father, David Cornwell. 'It’s this piece of 20th-century literature that defines a genre and potentially a historical period. This body of work is immense. And it’s my father’s universe,' he said. 'There’s every reason for people to be skeptical.' Sitting in his spacious north London home — in the 'very uncomfortable' writing chair that once belonged to his father – Harkaway has relaxed a bit now that the book has been published (by Viking) to largely glowing reviews. The Daily Telegraph said Harkaway’s 'recreation of the Smiley milieu is note-perfect,' while The Guardian declared the novel 'a treat.' 'Karla’s Choice' is set in 1963, months after the end of le Carré’s breakthrough novel, 'The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.' It opens with a hitman, dispatched by Moscow to assassinate a Hungarian publisher in London, having a last-minute crisis of conscience. A recently retired Smiley is pulled in for one last job. He’s assured it will be short and simple. Famous last words. The peril-filled saga that follows fleshes out the early relationship between Smiley and the Soviet spymaster Karla, who becomes his nemesis in later works like 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' and 'Smiley’s People.' Childhood memories Harkaway says that once he got over his terror, capturing Smiley’s voice came easily — he had literally grown up with it. Some of his earliest memories involve his father reading aloud draft pages of his works in progress. 'The formative moment in my life where I was actually learning to speak, was learning to use language, I was getting 90 minutes or more of George Smiley in my ear every day,' he said. 'And so when I came to sit down to do this, I found that I did not have to turn the dial very far to find a voice that is absolutely my own, but which reads to people as being sufficiently of the le Carré mood.' That mood is often dark. Le Carré had been a real-life Cold War intelligence agent, and his thrillers are steeped in the moral murk of the spy world. But bespectacled, understated Smiley – antithesis of that other famous fictional spy, James Bond — offers decency and hope. Harkaway sees Smiley as 'this compassionate, anonymous little everyman who can turn up and see the broken pieces of life on the floor and put them back together.' There is a bit more humor in 'Karla’s Choice' than in many of his father’s books, and female characters, including Smiley's wife Ann, get more space and voice. 'I had a flat-out ambition that the Circus and the Circus universe should not just be elderly, straight white men,' Harkaway said. He acknowledges that women were often on the sidelines in his father’s work — a reflection of the male-dominated era, and of a complicated life. David Cornwell’s mother left when he was 5 years old, leaving him with his father, a charismatic conman. He didn’t see her again until he was 21. As an adult he had two long marriages — the second to Harkaway’s mother, Valerie Jane Eustace — and multiple affairs. 'On a fundamental level for him, his relationships with women were about absence and pain,' Harkaway said. 'That got better over time. But when he was writing Smiley, that’s what came through. And that’s not my life.' Grief and joy Harkaway says working on the book didn’t bring 'an Obi Wan Kenobi moment' in which an apparition of his father appeared to offer writing advice. But he found the experience 'very moving.' 'Despite the fact that it’s … slightly a project that has grief attached to it, it’s still a joyful process,' he said. It seems inevitable that more le Carré thrillers will follow. Harkaway also plans to continue writing under his own name and in his own style, with a sequel to 'Titanium Noir' due to be published in April. 'Karla’s Choice' carries a double dedication: To David John Moore Cornwell, 'father, husband, brother, son,' and to 'John le Carré, novelist.' 'John le Carré was, among other things, a shield that my father created, because he was quite a shy guy,' Harkaway said. 'John le Carré was kind of the suit that he put on to be able to do it all. And then David Cornwell was my dad. He was a terrible cook, he was a ping pong player of enormous aggression and flair … he was the person I lived with. 'I wanted with that dedication to thank them both. And also just to remind everybody, he was an awful lot of things to a lot of people.'	https://apnews.com/article/john-le-carre-nick-harkaway-karlas-choice-02f14ac19e45aaf9bafbdb31624c7ceb	2024-10-25T19:06:50-07:00	
Georgia votes in an election that could take it toward the EU or into Russia's orbit	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgians headed to the polls Saturday in a ballot many citizens see as a make-or-break vote on the opportunity to join the European Union. The pre-election campaign in the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people has been dominated by foreign policy and marked by a bitter fight for votes and allegations of a smear campaign. Some Georgians complained of intimidation and being pressured to vote for the ruling party, Georgian Dream, while the opposition accused the party of carrying out a 'hybrid war' against its citizens. Ahead of the parliamentary election, Bidzina Ivanishvili — a shadowy billionaire who set up Georgian Dream and made his fortune in Russia — vowed again to ban opposition parties should his party win. Georgian Dream will hold opposition parties 'fully accountable under the full force of the law' for 'war crimes' committed against the people of Georgia, Ivanishvili said at a pro-government rally in the capital Tbilisi Wednesday. He did not explain what crimes he believes the opposition has committed. Georgians will elect 150 lawmakers from 18 parties. If no party wins the 76 seats required to form a government for a four-year term, the president will invite the largest party to form a coalition. Many believe the election may be the most crucial vote of their lifetimes; it will determine whether Georgia gets back on track to EU membership or embraces authoritarianism and falls into Russia's orbit. 'It's an existential election,' Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said. Georgians want 'European integration, want to move forward and want policies which will bring us a better, more stable, future,' Qristine Tordia, 29, told The Associated Press shortly after voting in the capital, Tbilisi. Around 80% of Georgians favor joining the EU according to polls and the country’s constitution obliges its leaders to pursue membership in that bloc and NATO. But Brussels put Georgia’s bid for entry to the EU on hold indefinitely after the ruling party passed a 'Russian law' cracking down on freedom of speech in June. Many Georgians fear the party is dragging the country towards authoritarianism and killing off hopes it could join the EU. The opposition parties have ignored Zourabichvili’s request to unite into a single party but have signed up to her 'charter' to carry out the reforms required by the EU to join. Zourabichvili told the AP on Thursday she believed most Georgians would mobilize to vote 'despite some instances of intimidation, despite the use of state resources ... and the use of financial resources' by the government. Georgian Dream took out billboards across the country contrasting black-and-white images of destruction in Ukraine with colorful images of life in Georgia alongside the slogan, 'Say no to war — choose peace.' The governing and opposition parties told voters they would pursue EU membership even though laws passed by Georgian Dream have put that hope on hold. 'The EU decided to stop Georgia’s integration process unilaterally,' said Vakhtang Asanidze, who spoke to AP at a pro-government rally in Tbilisi. He said he saw no reason why Georgia could not join the EU in spite of the laws. At the EU summit last week, EU leaders said they have 'serious concerns regarding the course of action taken by the Georgian government.' While Georgian Dream has adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on its critics, voters at the pro-government rally said they did not view the election as a choice between Russia or Europe. 'We remember everything about Russia, including Abkhazia and South Ossetia,' said Latavra Dashniani at the rally, referring to Russia's occupation of 20% of Georgian territory after the two countries fought a short war in 2008. Voting for the ruling party, she said, would ensure Georgia enters Europe 'with dignity,' alluding to its conservative values, including opposition to rights for LGBTQ+ people. Polls opened in the parliamentary election at 8 a.m. local time and will close 12 hours later. Georgian Dream stands against three coalitions: the Unity National Movement, the Coalition for Changes Lelo, and Strong Georgia. The Gakharia for Georgia party, set up by former prime minister Giorgi Gakharia, said it will not go into an alliance with anyone but will support the opposition to form a government. — Associated Press producer Sophiko Megrelidze contributed to this report	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-elections-european-union-russia-06103525947fe3a1d372539a74cb573f	2024-10-25T19:04:23-07:00

War affects over 600 million women and girls, UN says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — More than 600 million women and girls are now affected by war, a 50% increase from a decade ago, and they fear the world has forgotten them amid an escalating backlash against women’s rights and gender equality, top U.N. officials say. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a new report that amid record levels of armed conflict and violence, progress over the decades for women is vanishing and 'generational gains in women’s rights hang in the balance around the world.' The U.N. chief was assessing the state of a Security Council resolution adopted on Oct. 31, 2000, that demanded equal participation for women in peace negotiations, a goal that remains as distant as gender equality. Guterres said current data and findings show that 'the transformative potential of women’s leadership and inclusion in the pursuit of peace' is being undercut — with power and decision-making on peace and security matters overwhelmingly in the hands of men. 'As long as oppressive patriarchal social structures and gender biases hold back half our societies, peace will remain elusive,' he warned. The report says the proportion of women killed in armed conflicts doubled in 2023 compared with a year earlier; U.N.-verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence were 50% higher; and the number of girls affected by grave violations in conflicts increased by 35%. At a two-day U.N. Security Council meeting on the topic that ended Friday, Sima Bahous, head of the U.N. agency promoting gender equality known as UN Women, also pointed to a lack of attention to women’s voices in the search for peace. She cited the fears of millions of women and girls in Afghanistan deprived of an education and a future; of displaced women in Gaza 'waiting for death'; of women in Sudan who are victims of sexual violence; and of the vanishing hopes of women in Myanmar, Haiti, Congo, the Sahel region of Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen and elsewhere. Bahous said 612 million women and girls who are affected by war 'wonder if the world has already forgotten them, if they have fallen from the agenda of an international community overwhelmed by crises of ever deeper frequency, severity and urgency.' The world needs to answer their fears with hope, she said, but the reality is grim: 'One in two women and girls in conflict-affected settings are facing moderate to severe food insecurity, 61% of all maternal mortality is concentrated in 35 conflict-affected countries.' As for women’s participation in decision-making and politics in countries in conflict, Bahous said it’s stalled. 'The percentage of women in peace negotiations has not improved over the last decade: under 10% on average in all processes, and under 20% in processes led or supported by the United Nations,' she said. U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed announced the launch of a 'Common Pledge on Women’s Participation in Peace Processes,' and urged governments, regional organizations and others involved in mediation to join the U.N. in taking concrete steps toward that end. The commitments include appointing women as lead mediators and team members, promoting direct and meaningful participation of women in peace processes, consulting women leaders at all stages and embedding women with expertise 'to foster gender-responsive peace processes and agreements,' she said. Many U.N. ambassadors who spoke at the council meeting focused on the lack of 'political will' to promote women in the peace process. 'We’ve seen how the lack of political will continues to stand in the way of the full implementation of the commitments entered into by member states,' Panama’s U.N. Ambassador Eloy Alfaro de Alba said Friday.	https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-women-war-gender-equality-0730fc6f9bb752b955d0078fe8b275a9	2024-10-25T15:45:59-07:00	
Microsoft fires employees who organized vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza	Microsoft has fired two employees who organized an unauthorized vigil at the company's headquarters for Palestinians killed in Gaza during Israel's war with Hamas. The two employees told The Associated Press they were fired by phone call late Thursday, several hours after a lunchtime event they organized at Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Washington. Both employees were members of a coalition of employees called 'No Azure for Apartheid' that has opposed Microsoft's sale of its cloud-computing technology to the Israeli government. But they contended that Thursday's event was similar to other Microsoft-sanctioned employee gift campaigns for people in need. 'We have so many community members within Microsoft who have lost family, lost friends or loved ones,' said Abdelrahman Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist. 'But Microsoft really failed to have the space for us where we can come together and share our grief and honor the memories of people who can no longer speak for themselves.' Microsoft said Friday it has 'ended the employment of some individuals in accordance with internal policy' but declined to provide details. Mohamed, who is from Egypt, said he now needs a new job in the next two months to transfer a work visa and avoid deportation. Another fired worker, Hossam Nasr, said the purpose of the vigil was both 'to honor the victims of the Palestinian genocide in Gaza and to call attention to Microsoft’s complicity in the genocide' because of the use of its technology by the Israeli military. Nasr said his firing was disclosed on social media by the watchdog group Stop Antisemitism more than an hour before he received the call from Microsoft. The group didn't immediately respond Friday to a request for comment on how it learned about the firing. The same group had months earlier publicly called on Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to take action against Nasr for his public stances on Israel. Nasr, an Egyptian-raised 2021 graduate of Harvard University, is also a co-organizer of Harvard Alumni for Palestine. Google earlier this year fired more than 50 workers in the aftermath of protests over technology the company is supplying the Israeli government amid the Gaza war. The firings stemmed from internal turmoil and sit-in protests at Google offices centered on 'Project Nimbus,' a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 for Google and Amazon to provide the Israeli government with cloud computing and artificial intelligence services. Microsoft said in its statement Friday about the firings that it remains 'dedicated to maintaining a professional and respectful work environment. Due to privacy and confidentiality considerations, we cannot provide specific details.'	https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-fired-workers-israel-palestinians-gaza-72de6fe1f35db9398e3b6785203c6bbf	2024-10-25T15:41:28-07:00	
Delta sues cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike over tech outage that canceled flights	ATLANTA (AP) — Delta Air Lines sued CrowdStrike on Friday, claiming the cybersecurity company had cut corners and caused a worldwide technology outage that led to thousands of canceled flight in July. The airline is asking for compensation and punitive damages from the outage, which started with a faulty update sent to several million Microsoft computers. Delta said the outage crippled its operations for several days, costing more than $500 million in lost revenue and extra expenses. CrowdStrike said Delta is giving 'misinformation,' does not understand cybersecurity and is trying to shift blame for its slow recovery from the outage. The U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating why Delta took longer to recover than other carriers. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the department also would look into complaints about Delta customer service during the outage, including long waits for help and reports that unaccompanied minors were stranded at airports. In its lawsuit, Delta claims that the outage occurred because CrowdStrike failed to test the update before rolling it out worldwide. Delta canceled about 7,000 flights over a five-day period during the peak summer vacation season. The outage also affected banks, hospitals and other businesses. 'CrowdStrike caused a global catastrophe because it cut corners, took shortcuts, and circumvented the very testing and certification processes it advertised, for its own benefit and profit,' Delta said in the lawsuit, which was filed in Fulton County Superior Court in Georgia, near the company's headquarters. A CrowdStrike spokesperson said the company tried to resolve the dispute — one of its lawyers said in August that CrowdStrike's liability to Delta was less than $10 million. The spokesperson said Delta's claims are based on 'misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure.'	https://apnews.com/article/delta-airlines-crowdstrike-outage-lawsuit-43bb230d2edf235bb9f7928c4279fec2	2024-10-25T14:38:21-07:00	
AP sources: Chinese hackers targeted phones of Trump, Vance, people associated with Harris campaign	WASHINGTON (AP) — Chinese hackers engaged in a broader espionage operation targeted cellphones used by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, his running mate, JD Vance, and people associated with the Democratic campaign of Kamala Harris, people familiar with the matter said Friday. It was not immediately clear what data, if any, may have been accessed. U.S. officials are continuing to investigate, according to the people, who were not authorized to publicly discuss the ongoing inquiry and spoke on the condition of anonymity to The Associated Press. An FBI statement did not confirm the identities of any of the potential targets but said it was investigating 'unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China.' 'Agencies across the U.S. Government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial communications sector,' the FBI said. U.S. officials believe the campaigns were among numerous targets of a larger cyberespionage operation launched by China, the people said. It was not immediately clear what information China may have hoped to glean, though Beijing has for years engaged in vast hacking campaigns aimed at collecting the private data of Americans and government workers, spying on technology and corporate secrets from major American companies and targeting U.S. infrastructure. News that high-profile political candidates and their campaigns were targeted comes as U.S. officials remain on high alert for foreign interference in the final stretch of the presidential campaign. Iranian hackers have been blamed for targeting Trump campaign officials and the Justice Department has exposed vast disinformation campaigns orchestrated by Russia, which is said to favor Trump over Harris. China, by contrast, is believed by U.S. intelligence officials to be taking a neutral stance in the race and is instead focused on down-ballot races, targeting candidates from both parties based on their stance on issues of key importance to Beijing, including support for Taiwan. The New York Times first reported that Trump and Vance had been targeted and said the campaign was advised of the development this week. Three people confirmed the news to the AP, including one who said that people associated with the Harris campaign were also targeted. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said Friday that they were not familiar with the specifics and could not comment, but contended that China is routinely victimized by cyberattacks and opposes the activity. 'The presidential elections are the United States’ domestic affairs. China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election. We hope that the U.S. side will not make accusations against China in the election,' the statement said. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not offer any details about the Chinese operation but issued a statement accusing the Harris campaign of having emboldened foreign adversaries, including China and Iran. Trump did not respond to shouted questions about whether his phone had been hacked by China as he departed an event in Texas. The FBI has repeatedly warned over the last year about Chinese hacking operations, with Director Chris Wray telling Congress in January that investigators had disrupted a state-sponsored group known as Volt Typhoon. That operation disrupted a botnet of hundreds of U.S.-based small office and home routers owned by private citizens and companies. Their ultimate targets included water treatment plants, the electrical grid and transportation systems across the U.S, with Wray warning that Beijing was positioning itself to disrupt the daily lives of Americans if the United States and China ever go to war. Last month, Wray said that the FBI had interrupted a separate Chinese government campaign, called Typhoon Flax, that targeted universities, government agencies and other organizations and that installed malicious software on more than 200,000 consumer devices, including cameras, video recorders and home and office routers. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that Chinese hackers had burrowed inside the networks of U.S. broadband providers and had potentially accessed systems that law enforcement officials use for wiretapping requests. ____ Michelle L.

Here's a look at what came out of Blinken's 11th trip to the Middle East	LONDON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken's weeklong trip to the Middle East ended unexpectedly in London on Friday, but the lack of a cease-fire breakthrough for Gaza came as no surprise to U.S. and Arab officials, who described the growing regional conflicts as a 'nightmare.' The trip to Israel, Qatar and Saudi Arabia had been expected after President Joe Biden said this month that he would dispatch Blinken to the region following Israel’s killing of Hamas military chief Yahya Sinwar, a move that Blinken said helped open a window for new talks on a cease-fire proposal that has been languishing for months. Blinken and other U.S. officials discussed various proposals that could potentially trigger the release of Israeli hostages and end the devastating war in Gaza. The main discussion this week was more focused on a post-war plan for Palestinian governance, reconstruction and security for the larger region. The impact of the war was on full display on Blinken's last day in Tel Aviv, when shortly before departing for the airport Wednesday, air raid sirens blared at the hotel where U.S. officials and press had been staying. The Israeli military said two rockets fired into Israel from Lebanon were intercepted, with smoke visible from the hotel. Here are some takeaways from Blinken's 11th visit to the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began over a year ago: Reigniting peace talks While expectations were low for an agreement between Israel and Hamas militants, America and Israel did announce that after several weeks with no meetings, U.S. and Israeli negotiators will be arriving in Qatar in the coming days to revive talks. Qatar has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas. Blinken, speaking to reporters Thursday in the Qatari capital, Doha, said negotiators would soon return to the Gulf city. 'What we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,' Blinken said. But Hamas’ political representatives have not so far signaled a softer stance. 'There is no change in our position,' senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Mayadeen, a Lebanese broadcaster. Hamdan said their delegates heard from mediators in Cairo about the potential to revive cease-fire negotiations, but he reiterated that the group still insists on an end to Israel’s offensive in Gaza, as well as its complete withdrawal from the territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the head of the Mossad, the country’s spy agency, would travel to Qatar on Sunday to meet with CIA director Bill Burns and the Qatari prime minister. Laying out red lines Throughout the trip, the U.S. questioned aspects of Israel's handling of the war, raising concerns about a controversial plan in northern Gaza as well as pushing its ally to adhere to U.S. humanitarian law regarding the insufficient level of aid reaching Palestinians. Before leaving Tel Aviv, Blinken and other U.S. officials cornered Netanyahu and members of his government regarding a proposal backed by some Israeli officials in which civilians would be ordered to leave the north and anyone remaining would be starved out or killed. A senior State Department official said Tuesday that both Netanyahu and his aide Ron Dermer denied having a proposal titled the 'General’s Plan' and that it was damaging for such a perception to even exist. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks, said the U.S. responded by imploring the Israelis to go to great lengths to make it clear publicly that this is not their policy. In that same meeting, Blinken also broached the issue of aid getting into Gaza, following up on a stern letter issued by him and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently that called for a remedy to the dire situation on the ground for Palestinians. Blinken, according to the official, laid out a series of areas where the Israelis needed to improve, providing a 30-day deadline to begin seeing progress. Days later in Doha, Blinken announced an additional $135 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinians but said again that the assistance would be hopeless if it is not able to get to the civilians in need. Frustration from Arab partners Many Arab leaders this week publicly expressed their exasperation at the status of the cease-fire negotiations more than a year into the conflict. Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said he was sad that mediators got so close to a deal several times in recent months only to be derailed. 'Every time we got closer to a solution, unfortunately, there were many steps back,' he told reporters Thursday in Doha. He added that going forward, there would be consequences 'should there be any of the parties that refuse to be constructively part of the negotiations.' Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, took it even further, saying directly to Blinken during a meeting Friday in London that the 'Israeli government is not listening to anyone,' and as a result, the conflicts have became a 'nightmare that the region is continuing to live through.' 'The only path to save the region from that is for Israel to stop the aggressions on Gaza, on Lebanon, stop unilateral illegal measures of the West Bank that is also pushing the situation,' Safadi said. Running out of time Many questioned if the timing of the trip was the Biden administration's 11th-hour effort to achieve even the most modest of breakthroughs in the region before the U.S. presidential election. Blinken, instead, pointed to Sinwar's death as providing a much-needed opening for mediators who had spent the last month trying to get back to the negotiating table. The discussions around a post-war plan are being pushed by the U.S. as a way to rebuild goodwill among the various stakeholders after several lethal strikes over the summer, including two that took out the leaders of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. This is the last time Blinken will be in the region before Election Day in 11 days, and Democrats had hoped for a cease-fire deal by the time Americans began to vote. That would have helped alleviate the serious criticism many voters have had toward Vice President Kamala Harris' stance on the war. Critics say the Biden administration has not gone far enough to deter Israel's conduct of the war, which has left more than 42,000 Palestinians dead. Local health authorities do not differentiate between militants and civilians in their count but say women and children make up more than half the fatalities.	https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-blinken-c450119702081057ff6c816d6a19e51a	2024-10-25T09:19:37-07:00	
Here's a look at Musk's contact with Putin and why it matters	WASHINGTON (AP) — Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of major government contractor SpaceX and a key ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the last two years, The Wall Street Journal reported. A person familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, confirmed to The Associated Press that Musk and Putin have had contact through calls. The person didn't provide additional details about the frequency of the calls, when they occurred or their content. Musk, the world's richest man who also owns Tesla and the social platform X, has emerged as a leading voice on the American right. He's poured millions of dollars into Trump's presidential bid and turned the platform once known as Twitter into a site popular with Trump supporters, as well as conspiracy theorists, extremists and Russian propagandists. Musk's contacts with Putin raise national security questions, given his companies' work for the government, and highlight concerns about Russian influence in American politics. Here's what to know: What they talked about Musk and Putin have spoken repeatedly about personal matters as well as business and geopolitics, The Journal reported Thursday, citing multiple current and former officials in the U.S., Europe and Russia. During one talk, Putin asked Musk not to activate his Starlink satellite system over Taiwan as a favor for Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose ties to Putin have grown closer, the Journal reported. Putin and Xi have met more than 40 times since 2013. Russia has denied the conversations took place. In 2022, Musk said he'd only spoken to Putin once, in a call 18 months earlier focused on space. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said Friday that it was 'not aware of the specifics' of any requests made by Putin on China’s behalf. There was no immediate response to messages left with X and Tesla seeking Musk's comment. What the talks mean for national security Musk’s relationship with Putin raises national security questions given the billions of dollars in government contracts awarded to SpaceX, a critical partner to NASA and government satellite programs. Trump also has vowed to give Musk a role in his administration if he wins next month. The head of any large defense contractor would face similar questions if they held private talks with one of America's greatest adversaries, said Bradley Bowman, a former West Point professor and Senate national security adviser who now serves as senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based defense think tank. Bowman said the timing of the calls as reported by The Journal and Musk's changing views on Ukraine was a 'disturbing coincidence.' 'The policy of the U.S. government is to try to isolate Vladimir Putin, and Elon Musk is directly undercutting that,' Bowman said. 'What is Putin doing with Musk? He's trying to reduce his international isolation and impact American foreign policy.' The request from Putin on Starlink as a favor to China is also likely to get attention, given U.S. support for Taiwan and concerns about the growing partnership between the Kremlin and Beijing. Musk, whose Tesla operates Gigafactory Shanghai, has developed a close relationship with China’s top leaders. His remarks about China have been friendly, and he has suggested Taiwan cede some control to Beijing by becoming a special administrative region. Moscow has growing ties to other American adversaries. The U.S. has accused Russia of sending ballistic missiles to Iran and said North Korea sent troops to Russia, possibly for combat in Ukraine. On Ukraine, Musk's views have shifted since he initially supported Kyiv following Russia's invasion in 2022 and provided it with his Starlink system for communications. Musk then refused to allow Ukraine in 2023 to use Starlink for a surprise attack on Russian soldiers in Crimea. He also floated a proposal in 2022 to end the war that would have required Ukraine to drop its plans for NATO membership and given Russia permanent control of Crimea, which it seized in 2014. The plan infuriated Ukrainian leaders. One person familiar with the talks between Musk and Putin told The Journal that there is no evidence the contact between Musk and Putin represents a security problem for the U.S. Asked about Musk’s contacts with Putin, White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters Friday that he had no information to share. The CIA, Pentagon and National Security Agency and had no comment. The State Department didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Musk's close ties to Trump Musk recently appeared at a Trump rally, sporting a Make America Great Again hat and delivered a ominous warning that if Trump lost the race 'this will be the last election.' Last year, Musk mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s request for aid for his country with a meme and said in February that the U.S. should cut its assistance because Ukraine couldn’t win. Trump, who has praised Putin’s leadership and criticized the NATO alliance and U.S. aid for Ukraine, has raised questions about what he would be willing to concede if he's elected in a negotiation over Ukraine's future U.S. intelligence officials and private tech analysts have concluded that Russia is working to covertly support Trump with disinformation and propaganda targeting his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Since he took over X, it has become a leading online source of Russian propaganda and disinformation aimed at Americans. Trump has faced scrutiny over his own recent contacts with Putin, outlined in a new book by Watergate journalist Bob Woodward. Woodward quoted an unnamed Trump aide who said the former president and Putin may have had as many as seven conversations since Trump lost reelection in 2020. Before one of the calls, the aide said they were asked to leave Trump’s office to give the two privacy. The Trump campaign and the Kremlin have denied those calls occurred. In response to questions about Musk and Putin, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the billionaire 'a once-in-a-generation industry leader' whose ideas could benefit 'our broken federal bureaucracy.' 'As for Putin, there’s only one candidate in the race that he did not invade another country under, and it’s President Trump,' Leavitt said in a statement. 'President Trump has long said that he will re-establish his peace through strength foreign policy to deter Russia’s aggression and end the war in Ukraine.' Russia confirms one conversation Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday rejected The Journal’s report as 'absolutely false information.' Peskov said Putin and Musk once held a 'medium-length phone conversation' prior to 2022 that was 'as more of an introductory nature' and that the two talked about 'visionary technologies, technological solutions for the future.' 'After that, Musk had no contacts with Putin,' Peskov said, dismissing The Journal’s article as political. 'The election has entered its home stretch, and of course the opponents stop at nothing,' Peskov said. 'Remember that a week ago they were saying that Putin allegedly talks to Trump all day long. Now he allegedly talks to Musk all the time. It’s all untrue.' Ukraine’s military intelligence told the AP that they would 'refrain from commenting' about communication between Putin and Musk. ___ Associated Press writers Didi Tang in Washington, Daria Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, and Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/musk-putin-x-trump-tesla-election-russia-9cecb7cb0f23ccce49336771280ae179	2024-10-25T08:21:30-07:00	
Tunisian commentator sentenced to two years under controversial anti-fake news law	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — A well-known Tunisian attorney and commentator was sentenced to two years in prison over remarks she made about the North African country and its treatment of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. Sonia Dahmani was found guilty on Thursday of violating a statute against fake news that critics have long argued Tunisian authorities use to stifle criticism of President Kais Saied. Saied, a populist, has aggressively pursued his opponents since taking office, often casting them as foreign agents or accusing them of undermining state security. The cybercrime statute, known as Decree-Law 54, makes it illegal 'to produce, spread, disseminate, send or write false news ... with the aim of infringing the rights of others, harming public safety or national defense or sowing terror among the population.' Since its passage in 2022, journalists and human rights groups have said Decree-Law 54 is among the ways that authorities have curbed freedom of expression in Tunisia under Saied. Dozens of opposition figures, journalists and political commentators have been charged after criticizing the government, including Dahmani, who is being prosecuted in several cases for remarks she made earlier this year, her attorney Sami Ben Ghazi told The Associated Press. In May, she sarcastically criticized Tunisia on a private radio station, calling attention to the economic conditions and the racism afflicting Black migrants living in the country. 'What a magnificent country you speak of,' she said on the radio during a discussion about migrants that followed clashes between them and Tunisians. Masked plainclothes officers subsequently raided the headquarters of Tunisia’s bar association to arrest her. Ben Ghazi called Thursday's sentence unjust and 'part of the pattern of harassment practiced by the authorities against free voices' while Dahmani's defense committee said she was a 'victim of injustice and various judicial abuses.' Arrests ramped up in the months before Tunisia's Oct. 6 presidential election, which Saied won with 90.7% of the vote. Government critics including Dahmani, her fellow Radio IFM commentators Mourad Zeghidi and Borhane Bsaïs, and journalist and commentator Mohammed Boughalleb were all sentenced on charges that included violating Decree-Law 54. Zeghidi and Bsais in May were sentenced to one year in prison for violating the statute. Boughalleb was sentenced to six months in prison in April. 'Under such a decree, no critic of the authorities can feel safe,' Human Rights Watch said in a report last December in which it documented 22 court cases against government critics. Tunisia is among the countries in which populist politicians have in recent years pushed for legislation targeting the dissemination of so-called fake news. From Egypt to Uganda, press freedom advocates have said that leaders have exploited newfound concerns about misinformation to pass new laws that stifle legitimate criticism of the government. The National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists in a statement expressed its 'firm condemnation of the ongoing policy of blackout and restrictions on journalistic work' put in place by authorities. __ Metz reported from Rabat, Morocco.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-dahmani-decree-54-misinformation-crackdown-dissent-5d1cd879bb081796439a469db744014e	2024-10-25T08:10:59-07:00	
Brazil reaches a $23 billion settlement with mining firms over a 2015 environmental disaster	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's federal government on Friday reached a multibillion-dollar settlement with the mining companies responsible for a 2015 dam collapse that the government said was the country's worst-ever environmental disaster. Under the agreement, Samarco — a joint venture of Brazilian mining giant Vale and Anglo-Australian firm BHP — will pay 132 billion reais ($23 billion) over 20 years. The payments are meant to compensate for human, environmental and infrastructure damage caused by the release of an immense amount of toxic mining waste into a major river in southeastern Minas Gerais state, killing 19 people and ravaging entire villages. 'We are fixing a disaster that could have been avoided, but wasn’t,' President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in a hall of the presidential palace, surrounded by governors of the affected states, members of his administration, reporters and victims. Lula's speech, filled with criticism of what he called the mining companies’ irresponsibility in chasing profit over safety, was met with applause from the audience. The toxic sludge — enough to fill 13,000 Olympic-size swimming pools — flowed down the Doce River for 420 miles to the Atlantic Ocean, contaminating waterways and coastal areas in two neighboring states. The mining companies told the federal government during negotiations that they had already paid 38 billion reais ($6.7 billion) in reparations. In a statement Friday, Samarco said the agreement allowed for the resolution of lawsuits related to the dam rupture. Rodrigo Vilela, Samarco's president, said in the statement that the collapse was a watershed in their history, which they 'deeply regret and will never forget.' 'The agreement signed today reinforces Samarco and its shareholders’ commitment to people, communities and the environment, ensuring the continuation of full and definitive repair and compensation for the damages,' he added. The settlement includes compensation for more than 300,000 victims, though that figure does not account for everyone affected. Twice as many people — 620,000 — took their case to a UK court on Monday seeking reparations. The class action lawsuit at the High Court in London seeks an estimated 36 billion pounds ($47 billion) in damages from BHP. The case was filed in Britain because one of BHP’s two main legal entities was based in London at the time. The London suit prompted the Brazilian Supreme Court's Chief Justice, Luís Roberto Barroso, to personally seek Lula's commitment to ensure parties reached an agreement domestically. 'I spoke with Lula and said, ‘Mr. President, there is a case abroad, and it will be very damaging to the Brazilian courts if this matter is resolved outside the country,’' Barroso said Friday at the presidential palace. The Brazilian federal government said victims would receive 35,000 reais ($6,150) each, while fishermen and farmers would be paid 95,000 reais ($17,000) in total through monthly installments over four years. Cristiano Sales, 42, was born and raised in Bento Rodrigues, one of the districts in the municipality of Mariana that was washed over by the sludge nine years ago. When he returned to the ruins of his house three months later, the only item he found was a jersey from his favorite soccer team, Cruzeiro. Sales lives in a new house in a neighborhood built by the mining companies as part of compensation to his father. After filing a lawsuit, he personally received 100,000 reais ($18,000) and is still pursuing additional reparations through the London suit. 'Money can’t pay for what we’ve been through here,' he said. 'We take the money because it’s our right. But to say that 100,000 or even 200,000 or 300,000 could bring back the life we had — I don’t think any amount of money can do that.' Melbourne, Australia-based BHP said in a statement on Oct. 19 it believes the U.K. action is unnecessary because it duplicates matters covered by reparation efforts and legal proceedings in Brazil, but will continue to defend itself. Pogust Goodhead, the law firm representing the plaintiffs, said Friday the settlement in Brazil shouldn’t have any impact on the London case and that there will be no double compensation. The firm added that its clients were excluded from the negotiations and are still pursuing full reparations for unresolved damages. 'The Mariana agreement signed this Friday in Brazil demonstrates that, after 9 years of negligence, the mining companies have finally decided to react to the pressure from public opinion and the trial in England, which began last Monday,' the law firm said in a statement. 'Even so, the amounts defined are far from covering the profound losses suffered by the victims, who continue to fight for justice and full reparations.' ___ Hughes reported from Bento Rodrigues, Brazil.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-mining-collapse-settlement-bhp-samarco-vale-mariana-8b84c808fa25139e019d7981a3b7de19	2024-10-25T07:58:43-07:00	
Calls for reparations for Britain's slave trade are rooted in dark legacy	LONDON (AP) — A debate about reparations for Britain’s role in the slave trade overshadowed a summit in Samoa of the Commonwealth, many of whose member nations were once British colonies. Britain insists it will not pay to make amends for the historic wrong, but both King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed the issue indirectly at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. 'None of us can change the past but we can commit with all our hearts to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right the inequalities that endure,' Charles said. The legacy of slavery is interwoven in some of Britain’s richest and most revered institutions — from the Church of England to the insurance giant Lloyd’s of London to the monarchy itself. 'Britain benefited from transatlantic enslavement,' said Olivette Otele, professor of the legacies and memory of slavery at the School of African and Oriental Studies at University of London. 'The money and the money trail is there to prove it. So we need to have these conversations much more openly.' It's a discussion that has been going on for a long time. Charles, when he was Prince of Wales, spoke of the 'appalling atrocity of slavery, which forever stains our history' during a visit to Barbados in 2021. At the Commonwealth summit two years ago in Rwanda, he spoke of his sorrow over slavery and its legacy for Indigenous communities and said it was a 'conversation whose time has come.' Here's a look at why the issue is getting attention now. What was Britain's role in the slave trade? Britain got involved in the slave trade in the mid-1500s, following Portugal and Spain. John Hawkins, one of the most notable sailors and naval commanders of the 16th century, is considered one of the pioneers of the English slave trade triangle. Goods were traded in West Africa for captured slaves who were shipped across the Atlantic to work in British sugar and tobacco plantations in the Caribbean and the Americas. Goods produced in the so-called New World were transported back to England. In 1672, the Royal African Company, established under King Charles II and run by his brother, Prince James (the future King James II), was given a monopoly on the slave trade. The company trafficked 80,000 African men, women and children to slavery in the Americas and about 20,000 died on the journey before the monopoly ended in 1698 when any Englishman could trade slaves. At its height, Britain was the world's biggest slave-trading nation and transported more than 3 million Africans across the Atlantic. When was it abolished? An abolitionist movement arose in England in the late 1700s, supported by Quakers, a few politicians and some former slaves. The slave trade was not outlawed until 1807. Even then Parliament did not emancipate slaves in its territories until 1833. 'But it didn’t go as planned,' Otele said. 'Plantation owners, some of them absentee plantation owners because they lived in Britain, were extremely wealthy. Their ancestors had been trading for centuries so they resisted and put pressure on Parliament ... to pay them for the so-called loss of their property..' The 1837 Compensation Act led to 20 million pounds, 40% of the national budget at the time, being paid to plantation owners for the loss of their slaves. It took until 2015 for the Bank of England to pay off the debt from those payouts. What is the current debate about? The movement demanding reparations goes back decades. The U.K. has never formally apologized for its role in the trade. Studies estimate Britain would owe between hundreds of millions and trillions of dollars in compensation to descendants of slaves. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed deep sorrow in 2006 for Britain’s role in the trade but stopped short of offering an apology or compensation for descendants of slaves. Activists said Blair's careful word choice reflected the government’s fear of paying out huge reparations. In 2013, the Caribbean trade bloc known as Caricom made a list of requests including that European governments formally apologize and create a repatriation program for those who wish to return to their homeland, which has not happened. On Thursday, Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis said he wanted a 'frank' discussion with Starmer about the matter and would seek mention of reparations in the leaders’ final statement at the Samoa event. All three candidates to be the next Commonwealth Secretary-General — from Gambia, Ghana and Lesotho — have endorsed policies of reparatory justice for slavery. Other European nations, including the Netherlands, and some British institutions have started to own up to their role in the trade. The Church of England last year announced a 100-million-pound ($130 million) fund last year for projects 'focused on improving opportunities for communities adversely impacted by historic slavery,' though a church advisory panel said it should increase it to $1 billion. Some of the descendants of slave traders have made their own amends. A descendant of Scottish 19th-century sugar and coffee plantation owner John Gladstone — father of 19th-century British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone — apologized last year to Guyana for his great-great-great grandfather's role as an absentee slave owner in what was then British Guiana. He received 100,000 pounds in compensation for hundreds of slaves. After earlier insisting that the Samoa summit should avoid becoming mired in the past and 'very, very long endless discussions about reparations,' Starmer acknowledged 'calls to face up to the harms and injustices of the past through reparatory justice.' Starmer said the 'most effective way to maintain a spirit of respect and dignity is by working together to make sure the future is not in the shadow of the past, but is illuminated by it.' Jacqueline McKenzie — a partner at London law firm Leigh Day — working on the issue of reparations, said the issue of how to reckon with the legacy of the slave trade is 'complex.' 'Reparations is not straightforward,' she said. 'At the moment it’s a discussion among the elites, and the people, the descendants of the enslaved … aren’t really part of the discussion.' ___ Associated Press writer Jill Lawless contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-slavery-history-reparations-colonies-16c0e99c4b4fa6da743baa21c8dcd09f	2024-10-25T07:55:05-07:00	
The Latest: Trump sits down with Joe Rogan, Harris to rally with Beyoncé	Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will center their attention on Texas on Friday with both presidential candidates holding events in the staunchly Republican state. The vice president will team up with Beyoncé for a rally aimed at highlighting the perilous medical fallout from the state’s strict abortion ban and putting the blame squarely on Trump. Meanwhile, the former president held a news conference in Austin Friday afternoon and is expected to sit down with podcaster Joe Rogan later in the day. President Joe Biden visited a reservation in Arizona, a long-promised trip to Indian Country that Democrats hope could boost Harris' turnout effort in a key battleground state. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump wraps remarks in Austin without taking questions from reporters Donald Trump has concluded his remarks in Austin, Texas. He spoke for about 45 minutes, with a heavy emphasis on immigration. Trump did not take questions from reporters while speaking, and he didn’t answer shouted questions afterward. Both major presidential candidates are in Texas on Friday. Kamala Harris took questions from reporters ahead of her rally later this evening with Beyoncé in Houston. Trump predicts he’ll break records for deportations if he wins the election Donald Trump is predicting he’ll break records for the number of people deported from the United States if he wins the election. At an appearance in Texas, Trump praised President Dwight D. Eisenhower for overseeing mass deportations as part of a sweeping plan known by the racist title 'Operation Wetback.' Trump has made mass deportation a centerpiece of his campaign for a second term in the White House. 'I think we’ll break that record,' Trump said of Eisenhower’s deportations. 'Not that I want to break it, but I think we have no choice.' He said his administration will put 'these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them the hell out of the country.' Leonardo DiCaprio endorses Harris for president Leonardo DiCaprio is endorsing Kamala Harris for president, with the Oscar-winning actor expressing support for the Democratic nominee in a video Friday. 'Climate change is killing the earth and ruining our economy. We need a bold step forward to save our economy, our planet and ourselves,' DiCaprio said. 'That’s why I’m voting for Kamala Harris.' DiCaprio, long an outspoken advocate for addressing the climate crisis, has supported Democratic candidates in the past. In early 2020, he attended a fundraiser for Joe Biden at the home of former Paramount Pictures chief Sherry Lansing. With less than two weeks until Election Day, Harris has received the support of many high-profile entertainers including Taylor Swift, Oprah Winfrey, Meryl Streep, Chris Rock and George Clooney. Republican nominee Donald Trump’s celebrity supporters include Elon Musk, Dennis Quaid, Roseanne Barr and Kid Rock. In December 2016, DiCaprio and the head of his eponymous foundation met with Trump, then president-elect, to discuss how jobs centered on preserving the environment could boost the economy. Trump again likens the US to a ‘garbage can’ AUSTIN, Texas — Former President Donald Trump is doubling — and tripling — down on likening the United States to a trash receptacle. 'We’re like a garbage can. We’re like a garbage can,' he said Friday. He noted that, 'The first time I said it was last night.' During a Thursday night event, Trump had declared that the U.S. was 'like a garbage can for the world.' Vice President Kamala Harris, in response on Friday, called that comment, 'Another example of how he really belittles our country.' Moments after her reaction, Trump said it twice more during an appearance in Texas. Trump derides Harris’ rally with Beyoncé as ‘rubbing shoulders’ with ‘woke celebrities’ AUSTIN, Texas — Donald Trump is dismissing Kamala Harris’ rally in Houston with Beyoncé as his opponent 'rubbing shoulders' with 'woke celebrities.' 'I think she’s coming here today,' Trump said in Austin. 'She picked the wrong place. I think she picked the wrong place.' He said that instead of her rally with a superstar, Harris should meet with victims of violent crimes committed by people in the country illegally. He called some immigrants arrested for allegedly committing violent crimes 'animals.' Trump says Biden administration has made Texas ‘ground zero’ for a border ‘invasion’ AUSTIN, Texas — Former President Donald Trump is saying in Texas that Vice President Kamala Harris is using the state as a 'staging ground' to bring armies of people into the U.S. illegally. The former president says the Biden administration is making Texas 'ground zero' for a border 'invasion,' though he blamed Harris. Trump also suggested that mismanagement of the U.S.-Mexico border was a crime against humanity. There is no evidence to support those claims, however. Trump slams judge’s order for Virginia to restore some purged voter registrations AUSTIN, Texas — Trump has kicked off his remarks in Texas by slamming a judge ordering Virginia to restore registered voters who were purged from the state’s voter roles close to Election Day. 'The outrageous decision goes against the bedrock of our democracy,' Trump said. ‘I do not have a Cabinet yet’ HOUSTON — Asked about reporting that JP Morgan chief Jamie Dimon would consider a role in Kamala Harris’ possible administration, Harris said she didn’t want to talk about theoretical leadership with the election not over. 'We have 11 days to go,' she said. 'I do not have a Cabinet yet.' Harris pledges to sign bill ‘putting back in place reproductive freedom’ HOUSTON — Answering a question about how she as president would advance reproductive rights legislation through Congress, where Democrats might not have control in either chamber following the elections, Kamala Harris promoted Democrat Colin Allred’s effort to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz from his Texas seat. 'It is my pledge — when Congress passes a bill putting back in place reproductive freedom — I will sign it,' she added. 'There’s no other plan. We keep fighting.' Harris calls Texas ‘ground zero’ when it comes to issues related to abortion HOUSTON — Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off her remarks to reporters ahead of a campaign event in Texas Friday by calling the non-battleground state 'ground zero' when it comes to issues related to abortion. The Democratic nominee called elected leaders to task for that situation, saying her event Friday night will be centered around 'the harm' that has caused for Americans. Trump arrives in Austin, Texas AUSTIN, Texas — Former President Donald Trump has arrived in Austin, Texas, where he’ll deliver remarks ahead of an expected taping of Joe Rogan’s popular podcast. He’ll be speaking in an airport hangar before invited guests. Signs that read 'END MIGRANT CRIME' and 'DEPORT ILLEGALS NOW' will be his backstop. Trump visiting Texas to tape Joe Rogan’s podcast and to criticize Harris on immigration AUSTIN, Texas — Former President Donald Trump on Friday is heading to Texas — his first public campaign event in the state since receiving the Republican nomination — to sit down with the most listened-to-podcaster in the country, creating another opportunity for him to highlight the hypermasculine tone that has defined much of his 2024 White House bid. The GOP presidential nominee will hold a news conference in Austin and meet with podcaster Joe Rogan at his studio there. It is only the second time he has campaigned in the state after a Dallas visit where he addressed members of the National Rifle Association in May. On Friday, his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, will also be visiting Texas for a rally on abortion rights with superstar Beyoncé. Read more here. Holocaust survivor criticizes Harris for calling Trump a ‘fascist’ WASHINGTON — A 94-year-old Holocaust survivor is criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for calling former President Donald Trump a ' fascist.' Jerry Wartski appears in a video for Trump’s campaign, saying, 'I know more about Hitler than Kamala will ever know in a thousands lifetimes.' He’s referring to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, who he describes having murdered his parents. In the video, Wartski rolls up his sleeve to reveal a number tattooed on his arm while he was a prisoner at the Auschwitz concentration camp. He says Harris owes Holocaust victims and survivors an apology. Harris called Trump a fascist during a CNN town hall this week. She said his comments denouncing the 'enemy within' mean he may prove willing to target Americans who disagree with him should he win the Nov. 5 election. Trump to return to Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum next week MILWAUKEE — Former President Donald Trump is returning to the site of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee just four days before the election. Trump plans to hold a rally at the Fiserv Forum on Nov. 1, his campaign said Friday. The stop comes two days after another planned rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The state is one of the most hard-fought this year with both sides expecting a razor-close finish. Vice President Kamala Harris was in both Milwaukee and Green Bay last week. Johnson and McConnell blast Harris over saying she believes Trump is a fascist WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for saying she believes that former President Donald Trump is a fascist during a CNN town hall, saying her words could lead to violence. 'Labeling a political opponent as a ‘fascist,’ risks inviting yet another would-be assassin to try robbing voters of their choice before Election Day,' the two Republicans said in their statement. When asked if she believed Trump is a fascist, Harris replied twice, 'Yes, I do.' Later, she brought it up herself, saying Trump would, if elected again, be 'a president who admires dictators and is a fascist.' The two lawmakers said they have been briefed on ongoing threats to Trump and called on Harris to take the threats seriously, adding 'stop escalating the threat environment, and help ensure President Trump has the necessary resources to be protected from those threats.' The two did not address comments coming from Trump, who at his rallies has also referred to Harris as a 'Marxist' and a 'fascist.' ACLU wants South Carolina to reopen voter registration for 1,900 teens COLUMBIA, S.C. — A civil rights organization wants South Carolina to reopen voter registration for nearly 1,900 teens after the state Department of Motor Vehicles failed to notify election officials that they checked the box to register as they got their driver’s licenses. The teens were 17 at the time they went to the DMV, but would be 18 by Election Day. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit Tuesday, a day after early voting started in South Carolina. Lawyers for the DMV, election officials and lawmakers said they are sympathetic toward the teens, but it is too late to verify the teens are eligible and adjust the voting rolls. A judge promised a ruling Friday after hearing arguments from both sides. Federal judge orders Virginia to restore more than 1,600 voter registrations ALEXANDRIA, Va. — A federal judge on Friday ordered Virginia to restore more than 1,600 voter registrations that she said were illegally purged in the past two months to keep noncitizens from voting. U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles granted an injunction request brought against Virginia election officials by the Justice Department, which claimed the voter registrations were wrongly canceled during a 90-day quiet period ahead of the November election that restricts states from making large-scale changes to their voter rolls. Thomas Sanford, an attorney with the Virginia attorney general’s office, told the judge at the conclusion of Friday’s hearing that the state intends to appeal her ruling. The Justice Department and private groups, including the League of Women Voters, said many of the 1,600 voters whose registrations were canceled were citizens whose registrations were canceled because of bureaucratic errors or simple mistakes like a wrongly checked box on a form. Election workers identified about 2,500 Pennsylvania voter registration forms that may be fraudulent, officials say LANCASTER, Pa. — Officials in a Pennsylvania county say an investigation is underway after election workers identified about 2,500 voter registration forms that may be fraudulent. The Lancaster County Elections Board and the county prosecutor plan to hold a news conference Friday to discuss the steps taken so far. The county says the registrations in question arrived in two batches shortly before Pennsylvania’s deadline to register to vote, which was this past Monday. Harris, Beyoncé team up for a Texas rally on abortion rights and hope battleground states hear them HOUSTON — Vice President Kamala Harris will team up with Beyoncé on Friday for a rally in solidly Republican Texas aimed at highlighting the perilous medical fallout from the state’s strict abortion ban and putting the blame squarely on Donald Trump. It’s a message intended to register far beyond Texas in the political battleground states, where Harris is hoping that the aftereffects from the fall of Roe v. Wade will spur voters to turn out to support her quest for the presidency. Harris will also be joined at the rally by women who have nearly died from sepsis and other pregnancy complications because they were unable to get proper medical care, including women who never intended to end their pregnancies.

Biden heads to Indian Country as Harris steps up appeal to Native American voters PHOENIX — President Joe Biden is at last making his way to Indian Country, paying a long-promised visit to a reservation in Arizona that Democrats hope could provide a boost to Vice President Kamala Harris’ turnout effort in a key battleground state. Biden’s visit to the Gila River Indian Community’s land on the outskirts of metro Phoenix will be his first to Indian Country as president — something he promised tribal leaders he would do nearly two years ago. During the visit, Biden intends to formally apologize to Native Americans for the U.S. government’s role in the abuse and neglect of Native children sent to federal boarding schools to assimilate them into white society, according to the White House.

Some warn it will make them pricier If Donald Trump wins the presidential election, Republicans hope he will fulfill a longstanding GOP goal of privatizing the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been under government control since the Great Recession. But Democrats and some economists warn that, especially in this time of high mortgage rates, doing so will make buying a home even more expensive. Read more here. Like Biden, Harris puts focus on Trump as Election Day draws near WASHINGTON — With the end of her abbreviated presidential campaign in sight, Kamala Harris is trying to put the focus squarely on Donald Trump and his threat to democratic institutions, echoing the strategy used by Joe Biden before he ended his reelection bid. It’s a bet that fear of the former Republican president can rally Harris supporters and nudge undecided voters to her side in the final days. Harris’ challenge will be connecting philosophical questions about American democracy with the everyday concerns of individual Americans. The effort will be on full display Tuesday, when Harris delivers what her team describes as her closing argument from the Ellipse, the grassy space adjacent to the National Mall in Washington. It’s the same place where Trump stood when he urged his supporters to march on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in what became a bloody attempt to prevent the certification of Biden’s election victory.

Criminals may be leveraging climate change as record acreage burns in Brazil's Amazon	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Wildfires in Brazil have swept through an area the size of Switzerland, a level of destruction that will take decades to recover, if it ever does, according to a new satellite assessment. The breadth of forest that has been lost or degraded was revealed as smoke that has blanketed the country cleared, thanks to rains that may be ending the worst drought Brazil has ever recorded. 'The data is exceptionally alarming, it's a very abrupt surge,' Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit, told The Associated Press. The area that burned between January and mid-October 2024 represents an 846% increase over the same period in 2023. That's five times larger than the forest fires of 2019 when, under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, rampant destruction of the Amazon made headlines worldwide. The estimate comes from the National Institute for Space Research, which tracks Brazil's official deforestation rate. This surge in fire comes one year before the Amazon city of Belém will host the annual U.N. climate conference, COP30. The level of destruction is raising suspicions among Brazilian officials and experts that criminals are using climate change to their advantage. Deforestation in the Amazon usually begins with chainsaws. Wet, fallen trees are left lying on the ground until they're dry enough to set afire. They're not even used for lumber. Now with the forest drying out from drought, lawbreakers seeking to create more pasture may be skipping the expensive, labor-intensive step of felling trees. A lighter and a few gallons of gasoline suffice to start a blaze. 'The drought played a major role in fueling the spread, but fire has also been weaponized,' Alencar said. 'The forest’s resilience to a severe drought is proving to be very low,' André Lima, secretary of deforestation control at the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, told the AP in his office in Brasilia. 'You don't need 1 million people setting fires to cause the disaster. One thousand can do it. We recorded 500 large blazes, that all began with a match.' Fueled by human-induced climate change and the El Nino phenomenon, the world’s largest basin is reeling from two years of severe drought. Many rivers fell to record lows in 2023, then broke those records again in 2024. Fish and endangered river dolphins have died in water that is too hot for them. Hundreds of river communities have been stranded without transportation. Then came fire. In September, wildfires surged through the region, doubling the acreage that had burned so far this year. With more than two months still remaining in 2024, it's already the largest area burned since the government began using its current methodology a decade ago. The estimate of forest loss comes as delegates from around the world are meeting in the Colombian city of Cali for COP16, focused on preserving biodiversity. The hypothesis that criminals are piggybacking on climate change needs more study, Lima said. But there is some evidence for it. One clue is that the conservation area that has suffered the most damage is Jamanxim National Forest. Dozens of landgrabbers have been illegally ranching cattle there, hoping their operations will be legalized. It is near the city of Novo Progresso, a deforestation hotspot where Bolsonaro, who favors economic development over forest preservation, received 83% of the votes in his failed 2022 re-election bid. The blazes have swept through 1,900 square kilometers (733 square miles) of Jamanxim this year, mostly in September, a 700% increase over 2023, according to MapBiomas, a network of non-governmental organizations that monitors land use. The unprecedented rise in fire has prompted Brazil's government to consider mandating that all burned areas be reforested — a deterrent for landgrabbers who hope to convert public forest into their own private pasture. Lima thinks local and state governments should act as well, since most fires start on rural private property, which is their jurisdiction. 'We need structural changes in policies to address climate change,' he said. The rise of wildfire in the Amazon is part of a global trend and makes climate change worse. A recent study published in the journal Science estimated that carbon emissions from forest fires increased 60% between 2001 and 2023. The researchers warned that forests, and all the carbon they store, are increasingly vulnerable to fire. Unlike wildfire in North America, where blazes sometimes reach treetops and expand from there, in the Amazon rainforest, fire spreads mostly through leaves on the ground, causing less harm. The deforestation control agency, known as INPE, tallies these areas as burn scars, not as deforestation. That is why, despite the surge in fire, this year's deforestation rate is still slowing under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and could end 2024 with a 60% reduction compared to Bolsonaro's years. This shows how deforestation is only one metric — and one that does not provide a full picture for damage to the forest in a given year. 'In areas where the fire was very intense, the forest may completely collapse,' Claudio Almeida, a senior officer at INPE, told the AP. 'Even regions where the fire was not as intense are now severely degraded and fragile. Another season of intense drought and fires could lead to the breakdown of the forest.' ____ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Ex-commander of a Ugandan rebel group has been sentenced to 40 years in prison	A former commander of the Lord’s Resistance Army rebels was sentenced by a court in Uganda on Friday to 40 years in prison for brutal crimes committed by the group during its insurgency that started in the 1980s. The jail sentence of Thomas Kwoyelo — a child soldier turned rebel commander — applies to the most serious crimes he faced, including multiple counts of murder, rape, pillaging, and enslavement. In August, Kwoyelo was convicted on 44 of the 78 counts he faced for crimes committed during the insurgency between 1992 and 2005. The sentence was delivered by a panel of the High Court that sat in Gulu, the northern city where the LRA once was active. He can appeal the sentence. Kwoyelo, whose trial began in 2019, had been in detention since 2009 as Ugandan authorities tried to figure out how to dispense justice in a way that was fair and credible. Human Rights Watch described his trial as 'a rare opportunity for justice for victims of the two-decade war between' Ugandan troops and the LRA. Prosecutors said Kwoyelo held the military rank of colonel within the LRA and that he ordered violent attacks on civilians, many of them displaced by the rebellion. The LRA’s overall leader, Joseph Kony, is believed to be hiding in a vast area of ungoverned bush in central Africa. The U.S. has offered $5 million as a reward for information leading to the capture of Kony, who is also wanted by the International Criminal Court. One of Kony’s lieutenants, Dominic Ongwen, was sentenced in 2021 by the ICC to 25 years of imprisonment for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Thousands of other rebel combatants have received Ugandan government amnesty over the years, but Kwoyelo, who was captured in neighboring Congo, was denied such reprieve. Ugandan officials have never explained why. Kwoyelo, who denied the charges against him, testified that only Kony could answer for LRA crimes, and said everyone in the LRA faced death for disobeying the warlord. The LRA, which began in Uganda as an anti-government rebellion — and later expanded its operations to neighboring Congo as well as Central African Republic — was accused of recruiting boys to fight and keeping girls as sex slaves. At the peak of its power, the group was a notoriously brutal outfit whose members for years eluded Ugandan forces in northern Uganda. The LRA was accused of committing multiple massacres targeting mostly members of the Acholi ethnic group. Kony, himself an Acholi, is a self-proclaimed messiah who said early in his rebellion that he wanted to rule Uganda according to the biblical Ten Commandments. When military pressure forced the LRA out of Uganda in 2005, the rebels scattered across parts of central Africa. The group has faded in recent years, and reports of LRA attacks are rare.	https://apnews.com/article/thomas-kwoyelo-ugandan-rebel-commander-8a4dc9d8a15f805bbb6620bc495e6e24	2024-10-25T03:11:45-07:00	
Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon kills 3 journalists as they sleep	BEIRUT (AP) — An Israeli airstrike killed three journalists as they slept at a guesthouse in southeast Lebanon early Friday, a rare strike on an area that had so far been spared the hostilities in the rest of the region. It was the latest in a series of Israeli attacks against journalists covering the war in Gaza and Lebanon in the past year. The 3 a.m. airstrike turned the site — a series of guesthouses nestled among trees that had been rented by various media outlets covering the war — into rubble, with cars marked 'PRESS' overturned and covered in dust and debris. The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike, and later said it was looking into it. Those killed were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and broadcast technician Mohammed Rida of the Beirut-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV, and camera operator Wissam Qassim, who worked for Al-Manar TV of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group. It came after a strike earlier in the week that hit an office belonging to Al-Mayadeen on the outskirts of Beirut’s southern suburbs. Both outlets are aligned with Hezbollah and its main backer, Iran. The strike in the Hasbaya region, which had so far been spared from the Israeli airstrikes pummeling other parts of south Lebanon, drew widespread condemnation from officials, journalists and press advocacy groups. TV crews had arrived in Hasbaya, deeming it safer after Israel had ordered an evacuation order for a town further south from which they were reporting. 'That is why we consider it a direct targetting, aimed at getting the journalists out of the south,' said Elsy Moufarrej, coordinator for the Alternative Press Syndicate in Lebanon. 'They want to prevent the journalists from covering and having presence in the south of Lebanon.' Lebanese Information Minister Ziad Makary said the journalists were killed while reporting on what he called Israel’s 'crimes,' and noted they were among a large group of members of the media. 'This is an assassination, after monitoring and tracking, with premeditation and planning, as there were 18 journalists present at the location representing seven media institutions,' he wrote in a post on X. Imran Khan, a senior correspondent for Al Jazeera English who was among the journalists in the Hasbaya Village Club guesthouses, said the airstrike hit at around 3:30 a.m. without warning. 'These were just journalists that were sleeping in bed after long days of covering the conflict,' he posted on social media, adding that he and his team were unhurt. Hussein Hoteit, a cameraman for Egypt’s Al-Qahira TV, said he was sleeping when he woke up to a 'huge weight' as the walls and ceiling collapsed. He was miraculously saved by colleagues who managed to move the debris covering him few minutes later. He said two missiles hit the chalet next door, although he didn’t hear them. He spoke from his hospital bed where he is being treated for thigh injuries. Friday’s deaths are the latest in a long list of journalists who have been killed by Israel in the past year in Gaza and Lebanon. In a report earlier this month, the Committee to Protect Journalists said at least 128 journalists and media workers, all but five of them Palestinian, had been killed in Gaza and Lebanon — more journalists than have died in any year since it started documenting journalist killings in 1992. All of the killings except two were carried out by Israeli forces, it said. 'One year in, Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza has exacted an unprecedented and horrific toll on Palestinian journalists and the region’s media landscape,' it said in the report released Oct. 4. The killing of journalists has prompted international outcry from press advocacy groups and United Nations experts, although Israel has said it does not deliberately target them. Lebanon’s Health Minister says over the past year 11 journalists have been killed and eight wounded by Israeli fire in Lebanon. In November 2023, two journalists for Al-Mayadeen TV were killed in a drone strike. A month earlier, Israeli shelling in southern Lebanon killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and wounded other journalists from France’s international news agency, Agence France-Presse, and Qatar’s Al-Jazeera TV. This week, Israel accused journalists working for Al Jazeera of being members of militant groups, citing documents it purportedly found in Gaza. The network has denied the claims as 'a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region.' The Committee to Protect Journalists has dismissed them as well, and said that 'Israel has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence.' Jad Shahrour, spokesperson for the Samir Kassir Eyes Center for Media and Cultural Freedom, told The Associated Press Friday that bombing press centers is a deliberate effort to obliterate the truth. 'It means they are establishing a media blackout,' he said, adding that it was a troubling trend that is now shifting from Gaza to Lebanon. Al-Mayadeen’s director, Ghassan bin Jiddo, alleged that the Israeli strike Friday was intentional and directed at those covering elements of its military offensive. Ali Shoeib, Al-Manar’s well-known correspondent in south Lebanon, was seen in a video filming himself with a cellphone saying that the camera operator who had been working with him for months was killed. Shoeib said the Israeli military knew that the area that was struck housed journalists of different media organizations. 'We were reporting the news and showing the suffering of the victims and now we are the news and the victims of Israel’s crimes,' Shoeib added in the video aired on Al-Manar TV. ___ Karam reported from London.

Greek ferry crews call off strike early ahead of three-day holiday weekend	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek ferry crews have curtailed a four-day strike by several hours, announcing Friday they would go back on the job in the early afternoon instead of at midnight. The strike had threatened to disrupt the travel plans of thousands of Greeks heading to islands for a long weekend ahead of a national holiday on Monday. The Greek seamen’s union said their strike that had left ferries tied up in port since Tuesday would end by 2 p.m. Friday, saying they had won some concessions from the government, including increased fines for violations of working conditions and better unemployment benefits for out-of-work seamen. The union said it would continue to pursue all of its demands, which originally included a 12% pay rise. Labor unions are pressing for the restoration of rights that were significantly rolled back during successive international bailouts between 2010 and 2018. The austerity measures implemented as a condition for the rescue loans included severe cuts to public spending, tax increases and labor reforms that resulted in a weakening of collective bargaining rules. School teachers also held a strike earlier this week, seeking salary increases and more permanent positions for temporary staff, among other demands.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-ferry-strike-61dab30d8338606e84032a7780d93c95	2024-10-25T02:55:17-07:00	
The son-in-law of former Myanmar's strongman is arrested over Facebook posts	BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s security forces arrested the son-in-law of the country’s former longtime military ruler, Than Shwe, for allegedly posting inflammatory statements on his Facebook account, the state-run media said Friday. Nay Soe Maung, a 67-year-old retired colonel and a former army medical officer, was the latest to be arrested and jailed for writing Facebook posts that allegedly spread inflammatory news. His arrest came two weeks after he posted criticism of the current military leader and his condolences for the death of Zaw Myint Maung, a senior member of Myanmar’s former ruling party whose government was ousted during the 2021 military takeover. The state-run The Mirror Daily newspaper said Nay Soe Maung was detained and prosecuted at a police station in Pyigyidagun township in Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city on Wednesday. Friday’s report said people who make incitements or share propaganda and support for opposition groups on social media will be prosecuted under the country's laws including counter-terrorism, electronic transactions, sedition and incitement. Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb.1, 2021. The army’s takeover triggered mass public protests that the military and police responded to with lethal force, triggering armed resistance and violence that has escalated into a civil war. Myanmar’s military leadership is known for being close-knit, secretive and sensitive. Data for Myanmar, an independent research group, said in a report last month that about 1,691 people were detained for criticizing the military regime and showing support for opposition groups on social media since the army takeover. Nay Soe Maung is married to a daughter of dictator Than Shwe, who ruled from 1992 until 2011, when he handed power to a nominally civilian, pro-military government. During his rule, he led a feared junta that brutally crushed dissent and routinely jailed political opponents, including Suu Kyi, the charismatic face of Myanmar’s pro-democracy movement. Nay Soe Maung served as a lecturer and rector of the University of Public Health, Yangon, the country’s largest city, after retiring as army doctor. Before the army’s 2021 takeover, he had express support for the previous government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and joined peaceful protests on the streets in Yangon after the military arrested her during the takeover. Days before his arrest, he posted condolences on the death of Zaw Myint Maung, Suu Kyi’s colleague and spokesperson of her NLD party.	https://apnews.com/article/nay-soe-maung-than-shwe-myanmar-incitement-4f2895d28fbe44221378f50bf4b05463	2024-10-25T02:37:53-07:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy claims North Korean troops will be deployed by Russia in coming days	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — North Korean troops are poised to be deployed by Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine as early as this weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Friday. Western officials have warned that such a development would stoke the almost three-year war and bring geopolitical consequences as far away as the Indo-Pacific region. Zelenskyy said Ukrainian intelligence had determined that 'the first North Korean military will be used by Russia in combat zones' between Sunday and Monday. He said on Telegram that the deployment was 'an obvious escalating move by Russia.' He didn’t provide any further details, including where the North Korean soldiers may be sent. Russia has been conducting a ferocious summer campaign along the eastern front in Ukraine, gradually compelling Kyiv to surrender ground. But Russia has struggled to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk border region following an incursion almost three months ago. North Korean units were detected on Wednesday in Kursk, according to Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate, known by its acronym GUR. The soldiers had undergone several weeks of training at bases in eastern Russia and had been equipped with clothes for the upcoming winter, GUR said in a statement late Thursday. It estimated the number of North Korean soldiers sent by Pyongyang to Russia at around 12,000, including some 500 officers and three generals. GUR provided no evidence for its claims. The deployment of North Korean forces under a military pact between Moscow and Pyongyang brings a new dimension to the conflict, which is Europe’s biggest war since World War II and has cost tens of thousands of lives on both sides, including many civilians. The U.S. said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations, calling the move very serious. Zelenskyy said a week ago that his government has intelligence information that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being readied to join Russian forces fighting against his country. He said that a third nation wading into the hostilities would turn the conflict into a 'world war.' North Korea had already been supplying ammunition to Russia under a defense pact, but putting boots on the ground could severely complicate a war that has inflamed international politics, with most Western countries supporting Kyiv. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has looked for support among BRICS countries. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-north-korea-troops-9d83c419ef741259d09860b576b8a27d	2024-10-25T01:52:08-07:00	
7 charged in cyberbullying campaign targeting Paris Olympics' artistic director	PARIS (AP) — French authorities said Friday they have charged seven individuals in connection with a cyberbullying campaign targeting Thomas Jolly, the artistic director behind the Paris Olympics’ opening and closing ceremonies. Jolly became the target of an online hate campaign filled with homophobic and antisemitic abuse following his acclaimed but controversial queer-inclusive opening show in July. He filed a complaint on July 31. The Paris prosecutor’s office, which launched an investigation, reported Friday that the arrests mark only the 'first wave' of detentions, with more expected as authorities expand their probe. The seven defendants, who are 22 to 79 years old, face charges of making death threats, aggravated insults, and cyberbullying, with potential prison sentences and significant fines. Jolly’s opening ceremony was a daring blend of French tradition and LGBTQ+ expression, featuring drag performers, flamboyant runway sequences, and a scene that some have drawn parallels with Da Vinci's 'The Last Supper.' The event, held along the Seine and featuring stars like Celine Dion and Lady Gaga, was meant to be a celebration of freedom and inclusivity. But it became a flashpoint for criticism, with far-right politicians and religious figures condemning some scenes as provocative. Hungary’s ambassador to the Vatican criticized what became known as the 'Last Supper' scene for allegedly mocking Christian iconography. Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump also weighed in, calling the scene 'a disgrace.' Jolly afterward drew attention away from 'The Last Supper' references, saying that hadn’t been his intention. Among the performers, Hugo Bardin, known as the drag queen Paloma, expressed pride in the event’s bold message of inclusion and called it 'a really important moment for the French people and the representation of France around the world.' Le Filip, the winner of Drag Race France, also expressed shock at the backlash against Jolly's event, describing the ceremony as 'a crowning moment' for the LGBTQ+ community. The prosecutor’s office Friday emphasized the seriousness of the charges, noting that the case reflects a troubling pattern of cyberbullying and hate speech directed at prominent figures. It said the suspects sought to 'intimidate and silence expressions of inclusivity' and diversity in a highly public and symbolic event. The arrests are seen as a first step in France’s fight against cyberbullying, which authorities note has become increasingly sophisticated. In Jolly’s case, prosecutors pointed to the disturbing 'pack behavior' of attackers acting independently to escalate the harassment, a pattern seen in other online hate campaigns. The seven accused are set to appear in court on March 5.	https://apnews.com/article/olympics-thomas-jolly-cyberbullying-24c1871664f4d9adc240643ebb20272c	2024-10-25T01:04:36-07:00	
4 astronauts return to Earth after being delayed by Boeing's capsule trouble and Hurricane Milton	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Four astronauts returned to Earth on Friday after a nearly eight-month space station stay extended by Boeing's capsule trouble and Hurricane Milton. A SpaceX capsule carrying the crew parachuted before dawn into the Gulf of Mexico just off the Florida coast after undocking from the International Space Station mid-week. The three Americans and one Russian should have been back two months ago. But their homecoming was stalled by problems with Boeing’s new Starliner astronaut capsule, which came back empty in September because of safety concerns. Then Hurricane Milton interfered, followed by another two weeks of high wind and rough seas. SpaceX launched the four — NASA's Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps, and Russia's Alexander Grebenkin — in March. Barratt, the only space veteran going into the mission, acknowledged the support teams back home that had 'to replan, retool and kind of redo everything right along with us ... and helped us to roll with all those punches.' Their replacements are the two Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, whose own mission went from eight days to eight months, and two astronauts launched by SpaceX four weeks ago. Those four will remain up there until February. The space station is now back to its normal crew size of seven — four Americans and three Russians — after months of overflow. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

2 Indian soldiers and 2 civilian porters are killed in an alleged rebel ambush in Kashmir	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Two Indian army soldiers and their two civilian porters were killed in a rebel ambush in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said Friday. Police said rebels sprayed bullets at an army vehicle carrying soldiers close to the highly militarized line of control near the resort town of Gulmarg on Thursday night. The de facto frontier divides the disputed Kashmir between India and Pakistan, which they both claim it in its entirety. Two soldiers and two civilians working as porters with the Indian military were killed and three other soldiers were wounded, police said. The military said it was a brief firefight and gave no other details. There was no independent confirmation of the incident. On Sunday, gunmen fatally shot at least seven people and injured five others working on a strategic tunnel project near another resort town of Sonamarg. Police blamed militants fighting against Indian rule for decades for the attack. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947.	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-rebel-ambush-d81cc1d887b8d65ff7446f97a1dd0935	2024-10-24T21:12:53-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes on Lebanon and Gaza leave dozens dead	Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said an Israeli airstrike hit guesthouses where journalists were staying in southeast Lebanon, killing three media staffers from two different news agencies Friday. In the southern Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack in the l eft 38 people dead. Several journalists have been killed since a near-daily exchange of fire began along the Lebanon-Israel border on Oct. 8, 2023. Lebanon’s health ministry says the total toll over the past year is over 2,500 killed and 12,000 wounded. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the United Nations children’s agency. Israeli strikes have killed much of Hezbollah’s top leadership since fighting ramped up in September. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Jordan’s Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, on Friday in London, where the Arab leader accused Israel of engaging in ethnic cleansing in Gaza. Safadi did not mince words when describing Israel’s role in the conflicts, saying cease-fire negotiation mediators are trying to 'get through the nightmare that the region continues to live in.' ___ Here's the latest: 41 people killed in 24 hours in Lebanon, health ministry says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s health ministry said Friday that 41 people were killed and 133 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,634 killed and 12,252 wounded. Lebanon’s crisis response unit recorded 125 airstrikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon and the Nabatiyeh province. Several intense airstrikes targeted Khiam village in southern Lebanon, killing four people and wounding four others, Lebanon’s state media said. Some 1,097 centers are sheltering 190,975 people, including 43,712 families, displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the health ministry's report said. Among these shelters, 929 have reached full capacity. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the U.N. children’s agency. People are also flowing across the border to Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 25, Lebanese General Security recorded nearly half a million people crossing into Syria, including 348,237 Syrian and 156,505 Lebanese citizens, the report said. Group decries Israeli airstrike that killed 3 journalists JERUSALEM — The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was appalled by the killing of the three journalists by an Israeli strike in Lebanon. The group on Friday called for an independent investigation into why the guesthouse where they were sleeping was targeted. 'CPJ is deeply outraged by yet another deadly Israeli airstrike on journalists, this time hitting a compound hosting 18 members of the press in south Lebanon,' said the organization’s program director, Carlos Martinez de la Serna. 'Deliberately targeting journalists is a war crime under international law. This attack must be independently investigated and the perpetrators must be held to account.' The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike, and later said it was looking into it. 2 people in Israel killed in rocket attack from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Two people in Israel died of their wounds after a rocket attack from Lebanon on Friday, the country’s rescue services said. A 35-year-old woman and a 21-year-old man died after sustaining critical injuries from rocket shrapnel in the predominantly Arab town of Majd Al-Krum in northern Israel, rescue services said. Rocket shrapnel hit the town’s 'industrial center,' injuring seven others. The Israeli military said that militants in Lebanon fired 45 rockets into Israel on Friday, with some escaping interception. UN human rights chief decries bombing in northern Gaza GENEVA -- The United Nations’ human rights chief says the Israeli government’s actions in northern Gaza 'risk emptying the area of all Palestinians' and argues that 'we are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes.' Volker Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, decried 'nonstop' bombing in northern Gaza in a statement Friday and said that 'the Israeli military has ordered hundreds of thousands to move, with no guarantees of return. But there is no safe way to leave.' Israel has been carrying out a major offensive in northern Gaza for more than two weeks. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have fled their homes. The military says it is battling Hamas fighters who regrouped in the north, one of the first targets of the ground offensive at the start of the war. Türk said that 'the Israeli government’s policies and practices in northern Gaza risk emptying the area of all Palestinians. We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity.' He said Palestinian armed groups also reportedly continue to operate amongst civilians and put them in harm’s way. Türk called on world leaders to act, pointing to a duty under the Geneva Conventions to ensure respect for international humanitarian law. Three more Israeli soldiers killed in Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel’s military announced Friday that three more soldiers were killed in Gaza. All three died on Wednesday, the military said, without specifying if they were all killed in the same incident or providing any details. In all, 359 Israeli soldiers have been killed in fighting in Gaza since the start of the ground operation, following Hamas militants’ attack on Israel Oct. 7. Israel says 3 injured by shrapnel from rocket attack from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Shrapnel from a rocket attack from Lebanon critically injured three people in Israel Friday, Israeli rescue services said. The three — two 21-year-old men and a 35-year-old woman — were injured in Majd Al-Krum, a predominantly Arab town in the country’s north, rescue services said. It said six others were injured, including an 80-year-old man in serious condition. Israel’s military said the rocket barrage hit a gym in the town. Militants in Lebanon fired 45 projectiles into Israel Friday, including some which were intercepted by Israel’s air defenses and others that fell in open areas, the military said. Israeli military confirms its troops operating near north Gaza hospital JERUSALEM — Israel’s military confirmed Friday that its troops were operating around Kamal Adwan hospital in north Gaza. The hospital’s director had said the facility was facing a catastrophic situation with bombardment, Israeli troops preventing the entry of crucial aid and patients dying for lack of medical supplies. In a social media video posted late Thursday, the hospital’s director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, said the hospital had been directly shelled by a tank, a claim the Israeli military did not immediately respond to. 'We’re a few hours away from the death of all these people,' he said. 'Until when will this continue? Instead of receiving aid, we receive tanks.' Israel said troops were operating in the area because it had intelligence that militants and militant infrastructure were there, and said it had evacuated some patients from the hospital the night before and delivered fuel and supplies to the facility. The Associated Press was not immediately able to verify the claims. The hospital is in the Jabaliya refugee camp in north Gaza, where Israel is staging a renewed offensive against Hamas fighters it says have regrouped there. It has called for the evacuation of all civilians in the north. In a voice recording obtained by AP from Thursday, Abu Safiya said the hospital has 14 patients in pediatric and neonatal intensive care, and several patients had died due to a lack of supplies and medicine like antibiotics. He said that one doctor at the hospital was killed Wednesday, as bombing could be heard in the background. His video showed one woman knelt over the yellowed body of a child, who Abu Safiya said had died that morning. Another small child sat alone on a bed, face bloodied and both arms bandaged, crying as flies swarmed around the open wounds on his head. Jordan's foreign minister alleges Israel is engaging in ethnic cleansing LONDON — United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Jordan’s Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, on Friday in London, where the Arab leader accused Israel of engaging in ethnic cleansing in Gaza. 'The only path to save the region from that is for Israel to stop the aggressions on Gaza, on Lebanon, stop unilateral illegal measures of the West Bank that is also pushing this situation,' Safadi said. 'We meet at a very, very critical moment, as you mentioned, the humanitarian situation is really difficult when we look at Northern Gaza, where we do see ethnic cleansing taking place, and that has got to stop,' he said. Safadi is one of many Arab leaders with whom Blinken has met with as he took negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza and a post war plan on a tour of the Middle East. Safadi did not mince words Friday when describing Israel’s role in the conflicts, saying mediators are trying to 'get through the nightmare that the region continues to live in.' Israeli attack kills 38 overnight in Khan Younis DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — The Israeli military conducted operations overnight into Friday in Khan Younis, killing 38 people and injuring more than a dozen others, health officials said. Palestinians who were killed or injured were taken to the European and Nasser Hospitals. Records from the European hospital obtained by the AP showed at least 15 members from al-Farra family were killed, including 13 children. Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal posted a video Friday morning of rescuers recovering the bodies of 9 children from the Al-Farra family in Al Manara neighborhood. The Israeli attack, which included airstrikes and shelling, according to health officials, targeted several residential buildings in neighborhoods east of Khan Younis Governorate. Six members of the Abdeen family were also killed, according to health officials. Israel has attacked 55 hospitals, Lebanon's health minister says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Minister Firass Abiad said Friday that Israel has carried out attacks on 55 hospitals — 36 of which were directly hit — leaving 12 people dead and 60 wounded. Abiad told reporters that eight hospitals have been closed while seven are still partially functioning. He said that paramedic groups have been targeted in different areas, killing 151 people and wounding 212. Of the paramedics killed, eight remain in their ambulances in south Lebanon with Israel’s military preventing anyone from reaching them, he said. 'Attacks against the medical and paramedic sectors in Lebanon are direct and intentional aggressions,' Abiad said, adding that Israel’s military claims to have intelligence information on what is happening in Lebanon, thus cannot say that these attacks happened by mistake. 'This is a war crime,' Abiad said. Israeli strike closes Lebanese border crossing with neighboring Syria BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike in northeast Lebanon has closed another border crossing with neighboring Syria, Lebanon’s state news agency said Friday. The airstrike on the outskirts of the village of Qaa brings the number of border crossings between the two countries that have been struck by Israel’s military to three. That leaves three functioning border crossings. An Israeli airstrike on Oct. 5 blocked a highway and left a giant crater near the Lebanese side of the crossing, known as Masnaa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Beirut. Masnaa is the busiest border crossing between the two countries. In late September, an Israeli airstrike struck the border crossing of Matraba in Lebanon’s northeast, forcing it to close. Lebanon's information minister accuses Israel of committing a war crime BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Information Minister Ziad Makary alleged Friday that the attack on a compound housing journalists which killed three media staffers is an 'assassination' and 'a war crime.' In a statement, Makary said there were 18 journalists representing seven media organizations at the compound in the town of Hasbaya in south Lebanon. The Beirut-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV said two of its staffers — camera operator Ghassan Najar and broadcast technician Mohammed Rida — were among the journalists killed early Friday. Al-Manar TV of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said its camera operator Wissam Qassim was also killed in the airstrike. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strike in Lebanon. Ghassan bin Jiddo, the director of Al-Mayadeen, alleged in a social media post that the journalists were deliberately targeted. 'We hold the (Israeli) occupation fully responsible for this war crime, in which journalist crews, including the Al-Mayadeen team, were targeted,' he said. An Israeli airstrike on a journalist compound kills 3 TV staffers, Lebanon’s state news says BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike on a compound housing journalists in southeast Lebanon has killed three media staffers, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Friday. Local news station Al Jadeed aired footage from the scene showing collapsed buildings and cars marked 'PRESS,' covered in dust and rubble. The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike, which hit a collection of chalets that had been rented by various media outlets. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strike in Lebanon. The Beirut-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV said two of its staffers were among the journalists killed early Friday. Al-Manar TV of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said its camera operator was also killed. The airstrike hit early Friday in the Hasbaya region, which had been spared much of the fighting along the border so far. Several journalists have been killed since a near-daily exchange of fire began along the Lebanon-Israel border on Oct. 8, 2023. Israel has accused journalists working for Al Jazeera of being members of militant groups, citing documents it purportedly found in Gaza. The network has denied the claims as 'a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-25-october-2024-6ef9066c9ff9f2d0518e281f3e622df4	2024-10-24T20:49:51-07:00	
Deadly storm blows away from northern Philippines, but forecasters warn it may do a U-turn	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Tropical storm Trami blew away from the northwestern Philippines on Friday, leaving at least 46 people dead after extensive flooding that forced authorities to scramble for more rescue boats to save thousands of terrified people, who were trapped, some on their roofs. But the onslaught may not be over: state forecasters raised the rare possibility that the storm, the 11th and one of the deadliest to hit the Philippines this year, could make a U-turn next week as its pushed back by high-pressure winds in the South China Sea. The storm was last tracked at dawn blowing 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of the coastal town of Bacnotan in northern La Union province with sustained winds of up to 95 kilometers (59 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 115 kph (78 mph). It was moving northwest at 25 kph (15 mph) toward Vietnam, which was forecast to be lashed by Trami starting on Sunday if it stays on course. The Philippine weather agency, however, said it's possible that high-pressure winds and other weather factors in the South China Sea could force the storm to turn back toward the Philippines. President Ferdinand Marcos, sounding exasperated, inquired about that prospect in an emergency meeting with Cabinet members and disaster-response officials Friday about the response to the widespread devastation. 'What is the forecast for that? Is it possible it would return?' Marcos asked. A government forecaster told him Trami could turn toward the western Philippines early next week, but its more likely to blow away from the Philippines again without making landfall. 'It doesn’t have to make landfall for the damage to occur,' Marcos said, citing the continuing downpours set off by Trami in the Philippines. Marcos also cited another brewing storm in the Pacific Ocean that could again threaten the country. 'Oh God, it is what it is. We just have to deal with it,' Marcos said. State forecaster Jofren Habaluyas told The Associated Press that Trami's possible U-turn has drawn interest among government weather experts in Asia, including those from Japan, which has been providing information to the Philippines to help track the storm. The death toll from Trami rose to at least 46 after five more people were reported killed in floodwaters and landslides in hard-hit Bicol, an agricultural region and tourism destination southeast of Manila that is popular for Mayon, one of the country’s 24 most active volcanoes that has a near-perfect cone. Nine of the newly reported storm deaths were caused by flooding and landslides in Batangas, a coastal resort province south of Manila, which was drenched by torrential rains in the last two days, according to police, which said that they were still gathering details about the deaths. Although Trami did not strengthen into a typhoon, it dumped unusually heavy rains in some regions, including some that saw one to two months’ worth of rainfall in just 24 hours, that inundated communities with flash floods. Officials in Naga city, where 11 people died by drowning, and the outlying provinces of Camarines Sur and Albay pleaded for more rescue boats at the height of the onslaught to reach people trapped on the upper floors of their homes or on their roofs as floodwaters rose. In the foothills of Mayon volcano in Albay province, mud and other debris cascaded toward nearby towns as the storm hit, engulfing houses and cars in black-colored mudflows. More than 2.6 million people were affected by the deluge, with nearly 320,000 people fleeing into evacuation centers or relatives' homes, disaster-mitigation officials said. The government shut down schools and government offices on the main northern island of Luzon. Inter-island ferry services were also suspended, stranding thousands. In Vietnam, state forecasters warned of heavy rains in the central region. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh ordered coastal provinces to stay vigilant, closely monitor Trami’s course and brace for contingencies. Last month, Typhoon Yagi battered Vietnam, killing 323 people and causing extensive damages valued at $3.3 billion, according to a Vietnamese government report. Each year, about 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines, a Southeast Asian archipelago which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and flattened entire villages. ___ Dinh reported from Hanoi, Vietnam.	https://apnews.com/article/storm-trami-philippines-vietnam-439d996e3409a15f0791c70c9a5a24f4	2024-10-24T20:43:15-07:00

Asian stocks are mostly higher, while Japan's Nikkei falls ahead of weekend election	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks were mostly higher Friday aside from in Japan, where investors were awaiting the outcome of an election on Sunday. U.S. futures fell and oil prices rose. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office just weeks ago, called the snap general election to drum up support as the ruling Liberal Democrats grapple with a political funding scandal. Recent upheavals have added to uncertainty for markets, complicating the Bank of Japan's efforts to shift away from long-standing near-zero interest rates. Core inflation in Japan’s capital was 1.8% in October, lower than the central bank’s 2% target for the first time in five months, the government reported. That reinforced expectations that the central bank will keep its key interest rate unchanged at a policy meeting next week. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index lost 1% to 37,771.79, while the Japanese yen rose against the U.S. dollar. Early Friday, the dollar was trading at 151.64 yen, down from 151.89 yen. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.1% to 20,720.60, and the Shanghai Composite gained 0.8% to 3,307.14. China’s central bank kept its medium-term lending rate unchanged at 2%. It also issued 700 billion yuan ($98.3 billion) in one-year medium-term lending facility loans to financial institutions, according to the bank’s statement. Elsewhere, South Korea’s Kospi climbed 0.3% to 2,590.30 and Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 climbed 0.1% to 8,216.50. Taiwan’s Taiex increased 0.3%. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.2% to 5,809.86, breaking its first three-day losing streak since early September. It bounced between losses and gains through the day, and it was roughly evenly split between stocks rising and falling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% to 42,374.36 and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% to 18,415.49. Tesla led the market with a jump of 21.9% after the electric-vehicle maker reported better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. An optimistic CEO Elon Musk also predicted 20%-30% sales growth next year, though revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ forecasts. It was the best day for Tesla’s stock since 2013. Boeing sank 1.2% after its machinists voted to continue their strike, which has crippled aircraft production. More than 60% of union members who voted on the proposed contract rejected it, keeping them on the picket lines six weeks into their strike. Stocks have broadly retreated this week after the S&amp;P 500 and Dow both set records at the end of last week. They’ve been hurt by rising Treasury yields in the bond market, which can make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks. Critics had already been saying beforehand that stocks looked too expensive given how much faster their prices have risen than corporate profits. A report on unemployment claims Thursday offered a mixed picture on the job market. It said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which can be a signal of relatively low layoffs. But it also said the total number of those collecting benefits rose to its highest level in almost three years. Treasury yields, which had eased overnight, pared their losses after the release of the unemployment claims report before yo-yoing. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.20% from 4.25% late Wednesday. It’s still well above its 4.08% level from late last week. A separate preliminary report said growth in U.S. business activity may have accelerated slightly last month, as strength for companies in services industries continue to make up for weakness in manufacturing. The report from S&amp;P Global also showed a recovery in confidence as companies anticipate greater stability and certainty after the upcoming presidential election. A third report, meanwhile, said sales of new homes were stronger last month than economists expected. In other dealings early Friday, benchmark U.S. crude added 10 cents to $70.29 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 13 cents to $74.16 a barrel. The euro fell to $1.0821 from $1.0828. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-japan-a41eeb280a3fa7cc5aaa042023f560ef	2024-10-24T19:32:47-07:00	
An Israeli airstrike on a journalist compound kills 3 TV staffers, Lebanon's state news says	BEIRUT (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on a compound housing journalists in southeast Lebanon has killed three media staffers, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Friday. Local news station Al Jadeed aired footage from the scene — a collection of chalets that had been rented by various media outlets — showing collapsed buildings and cars marked PRESS covered in dust and rubble. The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike. The Beirut-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV said two of its staffers — camera operator Ghassan Najar and broadcast technician Mohammed Rida — were among the journalists killed early Friday. Al-Manar TV of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said its camera operator Wissam Qassim was also killed in the airstrike on the Hasbaya region. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike. Ali Shoeib, Al-Manar’s well-known correspondent in south Lebanon, was seen in a video filming himself with a cellphone saying that the camera operator who had been working with him for months was killed. Shoeib said the Israeli military knew that the area that was struck housed journalists of different media organizations. 'We were reporting the news and showing the suffering of the victims and now we are the news and the victims of Israel’s crimes,' Shoeib added in the video aired on Al-Manar TV. The Hasbaya region has been spared much of the violence along the border and many of the journalists now staying there have moved from the nearby town of Marjayoun that has been subjected to sporadic strikes in recent weeks. Earlier in the week, a strike hit an office belonging to Al-Mayadeen on the outskirts of Beirut’s southern suburbs, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Several journalists have been killed since exchange of fire began along the Lebanon-Israel border in early October last year. In November 2023, two journalists for Al-Mayadeen TV were killed in a drone strike. A month earlier, Israeli shelling in southern Lebanon killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and wounded other journalists from France’s international news agency, Agence France-Presse, and Qatar’s Al-Jazeera TV. Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The Israeli campaign has since expanded to Lebanon, where Israel launched a ground invasion Oct. 1, after trading fire with the Hezbollah militant group for much of the past year. Lebanese health officials reported another day of intense airstrikes and shelling Thursday, which they said killed 19 people over 24 hours and raised the overall Lebanese death toll to 2,593 since October 2023.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-10-25-2024-0920f63542d158ad5999c481e421da00	2024-10-24T19:31:36-07:00

The Amazon River naturally fluctuates during the dry and rainy seasons. But a dramatic drop has been evident since 2023. In Colombia, the river’s fall has isolated some Indigenous communities, prompting nonprofits and the government to deliver water and food to places that depend on rain and river water to survive. Hundreds of people turned out for the burial of Catholic priest Marcelo Pérez, an activist for Indigenous peoples and farm laborers who was killed in the southern Mexico State of Chiapas. The Rev. Pérez had worked to bring peace to the highlands and border regions of Chiapas, where two drug cartels are battling for control.

Georgia prepares for a divisive election which could determine its future in Europe	JAVAKHETI, Georgia (AP) — When Vahan Agayan goes to the polling station in Georgia’s parliamentary election Saturday, he says he and his wife will vote as directed to by officials of the ruling Georgian Dream party. Agayan has a sheep farm near the border with Armenia and Turkey, 135 kilometers (83 miles) west of — and a world away from — the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. There, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in a pre-election demonstration in favor of joining the European Union. But in the mountainous Javakheti region, what Agayan wants most is stability. A few years ago, wolves got into his barn and killed half the sheep, almost destroying the livelihoods of dozens of families. For Agayan, the EU is far away; what matters are the local leaders who have the power to make or break small farmers like him. 'Most people' will vote for the regional lawmaker from Georgian Dream, he said. 'An old dog is always better than a new one,' he said, suggesting a change in power could be unpredictable. Many in this South Caucasus country of 3.7 million people believe the election will be the most important of their lives, a pivotal vote on the chance to join the European Union. It pits a coalition of opposition parties against Georgian Dream, which has governed in an increasingly authoritarian fashion since 2012. Polls indicate around 80% of Georgians favor joining the EU, and the constitution obliges leaders to pursue membership in both the bloc and NATO. In July, Brussels put Georgia’s bid for EU entry on hold indefinitely after Georgian Dream passed a 'foreign influence law,' modeled on similar legislation in Russia. It requires media, nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as 'pursuing the interests of a foreign power' if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. Georgian Dream argues it is needed to curb harmful foreign actors trying to destabilize the country. Many journalists and activists say its true goal is to stigmatize them and restrict debate before the election. ------ This story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an ongoing Associated Press series covering threats to democracy in Europe. ------ Georgia has long had an uneasy relationship with Russia. For most of the last century, it was ruled from Moscow until it gained independence in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2008, Georgia fought and lost a brief war with Russia, which still occupies some of its territory. When Georgian Dream came to power in 2012, it vowed to restore civil rights and 'reset' relations with Moscow. The party — set up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — also promised to pursue EU membership. That reassured many Georgians who had seen 'with their own eyes,' the threat from Russia and looked to the West to protect them, said Natia Seskuria, executive director of the Regional Institute for Security Studies in Tbilisi. But then Georgian Dream started tracking toward Moscow: passing the foreign influence law despite mass protests, abstaining from international sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine, and severely curtailing LGBTQ+ rights. However, the party’s authoritarian swing cannot be explained by influence from Moscow alone, Seskuria said. Instead, she suggested, the purpose of the foreign influence law is also 'power preservation.' She indicated Georgian Dream’s leaders watched the Kremlin use new laws to successfully crack down on critics and decided to do the same. Some businesspeople who support Georgian Dream also have an interest in seeing the party reelected as they have profited from its tenure. At a pro-government rally in Tbilisi Wednesday, family members of people who were awarded plum jobs in railways and infrastructure were spotted in the crowd. Georgian Dream is conducting a 'hybrid war' against its citizens, said Zurab Chiaberashvili, foreign policy secretary from the United National Movement opposition party. Ahead of the election, campaign ads for the ruling party claimed a 'Global War Party' was seeking to influence the EU and the U.S., widen the conflict in Ukraine, and force Georgian Dream from power. Billboards also appeared, contrasting black-and-white images of destruction in Ukraine with colorful images of life in Georgia alongside the slogan, 'Say no to war — choose peace.' 'Everyone is afraid of war,' said Nairik Ukanyan, the owner of a village shop in the Javakheti region, which is populated by ethnic Armenians. Like Ukanyan, many people speak Armenian and Russian but limited Georgian. Ukanyan said he got his news about Georgia from Russian television, which says relations between the two countries are friendly. 'Why do we need a relationship with Europe?' he asked. Agayan, the sheep farmer, agreed: 'Even if I had 20 children, I would not send them to Europe.' The West, he said, is 'afraid of Russia and wants everyone to abandon it.' Georgian Dream appears to keeps a tight grip on power. Its officials paid several villagers about $110 each to persuade others to support the ruling party, Agayan said. But not every resident indicated they would back the party. 'I am a single mother and we are very poor,' said Gayane Batirova, 41. Her entire family previously voted for Georgian Dream, she explained. She had been told to vote for the party again but would not because it hadn’t improved her life. AP visited Georgian Dream’s local headquarters in Javakheti, but no one responded to requests for comment. In the town of Ninotsminda, office signs were displayed in Russian and an official said everyone was out 'on business' and unavailable for an interview. Back in Tbilisi, Georgian Dream lawmaker Maka Bochorishvili said the party's main goal is European integration based on 'peace and dignity,' alluding to the party’s conservative values. 'At stake is peace and stability in this country,' she said. But while Georgian Dream is telling voters it wants to join Europe, its shift toward adopting Russia-style laws has cost it support in the West. As well as the EU freezing membership talks, the U.K. suspended its security dialogue with Georgia and canceled other defense talks, concerned about threats to democracy. These moves are 'good news for Russia,' Seskuria said, because the Kremlin is 'inherently interested' in Georgia being cut off from the West, including the loss of financial support and through sanctions. Many Georgians fear if Georgian Dream is reelected, it could kill off aspirations to EU membership entirely. 'We are at a crossroads — either becoming a Russian puppet state or being independent and free,' said Tina Bezhanidze, 26. Wrapped in the Georgian flag, she was one of tens of thousands who joined a pro-EU demonstration in Tbilisi on Sunday. Bezhanidze, an economist, came to the demonstration with her parents and three younger sisters, in a show of cross-generational support for Georgia’s European ambitions. Even in remote Javakheti, not everyone thought aligning with Russia was a good idea. 'Of course we need the European Union,' said Eghsam Manasyan, who was collecting potatoes in her vegetable patch. She and her husband Artur told AP they wished there were more jobs in the region. 'All our lives we were with Russia and the Soviet Union,' Artur Manasyan said, adding that Georgia needs to 'look everywhere' for opportunities. 'We still don’t really know what Europe is,' he said. ------ Sophiko Megrelidze contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-russia-election-georgian-dream-opposition-7514f5b099c6442c72c43e550e851f10	2024-10-24T19:09:19-07:00	
Lithuania votes in the 2nd round of its parliamentary election, with change uncertain	VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Lithuanians will vote Sunday in the second and final round of parliamentary elections, with the conservative governing party still in contention despite first-round gains for the left-leaning opposition. Strict COVID-19 measures during the pandemic, political scandals involving several key members of the Cabinet and an influx of migrants from neighboring Belarus have hurt the popularity of Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė’s government, which took office in 2020. The vote in Lithuania, which borders Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave to the west and Belarus to the east, comes at a time when Russia’s war in Ukraine is fueling greater fears about Moscow’s intentions, particularly in the strategically important Baltic region. It will set the political tone for the next four years, but despite a possible shift to the left analysts say there won't be significant change Lithuania's foreign policy. The European Union and NATO member is a staunch supporter of Ukraine. On Sunday, voters in dozens of electoral districts will choose between the two leading candidates from the first round and complete the new 141-seat parliament, known as the Seimas. The opposition Social Democrats, led by Vilija Blinkevičiūtė, came out of the first round with an edge two weeks ago, taking 20 of the first 70 seats to be decided. That put them two seats ahead of Šimonytė’s Homeland Union party. Blinkevičiūtė has said that she and the center-left Democratic Union, which took eight seats, would attempt to form a coalition together with a smaller third party. The three parties, which so far have 34 lawmakers in total, have said they would support each other’s candidates in the second round. But the center-left parties could lose their lead, and their ability to form a stable government could depend on a new party that many consider a pariah. The Nemuno Aušra party came in third in the first round, with 15 seats. Its leader Remigijus Žemaitaitis had to resign from parliament earlier this year for making antisemitic statements. A strong showing for Nemuno Aušra could open the way for the prime minister's party to form a minority government. 'Nobody can claim to have an obvious majority after the first round,' said Mažvydas Jastramskis, a political analyst at Vilnius University's institute of international relations and political science. Šimonytė’s Homeland Union won 18 seats in the first round and its coalition member, the Liberal Union, took eight. Both have several dozen candidates leading in run-offs, but they aren't in a position to win the 71 seats needed for a majority. Tensions in Lithuania's neighborhood are on voters' minds as well as domestic concerns. 'I voted for those who would never look east, I do not trust former communists and new populists,' Janina Kvietkauskiene, a retired librarian who cast her ballot in an early voting station in Vilnius, told The Associated Press. Most of the traditional parties said before the elections that they would not team up with Nemuno Aušra. The Social Democrats, for instance, have ruled out any alliance with Žemaitaitis’ party. Still, Nemuno Aušra announced this week that it would support the Social Democrats' Blinkevičiūtė in her bid to become prime minister. Jastramskis said it's unlikely that the three center-left parties will emerge with enough seats to form a stable new government alone. 'The one more likely option for the stable majority is if Nemuno Aušra joins the already announced three-party coalition,' Jastramskis said. 'But it may turn out as a major problem for the cabinet if the unacceptable rhetoric and actions continue'.	https://apnews.com/article/lithuania-parliamentary-election-new-government-95c7689b00bb041c895164ca3b470437	2024-10-24T19:07:37-07:00	
Tropical Storm Dana brings heavy rains and strong wind to India's eastern coast	NEW DELHI (AP) — Tropical Storm Dana brought strong winds and heavy rain to India's eastern coast Friday, uprooting trees and bringing a flood risk after nearly 600,000 people evacuated. The storm made landfall late Thursday night in Odisha state with maximum sustained winds of around 110 kph (68 mph) and gusts up to 120 kph (75 mph), according to the Indian Meteorological Department. Officials told the Press Trust of India news agency the storm would push further into northern Odisha and gradually weaken. The storm pounded some districts in Odisha and neighboring West Bengal state with heavy downpours as gusty winds brought down trees, local media reported. As of early Friday, there were no deaths nor any major damage reported. Nearly 600,000 people were evacuated from high-risk zones in Odisha earlier in the week, and teams of rescue and aid workers were deployed in preparation for the storm. Schools were closed, more than 200 trains were canceled and flights to and from the capital cities of Odisha and West Bengal were suspended. Authorities were on high alert for damage in three districts in Odisha, where the weather department forecast a sea surge of around 1 meter (yard), which could further flood low-lying areas. Climate scientists say severe storms are becoming more frequent in South Asia. Global warming driven by planet-heating gases has caused them to become more extreme and unpredictable. India’s eastern coasts have long been prone to cyclones, but the number of intense storms is increasing along the country’s coast. 2023 was India’s deadliest cyclone season in recent years, killing 523 people and costing an estimated $2.5 billion in damage.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-dana-cyclone-india-odisha-landfall-e5e35684a853b00df953798f715726ff	2024-10-24T18:45:25-07:00	
King Charles tells summit the past can't be changed as leaders ask Britain to reckon with slavery	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — King Charles III told a summit of Commonwealth countries in Samoa on Friday that the past could not be changed as he indirectly acknowledged calls from some of Britain’s former colonies for a reckoning over its role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The British royal understood 'the most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate,' he told leaders in Apia. But Charles stopped short of mentioning financial reparations that some leaders at the event have urged and instead exhorted them to find the 'right language' and an understanding of history 'to guide us towards making the right choices in future where inequality exists.' 'None of us can change the past but we can commit with all our hearts to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right the inequalities that endure,' said Charles, who is attending his first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, or CHOGM, as Britain's head of state. His remarks at the summit's official opening ceremony echoed comments a day earlier by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that the meeting should avoid becoming mired in the past and 'very, very long endless discussions about reparations.' The U.K. leader dismissed calls from Caribbean countries for leaders at the biennial event to explicitly discuss redress for Britain’s role in the slave trade and mention the matter in its final joint statement. But Britain's handling of its involvement in the trans-Atlantic slave trade is seen by many observers as a litmus test for the Commonwealth's adaptation to a modern-day world, as other European nations and some British institutions have started to own up to their role in the trade. 'I think the time has come for this to be taken seriously,' said Jacqueline McKenzie, a partner at London law firm Leigh Day. 'Nobody expects people to pay every single penny for what happened. But I think there needs to be negotiations.' Such a policy would be costly and divisive at home, McKenzie said. The U.K. has never formally apologized for its role in the trade, in which millions of African citizens were kidnapped and transported to plantations in the Caribbean and Americas over several centuries, enriching many individuals and companies. Studies estimate Britain would owe between hundreds of millions and trillions of dollars in compensation to descendants of slaves. The Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis on Thursday said he wanted a 'frank' discussion with Starmer about the matter and would seek mention of the reparations issue in the leaders' final statement at the event. All three candidates to be the next Commonwealth Secretary-General — from Gambia, Ghana and Lesotho — have endorsed policies of reparatory justice for slavery. Starmer said Thursday in remarks to reporters that the matter would not be on the summit’s agenda. But Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland told The Associated Press in an interview that leaders 'will speak about absolutely anything they want to speak about' at an all-day private meeting scheduled for Saturday. King Charles said in Friday's speech that nothing would right inequality 'more decisively than to champion the principle that our Commonwealth is one of genuine opportunity for all.' The monarch urged leaders to 'choose within our Commonwealth family the language of community and respect, and reject the language of division.' He has expressed 'sorrow' over slavery at a CHOGM summit before, in 2022, and last year endorsed a probe into the monarchy’s ties to the industry. Charles — who is battling cancer — and his wife, Queen Camilla, will return to Britain tomorrow after visiting Samoa and Australia — where his presence prompted a lawmaker's protest over his country's colonial legacy. He acknowledged Friday that the Commonwealth had mattered 'a great deal' his late mother Queen Elizabeth II, who was seen as a unifying figure among the body's at times disparate and divergent states. The row over reparations threatened to overshadow a summit that Pacific leaders — and the Commonwealth secretariat — hoped would focus squarely on the ruinous effects of climate change. 'We are well past believing it is a problem for the future since it is already undermining the development we have long fought for,' the king said Friday. 'This year alone we have seen terrifying storms in the Caribbean, devastating flooding in East Africa and catastrophic wildfires in Canada. Lives, livelihood and human rights are at-risk across the Commonwealth.' Charles offered 'every encouragement for action with unequivocal determination to arrest rising temperatures' by cutting emissions, building resilience, and conserving and restoring nature on land and at sea, he said. Samoa is the first Pacific Island nation to host the event, and Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa said in a speech Friday that it was 'a great opportunity for all to experience our lived reality, especially with climate change,' which was 'the greatest threat to the survival and security of our Pacific people.' Two dozen small island nations are among CHOGM's 56 member states, among them the world’s most imperiled by rising seas. Her remarks came as the United Nations released a stark new report warning that the world was on pace for significantly more warming than expected without immediate climate action. The population of the member nations of the 75-year-old Commonwealth organization totals 2.7 billion people.	https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-commonwealth-slavery-reparations-chogm-samoa-6488cbfb9367b81b8453ea6c6dc41cbd	2024-10-24T17:55:14-07:00	
‘US doesn’t see me as an American’: Thousands of adoptees live in limbo without citizenship	HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — The 50-year-old newspaper was turning yellow and its edges fraying, so she had it laminated, not as a memento but as proof — America made a promise to her, and did not keep it. She pointed to the picture in the corner of her as a little girl in the rural Midwest, hugging the family Yorkshire terrier, with dark pigtails and brown eyes so round people called her Buttons. Next to her sit smiling, proud parents — her father an Air Force veteran who had survived a German prison camp in World War II and found her in an orphanage in Iran. She was a skinny, sickly 2-year-old; he and his wife decided in 1972 to take her home and make her their American daughter. They brought her to the United States on a tourist visa, which in the eyes of the government she soon overstayed as a toddler — and that is an offense that cannot be rectified. She is one of thousands of children adopted from abroad by American parents — many of them military service members — who were left without citizenship by loopholes in American law that Congress has been aware of for decades, yet remains unwilling to fix. She is technically living here illegally, and eligible for deportation. 'My dad died thinking, ‘I raised my daughter. I did my part,’ but not knowing it put me on a path of instability and fear,' she said. The Associated Press is using only her childhood nickname, Buttons, because of her legal status. 'Adoption tells you: You’re an American, this is your home. But the United States doesn’t see me as an American.' Every time she turns on the news, she hears former President Donald Trump, in his bid for reelection, promising to round up immigrants living illegally in the U.S. Now she lays awake at night, wondering what it would be like to be sent back to Iran. 'What is a detention camp even like?' she wondered. 'We have a plan, we won’t let that happen,' her friend Joy Alessi, a Korean adoptee, assured her. They have lawyers, media statemetns prepared, phone numbers of sympathetic congressmembers. But they slumped their shoulders — they know it could happen, because it already has. Out of the shadows These two women grew up in military families, and were taught to be grateful to the nation that celebrated saving them. Then one day, as adults, they walked into passport offices and learned the news that would unspool their lives. Their adoption paperwork, signed by judges and stamped by governments, declared they enjoyed all the privileges of being daughters of American families. But that was untrue in one critical respect: Adoption for decades did not automatically make children citizens. They both hid for years, thinking they were the only one who fell through the cracks. Then Trump stormed into politics in 2015 on a promise to rid America of undocumented immigrants. They weren’t citizens, so they couldn’t even vote to try to stop him. Each decided they had nothing left to lose, emerged and found each other. Other adoptees found them, too, and told stories of indignities endured by those not fully American — they can’t get jobs or driver’s licenses or passports, every interaction with the government is terrifying, some panic when there’s a knock on the door. No one knows how many of them there are — estimates range from 15,000 to 75,000. Many were adopted from South Korea, home to the world’s longest and largest adoption program, but they’d also been brought from Ethiopia, Romania, Belize, more than two dozen countries. They started the Adoptee Rights Campaign, and were joined by an unexpected coalition, from the Southern Baptist Convention to liberal immigration advocates, all baffled that the government let this linger. The Adoptee Rights Campaign has heard from people who’d been deported, some still living in hiding, others freshly discovering they’d never been made citizens. There is no government mechanism for alerting them. They find out by accident, when applying for passports or government benefits. One woman learned as a senior citizen, when she was denied the Social Security she’d paid into all her life. Buttons calls herself the group’s 'adoptee wrangler;' she was visiting Alessi in Nevada, sitting at her kitchen table, fielding inquiries and checking in on people. She’s 54 and has never been in trouble; she has a corporate job in health care, owns her own home in California. She was raised a Christian, so fears that deportation to Iran would be 'a death sentence.' Still legislators won’t help. She had hope. She’s lost that now. For a decade, legislation has been introduced over and over, it dies, and nothing happens. So she lugs around the laminated newspaper clipping, stacks of adoption files and court records as proof she’s supposed to be here. 'It’s hard to give hope,' she said, 'when I don’t feel like I have any left.' ‘One piece of paper can ruin your life’ Alessi anointed her friend Buttons 'an honorary Korean.' This problem they have both endured was born there, in Alessi’s motherland, and to her it represents the most glaring example of the neglectful system that brought them here. The international adoption industry grew out of the wreckage of the Korean War in the 1950s. Americans were desperate for babies — the domestic supply of adoptable children had plummeted — and South Korea wanted to rid itself of mouths of feed. Alessi was among this early wave of adoptees, taken from South Korea at 7 months old in 1967. The system focused on shipping children abroad as quickly as possible. Korea’s government, eager to curry favor with the U.S., did everything it could to speed up the process, including relaxing the obligation of agencies to ensure citizenship for adoptees. The adoption industry took the model created in South Korea into poor countries around the world, shipping babies in bulk to American families. South Korea has struggled to track the citizenship of children placed in U.S. homes, and the status of more than 17,550 remains unconfirmed, according to government data AP obtained. The Adoptee Rights Campaign used Korean figures to estimate up to 75,000 adoptees from all over the world could lack citizenship. But groups like the National Council for Adoption put the number somewhere between 15,000 and 18,000. The Korean adoption diaspora has been hit particularly hard — there are simply more of them. At least 11 adoptees have been deported to South Korea since 2002, where they don’t know the language or the culture. An adoptee named Phillip Clay, sent to the U.S. at 8 years old in 1983, was deported. He killed himself by jumping from an apartment building in Seoul in 2017 at 42 years old. Adam Crapser, adopted at 3 years old in 1979, was also deported to South Korea. The married father of two says he was abused and abandoned by two different adoptive families who never filed his citizenship papers. He got into trouble with the law — once for breaking into his adoptive parents’ home to retrieve the Bible that came with him from the orphanage. He sued his Korean adoption agency, Holt Children’s Services, and a court last year ordered the agency to pay him damages for failing to inform his adopters that they should take steps to secure his citizenship. For some adoptees, their status is fixable through the arduous naturalization process — they have to join the line as though they’d just arrived. It takes years, thousands of dollars, wasted days, routine rejections from immigration offices on technicalities, the wrong form, an errant typo. Alessi looked at a picture of herself standing in a high school gymnasium, finally being made an American citizen at 52. 'We welcome you!' she remembers the announcer saying, and the crowd cheered. But her body looks stiff, her mouth pursed. 'You don’t welcome us,' she thought that day in 2019. Her friend, the adoptee called Buttons, was at the ceremony crying, genuinely happy for her friend, but also devastated for herself. Alessi felt a sort of survivor’s guilt. 'You were sitting right there, and I felt so conflicted, so shameful,' Alessi told her. Because for some adoptees, there is no clear solution. The difference between them is what visa their adoptive parents brought them in on, and many chose the fastest route — like a tourist or medical visa — not imagining complications down the road. 'One piece of paper,' Buttons said, 'can ruin your life.' ‘A collective failure’ A quarter-century ago, the U.S. Congress recognized it had left adoptees in this legal limbo. By 2000, nearly 20,000 children were coming to America each year. But the U.S. had wedged foreign adoptions into a system created for domestic ones. State courts give adopted children new birth certificates that list their adoptive parents’ names, purporting to give them all the privileges of biological children. But state courts have no control over immigration. After the expensive, long process of adoption, parents were supposed to naturalize their adopted children, but some never did. Those early decades of adoption were a 'wild west,' said Greg Luce, a lawyer who has represented many non-citizen adoptees; there was no standardized procedure to help adoptive families. 'It’s a combination of adoption agencies that were neglectful, adoptive parents who should have known better, and the U.S. government that had lax oversight and a visa system that could allow this to happen,' Luce said. 'It’s a collective failure on the part of everyone who was involved except the adoptee. They were a child, and they’re the ones left holding the bag.' The U.S. is unique in this: No other nation that has taken in adopted children deprives them of citizenship. In 2000, Congress acknowledged that injustice and passed the Child Citizenship Act, conferring automatic citizenship to adopted children. But it was designed to streamline the process for adoptive parents, not to help adoptees, and so applied only to those younger than 18 when it took effect. Everyone born before the arbitrary date of Feb. 27, 1983, was not included. Hannah Daniel, director of public policy for the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the lobbying arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, said lawmakers often find this situation hard to believe. 'I agree that it feels unbelievable,' she said. 'It’s the most classic example of wanting to bang your head against the wall, because how in the world have we not fixed this?' Adoption has been a rare issue championed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, a way of saving children by making them American. Many churches preach intercountry adoption as a Biblical calling. Daniel is part of a bipartisan coalition lobbying for a decade for a bill that extends citizenship to everyone legally adopted by American parents. The groups insist that families formed by adoption are due the same respect, the same rights, as biological ones, including equal treatment under the criminal justice system. But that argument has been consumed by the country’s hyper-partisan frenzy over immigration. Any bills offering paths to citizenship have stalled out. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, among those skeptical of the legislation, declined an interview. A spokesperson wrote in a statement that he is 'a longtime adoption advocate' but 'believes that any adult seeking U.S. citizenship should have their criminal records taken into consideration.' That is a sentiment that advocates of the bill say undermines the very meaning of adoption. If a foreign adopted sibling and a biological sibling commit a crime together, the biological child would pay their debt to society and move on. The adopted child might face a second, severe punishment: getting sent back to where the U.S. professed to have rescued them from. A bill is before Congress again now. But Daniel isn’t hopeful. 'In this day and age in Congress, if not doing anything is an option,' she said, 'that is the bet I’m going to take.' ‘The American dream’ Laura Lynn Davis called her representatives, her senators. She’s written to celebrities and talk show hosts, thinking surely someone would help. Mike Davis, her husband of 27 years, was adopted by a soldier, a Vietnam veteran stationed in Ethiopia, who met him there as a boy and brought him to the U.S. He was deported to Ethiopia two decades ago, and now lives in a room with a mud floor and running water only once a month and even when the tap works, it isn’t safe to drink. Davis, now 61, remembers his father telling him that everything would be OK because he was an American now. He pledged allegiance to the flag every morning and considered himself a happy military brat, moving around Army bases. 'I was living the American dream,' Davis said. He worked at a pizza shop through high school and when he graduated, he opened his own. In the 1990s, he was charged with possession of a firearm, marijuana and cocaine. He didn’t go to prison; he was sentenced to 120 days in a boot camp program. He found out he’d never been naturalized when he reported to his probation officer. Nothing happened for years. He married Laura Lynn, they had children to raise, and he pushed it to the back of his mind. Then one day in 2003, he closed his pizza shop and went to bed, someone banged on their door at 5 a.m. 'My kids were sleeping,' he said, 'When they woke up, their dad was gone.' He languished in a detention center for over a year, terrified, because he had the same perception of Ethiopia as every American: The State Department advises its citizens to not go there because of unpredictable violence, kidnappings, terrorism. Then officers took him to the airport and put him on a plane, he said. One officer felt sorry for him and gave him $20; Davis promised to pay him back when he returned to the U.S. He sold his wedding ring to pay rent, and that was the darkest moment. His adoptive father grew sicker, and Davis anguished over not being with him in the end. His wife sold their house and moved their family to be with him. But life was hard in Ethiopia: There were people with M16s on the street, they couldn’t work or speak the language. Laura Lynn lost 30 pounds. She and their children went home to Georgia. Mike was their breadwinner, and they struggled without him. They lived in cars and motels, but never blamed him. Laura Lynn kept all his things neatly packed and awaiting his return: clothes, sports memorabilia, his favorite music — on cassette tapes, a reminder of how the world changed since he left. He gets sick a lot as he’s getting older, she said, and can’t access medications in Ethiopia. He has five grandchildren he’s never met. His youngest son, Adam, 26 now, recently moved into his first apartment, and thought how nice it would be to have his father there to see it. Laura Lynn has more hope than she has in a long time, she said, because a group she never expected came to their aid: Koreans. They’ve offered advocacy and legal help. He’s being represented by groups like Asian Americans Advancing Justice and Adoptees for Justice. 'I pray we can make them see that he didn’t ask to come here, he was adopted and brought here. He became a really good man,' she said. 'He has a family who loves him and we’re ready for him to come back home to us.' ‘A spin of the roulette wheel’ Emily Howe, a lawyer in California, carries around a 5-inch binder, which she calls 'the simplified version' of the labyrinthine set of laws that dictate which adoptees have been able to become citizens and which have not. Howe was adopted from South Korea in 1984, barely young enough to be granted citizenship by the 2000 law. By a twist of luck and timing, this could have been her, she said. So she represents many adoptive families for free. 'It shouldn’t be a spin of the roulette wheel,' she said. She now asks every adoptee if they know their citizenship status. It gets complicated quickly; if they ask the government and find out they aren’t citizens, they tip off authorities to them living here illegally. Her clients are panicking about what will happen if Trump wins reelection. 'I’m terrified,' a mother named Debbie cried in Howe’s San Diego office. 'What if he gets back in? I’m hearing him talk about mass deportations.' Debbie and her husband, Paul, adopted two special-needs children from a Romanian orphanage in the 1990s, and they’ve been trying to make them citizens almost ever since. The Associated Press is using only the first names of the parents because they fear endangering their adopted children. The California couple watched a '20/20' television special about the plight of children there — they called them 'unsalvagables,' they didn’t learn to read, there wasn’t enough food. The couple was middle-class, with three biological children. But Debbie couldn’t sleep thinking about those kids, cold and hungry. So they refinanced their house to bring home two, a boy and a girl. 'We thought we had to get these children out of there. Then we’ll deal with what we need to deal with,' Debbie said. The boy was 10, and so small, just 40 pounds, that the school allowed him in kindergarten. The girl was 14 and legally blind, with limited vision in just one eye. They both had physical and cognitive impairments; the doctors believed the boy suffered fetal alcohol poisoning. The family was overwhelmed by their needs. Their new son was curious — in another life, he might have been an engineer, Debbie thinks. But in this one, they had to nail the front door shut because he’d wander out at night. He was fascinated by electricity, and couldn’t be left alone without fear he’d start a fire. Howe assures them they did everything they could. 'We thought we did it the right way, we tried to, I hope we did,' Debbie said. 'Maybe we were naive. Maybe there was something we missed.' They consulted with dozens of lawyers, who all said it couldn’t be fixed — it was a convoluted calculation of the children’s ages, how their birth certificates were written, their visas. They can’t tally how many thousands of dollars they’ve spent. 'It’s dumb, it’s outrageously dumb, it should not be this monstrous task,' Howe said. 'This could be fixed in a month if anyone had the political will to do it.' Their son, 43, doesn’t understand the situation he’s in. But their daughter understands. She’s a Special Olympian, now 46, with a stack of gold medals. She can’t compete in international competitions because she can’t get a passport. 'I want to be a citizen really bad,' their daughter said. 'I want to be here for a long, long time.' They've called their legislators. Debbie wept again and again: 'My adopted children deserve all the privileges of my birth children. They are no different in our eyes. Why are you looking at them differently?' Everyone told them not to worry because they aren’t the type of people on immigration’s radar. Then Trump’s administration terrified them. Debbie lay in bed, thinking her children couldn’t survive a detention camp. She imagined someone barging into their home and snatching them. It made her physically sick. Debbie and Paul are in their late 60s, and feel an urgent need to fix this. 'The clock is ticking,' Debbie said. 'I have zero regrets about adding these two to my family. But this country let them down, absolutely, without a doubt.' ‘It’s time for my country to fight for me' For most of her life, Joy Alessi was a proud patriot, who got teary-eyed when Garth Brooks sang about America. But patriotism is confusing for her now — as it is for many of the adoptees who’ve found themselves in this predicament. Alessi and Buttons hadn’t seen their friend and fellow adoptee, Leah Elmquist, since she became naturalized. 'Do you feel different? Do you feel like a citizen?' Alessi asked her, when they met for dinner at a Korean barbeque. Elmquist had always considered herself 'super-duper American.' She served in the Navy for 10 years; she was in a USAA commercial. That was all before she was actually made an American. She told Alessi she doesn’t feel any differently now. 'I felt like a citizen for the decade I was in the Navy. And I wasn’t one,' she said. Elmquist was adopted from South Korea as an infant in 1983, just six months too old to get citizenship by the 2000 legislation. She grew up in a white family in a Nebraska town with two stop lights. She can cite what her adoption decree declared her parents had done: they 'do hereby bestow upon said minor child equal rights, privileges and immunities with children born in lawful wedlock.' That was not true, but she only learned that later. 'That’s why I joined the military. I felt so lucky to be an American, ironically. I wanted to thank this country for raising me,' she said. 'I didn’t think about citizenship because I felt I was being more American than most Americans.' She excelled in the military, but wasn’t eligible for certain security clearances. She's wanted to serve as a linguist, but couldn't. After leaving, she laid low, terrified of deportation. When Trump won election in 2016, she felt a fear more intense than the night before she deployed to Iraq. Alessi pulled up a photo of Elmquist in 2019, standing behind a podium marked with the seal of the U.S. House of Representatives. Elmquist was wearing her military uniform, and Alessi recalled that the room went quiet, all you could hear was the 'click click click' of cameras. Elmquist remembered what she’d said: 'I fought for my country, now it’s time for my country to fight for me.' It didn’t. That session, the bill didn’t pass. Elmquist was rejected multiple times by immigration. Finally, she made it to an interview, and had to prove she could read and write English. Her interviewer was a veteran, like her, and said it seemed weird she was there. 'Tell me about it,' she remembers responding. She was naturalized in 2022, the day before her 40th birthday. She likes to look back at her picture on the front page of the local newspaper. 'I can see how happy I was,' she says. 'I almost cried.' 'I can imagine,' Buttons responded. She smiled, and wiped away a tear, imagining that one day maybe she’d feel that too. ___ AP researcher Rhonda Shafner contributed to this report. ___ This story is part of an ongoing investigation led by The Associated Press in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS).

Japan's ruling party may struggle in Sunday's vote, but its decades of dominance won't end	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ’s ruling party, dogged by corruption scandals and plunging support, faces its toughest challenge in more than a decade in Sunday’s parliamentary election. This could set up a very short-lived time in office for Ishiba, who only took power earlier this month. But even if he may have to take responsibility and step down as head of the party and prime minister, it won't cause his Liberal Democratic Party to fall from power. That's because the party, which has had a stranglehold on power since 1955, easily dominates a fractured, weak opposition, which has only ruled twice, and briefly, during that time. Analysts expect the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan to significantly gain ground, but not enough to change the government. 'I plan to vote, but the opposition won’t be my choice,' said Kanako Ojima, 48. 'I don’t think I want to let the opposition take the helm again. ... I think after all it is the LDP that has a long-term vision.' The LDP has built its juggernaut of support through a network of bureaucrats, businesses and regional leaders. While opposition parties have made inroads in cities, the LDP controls the countryside, funneling huge government subsidies to rural areas. Ishiba ordered Sunday's election on the day he took office, on Oct. 1, aiming to use his image as a reformer to shake off voter anger and shore up power. Analysts say the LDP is likely to lose a few dozen seats and may fail to reach the target Ishiba set for his ruling coalition. Even in a worst-case scenario, however, the LDP will still be the No. 1 party in the ruling bloc. Here's a look at how the LDP has dominated postwar Japanese politics and what virtual single-party rule means for Japan. The 1955 system The LDP was formed in 1955 by the merger of two major conservative parties: the Liberal Party and the Japan Democratic Party, just as leftwing groups formed the Socialist Party. They led Japan after the war, when conservatives in the U.S.-occupied country were looking to deter the spread of communism. The party's rule was only interrupted twice, from 1993-1994 and 2009-2012, both times following bribery scandals. Many credit the LDP with leading Japan's astonishing recovery after the war, when the nation became one of the world’s biggest economies through the 1980s. People became used to the LDP dominating the smaller and the main opposition Socialist Party, whose initial ambition to take power faded and was known as the perennial opposition. The LDP and the Socialists were part of a 1994-1998 trilateral ruling coalition until the LDP returned to a one-party reign. The Socialist Party has since renamed itself as the Social Democratic Party. Electoral reform The LDP’s loss to the short-lived eight-party coalition led by the Japan New Party after two high-profile bribery scandals led to political changes that set up a new electoral system that was supposed to promote two-party competition and eliminate pork barreling. The current electoral system combines single-seat districts with proportional representation. That means Liberal Democratic candidates only face opposition rivals, rather than competing against fellow party candidates. It has allowed the LDP to concentrate its political resources on one candidate per district. In traditional LDP strongholds, it has also helped powerful families to take control of electoral districts, funding and connections, with power usually passing to men. Women make up only 10% of the lower house. The LDP has set a goal to increase female candidates to 30% over the next decade. Factions LDP lawmakers are loosely connected by their support of conservative social values, strong defense policies and a desire to revise the U.S.-drafted war-renouncing constitution. Rather than ideological differences, LDP lawmakers until recently were divided among in-party factions competing for funding and connections that they need to keep winning elections and get favorable party and government posts. Factional power struggles have led to frequent changes of party leadership and a succession of short-lived prime ministers. Those government changes are meant to regenerate the party, according to Tomoaki Iwai, a Nihon University politics professor. This is what happened when Ishiba replaced his unpopular predecessor, Fumio Kishida, who resigned in the face of voter anger over a slush fund scandal. Kishida took leadership in the dissolution of most of the LDP factions and revised a political funding law, but voters and critics called the measures too lax. All but one of six factions no longer have formal structures, but party heavyweights like Kishida and their former faction members were part of a collective effort in backing Ishiba in the party leadership vote. Allies and opposition Support for the LDP is strong among older conservatives, especially in rural areas, but it is weaker in urban areas. That means the LDP relies on an alliance with the Komeito party, which is backed by a Buddhist group called Soka Gakkai that has several million members nationwide. The parties' partnership began in 1999 during a period of LDP struggles. The LDP also receives support from industry organizations, fisheries, agricultural cooperatives and religious groups. The main opposition is the liberal-leaning Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, but the party has struggled to build momentum despite the LDP scandals. Its newly elected leader, centrist former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, is pushing a conservative shift for the party to attract swing voters, saying that 'a change of government is the most effective political reform.' Media analysts expect his CDPJ to significantly gain ground in Sunday's elections, but not enough to change the government. That's because the opposition groups are too fractured. The defunct Democratic Party of Japan, which Noda once led, toppled the LDP in 2009, but lasted only three years, struggling through the 2011 triple disaster of a massive earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown in Fukushima. The DPJ’s inexperience and shaky handling of the crises disappointed the public and paved the way for the LDP’s big comeback in 2012. Since then the LDP has not faced serious challenges. LDP dominance is expected to last Unlike 2009, there is little voter interest in getting rid of the LDP. Taizo Yoshida, a 45-year-old office worker, said he doesn't want a change of government and hopes to see Ishiba push through reform. 'I don’t think the opposition has the ability to run the government,' he said, though he'd like to see a viable opposition in Japan. 'This party has more of a track record of getting things done,' Rintaro Nishimura, a political analyst at the Asia Group, a strategy and business advisory organization, said of the LDP. With younger people increasingly unhappy about the lack of LDP policies addressing their worries, there may be future changes, but not any time soon. 'There is still too much of uncertainty over what the opposition can do.'	https://apnews.com/article/japan-politics-ldp-election-ishiba-6698ca8ca03a4586929554c22427bfc6	2024-10-24T16:12:32-07:00	
Ship owner in Baltimore bridge collapse agrees to pay $102 million for cleanup	WASHINGTON (AP) — The owner and manager of the cargo ship that caused the deadly Baltimore bridge collapse have agreed to pay more than $102 million in cleanup costs to settle a lawsuit brought by the Justice Department, officials said Thursday. The settlement does not cover any damages for rebuilding the bridge, officials said in a news release announcing the agreement. That construction project could cost close to $2 billion. The state of Maryland has filed its own claim seeking those damages, among others. The settlement comes a month after the Justice Department sued the ship’s owner Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and manager Synergy Marine Group, both based in Singapore, seeking to recover funds from the cleanup. The Justice Department alleged that the electrical and mechanical systems on the ship, the Dali, were improperly maintained, causing it to lose power and veer off course before striking a support column on the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. The ship was leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka when its steering failed because of the power loss. Six men on a road crew, who were filling potholes during an overnight shift, fell to their deaths. Cleanup crews worked around the clock searching for bodies and removing thousands of tons of mangled steel and smashed concrete from the bottom of the Patapsco River. The Dali remained stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with collapsed steel trusses draped across the ship’s damaged bow. 'This resolution ensures that the costs of the federal government’s cleanup efforts in the Fort McHenry Channel are borne by Grace Ocean and Synergy and not the American taxpayer,' Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said in a statement. The collapse snarled commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore and put many local longshoremen out of work before the channel was fully opened in June. It interrupted East Coast shipping routes as the port is one of the busiest in the country, especially for cars and farm equipment. Grace Ocean and Synergy filed a court petition just days after the collapse seeking to limit their legal liability in what could become the most expensive marine casualty case in history. Court records show attorneys for both parties said in a joint filing Thursday that they had reached a settlement agreement and requested dismissal of the Justice Department’s claim, which sought $103 million in cleanup costs. The claim is one of many filed in an expansive liability case that will ultimately determine how much the ship’s owner and manager will owe for their role in causing the disaster. The other claims are still unresolved. They’ve been filed on behalf of the victims’ families, companies whose business has suffered as a result of the collapse, municipal entities and more. FBI agents boarded the ship in April amid a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading up to the collapse. When it was filed last month, the Justice Department civil claim provided the most detailed account yet of the cascading series of failures that left the Dali’s pilots and crew helpless in the face of looming disaster. The complaint pointed to 'excessive vibrations' on the ship that attorneys called a 'well-known cause of transformer and electrical failure.' Instead of dealing with the source of the excessive vibrations, crew members 'jury-rigged' the ship, the complaint alleged. It also noted cracked equipment in the engine room and pieces of cargo shaken loose. The ship’s electrical equipment was in such bad condition that an independent agency stopped further electrical testing because of safety concerns, according to the lawsuit.	https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-bridge-collapse-justice-department-4a3f064e4cfb433d4d142881decaaae0	2024-10-24T12:23:00-07:00	
Nevada lithium mine wins final approval despite potential harm to endangered wildflower	RENO, Nev. (AP) — For the first time under President Joe Biden, a federal permit for a new lithium-boron mine has been approved for a Nevada project essential to his clean energy agenda, despite conservationists' vows to sue over the plan they insist will drive an endangered wildflower to extinction. Ioneer Ltd.'s mine will help expedite production of a key mineral in the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles at the center of Biden's push to cut greenhouse gas emissions, administration officials said Thursday in Reno. Acting Deputy Interior Secretary Laura Daniel-Davis said bolstering domestic lithium supplies is 'essential to advancing the clean energy transition and powering the economy of the future.' 'This project demonstrates how partnership and collaboration can effectively balance mineral production with the protection of vulnerable species and irreplaceable natural resources,' added Steve Feldgus, principal deputy assistant U.S. interior secretary for land and minerals management. In the works for nearly eight years, construction of the Rhyolite Ridge mine should start next year in the high desert halfway between Reno and Las Vegas, the Australia-based Ioneer said. Production is scheduled to begin in 2028 at the mine, which should produce enough lithium for 370,000 vehicles annually for more than two decades, officials said. It’s unique because it includes a chemical processing facility that will process the lithium on-site instead of having to ship it to China, then back to the U.S. Worldwide demand for lithium is projected to have grown six times by 2030 compared to 2020. The biggest producer of lithium in the world is China, which processes most lithium currently. 'I can say with absolute confidence there are few deposits in the world as impactful as Rhyolite Ridge,' Ioneer Executive Chairman James Calaway said. The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued the permit after the Fish and Wildlife Service concluded — in consultation with the bureau required under the Endangered Species Act — that the mine would not jeopardize the survival of Tiehm's buckwheat. The service added the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with yellow and cream-colored blooms to the list of U.S. endangered species on Dec. 14, 2022, citing mining as the biggest threat to its survival. The bureau initiated the mine's permitting process five days later. The agencies say Ioneer's subsequent changes to the mine's footprint alleviated concerns about potential harm to the flower. Environmentalists said the mine's final approval was a politically motivated violation of multiple U.S. laws. An hour after the bureau posted its formal record of decision approving the permit, the Center for Biological Diversity sent Interior Secretary Deb Haaland a 60-day notice of the group's intent to sue under the Endangered Species Act. 'We need lithium for the energy transition, but it can’t come with a price tag of extinction,' said Patrick Donnelly, the center's Great Basin director. He said Biden's administration ' is abandoning its duty to protect endangered species like Tiehm’s buckwheat and it’s making a mockery of the Endangered Species Act.' Fewer than 30,000 of the plants remain in Nevada at the only place they're known to exist in the world across eight sub-populations that combined cover 10 acres (4 hectares) — an area equal to the size of about eight football fields. USFWS said the project — including the infrastructure and waste rock dump — will come within 15 feet (5 meters) of the buckwheat and result in the loss of some of its designated critical habitat that is home to neighboring bees and other pollinators integral to its reproduction. But the service said the operation will cause no direct disturbance to individual plants and that reclamation, mitigation and monitoring promised in the blueprint should provide necessary protections for it to coexist with the open pit mine deeper than the length of a football field. 'I don’t think the mine at all will lead to the extinction of Tiehm’s buckwheat,' Ioneer CEO Bernard Rowe said Thursday. 'If anything, I think we now are going to be part of the solution because we are going to continue providing significant resources ... to ensure it doesn’t become extinct.' Construction of the mine is expected to employ about 500 workers, with about 350 full-time employees when the mine is fully operational — a boon for tiny Esmeralda County with a population of about 1,000. Esmeralda County Commissioner Ralph Keys said the rural county that's now the least populous in Nevada was its most populated during the gold and silver boom in the late 1800s. 'This is going to put us back on the map,' he said Thursday. Opponents of the project say it’s the latest example of Biden’s administration running roughshod over U.S. protections for native wildlife, rare species and sacred tribal lands in the name of slowing climate change by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and bolstering national security by easing reliance on foreign sources of critical minerals. Daniel-Davis denied environmentalists’ claims that the administration is rushing to develop so-called 'green energy' projects at the expense of increased risk to troubled species. 'The urgency of climate change and the need to move to a clean energy economy has been critical to everything we have worked on since day one in the Biden-Harris administration,' she said. 'Does that make us look at projects like this or others that would support transition to a clean energy economy differently? I have to say categorically, no.' Nevada is home to the only existing lithium mine in the U.S. Another is currently under construction near the Oregon line 220 miles (354 kilometers) north of Reno — Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass mine.	https://apnews.com/article/lithium-mine-endangered-flower-nevada-biden-ioneer-a943364661c24a928d590eb17b00a92b	2024-10-24T08:46:17-07:00	
A car bomb explodes outside a police station in western Mexico, wounding 3 officers	ACAMBARO, Mexico (AP) — A car bomb left outside a police station in the town of Acambaro in western Mexico wounded three people, prosecutors in the violence-wracked state of Guanajuato said Thursday. They said another explosion, apparently a second car bomb, occurred in the nearby town of Jerecuaro. Although nobody was wounded, the force of that second blast was enough to blow the tile roof off a building, blacken the facades of surrounding stores and set alight a police patrol pickup truck. The near-simultaneous attacks in two different towns located about a half-hour away from each other suggested the involvement of drug cartels that have been fighting bloody turf battles for years in Guanajuato. Despite the violence, newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum pledged to continue the 'hugs, not bullets' approach of her predecessor. Sheinbaum said Thursday she has ordered the army 'not to have confrontations' with the cartels. 'We are not going to return to a war against the narcos,' Sheinbaum said. But it takes two to tango, and her administration already appears to be locked in a war-like situation with the cartels in several states, whether she likes it or not, just three weeks after she took office. The car bomb in Acambaro was sizable enough to toss parts of the burnt-out car across a tree-lined median strip in the street outside the police station, according to photos distributed by the municipal police. The powerful blast apparently blew out the windows and doors of nearby homes. It was the most serious car-bomb attack against authorities in Mexico since June 2023, when a cartel used a car bomb to kill a National Guard officer in the nearby city of Celaya. In July 2023, a drug cartel in the neighboring state of Jalisco set off a coordinated series of seven roadway bombs that killed four police officers and two civilians. The improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, had apparently been planted in holes dug in the roadway. The use of car bombs, improvised explosive devices and bomb-dropping drones illustrate the increasingly open, military-style challenge posed by the country’s drug cartels. Sheinbaum has pledged to continue the policy of her predecessor and mentor, former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, of avoiding confrontations with drug cartels. Before he left office on Sept. 30, López Obrador publicly appealed to the gangs to keep violence down, and offered training programs aimed at reducing the number of young recruits for the cartels. The policy did not result in any significant reduction in Mexico’s historically high levels of homicides. Sheinbaum faces a big surge in violence simultaneously in the northern state of Sinaloa, the southern state of Chiapas, and in Guanajuato, the state that has had the highest number of homicides in Mexico. Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, has said she will make reducing violence in Guanajuato a priority, and said the attacks Thursday were being investigated. But David Saucedo, a security analyst based in Guanajuato, said the government has failed to recognize the scope of the problem. Sheinbaum and other officials almost always respond to the violence with stock phrases like 'investigations are being carried out' or 'the problem is being addressed.' 'In the federal and state governments, there is a resistance to talking about narco terrorism, because they think it will create a bad image for the country,' Saucedo said. 'The truth is that Mexico already has a bad image regarding crime and violence.' The problem is becoming more acute for the Mexican government, as drug cartels and violence in Mexico have become an issue in the upcoming U.S. presidential election. 'There are voices within the government who think that talking about narco terrorism would add fuel to conservative sectors in the United States who want to send the U.S. army to fight the cartels,' he said. Saucedo said the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel — which has spent years fighting the Jalisco cartel for control of the state — is probably behind Thursday’s blasts. 'Although these attacks in Acambaro and Jerecuaro are part of a local (cartel) strategy, they are also intended as a message from the criminal gangs to the president and the governor, that they will continue in the battle and will continue fighting for Guanajuato,' he noted. The attacks appeared to specifically target police offices or vehicles. Officials are loath to acknowledge the war-like situation in some Mexican cities, because they can offer few solutions: their own policies have weakened local police forces and the government now relies almost exclusively on the military. That has brought predictable accusations of human rights abuses by soldiers. Mexican army troops shot to death six migrants from at least four countries in the southern state of Chiapas on Oct. 1, the same day Sheinbaum took office. Guanajuato state Gov. Libia Garcia said Thursday on social media that she had ordered a land and air search for the suspects, and wrote 'our municipal governments are not alone, the entire force of the government is involved in the work to restore peace to Guanajuato.' But only days before, officials fired the entire municipal force in the nearby city of Celaya, the city where more police have died fighting organized crime than any other in the nation. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-drugs-war-car-bomb-guanajato-sheinbaum-2af81dc58b803db44c167cdf14e0f7fb	2024-10-24T08:00:47-07:00	
Canada will reduce immigration targets as Trudeau acknowledges his policy failed	TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday that Canada will significantly reduce the number of new immigrants it allows into the country after acknowledging that his government failed to get the balance right coming out of the pandemic. Trudeau's Liberal government was criticized for its plan to allow 500,000 new permanent residents into the country in each of the next two years. On Thursday, he said next year’s target will now be 395,000 new permanent residents and that the figure will drop to 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027. 'In the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic, between addressing labor needs and maintaining population growth, we didn't get the balance right,' Trudeau said. 'Immigration is essential for Canada's future, but it must be controlled and it must be sustainable.' Trudeau, who is facing calls from within his own party not to seek a fourth term, has endured mounting criticism over his immigration policies and the negative impact that population growth has had on housing affordability. He said his government will reduce the number of immigrants Canada brings in over the next three years, and that this will freeze population growth over the next two years. Canada reached 41 million people in April. The population was 37.5 million in 2019. 'Even Justin Trudeau wants to close Canada’s Borders,' Donald Trump wrote Thursday on social media while arguing for tougher border measures in the U.S. Trudeau said Canada needs to stabilize its population growth to allow all levels of government to make necessary changes to health care, housing and social services so that it can accommodate more people in the future. Trudeau also blamed others. 'Far too many corporations have chosen to abuse our temporary measures, exploiting foreign workers while refusing to hire Canadians for a fair wage,' Trudeau said. 'All while under the watch of provinces, some colleges and universities are bringing in more international students than communities can accommodate, treating them as an expendable means to line their own pockets. That’s unacceptable, and it needs to change.' Immigration Minister Marc Miller said the lower immigration numbers will help with the country's housing shortage. He also acknowledged the change in public opinion about immigration. 'That volume that we have put forward is of concern,' Miller said. Miller said the government sees the pressures facing Canadians, and that it must adapt its policies accordingly. 'We are an open country, but not everyone can come to this country,' he said, noting that Canada will continue to welcome outsiders and that the government's immigration targets remain ambitious. Trudeau's government has long touted Canada's immigration policy and how Canada is better than peer countries in welcoming newcomers and integrating them into the economy. Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, accused Trudeau of destroying the national consensus on immigration. 'He has destroyed our immigration system through his own personal incompetence and destroyed 150 years of common sense consensus with the Liberals and Conservatives on that subject,' Poilievre said. 'He cannot fix what he broke on immigration and housing or anything else because he is busy fighting his own caucus,' he added. Poilievre was referring to calls by some lawmakers from Trudeau's own party to not run for a fourth term. Those calls represent one of the biggest tests of Trudeau's political career, but he said Thursday that he intends to stay on through the next election. Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Toronto, said the Trudeau government messed up badly on immigration. 'The government’s logic — to grow the economy and sustain an aging Canadian population by bringing in more young immigrants — was sound. But Ottawa has little control over meeting the housing, health, education, and other welfare needs of residents, whether they are citizens or immigrants,' Wiseman said. 'These are all provincial government responsibilities, and there was little cooperation or coordination between the two levels of government,' he said. A certain percentage of Canadians have always been xenophobic, but much less so than in some other countries, Wiseman said. 'Many Canadians have turned against the recent growing immigrant and temporary worker/student influx because of the growing housing, health, education, and other welfare challenges. Ottawa has read the polls and is responding accordingly,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-immigration-reduction-trudeau-dabd4a6248929285f90a5e95aeb06763	2024-10-24T07:53:19-07:00	
Canada's Trudeau vows to lead his Liberal Party into the next election	TORONTO (AP) — Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday that he will lead his Liberal Party into the next election, dismissing a request by some party members to not run for a fourth term. Trudeau met with his Liberal members of Parliament for three hours Wednesday, where he learned that more than 20 lawmakers from his party signed a letter asking him to step down before the next election. He said there were 'robust conversations' ongoing about the best way forward, but 'that will happen with me as leader going into the next election.' No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms. Trudeau's Cabinet ministers have said he has the support of the vast majority of the 153 Liberal Party members of the House of Commons. Sean Casey, one of the Liberal lawmakers who signed the letter asking Trudeau to step down, said he was disappointed Trudeau didn't take the time to reflect but said he now considers the matter done and he's moving on. Casey said Trudeau listened but he wasn't swayed. 'This was a decision he had every right to make and he made it,' Casey told reporters. 'I did my job in voicing what I was hearing from constituents and now I have to direct my energy to winning my seat and not internal party matters. As far as I'm concerned it is closed.' Casey said he wouldn’t call it delusional but said Trudeau 'is seeing something I don’t see, that my constituents don’t see.' The Liberals trail the Conservatives by 38% to 25% in the latest Nanos poll. The poll of 1,037 respondents has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. The Liberals recently suffered upsets in special elections for seats representing two districts in Toronto and Montreal that the party has held for years, raising doubts about Trudeau’s leadership. The federal election could come anytime between this fall and next October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament, as they don’t hold an outright majority themselves. The leader of the opposition Bloc Québécois has said his party will work with the Conservatives and the New Democratic Party, of NDP, to bring down the Liberals and force an election if the government doesn’t boost pensions. Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, said pressure is building on Trudeau but that some of his unhappy lawmakers don't have much power to force him out. 'Trudeau holds all the cards. It is up to him if he wants to stay. The Liberal Party revised its rules in 2016 so that the party leader is immune to any challenge to his leadership so long as he is prime minister,' said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015 when he reasserted the country’s liberal identity after almost 10 years of Conservative Party rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the rising cost of living and other issues like immigration increases following the country's emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-election-a4c5859fa028aefdcffd0e74ddc9fffa	2024-10-24T07:18:00-07:00	
Google's partnership with AI startup Anthropic faces a UK competition investigation	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s competition watchdog said Thursday it's opening a formal investigation into Google’s partnership with artificial intelligence startup Anthropic. The Competition and Markets Authority said it has 'sufficient information' to launch an initial probe after it sought input earlier this year on whether the deal would stifle competition. The CMA has until Dec. 19 to decide whether to approve the deal or escalate its investigation. 'Google is committed to building the most open and innovative AI ecosystem in the world,' the company said. 'Anthropic is free to use multiple cloud providers and does, and we don’t demand exclusive tech rights.' San Francisco-based Anthropic was founded in 2021 by siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, who previously worked at ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The company focused heavily on increasing the safety and reliability of AI models. Google reportedly agreed last year to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic. The U.K. regulator has been scrutinizing a raft of AI deals as investment money floods into the industry to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. Last month it cleared Anthropic's $4 billion deal with Amazon and it has also signed off on Microsoft's deals with two other AI startups, Inflection and Mistral.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-google-anthropic-competition-artificial-intelligence-ai-262eb88fb1db92eae68b6b2f158229a9	2024-10-24T06:23:10-07:00	
Britain's leaders likely to face slavery reparations questions at a summit of former colonies	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Britain's leaders will likely face uncomfortable questions about reparations for the trans-Atlantic slave trade at a summit of nations it once colonized, after Caribbean leaders said they would thrust the matter into the spotlight at the event in Samoa. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had said that compensation for slavery wasn't on the agenda at this week's biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, or CHOGM, in the Samoan capital, Apia. But the issue threatens to boil over anyway, presaging an uneasy summit for Starmer and Britain’s King Charles III, who is battling cancer but is also attending. The Commonwealth group of 56 nations has 'taken on issues other people have always run away from' before, the organization’s Secretary-General Patricia Scotland told The Associated Press on Thursday when asked if financial reparations would feature in talks. She didn't confirm BBC reports that a draft text of the statement to be issued by leaders after meetings on Friday and Saturday includes an acknowledgement of calls for 'reparatory justice' over the slave trade. The text of the statement could change before its release, and British officials reportedly vetoed a plan for a separate declaration on reparations, the BBC said. Caribbean and African leaders have led the push to address the reparations issue. The summit should involve 'a ‘come to Jesus’ moment where we truly look at one another in the eye and say, ‘look, this is what happened,'' Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis told Politico on Thursday. Davis confirmed that he is among the leaders who want their final joint communique to mention reparations and who hope to have a 'frank' discussion of the matter with Starmer. A handful of nations have apologized for their role in slavery, including the Netherlands. The U.K. has never formally apologized for its role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which enriched many individuals and companies. Britain outlawed the slave trade in 1807 but did not legislate to emancipate slaves in its territories until 1833. A growing list of British institutions, including the Church of England, have begun to own up to their historic involvement in slavery. The British government had said reparations would not be on the Commonwealth summit agenda, though it acknowledged Thursday that the issue might be mentioned in the final communique. Starmer said he wanted the summit to focus on the future, not the past, telling reporters as he arrived in Samoa that Commonwealth members had divulged to him they were 'facing real challenges on things like climate in the here and now.' He said he would rather focus on those matters than 'what will end up being very, very long endless discussions about reparations on the past.' 'The Commonwealth countries are looking forward to talking about things which concern them and they’re interested in,' said Scotland, the secretary-general. 'So this is Keir’s first CHOGM, and I know they’re going to love him.' Starmer isn't the only one who might have preferred to keep the matter off the agenda. The presence of King Charles could prompt uneasy questions — as it did in Australia — about the role of the British crown in the histories and aspirations of its former territories. Charles and his eldest son, Prince William, have expressed their sorrow over slavery, but they haven’t acknowledged the crown’s connections to the trade, although the king last year endorsed a probe into the monarchy’s ties to the industry. Studies and analysts have estimated the total that Britain could owe the descendants of millions of people whose slave labor funded the nation for centuries to be in the hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. At the this week's gathering, political leaders will head on a retreat for hours of free-ranging discussions. Other matters are high on the agenda, too. Leaders are expected agree on a commitment to establishing permanent ocean boundaries, and Davis, of the Bahamas, said poor countries will also seek reparations for increasing extreme weather events from polluters such as Britain. 'The most important thing to know is that the Commonwealth heads will speak about absolutely anything they want to speak about when they go on the retreat,' Scotland said. Jacqueline McKenzie, a partner at London law firm Leigh Day who is working on the reparations issue, said its inclusion on the CHOGM leaders’ communique would be 'hugely significant.' 'I think the time has come for this to be taken seriously. I’m not surprised at the response of the British government … because I think reparations is going to be hugely divisive in the U.K.,' she said. 'Nobody expects people to pay every single penny for what happened. But I think there needs to be negotiations,' said McKenzie. 'It has to be on the agenda.' Starmer, she added, was 'going to have to face it.' The 75-year-old Commonwealth has a collective population of 2.7 billion people and a disparate range of member states — including some that don't have historical ties to Britain. Observers will be assessing whether Charles can unify their purpose as his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, once did. 'The Commonwealth, I think he knows, was one of the most important things that his mother did,' said Anna Whitelock, professor of history of the monarchy at City, University of London. 'Not only keeping this Commonwealth of countries together, but actually retaining a sort of spirit of community and cooperation and relevance in a world where there’s so many other power blocs and challenges.' ___ Lawless reported from London.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-commonwealth-summit-slavery-reparations-be23cf856970878f82a2a7237ccf3b62	2024-10-24T06:22:40-07:00	
Gangs in Haiti open fire and hit a UN helicopter midair as violence surges	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Gangs on Thursday opened fire and hit a U.N. helicopter, forcing it to land in Port-au-Prince in the latest attack in Haiti's capital as violence surges once again. No one was injured as several rounds of gunfire hit the helicopter that was carrying three crew members and 15 passengers, according to a U.N. source who was not authorized to confirm the incident. The helicopter, which had departed from Port-au-Prince before it was attacked, landed safely, the source said. The attack comes five months after Haiti's main international airport reopened following coordinated gang attacks that forced it to close for nearly three months. The violence has spilled to nearby areas including Arcahaie, where some 50 suspected gang members died this week after attacking the coastal town located just northwest of the capital. Among the dead are at least a dozen gunmen who drowned after their boat capsized, a government official said Thursday. While the majority were killed by police, a group of gunmen drowned on Wednesday after their boat hit the reef as they ferried ammunition to gangs attacking the town of Arcahaie, said Wilner Réné from Haiti’s Civil Protection Agency. He told Radio Caraïbes that the attack began on Monday, with gunmen burning homes and cars across Arcahaie. When the gangs ran out of ammunition, they hid in nearby areas and were ferreted out by residents and police, he said. The attack is still ongoing, and Réné warned that officers on the scene urgently need reinforcements from soldiers and special police units. The attack is blamed on a gang coalition called Viv Ansanm, which also has targeted communities in Port-au-Prince in recent days. Those attacks have displaced more than 10,000 people in the capital in just one week, according to a report released Thursday by the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. More than half of those left homeless crowded into 14 makeshift shelters, including schools. The remainder are temporarily staying with relatives. The spike in gang violence comes just months after a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police began with the aim of quelling a surge in violence from gangs, who control more than 80% of Port-au-Prince. More than 700,000 people have been left homeless, and thousands have been killed. The U.S. government and top Haitian officials have warned that the Kenyan-led mission lacks personnel and funding and have asked that it be replaced with a U.N.-peacekeeping mission. ___ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-violence-boat-ammunition-viv-ansamn-c6f18eca38ec60a727b8d33308d8e1ef	2024-10-24T06:21:12-07:00	
Mozambique's ruling party candidate declared winner of presidential election as rigging claims swirl	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Mozambique's ruling party candidate Daniel Chapo was declared the winner of the country's presidential election Thursday as the opposition claimed the vote was rigged and one party said it would challenge the result in court. According to the national election commission, Chapo won with 70,67% of the national vote, followed by independent candidate Venancio Mondlane with 20,32% of the vote. The candidate of the opposition party Renamo, Ossufo Momade, came third with 5,81% of the total votes. The results of the Oct. 9 election mean the governing Front for the Liberation of Mozambique party, or Frelimo, has extended its 49 years in power since the southern African country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. It then fought a bloody 15-year civil war against rebel group Renamo, which later became the main opposition party and also contested this election. Speaking shortly after the results were announced, Chapo told supporters he condemned the recent killings of two opposition figures. He also criticized the strikes called by the opposition to protest what it claimed was systematic deceit. Police quelled the demonstrations this week, dispersing them by firing teargas. 'As the Frelimo party, we want to once again reiterate our repudiation of the murders of Elvino Dias and Paulo Guambe as well as other citizens physically affected in this ongoing process of demonstrations,' said Chapo. Dias, a lawyer and advisor to opposition presidential candidate Mondlane, was killed when gunmen riddled his car with bullets in the port capital of Maputo last Friday. Guambe, the party spokesperson, was also in the car and was killed. Chapo promised to 'try to do better for the Mozambican people,' regardless of race, religion or political affiliation. Lutero Simango of the opposition Mozambique Democratic Movement, who got just over 3% of the vote, on Thursday disputed the election outcome and said his party would challenge the results in court. 'We from the MDM will be on the side of the people, of electoral justice, and will combat all manipulations, which is why we will combine legal and political action so that the results reflect the will of the voters,' he said. Despite the confirmation of the results by the election commission, the Constitutional Council will have the final say after it considers any appeals filed by the opposition. Chapo will face immediate challenges including an extremist organization affiliated to the Islamic State group that has launched attacks on communities in the northern province of Cabo Delgado since 2017. It has carried out several beheadings. Around 600,000 of the 1.3 million people who fled the province since 2017 have since returned home, many to shattered communities where houses, markets, churches, schools and health facilities have been destroyed, the United Nations said earlier this year. Mozambique also faces high levels of unemployment and hunger, exacerbated by El Nino-induced severe drought. According to the U.N. World Food Program, 1.3 million people face severe food shortages. Frelimo has often been accused of rigging elections, which it has consistently denied. Current President Filipe Nyusi of Frelimo is stepping down after serving the maximum two terms allowed. The EU’s observer mission said this week that some of its election observers had been prevented from monitoring counting in some areas and there was an 'unjustified alteration' of results at some polling stations. Independent political analyst Onisio Buanaissa said it was in the best interest of the country for the opposition to accept the election results as announced by the electoral commission. 'You may not be satisfied with the result, but you need to respect that it is the majority. This is the very logic of liberal democracies,' he said. ___ Follow AP’s Africa coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-results-daniel-chapo-rigging-c92d818ecdbe6e4ba22256bfad9eecd1	2024-10-24T05:46:30-07:00	
A lawmaker from the far-right Freedom Party is elected as speaker of Austria's parliament	VIENNA (AP) — A lawmaker from the far-right Freedom Party was elected Thursday as the new speaker of Austria's parliament, weeks after the party won a national election for the first time. Walter Rosenkranz becomes the first member of the Freedom Party to be elected as speaker, one of the country's highest-ranking positions in protocol terms. It has traditionally been taken by the strongest party. Rosenkranz, a lawyer and former leader of his party's parliamentary group who most recently served as a member of the Austrian Ombudsman Board, won the support of 100 of the 183 lawmakers in the new parliament's inaugural session. No other party fielded a candidate but dozens of votes went to other lawmakers. While a majority of lawmakers stuck to tradition in making the 62-year-old Rosenkranz speaker, the Freedom Party isn't likely to be part of the next government. On Tuesday, President Alexander Van der Bellen dispensed with a tradition of giving the first-placed party's leader the task of forming a new administration after the Sept. 29 parliamentary election produced a stalemate. Instead, he asked incumbent Chancellor Karl Nehammer to do so. Whoever leads the next government will need to build a coalition to have a parliamentary majority. But Nehammer’s conservative Austrian People’s Party has said it wouldn’t work with the Freedom Party under its leader, Herbert Kickl. The other three parties in the new parliament said they wouldn’t work with the Freedom Party at all. And Kickl said the Freedom Party would only go into government with him as chancellor. Nehammer says he will try to form a three-party coalition with the center-left Social Democrats and one of two smaller parties, the liberal Neos or the environmentalist Greens. Rosenkranz was the Freedom Party's candidate in the 2022 presidential election, finishing a distant second behind Van der Bellen.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-far-right-parliament-speaker-rosenkranz-ab1d84ab7f022fe226b006e0479027e0	2024-10-24T05:22:38-07:00	
EU Commission chief urges North Macedonia's political parties to cooperate on accession push	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen praised North Macedonia’s reform efforts Thursday, but stressed the need for progress on constitutional changes if the country was to make progress with its bid to join the EU. North Macedonia's dispute with neighbor and EU member Bulgaria has delayed its EU accession process. The previous center-left government agreed to add a reference to a Bulgarian ethnic minority in the constitution to break the impasse, but lacked the parliamentary majority to enact the change. Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski’s new conservative government maintains it will only amend the constitution if Bulgaria first approves North Macedonia’s EU membership without additional conditions. 'We are almost there, but we know it's about the constitutional change that your country has committed to,' von der Leyen told a joint conference with Mickoski in Skopje, while on a six-nation tour of the region. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and fears of broader instability in Europe have added urgency to EU accession bids by Balkan countries seeking entry. The EU started membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania in 2022, and the bloc recently pushed ahead with Albania’s accession process independently, departing from the previous approach of moving both countries forward together. Von der Leyen urged cross-party support in North Macedonia for the constitutional amendment. Her regional tour continues with visits to Bosnia Herzegovina, Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro as the EU seeks to reassure Western Balkan nations of their membership prospects.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-north-macedonia-balkans-accession-skopje-mickoski-cac7185cc5640ff89f567d4d5973857c	2024-10-24T05:12:34-07:00	
World on pace for significantly more warming without immediate climate action, report warns	The world is on a path to get 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 Fahrenheit) warmer than it is now, but could trim half a degree of that projected future heating if countries do everything they promise to fight climate change, a United Nations report said Thursday. But it still won't be near enough to curb warming's worst impacts such as nastier heat waves, wildfires, storms and droughts, the report said. Under every scenario but the 'most optimistic' with the biggest cuts in fossil fuels burning, the chance of curbing warming so it stays within the internationally agreed-upon limit 'would be virtually zero,' the United Nations Environment Programme's annual Emissions Gap Report said. The goal, set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, is to limit human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. The report said that since the mid-1800s, the world has already heated up by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit), up from previous estimates of 1.1 or 1.2 degrees because it includes the record heat last year. Instead the world is on pace to hit 3.1 degrees Celsius (5.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. But if nations somehow do all of what they promised in targets they submitted to the United Nations that warming could be limited to 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the report said. In that super-stringent cuts scenario where nations have zero net carbon emissions after mid-century, there's a 23% chance of keeping warming at or below the 1.5 degrees goal. It's far more likely that even that optimistic scenario will keep warming to 1.9 degrees above pre-industrial times, the report said. 'The main message is that action right now and right here before 2030 is critical if we want to lower the temperature,' said report main editor Anne Olhoff, an economist and chief climate advisor to the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre. 'It is now or never really if we want to keep 1.5 alive.' Without swift and dramatic emission cuts 'on a scale and pace never seen before,' UNEP Director Inger Andersen said 'the 1.5 degree C goal will soon be dead and (the less stringent Paris goal of) well below 2 degrees C will take its place in the intensive care unit.' Olhoff said Earth's on a trajectory to slam the door on 1.5 sometime in 2029. 'Winning slowly is the same as losing when it comes to climate change,' said author Neil Grant of Climate Analytics. 'And so I think we are at risk of a lost decade.' One of the problems is that even though nations pledged climate action in their targets submitted as part of the Paris Agreement, there's a big gap between what they said they will do and what they are doing based on their existing policies, report authors said. The world's 20 richest countries — which are responsible for 77% of the carbon pollution in the air — are falling short of their stated emission-cutting goals, with only 11 meeting their individual targets, the report said. Emission cuts strong enough to limit warming to the 1.5 degree goal are more than technically and economically possible, the report found. They just aren't being proposed or done. The report 'shows that yet again governments are sleepwalking towards climate chaos,' said climate scientist Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, who wasn't part of the report. Another outside scientist, Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said the report confirms his worst concerns: 'We are not making progress and are now following a 3.1 degree path, which is, with next to zero uncertainty, a path to disaster.' Both the 3.1 degree and 2.6 degree calculations are a tenth of a degree Celsius warmer than last year’s version of the UN report, which experts said is within the margin of uncertainty. Mostly the problem is 'there's one year less time to cut emissions and avoid climate catastrophe,' said MIT's John Sterman, who models different warming scenarios based on emissions and countries policies. 'Catastrophe is a strong word and I don't use it lightly,' he said, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report saying 3 degrees of warming would trigger severe and irreversible damage. The report focuses on what's called an emissions gap. It calculates a budget of how many billions of tons of greenhouse gases — mostly carbon dioxide and methane — the world can spew and stay under 1.5 degrees, 1.8 degrees and 2 degrees of warming since pre-industrial times. It then figures how much annual emissions have to be slashed by 2030 to keep at those levels. To keep at or below 1.5 degrees, the world must slash emissions by 42%, and to keep at or below 2 degrees, the cut has to be 28%, the report, named, 'No more hot air... please !' said. In 2023, the world spewed 57.1 billion metric tons (62.9 billion U.S. tons) of greenhouse gases, the report said. That’s 1,810 metric tons (1,995 U.S. tons) of heat-trapping gases a second. 'There is a direct link between increasing emissions and increasingly frequent and intense climate disasters,' United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a video messaged released with the report. 'We're playing with fire, but there can be no more playing for time. We're out of time.' __ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ______ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

IMF chief warns that world risks falling into slow-growth rut and urges China to enact reforms	WASHINGTON (AP) — The world economy, buffeted by conflict and growing geopolitical rivalries, is in danger of getting stuck in a slow-growth, high-debt rut, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned Thursday. She also urged Chinese leaders to take more decisive action to jump-start their country's sluggish economy or risk seeing economic growth plummet. 'These are anxious times,’’ the fund’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, told reporters during the fall meetings of the IMF and its sister agency, the World Bank. The IMF forecasts that the global economy will expand this year at what Georgieva called an 'anemic'' 3.2%. Global trade is lackluster at a time of conflict and growing geopolitical tension — including frosty relations the world's two largest economies, the United States and China. 'Trade is no more a powerful engine of growth,'' she said. 'We live in a more fragmented global economy.' At the same time, many countries are struggling with debts they took on to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The IMF expects government debts worldwide to to top $100 trillion this year. That would equal to 93% of global economic output — a share that is expected to approach 100% by 2030. 'The global economy is in danger of getting stuck on a low growth, high debt path,'' Georgieva said. 'That means lower income and fewer jobs.'' Still, the economic backdrop isn't entirely bleak. The IMF says the world has made considerable progress to rein in inflation that surged in 2021 and 2022 as economies roared back with unexpected strength from pandemic lockdowns. She credited higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve and other central banks and the easing of backlogs at factories, ports and freight yards that had caused shortages, delays and higher prices. In wealthy countries, the fund expects inflation to drop next year to the 2% sought by central banks. And price pressures have eased without sending the world into a recession. 'For most of the world, a soft landing is in sight,’’ Georgieva said. But many people are still struggling with high prices and economic uncertainty. World leaders are telling her that their economies are relatively healthy — but ordinary 'people are not feeling good about their economic prospects.’’ The IMF, a 190-nation lending organization, works to promote economic growth and financial stability and reduce global poverty. In its latest World Economic Outlook report, issued Tuesday, the fund forecast that the once high-flying Chinese economy would grow just 4.8% this year and 4.5% in 2025, down from 5.2% in 2023. Georgieva urged the Chinese government to shift away from dependence on exports and toward more reliance on spending by consumers, which she called a 'more reliable'' engine of growth. Taking 'decisive action'' to reverse a collapse in the Chinese property market, she said, would boost consumers' confidence and willingness to spend. 'If China doesn’t move, potential growth can slow down to way below 4%,'' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/imf-world-economy-debt-inflation-32b7b5fe50176a680a380835e7113723	2024-10-24T04:51:05-07:00	
The Latest: Harris and Trump focus on closing messages with rallies in Georgia, Nevada, Arizona	Former President Donald Trump will be holding rallies in Tempe, Arizona, and Las Vegas on Thursday. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris will be holding a rally Thursday night in the Atlanta suburbs with former President Barack Obama and musician Bruce Springsteen. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: President Biden will meet with labor leaders in Pittsburgh on Saturday to help shore up their critical support for Harris in Pennsylvania Biden will meet with local leadership of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, and he’ll be joined by President Brent Booker. Biden, who has said he’s the most pro-union president in history, walked the picket line with the United Auto Workers and his administration worked most recently to prevent the dock workers strike. Biden has been calling local union workers in the critical battleground state to push for continued mobilization on behalf of his vice president, the Democratic nominee. Beyoncé, whose ‘Freedom’ is Harris’ campaign anthem, is expected at the Democrat’s Texas rally on Friday Beyoncé is expected to appear Friday in her hometown of Houston at a rally for Vice President Kamala Harris, according to three people familiar with the matter. Harris’ presidential campaign has taken on Beyonce’s 2016 track 'Freedom' as its anthem, and the singer’s planned appearance brings a high level of star power to what’s become a key theme of the Democratic nominee’s bid: freedom. Harris headed to the reliably Republican state just 10 days before Election Day in an effort to refocus her campaign against former President Donald Trump on reproductive care. The three people weren’t authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Harris campaign did not immediately comment. ▶ Read more about Beyoncé at Harris’ rally With two women running, the New Hampshire governor’s race is both close and personal One of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races has also become intensely personal. None of the nation’s 12 female governors are up for reelection, but five women are running as major party gubernatorial nominees in four states. Two of them are in New Hampshire, where Republican Kelly Ayotte and Democrat Joyce Craig are competing to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican who’s not seeking a fifth two-year term. While voters and the candidates themselves say their gender is a nonissue in a state with a history of electing women to top offices, it has influenced their approaches to the topic of abortion and reproductive health care. Both candidates have produced television ads in which they describe having miscarriages after medical appointments during which no fetal heartbeats were detected. ▶ Read more about the New Hampshire governor’s race Trump claims he is ‘maybe more conservative than any human being that’s ever lived’ The comment during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt came after Hewitt gave the Republican former president a chance to claim the moderate mantle in the closing days of the 2024 campaign, an opening Trump swiftly closed. 'You’re not a particularly conservative. You’re not as conservative as Ronald Reagan. And you’ve tried to make that point. You’re kind of a moderate Republican, aren’t you?' Hewitt asked. 'I’m very, very conservative,' Trump said. 'Maybe more conservative than any human being that’s ever lived.' One of the primary criticisms of Trump when he entered political life in 2015, especially from conservative Republicans, was that he wasn’t a true conservative. Trump had been a registered Democrat during portions of his business career in New York and received considerable coverage at the outset of his successful 2016 campaign for being a moderate Republican, something his primary opponents like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio used against him. Trump says he watched Harris’ Wednesday night town hall on CNN Speaking during a Thursday morning interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump called the vice president’s performance 'an embarrassment.' 'I watched her charade story last night on CNN,' Trump said during the friendly interview. 'It was an embarrassment that she was running for president, representing a major party.' The town hall with CNN was meant to replace a second debate between Trump and Harris. After one debate with Harris, the former president declined to participate in another debate and did not accept CNN’s invitation for a town hall. Harris used the forum to lambast Trump before an audience of undecided voters in Pennsylvania. She agreed — twice — that Trump was a fascist, echoing the criticism of Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, and said if Trump is elected again, he would be 'a president who admires dictators and is a fascist.' Trump returned to the town hall later in the interview, saying Harris was 'like a child almost.' The RNC is rebuilding its legal operation after Trump allies’ failed effort to undo the 2020 race The last time Donald Trump ran for president, the lawyers most directly involved in his efforts to overturn the election wound up sanctioned, criminally prosecuted or even sued for millions of dollars. This time around, Republican party leaders are working to present a more organized, skilled legal operation even as Trump continues to deny he lost the 2020 election and sows doubt about the integrity of the upcoming one. 'It has been very important to make sure that in every aspect, we are going to have a fully professional operation,' RNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press. As Republicans and Democrats fight in court over election rules, the Trump team finds itself under a particularly intense microscope given the aftermath of the 2020 race when meritless legal efforts challenging the results were repeatedly rejected by judges appointed by presidents of both political parties. ▶ Read more about the Republican legal operation Republican former Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid His endorsement on Thursday marks another cross-party backing for the Democratic presidential nominee, who’s campaigned this week with Liz Cheney, the GOP former Wyoming congresswoman. Both Upton and Cheney were among the House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Upton, who represented West Michigan and served in Congress for 36 years, said in a statement that Trump is 'unfit to serve as commander in chief again.' Upton said he has already cast his ballot for Harris. 'Time and time again respected senior national Republicans have urged our former president to focus on governing rather than personal attacks, mistruths, and continued false 2020 election claims,' said Upton. 'Instead of heeding that advice, we see unhinged behavior not acceptable in most forums almost daily.'	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-election-2024-93ab2993b8d713375eefb6fd32440d7f	2024-10-24T04:46:08-07:00	
In Colombia, Amazon River's extreme drought falls hard on Indigenous communities	LETICIA, Colombia (AP) — Marciano Flores stood knee-deep in the Amazon River with the rest of his crew, ready to haul in a giant net as a man in a canoe circled in an attempt to drive fish their way. At 69, after a life of working the river, Flores can tell at a glance just the right spots to seek a catch he can sell at the market. But standing here a year ago would have been impossible, with the river far above his head. Flores has never seen the Amazon so low, and the men’s net came up empty before they relocated downriver and caught a few small fish. A declining catch is forcing him and his fellow fishermen to search farther and farther down the river each day, and costing him more in fuel too. 'The drought has hit me hard,' said Flores, of the Cocama Indigenous community. 'When the water's low, the fish die, so there's nothing to get.' The Amazon River naturally fluctuates during the dry and rainy seasons. But since last year a dramatic drop has been evident, most critical in Brazil. Now the phenomenon is spreading into other Amazon nations, wreaking havoc on local economies and food supplies. In Colombia, the river's fall has isolated some rural Indigenous communities, prompting nonprofits and the government to deliver water and food to places that depend on rain and river water to survive. In some communities, it's an arduous hourlong walk along the dried-up areas to get basic supplies. In other areas, schoolchildren have to walk two hours to get to their classes as boats are unable to drop them close by. Water levels decreased between 80% and 90% in the past few months, Colombia’s National Unit for Disaster Risk Management said last month. 'I've been very concerned, particularly for the Indigenous communities that are affected the most because all the food has already run out,' said Álvaro Sarmiento, head of operations for the Colombian Civil Defense in the Amazonas province at Leticia's port. 'For Indigenous people, fishing is their main source of food.' __ EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part of a series on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change. ___ Large patches of sandy areas can be seen where the river has receded. Evidence of how dramatically the water has fallen can be seen along banks where the earth has cracked under the heat, with large parts collapsing into what's left of the river. In some areas, white marks high on tree trunks show where the water used to be. 'In the 35 years I’ve been in the Amazon, it's the first time I’ve seen it this low,' said Jugalvis Valencia, 61, a boat tour guide. He worries that a repeat drought next year will dry up some parts of the river completely. 'If we have a similar summer next year, it’s possible that (the river) will get cut off and we’ll be stuck in Leticia,' he said. Communities in need of resources, water In a community called La Playa on the outskirts of Leticia, Ermencida Miranda runs a small store out of her wooden home propped on stilts, selling things like cleaning supplies and Peruvian, Colombian and Brazilian foods in this area where the three countries come together. And Miranda worries about access to water. 'In all the communities ... we are suffering because of the water, because it's not raining, the drought is really severe,' said Miranda, 48, who came from Putumayo eight years ago in search of better economic opportunities. 'We bathe in the river water, but for cooking and drinking we have to wait for rainwater and when there's none, we have to buy water from Leticia. Imagine that!' said Miranda, of the Tikuna people. Some 32 kilometers (about 20 miles) down the river is the Indigenous reserve of Santa Sofia, a community of about 2,400 made up of five different Indigenous groups, where locals waited in the shade of mango trees for the arrival of supplies from a nonprofit organization. Last year, the river came right up to the mango trees, but now the water is so low it takes a five-minute walk down a dry, cracked mud path. The nonprofit delivered food supplies like lentils, rice and cooking oil, as well as three large cisterns that can be used to catch and store rainwater. Locals shouldered the heavy white bags of supplies to carry them back to their homes, and men teamed up to move the bulky cisterns. 'It's been hard for us to get food, and to take our crops for sale to Leticia because of the drought,' said Santa Sofia resident Elder Kawache, 47. Access to drinking water has been the most difficult part of the drought for the community since the local well also dried up, Kawache, from the Cocama community, said. Colombia's environment ministry didn't respond to a request for comment on the drought. The National Unit for Disaster Risk Management said this month it will deliver motorized pumps and hoses for water supply to isolated territories and that a contract for the exploration of underground water sources will be initiated. It has said it is sending humanitarian assistance kits with drinking water and nonperishable food for the communities. Peru announced a state of emergency and said it would deliver medicines and chlorinated water to communities near the river. Brazilian authorities have been distributing potable water and water purification systems and the government says it will make advance payments to those eligible for monthly welfare payments for poor families in affected areas. The river has risen slightly in some places in recent days, but after back-to-back and increasingly severe droughts, locals worry about next year. At her homemade store, Miranda has seen no evidence of help from the government. She'd love to see an elevated tank filled with water so people don't have to 'suffer so much in carrying water' during the summer. 'If someone could help us to get water, it would be a happiness and a change to life, wouldn’t it? Because water is very important for us.' — Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan — The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Train carrying at least 50 people derails on Norway's north coast, killing at least 1 person	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — At least one person was killed and four people injured when a train running along Norway’s northern coast derailed Thursday with at least 50 people on board, Norwegian media reported. Initial reports suggested that people with minor injuries were found at the scene. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Train operator SJ said 90 tickets for the train had been sold but it could not immediately say how many people were on board. Police spokesman Kenneth Lauritsen told the newspaper Dagbladet that one person had died in the derailment. Five or six people were injured. Police earlier had told Norwegian news agency NTB that people with minor injuries were found at the scene. They were alerted to the derailment at 1238 GMT. Police told NTB that a rock slide likely caused the derailment. The VG newspaper carried a photo of a huge rock on the track that had smashed into a train carriage. The Arctic Circle Express was on its way from Trondheim to the northern town of Bodoe. NTB, citing the Joint Rescue Coordination Center for northern Norway, said there were 'between 50 and 70 people on board the train.' 'We think all the passengers are out. But we are doublechecking the train as we do not have a passenger list,' police spokesman Bent Are Eilertsen told Norwegian broadcaster TV 2. One of the passengers, Ingvart Strand Mølster, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that 'a rock has hit the train.' Strand Mølster said no one in his train carriage was hurt, with the exception of one person who suffered a minor ankle injury. Another passenger told the local newspaper Avisa Nordland that people were evacuated out through the windows. NRK posted a video of the train which had left its mountainside tracks, crashing through trees and down onto the road, which was closed to traffic in the wake of the derailment. Photos on Norwegian media showed the locomotive and what appeared to be at least two passenger cars. The derailment happened near Bodoe, just north of the Arctic Circle.	https://apnews.com/article/norway-train-derails-bodoe-arctic-express-rescue-69eb40aaabbe0d658c6b8083144a6355	2024-10-24T04:14:26-07:00	
Israeli strike on Gaza shelter kills 17 as Blinken says cease-fire talks will resume	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on a school where displaced people were sheltering in the central Gaza Strip killed at least 17 people on Thursday, nearly all women and children, Palestinian medical officials said. The strike came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel had accomplished its objective of 'effectively dismantling' Hamas, and that negotiations over a cease-fire and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages would resume in the coming days. Another 42 people were wounded in the strike in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Among the dead were 13 children under the age of 18 and three women, according to the hospital's records. The Israeli military said it targeted Hamas militants inside the school, without providing evidence. Israel has carried out several strikes on schools-turned-shelters in recent months, saying it precisely targets militants hiding out among civilians. The strikes often kill women and children. Blinken, speaking to reporters in Qatar, which has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, said negotiators would reconvene 'in the coming days.' 'What we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,' he said on his 11th visit to the region since the start of the war, The United States hopes to renew the negotiations after Israeli forces killed top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza last week, but neither side has shown any sign of moderating its demands from months of negotiations that sputtered to a halt over the summer. Blinken also announced an additional $135 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinians, while again urging Israel to allow more assistance to enter the territory. Health workers in besieged northern Gaza meanwhile warned of a catastrophic situation there, where Israel has been waging an air and ground offensive for more than two weeks. Hospital director in northern Gaza says supplies are running out Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have fled their homes in northern Gaza in recent days. The military says it is battling Hamas fighters who regrouped in the north, which was one of the first targets of the ground offensive at the start of the war. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiyeh, the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in the north, said in a video message released Wednesday that some 150 wounded people were being treated there, including 14 children in intensive care or the neonatal department. 'There is a very large number of wounded people, and we lose at least one person every hour because of the lack of medical supplies and medical staff,' he said. 'Our ambulances can’t transfer wounded people,' he said. 'Those who can arrive by themselves to the hospital receive care, but those who don’t just die in the streets.' Footage shared with The Associated Press shows medical staff tending to premature babies and several older children in hospital beds, some with severe burns. One child is seen attached to a breathing machine, with bandages on her face and flies hovering over her. 'We are providing the bare minimum to patients. Everyone is paying the price of what is happening now in northern Gaza,' Abu Safiyeh said. Kamal Adwan is one of three hospitals in the north left largely inaccessible because of the fighting. The war has gutted the health system across Gaza, with only 16 of 39 hospitals even partially functioning, according to the World Health Organization. First responders halt operations after saying Israel fired on them The Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government, said they had suspended operations in the north. They said Israeli forces fired on one of their teams in the town of Beit Lahiya after ordering them to relocate to the Indonesian Hospital, where troops are stationed. Three Civil Defense members were wounded in the strike, and a firetruck was destroyed, it said. It said another five of its personnel were detained by Israeli forces at the hospital. 'As a result, we declare that Civil Defense operations in the northern Gaza Strip have been completely halted, leaving these areas without any firefighting, rescue, or emergency medical services,' it said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the allegations. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The war has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people are crammed into tent camps along the coast after entire neighborhoods in many areas were pounded to rubble. Months of cease-fire negotiations brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar sputtered to a halt over the summer. The war has meanwhile expanded to Lebanon, where Israel launched a ground invasion more than three weeks ago after trading fire with the Hezbollah militant group for much of the past year. ___ Amiri reported from Doha, Qatar, and Khaled reported from Cairo.

Pope Francis denounces a world 'losing its heart' in 4th encyclical of his papacy	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis issued the fourth encyclical of his papacy on Thursday, denouncing a world that 'is losing its heart' during times of global turmoil marked by 'wars, socio-economic disparities and the uses of technology that threaten our humanity.' The document titled 'Dilexit Nos,' Latin for 'He Loves Us,' was issued to coincide with the 350th anniversary of St. Margaret Mary Alocoque's first apparition, which helped spread devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus revealing his love of humanity. The social encyclical appeals to the faithful to 'meditate' on Jesus’ love in a world in which consumerism and algorithms obscure humanity. It is his fourth encyclical, the best-known of which to date is the 2015 'Laudato Si,' or 'Praised Be,' which cast care for the environment in moral terms. In 'Dilexit Nos,' the pontiff did not cite specific examples of global turmoil in the 220-paragraph document issued in eight languages, although he frequently refers to conflicts from Ukraine to Gaza in homilies, weekly prayers and global travels. Francis often asks for prayers for the 'martyred' people of Ukraine and most recently cited 'inhumane attacks' in Gaza. In the Middle East conflict, he has tended to take a balanced line, often mentioning Israel and the hostages still held by Hamas alongside the suffering of the Palestinians. In the document, the pontiff said the failure to 'feel that something is intolerable' in the suffering on both sides of conflict 'is a sign of a world that has grown heartless.' 'When we witness the outbreak of new wars, with the complicity, tolerance or indifference of other countries, or petty power struggles over partisan interests, we may be tempted to conclude that our world is losing its heart,’’ he wrote. The pope warned that consumer-driven societies 'dominated by the hectic pace and bombarded by technology,' risked interfering with the possibility of engaging with an 'interior life.' He noted that algorithms have revealed that 'our thoughts and will are much more ‘uniform’ than we had previously thought. They are easily predictable and thus capable of being manipulated.' In an era of artificial intelligence, 'we cannot forget that poetry and love are necessary to save our humanity,’’ he wrote. Vatican encyclicals are the most authoritative form of papal teaching and traditionally take their titles from the first two words of the document. Mons. Bruno Forte, a theologian who is archbishop of the Italian diocese of Chiet-Vasto, said the 'Dilexit Nos' encyclical 'can be truly considered as a summary of everything that Pope Francis has said and wishes to say to our brothers in humanity. He says, ‘God loves you and has shown you in the best way, through Jesus.’' Forte said the document should not be viewed as 'just a spiritual refuge,' but as a proposal of 'love, mutual reception and forgiveness.'	https://apnews.com/article/pope-encyclical-global-conflicts-consumerism-algorithms-love-c9099f3cd0e69b793b4d53eda47c4123	2024-10-24T01:06:09-07:00	
Putin presides over BRICS summit seeking to expand Russia's clout	KAZAN, Russia (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday presided at the closing session of a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, praising its role as a counterbalance to what he called the West's 'perverse methods.' The three-day summit in the city of Kazan covered the deepening of financial cooperation, including the development of alternatives to Western-dominated payment systems, efforts to settle regional conflicts and expansion of the BRICS group of nations. The alliance that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa when it was founded in 2009 has expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and several other countries have expressed interest in joining. The summit was attended by leaders or representatives of 36 countries, highlighting the failure of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine. The Kremlin touted the summit as 'the largest foreign policy event ever held' by Russia. Speaking at what was dubbed the 'BRICS Plus' session, which included countries that are considering joining the bloc, Putin accused the West of trying to stem the growing power of the Global South with 'illegal unilateral sanctions, blatant protectionism, manipulation of currency and stock markets, and relentless foreign influence ostensibly promoting democracy, human rights, and the climate change agenda.' 'Such perverse methods and approaches -– to put it bluntly -– lead to the emergence of new conflicts and the aggravation of old disagreements,' Putin said. 'One example of this is Ukraine, which is being used to create critical threats to Russia’s security, while ignoring our vital interests, our just concerns, and the infringement of the rights of Russian-speaking people.' Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. In a joint declaration Wednesday, participants voiced concern about 'the disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions' and reiterated their commitment to enhancing financial cooperation within BRICS. They noted the benefits of 'faster, low-cost, more efficient, transparent, safe and inclusive cross-border payment instruments built upon the principle of minimizing trade barriers and non-discriminatory access.' China's President Xi Jinping has emphasized the bloc’s role in ensuring global security. Xi noted that China and Brazil have put forward a peace plan for Ukraine and sought to rally broader international support for it. Ukraine has rejected the proposal. 'We should promote the de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible and pave the way for a political settlement,' Xi said Thursday. Putin and Xi had announced a 'no-limits' partnership weeks before Russia sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. They already met twice earlier this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July. Russia’s cooperation with India also has flourished as New Delhi sees Moscow as a time-tested partner since the Cold War despite Russia’s close ties with India’s rival, China. While Western allies want New Delhi to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the fighting in Ukraine, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. Putin, who held a series of bilateral meetings on the summit's sidelines, was set to meet Thursday with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who is making his first visit to Russia in more than two years. Guterres’s trip to Kazan drew an angry reaction from Kyiv. Addressing the BRICS Plus session, Guterres urged an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan. 'We need peace in Ukraine, a just peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions,' he said. Russia's Kremlin-controlled media touted the summit as a massive policy coup that left the West fearing the loss of its global clout. State TV shows and news bulletins underscored that BRICS countries account for about half the world's population comprising the 'global majority' and challenging Western 'hegemony.' TV hosts elaborately quoted Western media reports saying that the summit highlighted the failure to isolate Moscow. 'The West, the U.S., Washington, Brussels, London ended up isolating themselves,' said Yevgeny Popov, host of a popular political talk show on state channel Rossiya 1.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-brics-summit-china-india-31a4a4af22e9475aee322f2045701fc6	2024-10-24T00:21:59-07:00	
Well-known Cambodian investigative journalist released on bail	TA KHMAU, Cambodia (AP) — A Cambodian investigative reporter who was charged with a criminal offense after exposing online scams and corruption was released on bail Thursday. Mech Dara told reporters from a car outside the Kandal Provincial Prison complex, south of the capital Phnom Penh, that he had a small health problem. He looked tired and deathly pale as he spoke, saying 'I thank you every one for helping me, supporting me.' The freelance journalist was released at his lawyer's request in the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. Mech Dara told reporters that he still would need to fight the case in court in the future. He put his hands together in a salute and said he had not decided what to do next and refused to answer questions about whether he would resume working as an investigative journalist. On Wednesday, a government-allied media outlet, Fresh News, showed a video in which Mech Dara, wearing an orange prison uniform, apologized to Prime Minister Hun Manet and former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is now president of the Senate. In a minutelong clip, Dara admitted he posted five incidents of false information in the past that were harmful to Cambodia and its leaders and he promised not to post false information in the future. The charge against Mech Dara, incitement to commit a felony or cause social disorder, carries a potential penalty of six months to two years in prison. His arrest on Sept. 30 had been condemned by journalists who worked with him as well as by international press freedom and rights groups. About four dozen Cambodian media organizations and civil society groups issued a joint statement calling for his immediate release and to 'stop all forms of harassment against media organizations and journalists.' The U.S. State Department also said it was 'deeply troubled' by his arrest. It noted he had been honored with its Trafficking in Persons Report Hero award last year for his work.	https://apnews.com/article/cambodia-investigative-journalist-mech-dara-press-freedom-8f831d5bbfea20a0fdb7a7cfa4ac78e4	2024-10-23T23:23:27-07:00	
Seoul vows response as North Korean troops head to Ukraine	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's president said Thursday his government 'won’t sit idle' as North Korea allegedly sends troops to support Russia’s war on Ukraine, as he met with the leader of Poland to discuss expanding defense cooperation amid the ongoing conflict. The meeting between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Polish President Andrzej Duda came a day after U.S. and South Korean officials said they believe around 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations. South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers that North Korea likely aims to send a total of 10,000 troops to Russia by the end of the year. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the presence of North Korean troops. 'We agreed that North Korea’s troop deployment to Russia, which is in direct violation of the U.N. charter and U.N. Security Council resolutions, is a provocation that threatens global security,' Yoon said after the summit. Yoon said South Korea will work with allies and partners to prepare countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Yoon’s office said earlier this week that South Korea is considering various diplomatic, economic and military options, including supplying Ukraine with both defensive and offensive weapons systems. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has provided humanitarian aid and other non-lethal support to Ukraine and supported U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. But Seoul hasn’t directly provided Ukraine with arms, citing a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened since 2022 after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate the growth of his nuclear weapons and missile program. Seoul also worries as experts say the North may seek major technology transfers in return for sending troops, including Russian know-how on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarines that would advance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear arsenal. During their summit, Yoon and Duda agreed to 'actively support' additional deliveries of South Korean military equipment to Poland, including a new deal for Korean K-2 tanks the governments hope to finalize within this year, Yoon’s office said. Poland has signed a series of arms deals with South Korea in the last two years to acquire tanks, howitzers and missile launchers in an effort to bolster its military capabilities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-poland-yoon-duda-north-korea-russia-troop-deployment-2435e6ab2b795edf5b7dd233b93b69dd	2024-10-23T22:58:51-07:00	
Climate-threatened Pacific Islands criticize Australia at Commonwealth meeting	APIA, Samoa (AP) — Several Pacific island nations singled out Australia to do more to phase out fossil fuel exports during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which opened in Samoa on Thursday. Tuvalu’s Prime Minister, Feleti Teo, alongside senior officials from Vanuatu and Fiji, backed a new report from the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, which highlights the significant role Australia, Canada and the U.K. play in global emissions. The report said that fossil fuels extracted in the three nations were responsible for 60% of emissions generated by such extraction across Commonwealth countries since 1990, even though they represent only 6% of the Commonwealth’s population. The report’s findings also point to a 'stark imbalance in fossil fuel extraction' and criticize the contradictions between the climate pledges made by these countries and their ongoing efforts to expand fossil fuel production, especially in Australia and Canada. Pacific leaders have long warned that continued fossil fuel reliance threatens the very existence of their nations, many of which consist of low-lying islands that could be partly or wholly submerged by rising sea levels. Teo, who earlier this year ratified a treaty with Australia to strengthen migration and security ties between the two countries as well as climate change mitigation, intensified his calls for Australia to phase out fossil fuel production, warning that current policies by major polluters amount to a 'death sentence' for his nation. 'My view of that commitment is that Australia … is highly morally obliged to ensure that whatever action it does will not compromise the commitment it has provided in terms of climate impact,' Teo said at a press conference in Apia, the capital of Samoa. 'On that platform I’m hoping we’ll be able to leverage Australia’s support and hopefully that will translate into reducing emission levels.' Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who is also in Samoa, said Australia is tackling the 'big task' of transitioning its economy to net zero emissions, but cannot be held responsible for emissions from coal and gas exported to other countries. Wong said that the 'vast majority' of new coal-fired power plants are being built in China and other developing nations. 'Australia has to reduce its emissions, but the whole world — if we are going to combat sea level rise, temperature rising — the whole world will have to peak and reduce emissions,' she said on Thursday. It’s the first time a Pacific Island has hosted the biennial leaders’ summit and climate change is expected to occupy much of the summit’s agenda. More than half of the Commonwealth’s members are small countries like Samoa, many of them island nations among the world’s most imperiled by rising seas.	https://apnews.com/article/commonwealth-heads-of-government-meeting-samoa-climate-australia-charles-8bcc1ad88de45d9d8b266d929af5d261	2024-10-23T22:37:31-07:00	
Turkey strikes Kurdish militant targets in Syria and Iraq for a second day	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey struck suspected Kurdish militant targets in Syria and Iraq for a second day on Thursday following an attack on the premises of a key defense company which killed at least five people, the state-run news agency reported. The National Intelligence Organization targeted numerous 'strategic locations' used by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, PKK, or by Syrian Kurdish militia that are affiliated with the militants, the Anadolu Agency reported. The targets included military, intelligence, energy and infrastructure facilities and ammunition depots, the report said. A security official said armed drones were used in Thursday’s strikes. On Wednesday, Turkey's air force carried out airstrikes against similar targets in northern Syria and northern Iraq, hours after government officials blamed the deadly attack at the headquarters of the aerospace and defense company TUSAS, on the PKK. More than 30 targets were destroyed in the aerial offensive, the defense ministry said. The assailants — a man and a woman — arrived at the TUSAS premises in the outskirts of Ankara in a taxi they commandeered after killing its driver, reports said. Armed with assault riffles, they set off explosives and opened fire, killing four people at TUSAS, including a security personnel and a mechanical engineer. Security teams were dispatched as soon as the attack started at around 3:30 pm, the interior minister said. The two assailants were also killed and more than 20 people were injured in the attack. There was no immediate statement from the PKK on the attack or the Turkish airstrikes. In Syria, the main U.S.-backed force said Turkish strikes in the north of the country killed 12 civilians and wounded 25. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said Turkish warplanes and drones struck bakeries, power stations, oil facilities and local police checkpoints. TUSAS designs, manufactures and assembles civilian and military aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles and other defense industry and space systems. Its defense systems have been credited as key to Turkey gaining an upper hand in its fight against Kurdish militants. The attack occurred a day after the leader of Turkey’s far-right nationalist party that’s allied with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan raised the possibility that the PKK’s imprisoned leader could be granted parole if he renounces violence and disbands his organization. Abdullah Ocalan’s group has been fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people since the 1980s. It is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies. __ Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue contributed from Beirut.	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-strikes-pkk-targets-syria-iraq-8b8c5e09716e2d3e3a29809b4082854d	2024-10-23T22:18:35-07:00

Stock market today: Wall Street finishes mixed after Tesla soars and IBM slumps	NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street drifted to a mixed finish Thursday after Tesla surged to one of the best days in its history, while IBM slumped to its worst in six months. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.2% to break its first three-day losing streak since early September. It bounced between losses and gains through the day, and it was roughly evenly split between stocks rising and falling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 140 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.8%. Tesla led the market with a jump of 21.9% after the electric-vehicle maker reported better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. An optimistic CEO Elon Musk also predicted 20% to 30% sales growth next year, though its revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ forecasts. It was the best day for Tesla’s stock since 2013. UPS climbed 5.3% after likewise topping analysts’ forecasts for profit. The package-delivery company’s finances can offer a window into the strength of the economy because of how many different types of customers it serves, and its revenue edged past expectations. ServiceNow, whose platform helps companies automate and connect processes, was another one of the strongest forces pushing upward the S&amp;P 500. It rose 5.4% after delivering stronger profit and revenue than expected, driven by interest by customers to incorporate artificial-intelligence technology. Such gains helped to offset a drop of 6.2% for IBM, which reported revenue for the latest quarter that fell just short of analysts’ expectations. It was the single biggest reason the Dow dragged behind other indexes. Boeing was another weight and sank 1.2% after its machinists voted to continue their strike, which has crippled aircraft production. More than 60% of union members who voted on the proposed contract rejected it, keeping them on the picket lines six weeks into their strike. Union Pacific dropped 4.4% after the railroad reported slightly weaker profit and revenue than expected. All told, the S&amp;P 500 rose 12.44 points to 5,809.86. The Dow dropped 140.59 to 42,374.36, and the Nasdaq composite rose 138.83 to 18,415.49. Stocks have broadly regressed this week after the S&amp;P 500 and Dow both set records at the end of last week. They’ve been hurt by rising Treasury yields in the bond market, which can make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks. Critics had already been saying beforehand that stocks looked too expensive given how much faster their prices have risen than corporate profits. Yields have climbed as report after report has shown the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. That’s good news for Wall Street, because it bolsters hopes the economy can escape from the worst inflation in generations without the painful recession that many had worried was inevitable. But it’s also forcing traders to ratchet back forecasts for how deeply the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, now that it’s just as focused on keeping the economy humming as getting inflation lower. With bets diminishing on how much the Fed will ultimately cut its overnight interest rate, Treasury yields have also been given back some of their earlier declines. A report on unemployment claims Thursday offered a mixed picture on the job market. It said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which can be a signal of relatively low layoffs. But it also said the total number of those collecting benefits rose to its highest level in almost three years. Altogether, the numbers show a slowing economy, 'but there is no sign of a crash in employment or a surge of layoffs in these data,' according to Carl Weinberg and Rubeela Farooqi at High Frequency Economics. Treasury yields, which had eased overnight, pared their losses after the release of the unemployment claims report before yo-yoing. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.20% from 4.25% late Wednesday. It’s still well above its 4.08% level from late last week. A separate preliminary report said growth in U.S. business activity may have accelerated slightly last month, as strength for companies in services industries continue to make up for weakness in manufacturing. The report from S&amp;P Global also showed a recovery in confidence as companies anticipate greater stability and certainty after the upcoming presidential election. A third report, meanwhile, said sales of new homes were stronger last month than economists expected. In stock markets abroad, indexes were modestly higher in Europe after finishing mixed in Asia. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-bonds-dollar-81c830cd6d465440f3d8f4bfc12d7487	2024-10-23T19:45:25-07:00	
A melodic greeting between women in Burundi is at risk of being lost	NGOZI, Burundi (AP) — The hug between the two women looked like it would last forever. A spirited 85-year-old had embraced a younger woman she hadn’t seen for months, and she chanted a number of questions in the peculiar yodeling routine of her ancestors. How are you? How is your husband? How are the kids? How are your cows? Are you on good terms with your neighbors? And so on. Prudencienne Namukobwa paused in the melody to allow the younger woman's rhythmic affirmation, a pattern she has mastered over the decades. 'Ego,' Emelyne Nzeyimana replied over and over in the local Kirundi language. 'Yes.' A group of neighbors watched in amazement. Many were seeing their first performance of the traditional form of musical greeting, known to Burundians as akazehe. It is performed exclusively by women on a range of occasions. But akazehe is fading, despite its unique status in this central African country that is better known for its world-famous percussionists. That's according to cultural officials, teachers and others who say the practice is worth preserving. They cited the threat from public health measures that discourage unnecessary contact during disease outbreaks, in addition to the perceived failure to promote akazehe among school-going youth. Among young Burundians, it is hard to find people who know what akazehe means and even harder to find someone who can perform it. 'At a certain time, unfortunately, it was abandoned,' said Sandrine Kitonze, a culture advisor in the office of the governor of Ngozi province. She said akazehe and its minutes-long embrace 'made you feel that the person who greets you loves you.' Some academics have noted akazehe’s potential role in fostering social cohesion in Burundi, which is now largely peaceful after a period of deadly civil war followed by political instability. Annonciate Baragahorana, a teacher in the province of Bujumbura, which includes the commercial capital, told The Associated Press that while she was not born in a place where akazehe was widely practiced, she was astonished as a young girl when women embraced and addressed her in the polyphonic way during visits to other regions. 'The women who often did this lived in the central plateau provinces. When we went there during the holidays, a woman from the interior of the country kissed you strongly while wishing you wonders and she hugged you for a long time,' she said with a chuckle. 'I wanted her to finish quickly, even if it was sweet words to hear.' Baragahorana said she feared 'tenderness in social relationships will disappear' among Burundians amid threats from contagious diseases such as COVID-19 and Mpox. 'People greet each other from a distance for fear of contaminating each other,' she said. 'This will contribute enormously to the demise of akazehe.' In Ngozi, a hilly province in Burundi’s north, akazehe remains familiar to some locals, and women such as Namukobwa are impressive at performing it. She lives in a decaying house set in the side of a verdant hill. One recent morning, she was sitting on a mat outside when she glimpsed Nzeyimana, the visiting daughter of a former neighbor. She overcame her bad hip to rise and welcome the woman, whom she addressed as if she were her biological daughter. 'I felt that the first love she had when I was just a girl is kept until now,' said Nzeyimana, a broadcaster in Ngozi. 'This means that I am still her daughter.' Akazehe can seem like a race to perfect accord, a search for harmony, in the interwoven vocalizations. While most questions are routine, some can be unexpected. Nzeyimana said afterward that she had been anxious over possibly facing a question for which she was not ready with a positive response. There was none. Serena Facci, an Italian scholar at the University of Rome Tor Vergata who has written about akazehe, said that even by 1993, when she went to Burundi for research in ethnomusicology, 'this beautiful female greeting wasn't very common in the ordinary life.' Its continuing disappearance could be due to changing lifestyles, she said. A custom such as akazehe should be preserved at all costs because of its role in protecting families, said Isaac Nikobiba, an anthropologist in Bujumbura. Among communities that practiced it, women could alert mother figures to any turbulence at home, triggering supportive measures from the extended family, he said. Nikobiba called the potential disappearance of akazehe symptomatic of wider cultural losses stemming from modernization. 'Normally, before starting a home in traditional Burundi, the girl would first receive advice from her paternal aunt who would tell her, ‘I will come to greet you after a certain time. If you notice an anomaly in the home, you will have to tell me everything,’' he said. 'In short, if she does not find someone to whom she can confide her marital intimacies, she spends all the time in a very bad psychological atmosphere.' Floride Ntakirutimana was among the small group of women who gathered to witness the spectacle of Namukobwa greeting Nzeyimana. She said she grew up in a farming community where no mother could perform akazehe, and only heard of it through radio programs. The exchange she watched left her feeling she wanted to learn akazehe herself. 'I feel better, and I saw that it was good,' Ntakirutimana said. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Massive displacement from Israel-Hezbollah war transforms Beirut’s famed commercial street	BEIRUT (AP) — Inside what was once one of Beirut’s oldest and best-known cinemas, dozens of Lebanese, Palestinians and Syrians displaced by the Israel-Hezbollah war spend their time following the news on their phones, cooking, chatting and walking around to pass the time. Outside on Hamra Street, once a thriving economic hub, sidewalks are filled with displaced people, and hotels and apartments are crammed with those seeking shelter. Cafes and restaurants are overflowing. In some ways, the massive displacement of hundreds of thousands of people from south Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beirut’s southern suburbs has provided a boost for this commercial district after years of decline as a result of Lebanon’s economic crisis. But it is not the revival many had hoped for. 'The displacement revived Hamra Street in a wrong way,' said the manager of a four-star hotel on the boulevard, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the problems the influx has caused for the neighborhood. For three weeks after the war intensified in mid-September, his hotel enjoyed full occupancy. Today, it stands at about 65% capacity — still good for this time of year — after some left for cheaper rented apartments. But, he said, the flow of displaced people has also brought chaos. Traffic congestion, double parking and motorcycles and scooters scattered on sidewalks has become the norm, making it difficult for pedestrians to walk. Tensions regularly erupt between displaced people and the district’s residents, he said. Hamra Street has long been a bellwether for Lebanon’s turbulent politics. During the country's heyday in the 1960s and early 1970s, it represented everything that was glamorous, filled with Lebanon’s top movie houses and theaters, cafes frequented by intellectuals and artists, and ritzy shops. Over the past decades, the street has witnessed rises and falls depending on the situation in the small Mediterranean nation that has been marred by repeated bouts of instability, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990. In 1982, Israeli tanks rolled down Hamra Street after Israel invaded the country, reaching all the way to west Beirut. In recent years, the district was transformed by an influx of Syrian refugees fleeing the war in the neighboring nation, and businesses were hammered by the country’s financial collapse, which began in 2019. Israel dramatically escalated its attacks on parts of Lebanon on Sept. 23, killing nearly 500 people and wounding 1,600 in one day after nearly a year of skirmishes along the Lebanon-Israel border between Israeli troops and the militant Hezbollah group. The intensified attacks sparked an exodus of people fleeing the bombardment, including many who slept in public squares, on beaches or pavements around Beirut. More than 2,574 people have been killed in Lebanon and over 12,000 wounded in the past year of war, according to the country's Health Ministry, and around 1.2 million people are displaced. Many have flooded Hamra, a cosmopolitan and diverse area, with some moving in with relatives or friends and others headed to hotels and schools turned into shelters. In recent days several empty buildings were stormed by displaced people, who were forced to leave by security forces after confrontations that sometimes turned violent. Mohamad Rayes, a member of the Hamra Traders Association, said before the influx of displaced people, some businesses were planning to close because of financial difficulties. 'It is something that cannot be imagined,' Rayes said about the flow of displaced people boosting commerce in Hamra in ways unseen in years. He said some traders even doubled prices because of high demand. At a cellular shop, Farouk Fahmy said during the first two weeks his sales increased 70%, with people who fled their homes mostly buying chargers and internet data to follow the news. 'The market is stagnant again now,' Fahmy said. Since many fled their homes with few belongings, men's and women's underwear and pajama sales grew by 300% at the small boutique business owned by Hani, who declined to give his full name for safety reasons. The 60-year-old movie theatre, Le Colisee, a landmark on Hamra Street, had been closed for more than two decades until earlier this year when Lebanese actor Kassem Istanbouli, founder of the Lebanese National Theater, took over and began renovating it. With the massive tide of displacement, he transformed it into a shelter for families who fled their homes in south Lebanon. Istanbouli, who has theaters in the southern port city of Tyre and the northern city of Tripoli, Lebanon’s second-largest, has turned all three into shelters where people, no matter their nationality, can take refuge. This week, displaced people in the Beirut movie theater sat on thin mattresses on its red carpeting, checking their phones and reading. Some were helping with the theater's renovation work. Among them was Abdul-Rahman Mansour, a Syrian citizen, along with his three brothers and their Palestinian-Lebanese mother, Joumana Hanafi. Mansour said they fled Tyre after a rocket attack near their home, taking shelter at a school in the coastal city of Sidon, where they were allowed to stay since their mother is a Lebanese citizen. When the shelter’s management found out that Mansour and his brothers were Syrian they had to leave because only Lebanese citizens were allowed. With no place to stay, they returned to Tyre. 'We slept for a night in Tyre, but I hope you never witness such a night,' Hanafi said of the intensity of the bombardment. She said one of her sons knew Istanbouli and contacted him. 'We told him, ‘Before anything, we are Syrians.’ He said, ‘It is a shame that you have to say that.’' Istanbouli spends hours a day at his theaters in Beirut and Tripoli to be close to the displaced people sheltering there. 'Normally people used to come here to watch a movie. Today we are all at the theater and the movie is being played outside,' Istanbouli said of the ongoing war.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-displaced-hamra-beirut-582c617d6d3b8639c8c8ddec4a6916b7	2024-10-23T19:17:01-07:00	
The Paris conference for Lebanon raises $1 billion in pledges for humanitarian and military support	PARIS (AP) — An international conference for Lebanon in Paris on Thursday raised $1 billion in pledges for humanitarian aid and military support to help the country where war between Hezbollah militants and Israel has displaced a million people, killed over 2,500, and deepened an economic crisis, French organizers said. In his closing speech, France's foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot said : 'We have collectively raised $800 million in humanitarian aid and $200 million for the security forces, that’s about $1 billion.' The Paris conference gathered over 70 nations and international organizations. French President Emmanuel Macron had called on participants to bring 'massive aid' to support the country, as France promised $100 million. 'We’re up to the challenge,' Barrot said. The United States pledged to provide about $300 million, he added. Germany pledged a total of 96 million euros in humanitarian aid to both Lebanon and neighboring Syria, also deeply affected by escalating violence in the Middle East. Italy announced this week an additional 10 million euros ($10.8 million) in aid for Lebanon. The United Nations had previously estimated the urgent humanitarian needs in Lebanon to be $426 million. However, experts warn that delivering aid could be challenging as Lebanon’s growing dependence on informal and cash economy increases lack of transparency and corruption risks. Strengthening Lebanon’s armed forces The Paris conference also aimed at coordinating international support to strengthen Lebanon’s armed forces so they can deploy in the country’s south as part of a potential deal to end the war. Such a deal could see Hezbollah withdraw its forces from the border. This support to the Lebanese military includes 'helping with health care, fuel, small equipment, but also supporting the plan to recruit at least 6,000 additional soldiers and to enable the deployment of at least 8,000 additional soldiers in the south,' Macron said. Paris also seeks to help restore Lebanon's sovereignty and strengthen its institutions. The country, where Hezbollah effectively operates as a state within a state, has been without a president for two years while political factions fail to agree on a new one. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, in a pre-recorded video, called on Lebanon’s leaders 'to take decisive action to ensure the proper functioning of state institutions in order to meet the country’s urgent political and security challenges.' Lebanese prime mister urges international action Acting Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged the international community to take action. 'The devastating impact of this war on our nation cannot be overstated, and it has left a trail of destruction and misery in its wake. The Israelis' aggression has not only caused immense human suffering and loss of lives, but also inflicted severe damage to the country’s infrastructure, economy and social fabric,' Mikati said Thursday in Paris. In Lebanon, an Israeli airstrike killed early Thursday three Lebanese soldiers, including an officer, as they were evacuating wounded people in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese army said Israeli forces have targeted it on eight occasions since an all-out war broke out between Israel and Hezbollah in September. The Israeli army apologized for a strike on Sunday that it said mistakenly killed three soldiers, and on Wednesday said it was looking into whether 'a number of soldiers of the Lebanese army were accidentally harmed' after it targeted what it says was Hezbollah infrastructure. Israel in the past month has launched a major aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Lebanon as it says it's targeting Hezbollah, with strikes hitting the capital, Beirut, and elsewhere. The International Organization for Migration has said about 800,000 people are displaced, with many now in overcrowded shelters, while others have fled across the border into Syria. Mikati on Thursday estimated the number of displaced people is over 1.4 million, including 500,000 children. A government ill-prepared to deal with the crisis The cash-strapped Lebanese government is ill-prepared to deal with the crisis or the increased demands on its health system. Several have been evacuated because of nearby airstrikes and fears that they might be targeted. Lebanon's army has been hit hard by five years of economic crisis. It has an aging arsenal and no air defenses, leaving it in no position to defend against Israeli incursions or confront Hezbollah. The Lebanese army has about 80,000 troops, around 5,000 of them deployed in the south. Hezbollah has more than 100,000 fighters, according to the militant group’s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The militant group's arsenal, built with support from Iran, is more advanced. Supporting U.N. peacekeeping forces Conference participants discussed how to support the 10,500-soldier-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL. European nations including France, Italy and Spain provide a third of its troops. Italy, which has over 1,000 troops in UNIFIL, is pushing for the peacekeeping force to be strengthened to 'be able to face the new situation' on the ground, an Italian diplomat said, speaking anonymously to discuss ongoing talks. Guterres said Thursday that 'attacks on U.N. peacekeepers are totally unacceptable and are contrary to international law, contrary to international humanitarian law and may constitute a war crime.' France’s historic links with Lebanon, a former colony, and its influential diplomacy give Paris momentum to coordinate 'a proper response to the massive challenge that the war in Lebanon now poses,' said Middle East expert Rym Montaz, editor-in-chief of Carnegie Europe’s blog Strategic Europe. 'What we do know is that without a strengthened Lebanese armed forces and UNIFIL, there can be no sustainable peace and stability at the border between Lebanon and Israel,' Montaz said. 'As such, the French efforts are important and crucial for the way forward.' ___ AP writers Geir Moulson in Berlin, Germany and Abby Sewell in Beirut, Lebanon, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-lebanon-conference-paris-humanitarian-aid-30a97f88d2ec8dc138385d18a31dbb69	2024-10-23T19:15:58-07:00	
Tropical storm battering Philippines leaves at least 24 people dead in flooding and landslides	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Widespread flooding and landslides set off by a tropical storm in the northeastern Philippines on Thursday left at least 24 people dead, swept away cars and prompted authorities to scramble for motorboats to rescue trapped villagers, some on roofs. The government shut down schools and offices — except those urgently needed for disaster response — for the second day on the entire main island of Luzon to protect millions of people after Tropical Storm Trami slammed into the country’s northeastern province of Isabela after midnight. The storm was blowing over Aguinaldo town in the mountain province of Ifugao after dawn with sustained winds up to 95 kph (59 mph) and gusts up to 160 kph (99 mph). It was blowing westward and was forecast to enter the South China Sea later on Thursday, according to state forecasters. At least 24 people died, mostly due to drowning in the hard-hit Bicol region and nearby Quezon province but the toll was expected to rise as towns and villages isolated by flooding and roads blocked by landslides and toppled trees manage to send out reports, police and provincial officials said. Most of the storm deaths were reported in the six-province Bicol region, southeast of Manila, where at least 20 people died, including 7 residents in Naga city, which was inundated by flash floods as Trami was approaching Tuesday, dumping more than two months’ worth of rainfall in just 24 hours at high tide, regional police chief Brig. Gen. Andre Dizon and other officials said. While thousands of villagers, who were trapped in floodwaters, have been rescued by government forces, many more needed to be saved Thursday in the Bicol region, including some on roofs. About 1,500 police officers have been deployed for disaster-mitigation work, Dizon said. 'We can’t rescue them all at once because there are so many and we need additional motorboats,' Dizon told The Associated Press by telephone. 'We’re looking for ways to deliver food and water to those who were trapped but could not be evacuated right away.' Flash floods swept away and submerged cars in some parts of Naga city while mudflows from Mayon, one of the country’s 24 active volcanoes, in nearby Albay province, engulfed several vehicles, Dizon said. Stormy weather remained in the region, hampering relief efforts, officials said. The government’s disaster-mitigation agency said more than 2 million people were affected by the storm, including 75,400 villagers who were displaced from their homes and are sheltering on safer ground. About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones in the world, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and flattened entire villages.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-trami-philippines-85a28c058b1f4685033ab02d34782acf	2024-10-23T17:45:24-07:00	
Trash carried by a North Korean balloon again falls on the presidential compound in Seoul	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Trash carried by a North Korean balloon fell on the presidential compound in central Seoul on Thursday, officials said, the second such case in recent months that raise concerns about the vulnerability of key South Korean sites during potential North Korean aggression. The incident comes after the rival Koreas ramped up threats and rhetoric against each other over North Korea’s claims that South Korea flew drones over its capital Pyongyang to scatter propaganda leaflets this month. South Korea’s presidential security service said in a statement that one of the balloons floated by North Korea burst over the South Korean presidential compound on Thursday morning, dropping rubbish on the ground. No dangerous items were found. North Korea has sent trash-carrying balloons into South Korea since late May in a resumption of a Cold War-style psychological campaign. The trash that fell on the South Korean presidential compound in July contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt. It wasn’t immediately known whether South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was at the compound during the latest incident. His schedule showed he was due to meet with visiting Polish President Andrzej Duda at his office later Thursday. South Korea’s Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported earlier Thursday on its website that North Korea’s latest balloons contained propaganda leaflets criticizing Yoon and his wife Kim Keon Hee along with trash. The newspapers said the leaflets were scattered in areas in Seoul’s Yongsan district, where Yoon’s presidential office is located, and noted that North Korea has recently begun using GPS technology to drop balloons more accurately in intended locations. The South Korean presidential security service didn't immediately confirm the report. Experts say North Korea likely lacks sophisticated technology to drop balloons on specific targets. 'Whether the balloons have GPS or not, it’s all about launching them in large numbers and hitting the right altitude based on wind direction and speed, so that they can ride those winds to travel,' Lee Choon Geun, an honorary research fellow at South Korea’s Science and Technology Policy Institute, said. 'While some media are saying the accuracy of the balloons has improved, that improved accuracy isn’t because they equipped them with some sort of guidance system, but rather because it’s the season when winds blow southward,' Lee said. North Korea has earlier accused South Korea of infiltrating drones to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month and threatened military responses if it happened again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea would face the end of its regime if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened. North Korea said its balloon activities were response to South Korean activists launching anti-Pyongyang leaflets via their own balloons. South Korea responded by restarting propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts at border areas, prompting North Korea to turn on their own frontline loudspeakers. The Koreas' Cold War-style campaigns come as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has increased the pace of his weapons tests and expanded military cooperation with Russia. U.S. and South Korean officials said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations. South Korean officials say North Korea eventually aims to send a total of 10,000 troops to Russia to support its war efforts in Ukraine. South Korea is concerned that Russia may reward North Korea by giving it sophisticated technologies that could improve the North's nuclear and missile programs that target South Korea and its allies.	https://apnews.com/article/koreas-tensions-trash-balloon-presidential-compound-3ab04d8a582e1760d01c2783c2d50b30	2024-10-23T15:29:19-07:00	
Israel accuses 6 Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants	RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — The Israeli army on Wednesday accused six Al Jazeera journalists covering the war in Gaza of also being current or former paid fighters for Palestinian militant groups. Al Jazeera rejected the claims. Israel cited documents it purportedly found in Gaza, and other intelligence it gathered, in making the accusations against the journalists, all of whom are Palestinian men. It said four are or have been affiliated with Hamas, and two with Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera said the accusations were 'fabricated' and 'part of a wider pattern of hostility' toward the pan-Arab network. It said the claims were 'a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region, thereby obscuring the harsh realities of the war from audiences worldwide.' The Associated Press has been unable to independently verify the authenticity of the documents Israel posted online to support its claims. Al Jazeera is based in the energy-rich nation of Qatar, where many senior Hamas officials are based. The Gulf Arab country, which funds Al Jazeera, also has been a key player in Gaza cease-fire negotiations, along with the U.S. and Egypt. Al Jazeera journalists Anas al-Sharif, Hossam Shabat, Ismael Abu Omar, and Talal Arrouki were accused by Israel of ties to Hamas. Ashraf Saraj and Alaa Salameh were accused of ties to Islamic Jihad. The men have held various roles, according to documents Israel cited -- sniper, infantry soldier, fighter, captain, training coordinator and 'propaganda.' The Committee to Protect Journalists released a statement on Wednesday that was critical of Israel, which it said 'has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence.' In July, after an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City killed two Al Jazeera journalists, including Ismail Al Ghoul, Israel 'produced a similar document, which contained contradictory information, showing that Al Ghoul, born in 1997, received a Hamas military ranking in 2007 – when he would have been 10 years old,' the committee said in its statement. Militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad led last year's attack on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. They have been fighting alongside each other against Israeli troops in Gaza for the past year. In January, Israel detailed allegations against 12 employees of a United Nations agency that it says were involved in the Hamas attack on Israel last year that ignited the war in Gaza. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, subsequently fired at least 21 staffers for their roles in the attack. UNRWA has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians in Gaza during the war. Four Al Jazeera journalists have been killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza over the past 12 months, according to the network. Several of the dead later have been accused by Israel of being members of either Hamas or Islamic Jihad, accusations rejected by the Qatari outlet. In May, after an Israeli court ordered the closure of Al Jazeera's operations and broadcasts within Israel, police raided a hotel room in East Jerusalem from where the network had been broadcasting live images. It was the first time Israel had ever shuttered a foreign news outlet. Four months later, Israel raided Al Jazeera's office in the Palestinian-governed West Bank city of Ramallah, shutting down the bureau there. Several of those named by Israel on Wednesday, including al-Sharif, have become mainstay figures of the outlet's 24-hour live coverage of Gaza. They have acquired celebrity-like status among Palestinians and in other countries across the Middle East. Al Jazeera is one of a handful of news organizations still broadcasting daily from the besieged enclave. The documents and intelligence Israel released Wednesday purportedly show the rank, role, enlistment date, and battalion of each of the six Al Jazeera journalists. At least 128 journalists have been killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, and Lebanon since last October, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. They include 123 Palestinians, two Israelis and three Lebanese. Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza since the war began, according to the local health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants but says more than half of the dead are women and children. Even before the war, tensions between Al Jazeera and Israel ran high. Israeli forces shot and killed Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist, in May 2022 as she reported on a story in the West Bank. Israel isn't the only critic of Al Jazeera. The U.S. singled out the broadcaster during its occupation of Iraq after its 2003 invasion toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, and for airing videos of the late al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden, who orchestrated the Sept. 11, 2001 attack against the U.S. Al Jazeera has been closed or blocked by other governments in the Middle East. In 2013, Egyptian authorities seeking to crush mass protests against President Mohammed Morsi raided a luxury hotel used by Al Jazeera. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.	https://apnews.com/article/al-jazeera-journalists-hamas-islamic-jihad-israel-983215f9904bffa7f3d5518235e19e86	2024-10-23T12:54:25-07:00	
Some Liberal lawmakers ask Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau not to run for a fourth term	TORONTO (AP) — Some lawmakers in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's own Liberal Party asked the leader not to run for a fourth term Wednesday, handing him one of the biggest tests of his political career. Three Liberal members of Parliament said they were among a total of 20 plus lawmakers from the party to have signed a letter asking Trudeau to step down before the next election. There are 153 Liberals in Canada's House of Commons. 'He has to start listening, listening to the people,' said Ken McDonald, a Liberal Member of Parliament from Newfoundland who said he signed the letter, which has not been made public. McDonald, who is not running again, said some of his colleagues who plan on running are nervous because of poor polling numbers. Also stating publicly that they had signed the letter were Wayne Long of New Brunswick and Sean Casey of Prince Edward Island. Trudeau, who previously has said he plans to run again, met with Liberal lawmakers for three hours on Wednesday. 'The Liberal party is strong and united,' a smiling Trudeau said to reporters after the meeting ended. Liberals later applauded loudly for Trudeau when he addressed the House of Commons. Trudeau thanked them. His Cabinet ministers have supported him publicly. 'There is what would you call some palace drama going on right now. And that takes us away from the number one job, which is focusing on Canadians,' said Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, a Liberal Party member. Immigration Minister Marc Miller, also a Liberal and a close friend of Trudeau, said Tuesday that anonymous griping about the prime minister was 'garbage,' but he softened his language on Wednesday as he left the meeting early. 'This is something that I think has been simmering for some time and it's important for people to get it out,' Miller said. 'What happened in there, although it will remain confidential, is really about Members of Parliament telling the prime minister the truth whether he likes to hear it or not.' Charles Sousa, a member of Parliament for a suburban Toronto area, said Trudeau is reflecting. 'Trudeau made it very clear that he feels he’s the right choice but he appreciates all of what is being said,' Sousa said. 'I respect his decision, whatever that may be.' Ontario Liberal lawmaker John McKay called the meeting a candid conversation and said it was up to Trudeau whether he would remain leader. Trudeau's Liberals recently suffered upsets in special elections in two districts in Toronto and Montreal that the party has held for years, raising doubts about Trudeau’s leadership. The federal election could come any time between this fall and October 2025. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament as they don't have the majority of seats. The opposition leader of the Bloc Québécois has said his party will work with the Conservatives and the New Democratic Party, of NDP, to bring the Liberals down and force an election if the government doesn’t boost pensions for seniors. Tall and trim, Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015 when he reasserted the country’s liberal identity in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the cost of living coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Liberals trail the opposition Conservatives 38% to 25% in the latest Nanos poll. The poll of 1,037 respondents has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. 'The electoral prospects of the Liberals with Justin Trudeau at the helm look bleak,' said Daniel Béland, a politics professor at McGill University in Montreal. Trudeau’s legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax intended to fight climate change. 'He saved the Liberals back in 2015 but, over time, he’s become a huge liability for them,' Béland said.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-revolt-election-d60161f9b6e83e97864e9d78623e2260	2024-10-23T09:46:33-07:00	
Officials say North Korea has sent troops to Russia. What would that mean for the war with Ukraine?	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. and South Korean officials said Wednesday that there’s evidence North Korea has dispatched troops to Russia in a potential escalation of the nearly 3-year-old war with Ukraine. If the soldiers' goal is fighting with Russia in Ukraine, it would be the first time a third country puts boots on the ground in the war. Other countries on both sides of the divide have sent military aid, including weapons and training: Iran has supplied Russia with drones, and Western nations have provided Ukraine with modern weapons and financial and humanitarian assistance. South Korea’s spy chief told lawmakers that 3,000 North Korean troops are being trained to use equipment including drones before being they're sent to fight in Ukraine. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters during a visit to Rome that 'we are seeing evidence that there are North Korean troops' that have gone to Russia. 'What exactly they’re doing — left to be seen,' Austin said. Neither Austin nor South Korean National Intelligence Service Director Cho Tae-yong provided details about how they knew about the North Korean troops, and many questions remain about the impact of North Korea’s participation. What do we know about the North Koreans? Ukraine’s Military Intelligence Directorate head, Kyrylo Budanov, told the online military news outlet 'The War Zone' on Tuesday that North Korean troops were arriving in Russia’s Kursk region as early as Wednesday to help Russian troops fight off a Ukrainian border incursion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters on Monday that North Korean officers and technical personnel have already been spotted in Russian-occupied territories. He did not specify when. 'I believe they sent officers first to assess the situation before deploying troops,' Zelenskyy said. He has cautioned that the participation of a third country could escalate the conflict into a 'world war' and Austin said that it would be a 'very, very serious issue' if Pyongyang indeed did join the war on Russia’s side. What is Ukraine doing? Ukraine is preparing as though combating North Korea in its territory will be inevitable. An injection of 10,000 North Korean troops, which is what both Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence have claimed, 'could significantly destabilize Ukraine’s defense there and greatly accelerate the advancement of Russian forces,' said Glib Voloskyi, an analyst from a Ukrainian think tank, Come Back Alive Initiatives Center. Ukraine’s 'I Want to Live' project, a hotline encouraging Russian soldiers to surrender, published a video in Korean on Wednesday calling for North Korean soldiers to give up. 'We call for the soldiers of the Korean People’s Army, who were sent to help the Putin regime. You should not die senselessly on someone else’s land. There is no need to repeat the fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers who will never return home!' How is the West reacting? Zelenskyy told reporters Monday that the European Union and the U.S. have been cautious in publicly addressing North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia – describing their reactions as 'very restrained.' German and U.K. officials also weighed in, with South Korea hinting that it could support Ukraine with military weapons in the event of North Korea’s confirmed involvement. 'We don’t even know whether we are talking about 1,500 or 12,000 or which kind of soldiers are coming to Russia and to fight where and against,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said. 'It’s a kind of escalation and it shows us a very important, a very important aspect. International conflicts are approaching very rapidly.' U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said there was 'not just a concern about the potential for an escalation of conflict in Europe. There is an indivisible link with security concerns in the Indo-Pacific as well.' Why does Russia need North Korea? North Korea and Russia, both in separate confrontations with the West, have deepened their military cooperation in the last two years. In June, they signed a defense deal requiring both countries to provide military assistance if the other is attacked. For analysts, the introduction of troops would be a sign that the war isn’t going as Russia planned. 'I think Ukraine is wearing down the Russian army as we talk. You don’t get thousands of soldiers from North Korea if your war is going well,' said Justin Crump, a former British tank commander who heads Sibylline, a strategic advisory firm. 'You don’t require them'. North Korea has already sent over 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Those missiles are being actively used against Ukrainian targets, officials in Kyiv say. —— Associated Press reporters Hanna Arhirova and Illia Novikov contributed.

EU stays on the sidelines over migrant deal between Italy and Albania	TIRANA, Albania (AP) — A top European Union official on Wednesday refused to be drawn on an opinion of an agreement between Italy and Albania to process some migrants in centers set up in the tiny Western Balkan country, saying only that it was being closely monitored. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that 'from the very beginning on we have been very clear that we are monitoring the development related to this agreement very closely.' Under a five-year deal signed last November by Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama, up to 3,000 migrants picked up by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be sheltered in Albania. Their asylum requests will be processed there. Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania. The first 12 migrants sheltered last week in Albanian centers were brought back to Italy three days later, following a ruling by Rome judges, who rejected their detention, arguing that their countries of origin — Bangladesh and Egypt — were not safe enough for them to be sent back. Italy’s far-right government on Monday approved a new decree aimed at overcoming judicial hurdles that risked derailing a controversial migration deal with Albania. Under the new decree — which is effective immediately — the government shortened the list of countries considered 'safe' by law, meaning that Rome can repatriate to those countries migrants who didn’t win asylum using a fast-track procedure. The court ruling was an early stumbling block to the five-year deal between Italy and Albania. Italian Premier Minister Giorgia Meloni has strongly pushed the deal, defending it as a new 'model' to handle illegal migration. In a letter to EU leaders last December, a month after the deal was signed in Rome, von der Leyen praised 'important initiatives' on restricting migration by some of the bloc’s 27 member countries, including 'the operational arrangement between Italy and Albania.' 'This serves as an example of out-of-the-box thinking, based on fair sharing of responsibilities with third countries in line with obligations under EU and international law,' she wrote. Von der Leyen was in Tirana on Monday as part of a regional tour to reassure the Western Balkan countries that the enlargement of the trade bloc remained one of its priorities. She only said that the Italy-Albania deal was 'a bilateral agreement' which the EU would not comment on but only monitor.

Israeli weapon seen in rare AP photos of Beirut airstrike appears to be a powerful smart bomb	JERUSALEM (AP) — In all but the blink of an eye, an Associated Press photographer's camera captured the moments that a battleship-gray Israeli bomb plummeted toward a Beirut building before detonating to bring the tower down. The airstrike came 40 minutes after Israel warned people to evacuate two buildings in the area that it said were located near Hezbollah warehouses and assets. The site was not far from where a spokesperson for the militant group had just briefed journalists. It was a rare glimpse into the use of one of the most powerful bombs in Israel's arsenal. What kind of weapon was it? An examination by independent arms researchers suggests the weapon was a guided bomb, also known as a smart bomb, launched from an Israeli jet. The tail fin and nose sections indicate this was a 2,000-pound warhead fitted with an Israeli-made guidance kit known as SPICE, according to Richard Weir, a senior conflict, crisis and arms researcher at Human Rights Watch. SPICE — Smart, Precise-Impact and Cost-Effective — guidance systems are made by Israel’s government-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. They are attached to a standard unguided bomb to direct the weapon to its target. Minutes before the strike brought down the building, there were two smaller strikes on it, in what Israel’s military often refers to as a 'knock on the roof' warning strike, according to AP journalists at the scene. The practice has been observed in Israel's military campaign in Gaza; there, over 40,000 have been killed, according to local officials who don't distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths, in one of the most destructive conflicts in recent history. The Israeli military declined to comment about the type of weapon used. Why does Israel use this type of bomb? Rafael advertises SPICE kits as being able to operate day or night, through bad weather, and in areas jammed against GPS. It says the weapons offer 'high lethality and low collateral damage' and 'pinpoint hit accuracy.' It also keeps the attacking aircraft out of harm's way. The 2,000-pound version can be launched as far as 60 kilometers (37 miles) from its target. Rafael also makes smaller versions. Once released by an attacking Israeli warplane such as an American-made F-15 or F-16, the bomb glides toward its target, adjusting course using movable fins. Joseph Dempsey, a defense and military analyst at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, agreed the photos indicated the weapon was a 2,000-pound SPICE bomb. He said the guidance system is thought to rely on GPS and what are known as electro-optical guidance systems, which use cameras or sensors to zero in on the bomb's target. The destructive nature of the weapon comes down to many factors, including the size of the warhead and the way it is fused. 'This was clearly a delayed action fuse. It buried down into the ground (and) detonated, which has the effect of limiting the fragmentation and blast damage of this particular strike,' Weir said. That explains why the destruction was limited almost entirely to the targeted building. People standing a few hundred meters away felt little to nothing from the blast and didn't see much fragmentation. Where is this bomb made? The answer isn't straightforward. 'The guidance kits for the SPICE 2000 are manufactured by Rafael in Israel, though the level of reliance on foreign sub-components is unclear,' Dempsey said. In 2019, Rafael and U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin signed a deal to work together to build and sell SPICE guidance kits in the U.S. At the time, the companies said production of over 60 percent of the SPICE system was spread across eight U.S. states. In late October 2023, weeks after Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack, the U.S. State Department issued a letter approving the export of additional SPICE bomb assemblies to Israel. That letter, first reported by The New York Times, notified Congress that Rafael USA, an American subsidiary of the Israeli defense company, was seeking the $320 million shipment. That request was an amendment to an earlier $403 million license in 2020. The explosive warhead is a basic bomb, in this case likely a 2,000-pound MK-84 style explosive, where the nose and tail section have been swapped out for the guidance system. The U.S. earlier this year paused shipments of those powerful bombs to Israel because of concerns over civilian casualties, though Israel is believed to still have supplies in stock. It is difficult to know for sure where the bomb part was produced. Israel relies on the U.S. for supplies of MK-84 bombs, but it and other countries also produce similar weapons. Determining that with certainty would require recovering remnants with markings on them, Weir said. __ Associated Press journalist Sarah El Deeb contributed from Beirut.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-war-bomb-building-photos-beirut-c911be38a0ade1b96b4397ff496208e8	2024-10-23T08:58:39-07:00	
Sweeping blackouts in Cuba raise the question: Why has the island's solar buildout been so slow?	HAVANA (AP) — Cuba’s large-scale blackouts that left 10 million people without power this month may not have happened if the government had built out more solar power to boost its failing electric grid as promised, some experts say. In a nation with plentiful sunshine, Cuban officials have long had the opportunity to encourage solar power as one solution to national energy problems. But October’s sweeping outages — the island’s worst power failure in years — show little progress has been made. 'If you had extensive buildout of solar, solar farms, residential solar and storage, for the most part, you could avoid the problems they have,' said Dan Whittle, associate vice president of the resilient Caribbean practice at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. 'But they haven’t really built the policies to get there.' Cuban officials blame the blackouts on the U.S. trade embargo and other sanctions, the pandemic's effect on tourism, and emigration all inhibiting Cuba's economy. But experts say the government hasn’t updated its internal policies regarding foreign ownership and private financing, especially for critical solar projects, and are still focused on petroleum fuels. That's despite the fact that as part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the Cuban government committed to 37% of its power coming from renewable energy by 2030, an ambitious increase from an initial 24% target. John Kavulich, president of U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council Inc., said there was much hope in the business community two years ago when the U.S. changed policies enabling U.S. investment in private Cuban companies. But the Cuban government has failed to issue regulations necessary to allow the money to start flowing to the private sector, he said. 'So all of this investment and financing, not just from the U.S. but from other countries ... that are ready to take a chance in Cuba, sit idle, and that is hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars,' he said. The share of Cuba's electricity that comes from renewable sources like solar and burning sugar cane waste has increased only slightly, from 3.8% in 2012 to 5% as of 2022, according to research from the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School and EDF. That's a very small change during a time when solar and wind have ramped up sharply globally and costs have come down. Nearly all of the country's power — 95% — comes from burning fossil fuels. Much of that is from burning crude oil, a particularly polluting form of generation. One of Cuba's biggest trading partners, China, makes 80% of the world's solar panels, according to the energy data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, and they are inexpensive. China committed in March to building 92 solar farms on the island that are expected to add more than 2,000 megawatts of energy, and reports in June said China donated three solar parks expected to add 1,000 more. But that trade relationship has not yet led to a buildout that would at least keep the lights on during the day. The whole country had only 252 megawatts of solar power at the end of 2022. Kavulich said even China has its limits. The view of China's private sector, he said, is that Cuba 'seems to make no effort whatsoever to pay money that it owes.' 'The Cuban utility is the only buyer and it’s a risky investment,' said Whittle. European leaders tell him they 'just can’t in good faith encourage businesses in their countries to invest in Cuba.' Cuban officials acknowledged in recent days that more widespread solar power would have helped alleviate some of the misery from the recent outages. The minister of energy and head of the nation's electric utility encouraged Cubans to buy rooftop solar systems paired with batteries, instead of the gas and diesel generators purchased by Cubans who can afford them. 'We are thinking about' some regulations that would stimulate these solar purchases, the chief of the nation’s electric utility, Alfredo López, said. Cuba has struggled with frequent power outages for decades. Besides the U.S. economic embargo, officials have cited aging and insufficiently maintained power plants, increased demand for air conditioning and a lack of fuel for the lack of electricity. The nation relies on imported fuel to meet electric needs, including from oil-rich ally Venezuela, Mexico and Russia. This month’s crisis, which shut down institutions including schools, closed gas stations and left people cooking their food on wood stoves on the streets, began with one of the island’s major power plants failing. Human-driven climate change has contributed to extreme weather events that also regularly affect Cuba’s electrical grid. Desperation over the inability to carry out basic activities has sparked recent street protests. Whittle noted the country has no shortage of good climate scientists. Korey Silverman-Roati, senior fellow of carbon management and negative emissions at the Sabin Center, said the Cuban government is trying. 'There certainly has been a will and attempts to build out renewable energy infrastructure,' he said. 'It just hasn’t happened.' On the island, technicians are working to install 26 solar projects in different provinces, López told official media last week. Installations will ramp up fivefold over the next decade, said Lídice Vaillant, head of the Photovoltaic Research Laboratory at the University of Havana. Besides the strong sunlight, there is another way that Cuba is a good candidate for solar. A significant share of its electricity comes from smaller power plants distributed around the country. Solar could be added or switched out in those locations. But it hasn't happened yet. 'There is still sort of this, I think, this lingering belief at the highest levels of government that, you know, fossil fuels is really the best solution,' Whittle said. ___ Rodriguez reported from Havana, St. John from Detroit and Lobet from New York. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Efforts by Russia, Iran and China to sway US voters may escalate, new Microsoft report says	NEW YORK (AP) — Foreign adversaries have shown continued determination to influence the U.S. election –- and there are signs their activity will intensify as Election Day nears, Microsoft said in a report Wednesday. Russian operatives are doubling down on fake videos to smear Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, while Chinese-linked social media campaigns are maligning down-ballot candidates who are critical of China, the company’s threat intelligence arm said Wednesday. Meanwhile, Iranian actors who allegedly sent emails aimed at intimidating U.S. voters in 2020 have been surveying election-related websites and major media outlets, raising concerns they could be preparing for another scheme this year, the tech giant said. The report serves as a warning – building on others from U.S. intelligence officials – that as the nation enters this critical final stretch and begins counting ballots, the worst influence efforts may be yet to come. U.S. officials say they remain confident that election infrastructure is secure enough to withstand any attacks from American adversaries. Still, in a tight election, foreign efforts to influence voters are raising concern. Microsoft noted that some of the disinformation campaigns it tracks received little authentic engagement from U.S. audiences, but others have been amplified by unwitting Americans, exposing thousands to foreign propaganda in the final weeks of voting. Russia, China and Iran have all rejected claims that they are seeking to meddle with the U.S. election. 'The presidential elections are the United States’ domestic affairs. China has no intention and will not interfere in the US election,' the Chinese Embassy said in a statement. 'Having already unequivocally and repeatedly announced, Iran neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the U.S. election; and, it therefore categorically repudiates such accusations,' read a statement from Iran's mission to the United Nations. A message left with the Russian Embassy was not immediately returned on Wednesday. The report reveals an expanding landscape of coordinated campaigns to advance adversaries’ priorities as global wars and economic concerns raise the stakes for the U.S. election around the world. It details a trend also seen in the 2016 and 2020 elections of foreign actors covertly fomenting discord among American voters, furthering a divide in the electorate that has left the nation almost evenly split just 13 days before voting concludes. 'History has shown that the ability of foreign actors to rapidly distribute deceptive content can significantly impact public perception and electoral outcomes,' Clint Watts, general manager of the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, said in a news release. 'With a particular focus on the 48 hours before and after Election Day, voters, government institutions, candidates and parties must remain vigilant to deceptive and suspicious activity online.' The report adds to previous findings from Microsoft and U.S. intelligence that suggest the Kremlin is committed to lambasting Harris’ character online, a sign of its preference for another Donald Trump presidency. Russian actors have spent recent months churning out both AI-generated content and more rudimentary spoofs and staged videos spreading disinformation about Harris, Microsoft’s analysts found. Among the fake videos were a staged clip of a park ranger impersonator claiming Harris killed an endangered rhinoceros in Zambia, as well as a video sharing baseless allegations about her running mate Tim Walz, which U.S. intelligence officials also attributed to Russia this week. Morgan Finkelstein, national security spokeswoman for the Harris campaign, condemned Russia's efforts. Another Russian influence actor has been producing fake election-related videos spoofing American organizations from Fox News to the FBI and Wired magazine, according to the report. China over the last several months has focused on down-ballot races, and on general efforts to sow distrust and democratic dissatisfaction. A Chinese influence actor widely known as Spamouflage has been using fake social media users to attack down-ballot Republicans who have publicly denounced China, according to Microsoft’s analysts. Candidates targeted have included Rep. Barry Moore of Alabama, Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, all of whom are running for reelection, the report said. The group also has attacked Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. All four politicians sent emailed statements condemning China's aggression against American political candidates and its efforts to weaken democracy. In its statement, the Chinese embassy said U.S. officials, politicians and media 'have accused China of using news websites and social media accounts to spread so-called disinformation in the US. Such allegations are full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes.' Iran, which has spent the 2024 campaign going after Trump with disinformation as well as hacking into the former president’s campaign, hasn’t been stymied by ongoing tension in the Middle East, according to the Microsoft report. Quite the opposite, groups linked to Iran have weaponized divided opinions on the Israel-Hamas War to influence American voters, the analysts found. For example, an Iranian operated persona took to Telegram and X to call on Americans to sit out the elections due to the candidates’ support for Israel. Microsoft's report also said it observed an Iranian group compromising an account of a notable Republican politician who had a different account targeted in June. The company would not name the individual but said it was the same person who it had referenced in August as a 'former presidential candidate.' The report also warned that the same Iranian group that allegedly posed as members of the far-right Proud Boys in intimidating emails to voters in 2020 has been scouting swing-state election-related websites and media outlets in recent months. The behavior could 'suggest preparations for more direct influence operations as Election Day nears,' Watts said. Iran's mission to the United Nations said in a statement that the allegations in the report 'are fundamentally unfounded, and wholly inadmissible.' Even as Russia, China and Iran try to influence voters, intelligence officials said Tuesday there is still no indication they are plotting significant attacks on election infrastructure as a way to disrupt the outcome. If they tried, improvements to election security means there is no way they could alter the results, Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told The Associated Press earlier this month. Intelligence officials on Tuesday also warned that Russia and Iran may try to encourage violent protests in the U.S. after next month’s election, setting the stage for potential complications in the post-election period. ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

An attack on a Turkish defense company that kills 5 people is blamed on Kurdish militants	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Suspected Kurdish militants set off explosives and opened fire Wednesday at Turkey's state-run aerospace and defense company TUSAS, killing five people and wounding more than a dozen, the interior minister said. The two attackers — a man and a woman — also were killed, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. Yerlikaya said the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, is suspected of being behind the attack but cautioned that the process of identifying the assailants continued. Defense Minister Yasar Guler also pointed the finger at the PKK. 'We give these PKK scoundrels the punishment they deserve every time. But they never come to their senses,' Guler said. 'We will pursue them until the last terrorist is eliminated.' The Islamic State group and leftist extremists have also carried out past attacks in Turkey. 'I condemn this heinous terrorist attack,' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a BRICS meeting in Russia. Putin offered condolences. A U.S. Embassy statement said Washington 'strongly condemns today’s terrorist attack.' TUSAS designs, manufactures and assembles civilian and military aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles and other defense industry and space systems. Its UAVs have been instrumental in Turkey gaining an upper hand in its fight against Kurdish militants both on its own territory and across the border in Iraq. The attack occurred a day after the leader of Turkey’s far-right nationalist party that's allied with Erdogan raised the possibility that the PKK's imprisoned leader could be granted parole if he renounces violence and disbands his organization. Abdullah Ocalan's group has been fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people since the 1980s. It is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies. The country's pro-Kurdish political party, which also condemned the attack, noted that it had occurred at a time when the possibility of a dialogue to end the conflict had emerged. Turkish media said the assailants arrived Wednesday at an entry to the TUSAS complex in a taxi. The assailants, carrying assault weapons, detonated an explosive device next to the taxi, causing panic and allowing them to enter. The taxi driver was among the dead, according to HaberTurk television. Orhan Akdundar, a brother of one the TUSAS employees, was among relatives waiting outside the complex for news of their loved ones. 'I called my brother who was inside and said, ‘What happened?’ He said a bomb had exploded and said that gunshots continued for a very long time,' Akdundar said. 'There was a huge commotion. The gendarmerie, special forces and other security forces were all here. There were lots of ambulances. Then the phones shut off and I wasn’t able to establish communication.' An unidentified TUSAS employee shouted: 'We will work harder and produce more in defiance of the traitors' as he and other colleagues were being evacuated from the premises, according to a video aired by HaberTurk. Security camera images, aired on television, showed a man in plainclothes carrying a backpack and holding an assault rifle. The interior minister said security teams were dispatched as soon as the attack started at around 3:30 p.m. Multiple gunshots were heard after security forces entered the site, the DHA news agency and other media reported. Helicopters were seen flying above the premises. Authorities issued a temporary blackout on the coverage of the attack and went on to throttle access to social media websites. Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz said the target of the attack was Turkey's 'success in the defense industry.' The Iraqi embassy in Ankara issued a statement condemning the attack. It said the embassy 'affirms Iraq’s firm position in rejecting terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations, and expresses the solidarity of Iraq’s government and people, with the government and people of the Republic of Turkey.' Earlier this year, Iraq announced a ban on the PKK. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the United Nations 'stands in solidarity' with the people and government of Turkey, according to U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis also denounced the attack. 'Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to the families of the victims,' he said on X. ___ Associated Press writer Robert Badendieck in Hamburg, Germany, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-explosion-aerospace-company-413fbeb21e1fa86ea1ecd52a19079e67	2024-10-23T04:08:23-07:00	
An anti-whaling activist will stay in detention in Greenland	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A court in Greenland on Wednesday once again decided to extend the custody of anti-whaling campaigner Paul Watson till Nov. 13 while Denmark considers a Japanese extradition request. It was unclear when Denmark will decide whether or not to send him to Japan, which does not have an extradition treaty with the Scandinavian country. Watson, a 73-year-old Canadian-American citizen, is a former head of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Its direct action tactics, including high-seas confrontations with whaling vessels, have drawn support from A-list celebrities and were featured in the reality television series 'Whale Wars.' Watson was arrested on July 21 when his ship docked in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital and a Greenland court repeatedly has approved his detention while Danish authorities look into his possible extradition to Japan, where he faces up to 15 years in prison, according to the Captain Paul Watson Foundation. Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark and handles police and justice matters. Japan’s coast guard sought his arrest over an encounter with a Japanese whaling research ship in 2010. He was accused of obstructing the crew’s official duties by ordering the captain of his ship to throw explosives at the whaling ship. Prosecutor Mariam Khalil said that there still was a flight risk and an extension of the custody was needed, the Greenland newspaper Sermitsiaq said. Last week, Sea Shepherd France said Watson had asked France’s president for political asylum. It said a letter from Watson had been delivered to President Emmanuel Macron, who previously expressed his support for Watson and emphasized the importance of the case to environmental advocacy and human rights. Whale meat is an element of Japanese food culture, and the Japanese government says it supports the sustainable use of whales. Watson, who left Sea Shepherd in 2022, was also a leading member of Greenpeace, but left in 1977 amid disagreements over his aggressive tactics and set up the more action-oriented organization. The group has waged aggressive campaigns to protect whales, dolphins and other marine animals.	https://apnews.com/article/watson-greenland-japan-whaling-18d2ed38a37251919ced724c7c37ae6b	2024-10-23T03:04:34-07:00	
Fallout from 2023 Hamas attack lingers as Jews worldwide prepare for a holiday meant for joy	NEW YORK (AP) — Customarily, Simchat Torah is one of the most joyous days of the Jewish calendar, highlighted by exuberant dancing around a Torah. Jewish leaders say the joy will return during this week's celebrations, even as Jews recall that last year's Simchat Torah overlapped with Oct. 7, the day some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped in the Hamas attack on Israel. Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of Union for Reform Judaism, reflected on the inevitably that the celebrations coming on Wednesday and Thursday will include 'an overlay of pain and loss and mourning.' 'Do we dance again? Has enough time passed?' asked Jacobs, whose organization represents more than 800 Reform synagogues in North America. 'I’m of a mind that we must dance,' he said. 'There’s something defiant about dancing with the Torahs and not conceding Jewish life to those who hate us ... Jewish life cannot be put on pause.' Simchat Torah marks the conclusion of the annual cycle of public Torah readings, and the start of a new one. The highlight is the hakafot, during which participants march and dance around a Torah scroll. 'This holiday is characterized by utterly unbridled joy,' says the Hasidic organization Chabad-Lubavitch. 'There are times for mourning and times for celebration and joy, and this is one of those times of joy,' said Rabbi Motti Seligson, a Chabad spokesman. 'That's the way we celebrate the lives that are lost. It's the way we lean into who we are. We don't let others define who we are.' Reflections of a rabbi whose family was shattered by violence Among those sounding the call for joy was Rabbi Leo Dee, an educator living in the Israeli settlement of Efrat in the West Bank. His wife and two of his daughters were killed during Passover in April 2023 in an attack by Palestinian militants. Writing in The Jewish Chronicle, a London-based newspaper, Dee said rabbis worldwide were wondering how to celebrate Simchat Torah this year. 'On the one hand it is a festival, a day when it is forbidden to give eulogies and to mourn,' Dee wrote. 'On the other hand, it is the anniversary of the most tragic attack against humanity since the Holocaust. Can we dance again? Can we celebrate again? How should we respect the victims? His answer: 'Let’s make this Simchat Torah a day of true joy, a day of supporting Israel in the most tangible way possible, by promoting immigration to the most incredible country with the most impressive people and the brightest future.' In the U.S., some Jews commented on the element of sadness that will accompany some of the celebrations. 'The singing and dancing will never ever be the same as prior to October 7th, 2023. It will be tinged with a bit of sad reflection and daunting memory,' wrote Chaim Botwinick, a Florida-based executive coach and educational consultant, in a blog post contributed to The Times of Israel. 'But the one lesson that remains in my heart and soul forever is that we must never ever give up hope,' he added. 'We must continue to dance — even as we cry.' Should the children shout for joy as the grown-ups weep? Similar sentiments were expressed by Rabbi Avi Killip, executive vice president at the Hadar Institute, a Jewish education center in New York. 'There will be shouts of joy from our children as they dance and celebrate the sweetness of Torah, and there will be cries of sorrow from the elders who saw something that cannot ever be forgotten,' Killip wrote in an opinion piece for eJewish Philanthropy. 'But of course it won’t be that simple.' 'This first year, we can and probably should let our weeping overtake the sounds of the joy of the children. That is appropriate. This year we need to allow the tears to flow,' she wrote. 'In future years there will be more and more children who weren’t there, who didn’t see, and who I pray will someday bring an unbridled joy back to this holiday of Simchat Torah.' Rabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, said the commemorations in Orthodox synagogues affiliated with the union would be 'intimately Jewish. They will be just for us.' 'We will celebrate in a manner that will connect us deeply to the events and challenges of this past year, and to specifically celebrate the gift of Torah,' he said via email. 'Carrying our children on our shoulders and Torah scrolls in our arms, we will sing and dance in joyous celebration of the values that define us, reinforcing our national mission to do good, to be good, to study and live by God’s word, and to bring light to the world.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Hungary's Orbán claims the EU seeks to topple his government as his hostility toward it grows	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán claimed in a speech on Wednesday that the European Union seeks to topple his government and install a puppet regime in the Central European country, an escalation of open hostility toward the bloc by the member considered Russia's closest ally. Speaking before thousands of supporters in Budapest, Orbán was marking Hungary’s national holiday commemorating a 1956 armed uprising against Soviet repression that began in the capital and spread across the country before being crushed by the Red Army. Orbán has often used the holiday, which looms large in Hungarians' memory as a freedom fight against foreign domination, to draw parallels between past occupying forces like the Soviet Union and Ottoman Empire and the EU of today. 'Independent Hungarian politics are unacceptable to Brussels,' Orbán told the crowd, referring to the EU headquarters in Belgium. 'That is why they announced in Brussels that they will get rid of Hungary’s national government. They also announced that they wanted to hang a Brussels puppet government around the country’s neck.' Orbán gave no evidence to support his claims. There was no immediate public reaction from Brussels. 'Do we bow to foreign will, this time to the will of Brussels, or do we resist it?' Orbán continued. 'I propose that our answer be as clear and unambiguous as it was in 1956.' The EU has withheld billions in financial support from Hungary over its alleged breaches of rule of law, while some of the bloc’s lawmakers have repeatedly proposed stripping Hungary of its voting rights over democratic backsliding. The EU parliament declared in 2022 that Hungary can no longer be considered a democracy. Hungary's leader has clashed with the bloc especially over the war in Ukraine. Hungary has routinely blocked, delayed or watered down EU efforts to extend assistance to Ukraine and sanction Russia, and taken an adversarial posture toward Kyiv while growing closer to Moscow. Orbán has broken with other EU leaders by arguing for an immediate cease-fire and peace talks in Ukraine, leading critics to suggest that he is advocating for Russian interests and turning his back on his EU and NATO partners. 'The Brussels bureaucrats have led the West into a hopeless war,' said Orbán, who is widely seen as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in the EU. 'In their minds, dizzy with the hope of victory, this war is the war of the West against Russia ... Now they want to openly push the entire European Union into the war in Ukraine.' He claimed, without providing evidence, that the EU plans to allow Ukrainian soldiers to station in Hungary after a future victory 'to guarantee the security of the whole of Europe.' He added: 'We Hungarians would wake up one morning to find that Slavic soldiers from the east were again stationed on the territory of Hungary. We do not want that, but the pressure from Brussels is getting stronger every day.' Orbán's speech came at a particularly difficult time for his right-wing populist government, which has gone through a dip in support amid a sputtering economy, a series of scandals and the emergence of a popular new opposition challenger, Péter Magyar and his Tisza party. As polls show that Orbán’s Fidesz party is neck and neck with Tisza, and with national elections on the horizon in 2026, the prime minister was seeking to shore up support among his base. Opposition challenger Magyar and his party planned a commemoration march in Budapest later on Wednesday. Magyar has accused Orbán of dishonoring the memory of the some 3,000 Hungarians that died during the 1956 revolution.

Israeli strikes pound Lebanese coastal city after residents evacuate	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli jets struck multiple buildings in Lebanon's southern coastal city of Tyre on Wednesday, sending large clouds of black smoke into the air. The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli strike on the nearby town of Maarakeh killed three people. There were no reports of casualties in Tyre, where the Israeli military had issued evacuation warnings prior to the strikes. Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group meanwhile fired another barrage of rockets into Israel, including two that set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv before being intercepted. A cloud of smoke could be seen in the sky from the hotel where U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was staying on his latest visit to the region to try to renew cease-fire talks. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, drawing retaliatory airstrikes, after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. All-out war erupted in Lebanon last month, and Israeli strikes killed Hezbollah's top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of October. The Israeli military said Tuesday that one of its airstrikes in recent weeks killed Hashem Safieddine, a senior Hezbollah leader and cleric who was widely expected to succeed Nasrallah. Tyre, a provincial capital, had largely been spared in the Israel-Hezbollah war, but strikes in an around the city have intensified recently. The 2,500-year-old city, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Beirut, is known for its pristine beaches, ancient harbor and imposing Roman ruins and hippodrome, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is among Lebanon’s largest cities and a vibrant metropolis popular with tourists. The buildings struck on Wednesday were between several heritage sites, including the hippodrome and a cluster of seaside sites associated with the ancient Phoenicians and the Crusaders. The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings a couple hours prior for dozens of buildings in the heart of the city. It told residents to move north of the Awali River, dozens of kilometers (miles) to the north. Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesman, said on the platform X that there were Hezbollah assets in the area of the evacuation warning, without elaborating or providing evidence. The city is in southern Lebanon, where the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah has a strong presence, and its legislators are members of the group or its allies. But Tyre is also home to civilians with no ties to the group, including a sizable Christian community. First responders from Lebanon’s Civil Defense used loudspeakers to warn residents to evacuate the area and helped older adults and others who had difficulty leaving. Ali Safieddine, the head of the Civil Defense, told The Associated Press there were no casualties. Dr. Wissam Ghazal, a health official in Tyre, said the strikes hit six buildings, flattening four of them, around 2 1/2 hours after the evacuation warnings. People displaced by the strikes could be seen in parks and sitting on the sides of nearby roads. Over 2,500 people have been killed in Lebanon since the conflict began late last year, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Over a million people have fled their homes since September. On the Israeli side, attacks have killed around 60 people, half of them soldiers. Near-daily rocket barrages have emptied out communities across northern Israel, displacing some 60,000 people. In recent weeks Hezbollah has extended its range, launching scores of rockets every day and regularly targeting the northern Israeli city of Haifa. Most of the projectiles are intercepted or fall in open areas. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-lebanon-hezbollah-10-23-2024-31162ca16468bc22cf0696535ea3f3f8	2024-10-23T02:25:11-07:00	
Hong Kong discovers dinosaur fossils for the first time	HONG KONG (AP) — Officials in Hong Kong said Wednesday they have discovered dinosaur fossils in the city for the first time on a remote, uninhabited island that's part of a geopark. Experts have initially confirmed the fossils were part of a large dinosaur from the Cretaceous period, about 145 million to 66 million years ago, the government said in a statement. They will need to conduct further studies to confirm the species of the dinosaur. Experts speculate that the dinosaur was likely buried by sand and gravel after its death before it was later washed to the surface by a large flood, and subsequently buried again at the discovery site, it said. The government said the conservation department in March informed its Antiquities and Monuments Office about a sedimentary rock containing substances suspected to be vertebrate fossils. The rock was found on Port Island in the Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark in the city's northeastern waters. The government said it commissioned mainland Chinese experts to conduct field investigations. Port Island is closed to the public from Wednesday until further notice to facilitate future investigations and excavations. The fossils will be on display at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, one of the city's popular shopping districts, starting on Friday. The government is also planning to open a temporary workshop for the public to observe experts' preparation of fossil specimens by the end of 2024.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-dinosaur-fossil-first-time-49c18b71950542d2d82b95ae71c5dbb7	2024-10-23T02:13:20-07:00	
Britain and Germany sign defense pact to counter Russia's growing threat	LONDON (AP) — German submarine-hunting planes will patrol the North Atlantic from a base in Scotland under a new Britain-Germany defense pact sealed in response to the growing threat from Russia. Defense ministers from Britain and Germany signed the agreement in London on Wednesday in what officials call the first such defense pact between the two NATO member countries to boost European security amid rising Russian aggression. The deal comes as the war launched by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 grinds on, and with Ukraine and its European allies anxious about the outcome of November's U.S. presidential election. U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said the need for Europe to bolster its own security, and for the U.K. to play a bigger role in NATO, 'is the driving force behind our NATO-first U.K. defense strategy, (and) behind our reset of U.K. relations with Europe.' 'In a more dangerous world, allies are our strategic strength and we must do more together,' Healey said at a news conference in London alongside German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Under the deal, German submarine hunter aircraft are expected to operate 'periodically' from a Scottish military base to patrol the North Atlantic. The allies will work closer together to protect vital underwater cables in the North Sea. The two countries say they will also cooperate to prioritize developing long-range strike weapons that can travel farther than the U.K.'s existing Storm Shadow missiles. German defense giant Rheinmetall is also expected to open a factory producing artillery gun barrels using British steel. Officials say the pact will mean British and German forces committed to NATO in Estonia and Lithuania will exercise and operate together more closely, ensuring that 'land forces on NATO’s eastern flank remain a strong deterrent and are ready to fight and win if required.' Britain and Germany are also expected to collaborate on developing new land-based and aerial drones. 'We must not take security in Europe for granted,'' Pistorius said. 'Russia is waging war against Ukraine, it is increasing its weapons production immensely and has repeatedly launched hybrid attacks on our partners in eastern Europe. 'With the Trinity House Agreement, we are showing that the NATO allies have recognized what these times require and are determined to improve their deterrence and defense capabilities.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-germany-defense-pact-russia-nato-97d1ad3a8c60d1611581ddc942f4d302	2024-10-23T02:03:53-07:00	
US and Cyprus launch a strategic dialogue to bolster security	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — U.S. and Cypriot officials on Wednesday launched a strategic dialogue they said would bolster security and stability in a crisis-wracked region through initiatives including counterterrorism training of personnel from Middle Eastern countries and fighting sanctions evasion. 'It is a big moment in the relationship between our countries and to be part of this feels like being part of an historic occasion,' U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs James O’Brien said at a news conference. Cyprus’ clear policy shift toward deepening U.S. relations after decades of walking a tightrope between Washington and Moscow gained added steam after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. official pointed to a U.S.-funded center on the island nation under the acronym CYCLOPS that trains personnel from Cyprus and neighboring countries on maritime and cybersecurity as well as counterterrorism techniques. Cyprus' Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos said his government remains committed to a partnership between local law enforcement, the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI in combating illicit finance and the evasion of sanctions against Russia and other countries. The FBI is helping train Cypriot police in identifying and prosecuting cases of illegal financing and attempts to evade U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions imposed on any third country. 'It’s dealing with crises like we see from the instability in the region,' O’Brien said. 'It’s law enforcement cooperation on the sanctions enforcement and other cooperation so that we keep our people safe.' Kombos said the start of the dialogue affords Cyprus the opportunity to demonstrate that it's a credible strategic partner to the U.S. regarding humanitarian initiatives including the establishment earlier this year of a Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor for the shipborne delivery of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territory. Last month, Cyprus and the U.S. signed a defense cooperation framework agreement that outlines ways the two countries can enhance their response to regional humanitarian crises and security concerns.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-us-security-dialogue-bc23f9304fab58c425b4fddc44e45db4	2024-10-23T01:47:57-07:00	
A Brazilian artist uses ash and mud for a massive Sao Paulo mural lamenting climate disasters	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian artist Mundano on Wednesday is presenting a massive street mural in Sao Paulo that uses ash from wildfires and mud from floods to highlight extreme weather events wreaking devastation across the country — as well as their causes. Over 30 meters (98.4 feet) high and 48 meters (157.5 feet) wide, the mural depicts deforestation and severe drought in the Amazon rainforest with its parched brown earth and gray tree stumps. It features Indigenous activist Alessandra Korap wearing a crown of flowers and holding a sign that says: 'Stop the destruction #keepyourpromise.' It is a call to the Minnesota-based soy giant Cargill, according to Mundano. Soy farming is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation in the Amazon. Cargill says on its website that it will eliminate deforestation from its supply chain in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay by 2025. Mundano is seeking to hold them to account. 'We are tired of being a country, a continent where we and the natural resources we have here are exploited. ... We have to regenerate our planet instead of destroying it,' Mundano said in an interview on Tuesday. Cargill did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday morning. Over the past few months, uncontrolled human-caused wildfires have ravaged protected areas in the Amazon, the vast Cerrado savanna and the world’s largest tropical wetland area, the Pantanal. Those blazes have spread smoke over a vast expanse, choking residents of some cities. Drought has caused a critical situation nationwide, and forecasts indicate it will persist in much of the country through at least the rest of the month, according to a Sunday report from Cemaden, Brazil’s disaster warning center. Climate change — primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal — leads to frequent and more extreme alterations in weather patterns. The depth of the Amazon’s Negro River was 12.46 meters (41 feet) on Tuesday, a slight increase from 10 days earlier, when it registered its lowest level since measurements started 122 years ago. Tuesday’s depth was still around 6 meters (20 feet) less than usual for the same date in prior years, according to data from the Manaus port. Rivers in Brazil ’s Amazon always rise and fall with its rainy and dry seasons. But the dry season this year has been much worse than usual. Earlier this year, an unprecedented flood in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul killed more than 180 people, affected over 2 million people and destroyed urban communities. Mundano, who calls himself an 'artivist,' used mud from that flood collected by activist group Movement of People Affected by Dams in the mural, as well as ashes from the Amazon, the Atlantic Forest, the Pantanal and the Cerrado. He also used earth thrown away in dumpsters in Sao Paulo and clay collected from the Sawre Muybu Indigenous land in the Amazon, from where Korap hails. 'From floods to droughts, everything is connected!' Mundano said in an Instagram post on Tuesday, accompanied by a video showing the mural in Sao Paulo, which the artist said was his biggest ever. Three years ago, Mundano employed ash from the Amazon to create a similar mural in Sao Paulo. That work depicted a firefighter standing amid deforested areas and featured a cattle ranch as well as trucks loaded with logs. ___ Hughes reported from Rio de Janeiro.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-amazon-drought-mural-art-sao-paulo-9a0f30cc9fd703c96666ee364c284287	2024-10-23T00:32:01-07:00	
Financial cooperation and BRICS expansion are on the table as Putin hosts Global South leaders	KAZAN, Russia (AP) — Russia’s President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday hosted China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi and other world leaders at a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, part of the Kremlin's efforts to challenge Western global clout. Speaking at the start of Wednesday's BRICS meeting, Putin named the deepening of cooperation in the financial sector as part of its agenda. He said participants were also set to discuss a range of international issues including the settlement of regional conflicts, along with the expansion of the BRICS group of countries. 'BRICS strategy on the global arena conforms with the strivings of the main part of the global community, the so-called global majority,' Putin said. The alliance that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa has expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and several others have expressed interest in joining. The three-day summit in the city of Kazan was attended by 36 countries, highlighting the failure of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine. The Kremlin touted the summit as 'the largest foreign policy event ever held' by Russia. The Kremlin has cast BRICS as a counterbalance to the Western-dominated global order and redoubled its efforts to court the countries of the Global South after sending troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. Speaking at the summit, Putin also proposed creating a new BRICS investment platform, saying that it could 'become a powerful tool for supporting our economies, and would also provide financial resources to countries of the Global South and East.' The Russian leader and Xi had announced a 'no-limits' partnership weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. They already met twice earlier this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July. On Wednesday, Xi emphasized the bloc’s role in ensuring global security and emphasized the need to avoid an escalation of the Ukrainian conflict. China and Brazil have put forward a peace plan that Ukraine has rejected. Putin on Tuesday described the relations between Moscow and Beijing as 'one of the main stabilizing factors on the world arena.' He vowed to 'expand coordination on all multilateral forums for the sake of global stability and a fair world order.' Russia’s cooperation with India has also flourished as New Delhi sees Moscow as a time-tested partner since Cold War times despite Russia’s close ties with India’s main rival, China. Western allies want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the fighting in Ukraine, but Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. 'We support dialogue and diplomacy, not war,' Modi said during Wednesday's BRICS meeting in remarks carried by the Indian foreign ministry. Modi's visit to the summit marked his second trip to Russia in three months. 'As a diverse and inclusive platform, BRICS can play a positive role in all areas,' Modi said. Putin is also set to meet Thursday with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has repeatedly criticized Moscow's actions in Ukraine and is making his first visit to Russia in more than two years. Guterres's trip to Kazan has drawn an angry reaction from Kyiv. 'This is a wrong choice that does not advance the cause of peace,' Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said on X, adding that 'it only damages the U.N.’s reputation.' Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for Guterres, responded to the Ukrainian criticism by saying that the visit is 'a standard practice in attending meetings of organizations with large numbers of important member states, such as the G7 and the G20.' 'There’s a meeting with great importance for the work of the United Nations, with the BRICS countries representing about half the world’s population,' Haq said. Putin is expected to hold more than a dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-brics-summit-china-india-d672be9b1ec2ffd0fba608e8a6aca790	2024-10-23T00:10:32-07:00	
US defense chief Austin says there’s evidence North Korea has sent troops to Russia	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Wednesday there is evidence that North Korea has sent troops to Russia, as South Korea's spy chief told lawmakers that 3,000 North Korean troops are in the country receiving training on drones and other equipment before being deployed to battlefields in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Rome, Austin said 'What exactly they are doing? Left to be seen. These are things that we need to sort out,' according to a video posted by the Washington Post. If the troops join the war in Ukraine on Russia’s side, it will be 'a very, very serious issue,' Austin said, adding it would have an impact in Europe and in the Indo-Pacific region. South Korean intelligence first publicized reports that the Russian navy had taken 1,500 North Korean special warfare troops to Russia this month, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had earlier said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join the invading Russian forces. The U.S. and NATO had not previously formally confirmed North Korea’s reported troop dispatch, but have warned of the danger of such a development if true. Russia and North Korea have so far denied the troop movements. South Korean National Intelligence Service Director Cho Tae-yong told lawmakers Wednesday that another 1,500 North Korean troops have entered Russia, according to lawmaker Park Sunwon, who attended a closed-door briefing by Cho. Cho told lawmakers that his agency assessed that North Korea aims to deploy a total of 10,000 troops to Russia by December, Park told reporters. Park cited Cho as saying the 3,000 North Korean soldiers sent to Russia have been split among multiple military bases and are in training. Cho told lawmakers that NIS believes they have yet to be deployed in battle, according to Park. Speaking jointly with Park about the NIS briefing, lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun said that the NIS found that the Russian military is now teaching those North Korean soldiers how to use military equipment such as drones. Lee cited the NIS chief as saying Russian instructors have high opinions of the morale and physical strength of the North Korean soldiers but think they will eventually suffer a heavy causalities because they lack an understanding of modern warfare. Lee, citing Cho, said Russia is recruiting a large number of interpreters. Lee said NIS has detected signs that North Korea is relocating family members of soldiers chosen to be sent to Russia to special sites to isolate them. The NIS chief told lawmakers that North Korea hasn't disclosed its troop dispatch to its own people. But there are rumors that the news is spreading to local residents, including those whose loved ones have been assigned Russian tours, Lee said, citing the NIS. Ukraine’s Military Intelligence Directorate head, Kyrylo Budanov, told the online military news outlet The War Zone that North Korean troops will arrive to Russia's Kursk region today to help Russian troops fighting off a Ukrainian incursion. North Korea and Russia, embroiled in separate confrontations with the West, have been sharply boosting their cooperation in the past two years. In June, they signed a major defense deal requiring both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. The NIS said last week that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Reports that the North is sending troops to Russia stoked security jitters in South Korea. South Korean officials worry that Russia may reward North Korea by giving it sophisticated weapons technologies that could boost the North’s nuclear and missile programs that target South Korea. South Korea said Tuesday it would consider supplying weapons to Ukraine in response to the North's reported troop dispatch. South Korea has shipped humanitarian and financial support to Ukraine, but it has so far avoided directly supplying arms to Ukraine in line with its policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. North Korea has 1.2 million troops, one of the largest standing armies in the world, but it hasn’t fought in large-scale conflicts since the 1950-53 Korean War. Many experts question how much North Korean troops would help Russia, citing a shortage of battle experience. They say North Korea wants to get Russian economic support and its help to modernize the North's outdated conventional weapons systems as well as its high-tech weapons technology transfers. ___ Associated Press writer Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-troops-ukraine-b664f8c1164e9ef859b7a618ffa92140	2024-10-23T00:00:48-07:00	
Blinken urges Israel to seek enduring deal, as officials say a limited cease-fire has been discussed	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Israel needs to pursue an 'enduring strategic success' in Gaza after its tactical victories against Hamas, urging it to seek a deal that would end the war and bring back dozens of hostages. He spoke before traveling from Israel to Saudi Arabia on his 11th visit to the region since the war began. Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv shortly before his departure as Israel intercepted two projectiles fired from Lebanon — the latest in Israel's war with Hezbollah — and a puff of smoke could be seen in the sky from Blinken's hotel. 'Israel has achieved most of the strategic objectives when it comes to Gaza,' Blinken told reporters before boarding his plane. 'Now is the time to turn those successes into an enduring strategic success.' 'There really are two things left to do: Get the hostages home and bring the war to an end with an understanding of what will follow,' he said. Meanwhile, officials with the U.S., Israel and Egypt confirmed that a proposal for a limited cease-fire and hostage release has been discussed in recent days. No sign of a breakthrough after killing of Hamas leader The United States sees a new opportunity to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli forces in Gaza last week. But there’s no indication that the warring parties have modified their demands since talks stalled over the summer. There was also no immediate sign of a breakthrough after Blinken met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials on Tuesday. Israel blamed the failure of talks on Sinwar's hard-line stance, but Hamas says its demands for a lasting cease-fire, full Israeli withdrawal and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners have not changed. Hamas blamed the failure of the talks on Israel's demand for a lasting military presence in parts of Gaza. Talk of a more limited cease-fire and hostage release Egypt has suggested the possibility of a short pause in fighting in which Hamas would release a handful of hostages and humanitarian aid deliveries would be increased, especially in northern Gaza, an Egyptian official told The Associated Press. The official, who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Egypt and fellow mediator Qatar had discussed the idea with the United States but it was not yet a firm proposal. A senior State Department official confirmed that a proposal for a limited hostage release has been discussed in recent days but that no determination had been made, even after Blinken's meetings with Israeli officials and families of the hostages on Tuesday. An Israeli official said Israel's Security Cabinet had discussed an Egyptian initiative centered on a 12-day cease-fire and the release of six hostages. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. There was no immediate comment from Hamas, which has rejected such ideas in the past, saying it is intent on ending the war. It is still holding around 100 hostages captured in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is warned on aid during offensive in northern Gaza Israel has dramatically reduced the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza as it wages another major operation in the territory's hard-hit north. Blinken reiterated a warning that hindering humanitarian aid could force the U.S. to scale back the crucial military support it has provided to Israel since the war began. 'There’s progress made, which is good, but more progress needs to be made,' he told reporters, without elaborating. The U.N. humanitarian office says Israel has severely restricted aid operations since the start of its offensive in Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp in northern Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. It said one critical mission, to rescue around 40 people trapped in the rubble in Jabaliya, had been repeatedly denied since Friday. Northern Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel's ground operation and has been encircled by Israeli forces since late last year. Most of the population heeded Israeli evacuation warnings early in the war, but an estimated 400,000 people have stayed. The U.N. estimates that 60,000 people have been displaced within northern Gaza since the start of the operation in Jabaliya, the latest in a series of mass displacements. The north has been more heavily destroyed than other areas of Gaza, with entire neighborhoods obliterated. Israel has prevented Palestinians who fled the north from returning to their homes, a key demand from Hamas in the cease-fire talks. US urges Israel to distance itself from ‘Generals’ Plan' for Gaza The renewed offensive in the north has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel intends to implement a plan proposed by former generals in which civilians would be ordered to leave the north and anyone remaining would be starved out or killed. Far-right ministers in Netanyahu's Cabinet say Israel should remain in Gaza and re-establish Jewish settlements there. Blinken said the U.S. officials 'fully reject' any Israeli reoccupation of Gaza and that it was not the policy of the Israeli government. The State Department official said Blinken questioned Netanyahu and members of his government about the so-called Generals' Plan. The Israelis denied having such a plan and said the perception of it was damaging, the official said. The official said the Americans pressed the Israelis to publicly distance themselves from it. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250 when they stormed into southern Israel a year ago. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children. It has displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, forcing hundreds of thousands into squalid tent camps. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Fresh tension grips Bangladesh as student protesters demand president's resignation	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Political tension in Bangladesh grew Wednesday after a leading student group called for the country’s figurehead president to resign over his comments that appeared to call into question former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation in August. The interim government was expected to hold a Cabinet meeting to discuss the issue Thursday, while student protesters accused President Mohammed Shahabuddin of collaborating with Hasina’s 'fascist' regime. The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement set a two-day deadline for Shahabuddin to step down. Hundreds of protesters rallied in the capital, Dhaka, on Tuesday and into Wednesday while others attempted to storm the presidential palace. Police and witnesses said security officials used stun grenades to disperse people. Shahabuddin told a Bengali-language newspaper earlier this week that he had not seen Hasina’s resignation letter as she fled to India in August during a student-led uprising. An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took power and formed a government after Hasina stepped down on Aug. 5. Shahabuddin told the Manab Zamin daily that he only heard about Hasina’s resignation but had not seen the letter, saying he tried to collect it 'many times but failed.' He added: 'Maybe she did not have the time.' The statement infuriated the Yunus-led government and student activists. It contradicted Shahabuddin's address to the nation on Aug. 5, when he said he had received the letter. Under Bangladesh’s constitution, an elected prime minister must submit his or her resignation in writing to the president. Shahabuddin was appointed to the post by parliament after Hasina was elected prime minister for a fourth consecutive term in January. Shahabuddin dissolved parliament before the interim government took power on Aug. 8. Asif Nazrul, the country’s law adviser, recently accused Shahabuddin of spreading falsehoods and questioned if he was fit to remain in office. Experts said the resignation or removal of the president could create a constitutional vacuum. Under the constitution, only parliament can impeach the president. A senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which is led by Hasina's main rival and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, met with Yunus on Wednesday. 'If the associates of the fallen autocracy attempt to create any constitutional and political crisis, the pro-democracy and agitating political parties and different organizations will deal with it unitedly,' Nazrul Islam Khan, a standing committee member of the party, told reporters. Also on Wednesday, the Ministry of Home Affairs in a notice banned the Bangladesh Chhatra League, an influential student wing of Hasina’s Bangladesh Awami League party, with immediate effect, saying the government made the decision following the country’s Anti-Terrorism Act. The notice said the government has evidence that the 76-year-old student body has been involved in 'subversive' activities against the state since Hasina stepped down. It did not share the evidence. The decision came a day after the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement issued a seven-day ultimatum to the government to ban the group. Hasina is now in India, but the Yunus-led government has said it would seek her expatriation to try her for alleged crimes against humanity.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-president-resignation-muhammad-yunus-sheikh-hasina-b65b740b014f12aff2d7043650e6f7b2	2024-10-22T22:52:10-07:00	
Sensational mass trial shines a dark light on rape culture in France	AVIGNON, France (AP) — They are, on the face of it, the most ordinary of men. Yet they’re all on trial charged with rape. Fathers, grandfathers, husbands, workers and retirees — 50 in all — accused of taking turns on the drugged and inert body of Gisèle Pelicot while her husband recorded the horror for his swelling private video library. The harrowing and unprecedented trial in France is exposing how pornography, chatrooms and men’s disdain for or hazy understanding of consent is fueling rape culture. The horror isn’t simply that Dominique Pelicot, in his own words, arranged for men to rape his wife, it’s that he also had no difficulty finding dozens of them to take part. Among the nearly two dozen defendants who testified during the trial's first seven weeks was Ahmed T. — French defendants’ full last names are generally withheld until conviction. The married plumber with three kids and five grandchildren said he wasn’t particularly alarmed that Pelicot wasn't moving when he visited her and her now-ex-husband's house in the small Provence town of Mazan in 2019. It reminded him of porn he had watched featuring women who 'pretend to be asleep and don’t react,' he said. Like him, many other defendants told the court that they couldn’t have imagined that Dominique Pelicot was drugging his wife, and that they were told she was a willing participant acting out a kinky fantasy. Dominique Pelicot denied this, telling the court his co-defendants knew exactly what the situation was. Céline Piques, a spokesperson of the feminist group Osez le Féminisme!, or Dare Feminism! said she's convinced that many of the men on trial were inspired or perverted by porn, including videos found on popular websites. Although some sites have started cracking down on search terms such as 'unconscious,' hundreds of videos of men having sex with seemingly passed out women can be found online, she said. Piques was particularly struck by the testimony of a tech expert at the trial who had found the search terms 'asleep porn' on Dominique Pelicot's computer. Last year, French authorities registered 114,000 victims of sexual violence, including more than 25,000 reported rapes. But experts say most rapes go unreported due to a lack of tangible evidence: About 80% of women don’t press charges, and 80% of the ones who do see their case dropped before it is investigated. In stark contrast, the trial of Dominique Pelicot and his 50 co-defendants has been unique in its scope, nature and openness to the public at the victim’s insistence. After a store security guard caught Pelicot shooting video up unsuspecting women’s skirts in 2020, police searched his home and found thousands of pornographic photos and videos on his phone, laptop and USB stick. Dominique Pelicot later said he had recorded and stored the sexual encounters of each of his guests, and neatly organized them in separate files. Among those he had over was Mahdi D., who testified that when he left home on the night of Oct. 5, 2018, he didn’t intend to rape anyone. 'I thought she was asleep,' the 36-year-old transportation worker told the panel of five judges, referring to Gisèle Pelicot, who has attended nearly every day of the trial and has become a hero to many sexual abuse victims for insisting that it be public. 'I grant you that you did not leave with the intention of raping anyone,' the prosecutor told him. 'But there in the room, it was you.' Like a few of the other men accused of raping Pelicot between 2011 and 2020, Mahdi D. acknowledged almost all of the facts presented against him. And he expressed remorse, telling the judges, 'She is a victim. We can’t imagine what she went through. She was destroyed.' But he wouldn’t call it rape, even if admitting that it was might get him a lighter sentence. That led prosecutors to ask the court to screen the graphic videos of Mahdi D.'s visit to the Pelicot home. In June, authorities took down the chatroom where they say Dominique Pelicot and his co-defendants met. Since the trial started on Sept. 2, it has resonated far beyond the Avignon courtroom's walls, sparking protests in French cities big and small and inspiring a steady flow of opinion pieces and open letters penned by journalists, philosophers and activists. It has also drawn curious visitors to the city in southeastern France, such as Florence Nack, her husband and 23-year-old daughter, who made the trip from Switzerland to witness the 'historical trial.' Nack, who noted that she, too, was a victim of sexual violence, said she was disturbed by the testimony of 43-year-old trucker Cyprien C., a defendant who spoke that day in court. Asked by the head judge, Roger Arata, whether he recognized the facts, Cyprien C. answered that he 'did not contest the sexual act.' 'And the rape?' Arata pressed. The defendant stood silently before eventually responding, 'I can’t answer.' Arata then began to describe what was on the videos implicating him. They are only shown as a last resource and on a case-by-case basis. But for many in the courtroom, such detailed descriptions can last several minutes and be just as heavy as watching them. Gisèle Pelicot, who is in her early 70s, has chosen to remain in the courtroom while the videos are shown. Unable to watch, she usually closes her eyes, stares at the floor, or buries her face in her hands. Experts and groups working to combat sexual violence say the defendants’ unwillingness or inability to admit to rape speaks loudly to taboos and stereotypes that persist in French society. For Magali Lafourcade, a judge and general secretary of the National Consultative Commission of Human Rights who isn’t involved in the trial, popular culture has given people the wrong idea about what rapists look like and how they operate. 'It’s the idea of a hooded man with a knife whom you don’t know and is waiting for you in a place that is not a private place,' she said, noting that this 'is miles away from the sociological, criminological reality of rape.' Two-thirds of rapes take place at private homes, and in a vast majority of cases, victims know their rapists, Lafourcade said. It can be difficult at times to reconcile the facts with the personalities of the accused — described by loved ones as loving, generous and considerate companions, brothers and fathers. Cyril B.’s tearful older sister told the court: 'It’s my brother, I love him. He’s not a mean person.' His partner described him as 'kind, his heart on his sleeve and full of attention.' She insisted that he isn’t 'macho' and that he had never forced her to do anything sexually that she wasn’t comfortable with. Although Lafourcade does not believe 'all men are rapists,' as some have concluded the trial shows, she said that unlike the #MeToo accusations that have ensnared French celebrities, the Pelicot case 'makes us understand that in fact rapists could be everyone.' 'For once, they’re not monsters — they’re not serial killers on the margin of society. They are men who resemble those we love,' she said. 'In this sense, there is something revolutionary.'	https://apnews.com/article/france-pelicot-trial-rape-culture-b846c0258e90daed7989693ef308547c	2024-10-22T22:13:42-07:00	
Middle East latest: Sirens sound across Tel Aviv as projectiles are intercepted near Blinken's hotel	Air raid sirens echoed across Tel Aviv on Wednesday as United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to end a visit. Smoke, apparently from an intercepted projectile, could be seen in the sky above the hotel where Blinken was staying. Blinken urged Israel to use its recent tactical victories against Hamas to seek a war-ending deal and bring back dozens of hostages, before leaving Wednesday for Saudi Arabia as part of his 11th visit to the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Both sides appear to be dug in. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization postponed the third phase of a polio vaccine campaign in the besieged Gaza Strip, saying the current conditions made it 'impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination.' ___ Here's the latest: Blinken to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to meet Wednesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh as tensions in the region continue to intensify with no breakthrough on a ceasefire deal. The meeting is one of many Blinken will have with Arab officials in the next few days as the U.S. struggles to achieve some sort of progress just two weeks before the presidential election and in the final stretch of President Joe Biden’s administration. The two are expected to discuss the growing concerns over humanitarian aide for Gaza as well as a post-war plan for Palestinians. Multiple buildings in Lebanon hit i n coastal city hit in airstrike TYRE, Lebanon — Israeli jets struck multiple buildings in the coastal city of Tyre on Wednesday, sending large clouds of black smoke into the air. The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli strike on the nearby town of Maarakeh killed three people. There were no immediate reports of casualties in Tyre. Tyre, a provincial capital, had largely been spared in the Israel-Hezbollah war that erupted last month after nearly a year of escalating tensions, but strikes in and around the city have intensified recently. The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings a few hours prior for dozens of buildings in the heart of the coastal city. It told residents to move north of the Awali River, dozens of kilometers (miles) to the north. The buildings are surrounded by ancient historical sites and beach resorts. Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesman, said on the platform X that there were Hezbollah assets in the area of the evacuation warning, without elaborating or providing evidence. First responders from Lebanon’s Civil Defense used loudspeakers to warn residents to evacuate the area and helped older adults and others who had difficulty leaving. World Health Organization postpones third phase of polio vaccination campaign DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The World Health Organization on Wednesday said it and other aid agencies had to postpone the third phase of a polio vaccine campaign in the besieged Gaza Strip due to the ongoing war there. The WHO issued a statement saying the decision was made in concert with UNICEF, the United Nations' Palestinian aid agency UNRWA, Palestinian officials and others after the inoculations were to begin Wednesday. 'The current conditions, including ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure continue to jeopardize people’s safety and movement in northern Gaza, making it impossible for families to safely bring their children for vaccination, and health workers to operate,' a WHO statement said. It added: 'Given that the area currently approved for temporary humanitarian pauses was substantially reduced — now limited only to Gaza City, a significant decrease from the first round — many children in northern Gaza would have missed out on the polio vaccine dose.' The WHO said this phase of the vaccinations aimed to vaccinate over 119,000 children across northern Gaza. The campaign began in September after Gaza reported its first polio case in 25 years. Health officials have expressed alarm about disease outbreaks as uncollected garbage piles up and the bombing of critical infrastructure sends putrid water flowing through the streets. Polio is spread through fecal matter. Widespread hunger has left people even more vulnerable to illness. Germany's foreign minister calls for a diplomatic solution to fighting on her visit to Beirut BERLIN — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has called for a diplomatic solution to the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Baerbock, upon her arrival Wednesday in Beirut, said that 'we must now work with our partners in the USA, Europe and the Arab world to find a viable diplomatic solution that safeguards the legitimate security interests of both Israel and Lebanon.' The foreign minister warned that 'a complete destabilization of the country would be fatal for the most religiously diverse society of all states in the Middle East and also for the entire region.' She also asked all parties involved in the conflict to protect the United Nations peacekeeper troops stationed in the Israeli-Lebanese border region. Baerbock is on her 12th visit to the region since Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The 5 Nordic countries are ‘deeply concerned’ about legislation that would prevent UNRWA from operating COPENHAGEN, Denmark — The five Nordic countries said Wednesday that they are 'deeply concerned' by bills introduced to Israel's parliament that, if passed, would prevent the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees from operating in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza. In early October, an Israeli parliamentary committee approved two bills that would sever Israeli government ties with UNRWA, ban UNRWA activity on Israel territory and strip it of legal immunities. The bills passed preliminary approvals by a large margin but must pass several more readings before they become law. A joint letter signed by the foreign ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden said that if the U.N. body 'would no longer be able to exercise its core tasks' it could further destabilize the situation in the region, 'and may fundamentally jeopardize the prospects for a two-state solution.' In the letter, they 'strongly urge Israel to ensure continued and unhindered humanitarian access' to Palestinian refugees for UNRWA. Blinken urges Israel to end war as he leaves for Saudi Arabia TEL AVIV, Israel — Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Israel needs to pursue an 'enduring strategic success' after its recent tactical victories against Hamas, urging it to seek a deal to end the war and bring back dozens of hostages. He spoke to reporters Wednesday before traveling from Israel to Saudi Arabia on his 11th visit to the region since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered the war in Gaza. The United States hopes to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in an Israeli military operation in Gaza the previous week. But there’s no indication that either of the warring parties have modified their demands since the talks stalled over the summer. Hamas has said its demands have not changed following Sinwar’s death. Blinken, who met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials Tuesday, said he had pressed Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza and reiterated his warning that the failure to do so could lead to a reduction in U.S. military aid. 'There’s progress made, which is good, but more progress needs to be made,' on that front, he said. Sirens sound across Tel Aviv as projectiles are intercepted near Blinken's hotel TEL AVIV, Israel — Air raid sirens echoed across Tel Aviv on Wednesday as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to depart from his hotel to the airport. The Israeli military said it intercepted two projectiles fired from Lebanon. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Smoke, apparently from one of the interceptions, could be seen in the sky above the hotel where Blinken was staying. He is on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, hoping to renew cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-23-october-2024-7069fe55933f3be5ea43a0ef09fc6a0f	2024-10-22T21:54:42-07:00	
Villagers are wary of plans to dam a river to ensure Panama Canal's water supply	EL JOBO, Panama (AP) — A long, wooden boat puttered down the Indio River’s chocolate waters carrying Ana María Antonio and a colleague from the Panama Canal Authority on a mission to hear directly from villagers who could be affected by plans to dam the river. The canal forms the backbone of Panama’s economy, and the proposed dam would secure the water needed to ensure the canal’s uninterrupted operation at a time of increasingly erratic weather. It also would flood villages, where about 2,000 people would need to be relocated and where there is opposition to the plan, and curb the flow of the river to other communities downstream. Those living downstream know the mega-project will substantially alter the river, but they hope it will bring jobs, potable water, electricity and roads to their remote communities and not just leave them impoverished. 'We, as the Panama Canal, understand that many of these areas have been abandoned in terms of basic services,' Antonio said. The canal The Panama Canal was completed in 1914 and generates about a quarter of the government's budget. Last year, the canal authority reduced the number of ships that could cross daily by about 20% because rains hadn’t replenished the reservoirs used to operate the locks, which need about 50 million gallons of fresh water for each ship. It led to shipping delays, and in some cases companies looking for alternatives. By the time restrictions were lifted this month, demand had fallen. To avoid a repeat due to drought exacerbated by climate change, the plan to dam the Indio River was revived. It received a boost this summer with a ruling from Panama’s Supreme Court. For years, Panama has wanted to build another reservoir to supplement the main supply of water from Lake Gatun — a large manmade lake and part of the canal’s route — but a 2006 regulation prohibited the canal from expansion outside its traditional watershed. The Supreme Court’s decision allowed a re-interpretation of the boundaries. The Indio runs roughly parallel to the canal, through the isthmus. The new reservoir on the Indio would sit southwest of Lake Gatun and supplement the water from there and what comes from the much smaller Alhajuela Lake to the east. The Indio reservoir would allow an estimated 12 to 13 additional canal crossings each day. The reservoirs also provide water to the more than 2 million people — half the country’s population — living in the capital. The river Monkeys screeched in the thick jungle lining the Indio on an August morning. The boat weaved around submerged logs below concrete and rough timber houses high on the banks. Locals passed in other boats, the main means of transportation for the area. At the town of El Jobo, Antonio and her colleague carefully climbed the muddy incline from the river to a room belonging to the local Catholic parish, decorated with flowers and bunches of green bananas. Inside, residents from El Jobo and Guayabalito, two communities that won't be flooded, took their seats. The canal authority has held dozens of such outreach meetings in the watershed. The canal representatives hung posters with maps and photos showing the Indio’s watershed. They talked about the proposed project, the Supreme Court’s recent decision, a rough timeline. Antonio said that canal officials are talking to affected residents to figure out their needs, especially if they are from the 37 tiny villages where residents would have to be relocated. Canal authorities have said the Indio is not the only solution they’re considering, but just days earlier canal administrator Ricaurte Catín Vásquez said it would be the most efficient option, because it has been studied for at least 40 years. That’s nearly as long as Jeronima Figueroa, 60, has lived along the Indio in El Jobo. Besides being the area’s critical transportation link, the Indio provides water for drinking, washing clothes and watering their crops, she said. 'That river is our highway and our everything,' she said. The dam's effect on the river's flow was top of mind for the assembled residents, along with why the reservoir is needed, what would the water be used for, which communities would have to relocate, how property titles would be handled, would the construction pollute the river. Puria Nuñez of El Jobo summed up the fears: 'Our river isn’t going to be the same Indio River.' Progress Kenny Alexander Macero, a 21-year-old father who raises livestock in Guayabalito, said it was clear to him that the reservoir would make the canal a lot of money, but he wanted to see it spur real change for his family and others in the area. 'I’m not against the project, it’s going to generate a lot of work for people who need it, but you should be sincere in saying that ‘we’re going to bring projects to the communities that live in that area,’' he said. 'We want highways. Don’t try to fool us.' One complication was that while the canal authorities would be in charge of the reservoir project, the federal government would have to carry out the region's major development projects. And the feds weren’t in the room. The project is not a guarantee of other benefits. There are communities along Lake Gatun that don’t have potable water. Gilberto Toro, a community development consultant not involved in the canal project, said that the canal administration is actually more trusted by people than Panama’s federal government, because it hasn’t been enmeshed in as many scandals. 'Everybody knows that the canal projects come with a seal of guarantee,' Toro said. 'So a lot of people want to negotiate with the canal in some way because they know what they’re going to offer isn’t going to be trinkets.' Figueroa expressed similar faith in the canal administrators, but said that residents would need to monitor them closely to avoid being overlooked. 'We can’t keep living far behind like this,' she said. 'We don’t have electricity, water, healthcare and education.' Next steps President José Raúl Mulino has said a decision about the Indio River project would come next year. The canal administration ultimately will decide, but the project would require coordination with the federal government. No public vote is necessary, but the canal administrator has said they are looking to arrive at a public consensus. Opposition has emerged, not surprisingly, in communities that would be flooded. Among those is Limon, where the canal representatives parked their car and boarded a boat to El Jobo. It’s where the reservoir’s dam would be constructed. The highway only arrived there two years ago and the community still has many needs. Olegario Hernández has had a sign out in front of his home in Limon for the past year that says: 'No to the reservoirs.' The 86-year-old farmer was born there and raised his six children there. His children all left the area in search of opportunities, but Hernández wants to stay. 'We don’t need to leave,' Hernández said, but the canal administration 'wants to kick us out.'	https://apnews.com/article/panama-canal-indio-river-dam-villagers-6f10f8a297f93a93bc610efd4fc639ff	2024-10-22T20:04:05-07:00	
Asian stocks are mixed following a quiet day on Wall Street	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks were mixed on Wednesday under pressure from a rising U.S. dollar and the uncertainties over the U.S. election. U.S. futures and oil prices fell due to escalating geopolitical tensions after Israel announced that an airstrike outside Beirut earlier this month killed a Hezbollah official who had been expected to succeed the group’s longtime leader after he died in an Israeli strike last month. In Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3% to 38,300.81 as the dollar rose against the Japanese yen. Tokyo Metro Co.’s stock surged 43% during its trading debut on early Wednesday. The company raised 348.6 billion yen ($2.3 billion) in its initial public offering, making it Japan’s largest IPO since SoftBank Corp. went public in 2018. Chinese markets rose for a second day after the central bank cut its one-year and five-year Loan Prime Rates on Monday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.7% to 20,841.73, and the Shanghai Composite gained 0.8% to 3,311.87. State media have reported that a state-backed think tank has proposed issuing 2 trillion yuan ($281 billion) in special government bonds to create a market stabilization fund aiming to further ease the hidden debt pressures and inject confidence into the market. 'Yet, despite the bold proposal, there’s a sense that Beijing remains in reactionary mode, playing catch-up rather than getting ahead of the game,' Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a commentary. Elsewhere, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 was almost unchanged at 8,207.20. South Korea’s Kospi was 1.3% higher at 2,594.23. Taiwan's Taiex slipped 0.8%, while the Sensex in India gained 0.2%. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 edged down less than 0.1% to 5,851.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped less than 0.1% to 42,924.89. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.2% to 18,573.13. Stocks have slowed their record-breaking momentum this week under increasing pressure from rising Treasury yields in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.20%, where it was late Monday. That’s well above the 4.08% level it was at just on Friday. Higher yields for Treasurys can make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks, which critics say already look too expensive. Treasury yields have been climbing following a raft of reports showing the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. That’s good news for Wall Street, because it bolsters hopes that the economy can escape from the worst inflation in generations without the painful recession that many had worried was inevitable. 'What appears to be unfolding before our eyes is a soft-landing scenario only the most optimistic dream of,' according to Gregory Daco, EY chief economist. But it also is forcing traders on Wall Street to ratchet back expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. The central bank has made the drastic shift to lowering interest rates in hopes of keeping the economy strong, but a more resilient-than-expected economy wouldn’t need as much help. Traders are now largely expecting the Fed to cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point more through the end of the year, according to data from CME Group. A month ago, some of those same traders were betting on the federal funds rate ending the year as much as half a percentage point lower than that. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude shed 10 cents to $71.64 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 9 cents to $75.95 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 152.00 Japanese yen from 151.03 yen. The euro fell to $1.0802 from $1.0803. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-tokyo-yen-acd1c0b379dbe53978f2e3e6d05e588e	2024-10-22T19:45:07-07:00	
With or without the far right in power, Austria's links with Russia cause concern among allies	VIENNA (AP) — Tens of thousands of devastated Swifties trading friendship bracelets, wearing sparkly dresses and singing songs in the streets of Vienna. Workers taking down the Taylor Swift stage inside an empty stadium. This was the scene at the beginning of August in the Austrian capital after organizers abruptly canceled Swift’s three shows over threats of an attack by Islamic State group militants. Intelligence-sharing was instrumental in preventing a tragedy, Austrian and U.S. officials said. But it relies on mutual trust — confidence that secrets will not fall into the wrong hands or be leaked to hostile governments. Austria’s Western allies have grown increasingly worried about this possibility in recent weeks. The country’s political parties have maintained an openness to Russia for decades — part of a traditional foreign policy of neutrality — but none more so than the far-right Freedom Party, which secured the largest share of the vote in last month’s national elections. If the Freedom Party is part of Austria’s next government, some analysts warn that intelligence-sharing could be drastically restricted, if not stopped altogether. For now, the center-right People’s Party has a mandate to form a governing coalition. Negotiations will be held in the weeks and months ahead without the Freedom Party since the conservatives and all other parties have ruled out governing with the far right. But if those negotiations fail, the Freedom Party will be waiting in the wings. ____ This story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an ongoing Associated Press series covering threats to democracy in Europe. ____ Austrian and U.S. officials confirmed that intelligence-sharing was instrumental in preventing a tragedy. But that kind of exchange of information relies on mutual trust – confidence that secrets will not fall into the wrong hands or be leaked to hostile governments. In the case of the U.S. and most of the EU, those hostile governments include Russia. In February 2018, when Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl was interior minister, several foreign intelligence services cut Austria out from intelligence sharing as a result of a police raid that his ministry ordered on its own domestic intelligence agency. The raid, which was ruled illegal by an Austrian court in August 2018,shocked the country. It prompted a parliamentary inquiry and led to the agency being shut down. A Russian role? It is still unclear if or to what extent Russia could have pulled the strings. Beate Meinl-Reisinger, who heads the liberal Neos party in Austria, told a news conference in May that Kickl and the Freedom Party in 2018 either knowingly agreed to work for Russia’s interests or acted as 'useful idiots.' The parliamentary inquiry found that senior officials at the Ministry of Interior, at the time headed by Kickl, played an active role by using accusations against senior government and intelligence officials in an anonymous dossier to push prosecutors to sign off on the raid. Kickl has denied any wrongdoing. The accusations in the dossier, including corruption, the mishandling of sensitive data and sexual harassment, went up in smoke, but after four years of investigation, it’s still not clear who compiled and leaked the document. Austrian media report that investigators are pursuing whether Egisto Ott, a disgruntled former intelligence official suspected of spying for Russia, may have compiled the dossier in an effort to undermine the intelligence service, possibly because of his own frustrations with the agency. Green Party lawmaker David Stögmüller said that by pushing for the raid, the Freedom Party 'wanted to smash the domestic intelligence agency and create something new with faces close to their own party.' The party’s alleged attempts to reshape the domestic intelligence agency were only disrupted after its then-leader was forced to resign after being caught on video apparently offering public contracts in return for campaign donations The raid’s repercussions are still being felt. German lawmakers have said their government should review its cooperation with Austria if the Freedom Party is part of the new government. 'In light of the massive danger posed by Russia to peace and stability in Europe, we cannot allow relevant information to be handed over directly to Russia,' Konstantin Kuhle from the liberal FDP and a member of the intelligence oversight committee in the German parliament told German newspaper Handelsblatt earlier this month. 'Should the far-right Freedom Party become part of the next government and be given control over the intelligence agencies again, the trust of foreign intelligence services will certainly be up for debate again,' said Thomas Riegler, an espionage expert affiliated with the Austrian Center for Intelligence, Propaganda and Security Studies. Among the items seized in the illegal 2018 raid was a copy of the so-called Neptune Database — a hard drive containing sensitive information shared by foreign intelligence agencies with Austria. 'The mistrust foreign partners have of the Freedom Party is rooted in the party’s relationship with Russia,' Rieger said. The Freedom Party calls for an end to sanctions against Russia. It is critical of Western military aid to Ukraine, and signed a friendship agreement in 2016 with Putin’s United Russia Party that it now claims has expired. But the Freedom Party is not the only one to have enabled Russian influence. Mainstream parties have also played their part, at the risk of undermining Austrian and European security. This has a lot to do with Austria’s post-war history. Austria, which was annexed by Nazi Germany in the run-up to World War II, declared neutrality after the war under pressure from Western allies and the Soviet Union. It sought a role as a mediator between East and West, developing ties with Moscow that outlasted the Cold War. 'Austria’s neutrality, the many international organizations in Vienna, its geostrategic location and lenient espionage laws all have turned Austria into a hotbed for Russian and other espionage,' Riegler said. Espionage is only explicitly banned if directed against Austria itself, not if it targets other countries or international organizations. Since 2020, 11 Russian diplomats suspected of spying have been told to leave Austria. In contrast, Germany closed down four out of five Russian consulates last year. As of March 2024, Russia had 142 diplomats and 116 administrative and technical personnel accredited in Austria. Approximately 25% are likely spies, said an Austrian intelligence official, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic. The true number is likely higher: it may include diplomats’ relatives and employees of semi-official institutions such as schools, airlines offices or media organizations, the official added. 'The reluctance of the Austrian Foreign Ministry to expel more Russian diplomats is a scandal and poses a security risk for the country,' said Stephanie Krisper, whose NEOS party champions a tougher stance towards Russia. Austria’s foreign ministry says the number of Russian diplomats expelled is 'in the median of the European field.' In a written response to The Associated Press, Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said: 'My position is very clear: International law is the basis of my actions. As the first Austrian Foreign Minister ever, I have not shied away from taking appropriate measures and expelled diplomats whenever it is brought to my attention that they have engaged in acts incompatible with their diplomatic status.' But in its 2023 annual report, Austria’s domestic intelligence agency DSN emphasized the danger of Russian and other espionage. Radar and satellite installations on the roofs of Russian diplomatic representations in Vienna are used for gathering intelligence on European NATO states, it said, thereby leading to a 'loss of reputation' for Austria. 'Austria lets espionage happen on its soil that is directed against the security interests and values of European and other partner states,' said a senior European diplomat who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic. Given the historical connections between Austria and Russia, the situation is unlikely to change much, no matter who is in the next government, the diplomat said.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-democracy-freedom-party-russia-kickl-espionage-a8e5e67808ad691d09e03fba10bacc4d	2024-10-22T19:05:31-07:00	
How a nearly extinct crocodile species returned from the brink in Cambodia	PHNOM TAMAO, Cambodia (AP) — A tiny snout poked out to widen the crack of the slowly shattering eggshell. The Siamese crocodile was taking its time, lagging others that had already wriggled out, chirping, into the sand. Adults can be up to 4 meters (13 feet) long and weigh up to 350 kilogram (770 pounds). They have few natural predators. But these hatchlings — each roughly the size of a New York hotdog — are vulnerable and their chorus of shrill calls was a signal for mothers to protect them and for stragglers to catch up. Hor Vichet, a zookeeper at the nonprofit Fauna and Flora's breeding center for the critically endangered reptiles in Cambodia’s Phnom Tamao, broke the rest of the shell. 'It's time to go into the world,' he said. Siamese crocodiles are making an unlikely comeback. Once widespread across Southeast Asia, demand for leather made from their skins decimated wild populations in the last century. Thousands were hunted or captured for breeding at farms. By the late nineties, they were thought to be extinct. But a 2000 survey in the Cardamom Mountains in western Cambodia found a vestige of a wild population. These misty rainforests were among the last strongholds of Khmer Rouge guerrillas who fought the government until 1999. That, combined with the reverence of local Indigenous communities saved this lingering enclave of crocodiles. But they were still too few and too scattered to recover the population. Conservationists realized that saving the species would require captive breeding of purebred, fertile crocodiles. The crocodile farmers who had nearly hunted the species to extinction now play a vital role in that effort. Today there are about 1,000 Siamese crocodiles in the wild, roughly 400 in Cambodia and the rest scattered in Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Indonesia. Protecting the reptile also requires safeguarding its habitat in the Cardamom Mountains -– a diverse ecosystem that is one of the last surviving rainforests in Southeast Asia. It stretches over an area larger than Denmark, helping to trap earth-warming greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The efforts are finally paying off: The first crocodiles were reintroduced into the wild in 2012 and they have begun breeding in the wild: over a hundred eggs were discovered in the forests in July, the most so far. 'We are still far from being able to say the species is in a good place,' admitted Pablo Sinovas of Fauna and Flora. 'But it is making progress.' The conservationists faced big challenges when they began their project in 2011. There were over 1.5 million crocodiles languishing in farms across Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, but few were purebreds. Farmers had bred Siamese crocodiles with larger, more aggressive species to get skins with textures demanded by fashion brands. Releasing those hybrids into the wild might hasten the disappearance of the purebred species. It also could pose a threat to people. Evidence of Cambodian reverence for Siamese crocodiles lives on in toothy carvings on the walls of the Bayon temple in the country’s Angkor Wat temple complex, but the hybrids are not the same animals. 'That would be a problem since some of these species are aggressive to humans. And you don’t want them in the wild,' he said. So the experts scoured through crocodile farms across Cambodia, working with farmers and scientists to find purebreds. The few that were eventually identified were brought to the wildlife center at Phnom Tamao to breed in captivity. Their eggs were were incubated artificially and the first group of 18 purebred young crocodiles was released in the Cardamom Mountains, laying the foundation for resurrecting the species. Crocodiles are social species and once together, they 'find their own hierarchy,' said Iri Gill, who manages cold-blooded animals at the Chester Zoo in the U.K., which supports the breeding program. After the breeding season, females lay eggs which are then kept in an artificial incubator where humidity and temperatures are monitored carefully to replicate the conditions of a nest in the wild. 'That is the key stage to hatch those juveniles out and raise them to a strong age before their release,' said Gill. A similar captive breeding program was also instrumental in bringing back crocodile populations in India, after they were nearly wiped out by the early 1970s, said Yashendu Joshi, a crocodile researcher at the Indian nonprofit Centre for Wildlife Studies. In the wild, fewer than 1 in 20 crocodile hatchlings make it to adulthood. Their chances of survival increase exponentially if they're released after they grow to a meter (3.4 feet) long. 'That’s why these captive breeding programs have been working across the world,' he said. Today, demand for crocodile leather has diminished and many of the farms had been losing money since the pandemic, said crocodile farmer Ry Lean. Dozens of large crocodiles bask in pens around the home where the 73-year-old lives with her extended family. Her shop sells souvenirs like crocodile skulls stacked in shelves like books, glass cases overflowing with canines, mounds of crocodile jerky and lacquered bodies of baby crocodiles drying in the sun. But tourism has dwindled since the pandemic and rising fish prices make it harder to feed the reptiles, Lean said. 'I am stuck with this business and the crocodiles,' she said, adding that a large crocodile used to fetch up to $1,500. Now she’d be lucky to get $150. Conservationists still scout the farms searching for purebred Siamese crocodiles. They are also working to protect the habitats where the purebred juveniles are released. In 2001-23, Cambodia lost nearly a third of its tree cover, according to Global Forest Watch — a platform run by the non-profit World Resources Institute. The Siamese crocodile’s role as a flagship species — chosen to represent an environmental cause similar to giant pandas in China and tigers in India — helps the cause of protecting the Cardamom Mountains, said Sinovas of Fauna and Flora. It makes no sense to release crocodiles into habitats that cannot support them, he said. 'Protecting habitat is the most important part of this whole project,' he said. ___ Associated Press journalist Sopheng Cheang contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Tropical storm swamps Philippine provinces in widespread flooding and trap people, some on roofs	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Torrential rain set off by an approaching tropical storm swamped eastern Philippine cities and towns overnight in widespread flooding that trapped people, some on their roofs, and sparked frantic appeals for rescue boats and trucks, officials said Wednesday. The government shut down public schools and government offices, except those urgently needed for disaster response, on the entire main island of Luzon to protect millions of people as Tropical Storm Trami blew closer from the Pacific. The storm was about 310 kilometers (193 miles) east of Baler in the northeastern province of Aurora with sustained winds of 85 kilometers (53 miles) per hour and gusts to 105 kph (65 mph). It was forecast to hit Aurora’s coast Wednesday night. Thousands of villagers have evacuated to emergency shelters in northeastern provinces, and storm warnings were raised in more than two dozen northern and central provinces, including in the densely populated capital of Manila. No fatalities or major injuries have been reported. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. cancelled all his appointments Wednesday 'to focus on coordinating the government’s comprehensive search and rescue and relief efforts' and would convene an emergency meeting at military headquarters to discuss disaster-mitigation efforts, Communications Secretary Cesar Chavez said. 'People have been stuck on roofs of their houses for several hours now,' former Vice President Leni Robredo, who lives in the northeastern city of Naga, said in a post on Facebook early Wednesday. 'Many of our rescue trucks have stalled due to the floods.' Robredo expressed hopes the flooding would ease at low tide Wednesday morning. Coast guard personnel have been rescuing residents in flooded villages in the eastern provinces of Sorsogon, Albay, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes and outlying regions since Tuesday, but provincial authorities said the number of rescue boats and personnel was not enough. Thousands of passengers and cargo workers were stranded in several seaports after the coast guard said it suspended inter-island ferry services and barred fishing boats from venturing into the increasingly rough seas. 'We need national intervention,' Rep. Luis Raymund Villafuerte of Camarines Sur province told DZRH radio network, saying his flood-prone province has about 50 rescue boats but needs about 200 due to the widespread appeals from villagers to be rescued. Thousands of villagers were evacuated from low-lying communities and landslide-prone areas starting two days ago in Camarines Sur but many more were asking for help. 'Last night, my phone was filled with nonstop calls and text messages from people pleading 'Help us, rescue us,’' Villafuerte said. 'It’s sad when you feel helpless because of this deluge of problems.' In nearby Quezon province, Governor Angelina Tan said floods in some areas reach up to 3 meters (nearly 10 feet) and at least 8,000 villagers have evacuated from low-lying communities. About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago also lies in the 'Pacific Ring of Fire,' a region along most of the Pacific Ocean rim where many volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur, making the Southeast Asian nation one of the world’s most disaster-prone. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones in the world, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-tropical-storm-trami-floods-5a5d3261a0646aa2c233cc63b27e46c4	2024-10-22T16:56:40-07:00

Canadian Cabinet voices support for Trudeau as some Liberals prepare to confront him	TORONTO (AP) — Canada's deputy prime minister said she believes Justin Trudeau has the support of a majority of Liberals in Parliament as some prepare to confront him Wednesday in the hopes of convincing him to step down. Chrystia Freeland and other Cabinet members voiced support for the prime minister on Tuesday ahead of a broader meeting with colleagues. A number of Liberals have signed a letter hoping to persuade Trudeau to step down before the next election. It was unclear how many signed. 'The vast majority of Liberal Members of Parliament support the prime minister, support him as leader of our government, support him as leader of our party and support him as the guy who is going to lead us into the next election,' Freeland said. Freeland said she is more confident of that after meetings in the last 36 hours. The Liberal recently suffered upsets in special elections in districts the party has held for years, raising doubts about Trudeau’s leadership. Losing a district in Canada’s largest city of Toronto, a traditional Liberal stronghold, does not bode well. A number of Liberal lawmakers have said they will not run again. Trudeau has said he will lead the party into the election, which come any time between this fall and October, 2025. His Liberal party must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament as the Liberals do not have the majority in the House of Commons. The opposition leader of the Bloc Québécois said his party will work with the Conservatives and NDP parties to bring the Liberals down and force an election if the government doesn't boost old age security payments for seniors. 'The whole story is now: what will Justin Trudeau, superstar, do in the coming days,' Bloc Leader Yves-François Blanchet said. Trudeau's Liberals have been in power since 2015 but Canadians have been frustrated by the cost of living coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trudeau reasserted the country’s liberal identity in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative rule. His legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change. 'Anybody who has ever bet against Justin Trudeau is sorry they made that bet the next day,' said Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault. Some Cabinet ministers acknowledged some colleagues don't agree. 'Any time there are voices of dissent we have to deal with them, we have to listen to them carefully,' Labor Minister Stephen MacKinnon said. 'We have to deal with them and present a unified face to Canadians.' Opposition Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre goaded the prime minister about the potential revolt. 'The reality is he can’t administer the government because he’s too busy fighting for his job after nine years,' Poilievre said. Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, said the shelf life of Canadian prime ministers has been about a decade for the past 75 years. 'Trudeau’s time is up. Scandals over the years have tarnished his image. He deflects or evades rather than answering straight-forward questions. There is a popular appetite for change. Most Canadians have tuned him out,' he said. 'He is the reason why the Liberals went from the wilderness to power in 2015, but it is no longer 2015.' Trudeau’s father, Pierre Trudeau, swept to power in 1968 on a wave of 'Trudeaumania' and led Canada for almost 16 years.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-cabinet-liberal-leadership-election-e7a8fc0be9647d887154c4e748aaf8e9	2024-10-22T13:09:39-07:00	
Desperation amid search for survivors of an airstrike on a crowded area near major Beirut hospital	BEIRUT (AP) — Nearly 16 hours after an Israeli airstrike hit across the street from Beirut’s main public hospital, rescuers were still removing debris Tuesday from the overcrowded slum area. An excavator was digging at one of the destroyed buildings, picking out twisted metal and bricks in search for bodies. Residents standing on mounds of debris said an entire family remained missing under the rubble. Mohammad Ibrahim, a Sudanese national, came looking for his brother. 'His mobile phone is still ringing. We are trying to search for him,' he said. 'I don’t know if he is dead or alive.' Hours later, health officials said five bodies had been recovered from under the rubble. At least 18 people were killed, including four children, and at least 60 wounded in the strike that also caused damage across the street at the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the capital’s main public medical facility. Jihad Saadeh, director of the Rafik Hariri Hospital, said the strike broke several glass windows and the solar panels of the medical facility, which continued to operate despite the damage and the panic. None of the staff was injured. Saadeh said the hospital received no warning of the impending strike, just a few meters (yards) across the street. Neither did the residents of the slum area, where several buildings were crammed and which houses several migrant workers as well as working class Lebanese. The Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah target, without elaborating. It added had not targeted the hospital itself. It was hard for rescue equipment to reach the area of clustered settlements and dusty narrow roads. Nizar, one of the rescuers, said he had been at the site of the explosion since Monday night. 'It was too dark and there was so much panic,' he said, giving only his first name in line with the rescue team’s regulations. 'People didn’t understand yet what had happened.' The overcrowded slum was covered in debris, furniture and remains of life poking out of the twisted metal and broken bricks. Residents who survived the massive explosion were still in shock, some still searching through the debris with their hands for their relatives or what is left of their lives. Gunmen stood guard at the site. The Lebanese Civil Defense said Tuesday five buildings were destroyed and 12 sustained severe damage. The dead included one Sudanese and at least one Syrian. 'This is a very crowded area; buildings are very close. The destruction is massive,' Nizar said, explaining that the scale of the damage made their rescue effort harder. Across the street, the hospital was still treating a few of the injured. The morgue had received 13 bodies. Hussein al-Ali, a nurse who was there when the attack happened, said it took him a few minutes to realize it was not the hospital that was hit. Dust and smoke covered the hospital lobby. The glass in the dialysis unit, the pharmacy and other rooms in the hospital was shattered. The false roof fell over his and his colleagues' heads. 'We were terrified. This is a crime,' said al-Ali. 'It felt like judgement day.' It took only minutes for the injured from across the street to start streaming in. Al-Ali said he had little time to breathe or reassure his terrified colleagues and the rattled patients. 'Staff and patients thought the strike was here. We fled outside as the injured were coming in,' he said. And when he was done admitting the injured, 'we came out to carry our (killed) neighbors. They are our neighbors.' Ola Eid survived the strike. She helped dig out her neighbors’ children from under the rubble, before realizing she herself was injured. 'The problem is we didn’t feel it. They didn’t inform us. We heard they want to strike al-Sahel hospital,' said Eid, bandaged and still in shock sitting at the hospital gate. Israel had hinted another hospital miles away could possibly be a target, alleging it is housing tunnels used by the Hezbollah militant group. Eid, an actress, said she was playing with her neighbor’s kids when the first explosion hit. It knocked her to the floor and scattered the candy she was handing out to the kids. She stood up, not believing she was still alive, to find her neighbor’s kid soaked in blood. One was killed immediately; the other remained in intensive care. 'I looked ahead and saw the kids torn apart and hurt,' she said. 'The gas canisters were on fire. I didn’t know what to do — put out the fire or remove the kids.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-strike-hospital-israel-rescue-survivors-rubble-da09186fc06d734e0457e6c099f3d992	2024-10-22T10:07:23-07:00	
Mexico announces food and agriculture plan that could take the country back to the 1980s	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s new president announced a new agriculture plan Tuesday that could make the country’s food production and distribution look a lot more like it did in the 1980s, when meals in Mexico were dominated by tortillas, beans, instant coffee and cheap hot chocolate. Four decades ago, the ingredients for those meals were often bought at government stores that stocked a few basic goods. President Claudia Sheinbaum pledged Tuesday to revive those often shabby, limited government stores and continue efforts to achieve 'food sovereignty.' 'It is about producing what we eat,' Sheinbaum said of her policy, whose main focus will be on increasing bean and corn production. Sheinbaum appears to have a deep interest in boosting beans. On Monday, she said, 'It is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips.' Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué said the focus would be on guaranteeing prices for farmers who grow corn used for tortillas and lowering tortilla prices by 10%, after prices jumped a couple of years ago. The government aims to boost bean production by about 30% in six years to replace imports of beans, and will set up research centers to supply higher-yielding bean seeds. 'Self-sufficiency in beans is a goal the president has set for us,' Berdegué said. The government will also focus on supporting coffee production, but mainly for instant coffee, which it claims is used by 84% of Mexican households. The plan will also seek to support cocoa production, but mainly for powdered baking and hot chocolate, not fine chocolate bars. The policies appear to run counter to market trends and what Mexican food sales look like today, when consumption of most of the old basics has fallen. Most Mexicans today shop at modern grocery stores, and consumption of fresh ground coffee, not instant, has increased enormously, accompanied by a boom in specialized coffee chains and shops. Meanwhile, bean consumption has been dropping precipitously for decades in Mexico. According to the government's '2024 Agricultural Panorama' report, Mexicans consume only about 17 pounds (7.7 kilograms) of beans annually. That's less than half of the 35.2 pounds (16 kilograms) consumed per year in 1980. A combination of factors, including the time it takes to cook dried beans, may be behind this. Amanda Gálvez, a researcher at Mexico's National Autonomous University, wrote that 'we look down at beans because it is considered ‘the food of the poor,’ and we are making a serious mistake,' because beans are a good source of protein. However, the health benefits aren't clear: The most common bean recipe in Mexico — refried beans — often contains a considerable dose of lard. Tortilla consumption has also fallen from nearly 220 pounds (100 kilograms) per capita annually in 2000 to about 165 pounds (75 kilograms) in 2024. Consumers have increasingly taken to buying bread and other bakery products instead of tortillas. Apart from the challenge of trying to change consumer habits, the policy also runs counter to market trends. While some countries are trying to encourage high-value varietal and specialized chocolate strains, Mexico is focusing on the cheapest products. While chocolate was first exported to the rest of the world from Mexico, Mexico's own production has fallen dramatically because of plant diseases and a lack of investment. It dropped from almost 50,000 tons in 2003 to about 28,000 tons in 2022. And while most Mexican homes may have a jar of instant coffee in their cupboards, that's not where the tendency — or consumer spending — is headed. According to a Technavio industry report, instant products accounted for only about 37% of the sales value of coffee in Mexico. Sheinbaum's focus on self-sufficiency in oil, energy and foodstuffs is a holdover from her predecessor and political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30. López Obrador also appears to have passed on his nostalgia for a 1970s-style Mexico — including passenger rail service, state-owned industries, tight-knit families and small corner stores — to Sheinbaum.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-food-agriculture-plan-beans-nostalgia-1e3bd9d5e1af9e57376d2509e90d1260	2024-10-22T10:00:28-07:00	
Cuba fights to come back from a nationwide blackout, then a storm that killed six	HAVANA (AP) — A small town in far eastern Cuba was recovering Tuesday from flooding that killed at least six people after Oscar crossed the island’s eastern coast as a tropical storm with winds and heavy rain. Cuba's capital was partially illuminated after a large-scale blackout generated a handful of protests and a stern government warning that any unrest would be punished. President Miguel Díaz-Canel said on state television that rescue and recovery work continued in the town of San Antonio del Sur and officials hadn't yet entered some flooded areas. People in Havana collected subsidized food Tuesday and said the country faced an intensive recovery period. 'There are lines everywhere you go,' city resident Carlos López said. 'You get to a place and there are obstacles and obstacles.' Tropical Storm Oscar disintegrated as it headed toward the Bahamas after making landfall in Cuba as a Category 1 hurricane. The remnants were expected to drop up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain across the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Modesto Hernández, who lived in central Havana, said Tuesday that 'we don’t know anything about what is going on.' 'These problems need to be solved now,' he said. 'We are in bad shape.' Díaz-Canel warned on national television Sunday that 'we're not going to allow any vandalism, or let anyone disturb people's tranquility.' The prolonged nationwide blackout that followed a massive outage Thursday night was part of countrywide energy problems that led to the largest protests in Cuba in almost 30 years, in July 2021. Those were followed by smaller local protests in October 2022 and March 2024. All are part of a deep economic crisis that has prompted the exodus of more than half a million Cubans to the U.S., with thousands more heading to Europe. The Cuban government and its allies blame the United States' 62-year-old trade embargo on the island for its economic problems but White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that the Cuban government’s 'long-term mismanagement of its economic policy and resources has certainly increased the hardship of people in Cuba.' Power remains relatively cheap but increasingly unavailable. The Cuban government on state television Monday night said that it’s producing 1300 megawatts when peak demand can hit 3 gigawatts. Authorities said by Monday afternoon that about 80 percent of Havana had intermittent power but people remained fearful. Energy Minister Vicente de la O Levy said in a news conference he hoped that more reliable electricity would be restored by Tuesday morning but classes remained closed through at least Thursday. He said that Oscar would bring 'an additional inconvenience' to Cuba's recovery since it would affect key Cuban power plants, such as Felton in the city of Holguín, and Renté in Santiago de Cuba. Many of Havana's 2 million people resorted to cooking with improvised wood stoves on the streets before their food went bad in refrigerators. People lined up to buy subsidized food and few gas stations were open. The failure of the Antonio Guiteras plant on Friday was the latest problem with energy distribution in a country where electricity has been restricted and rotated among different regions at different times. The blackout was considered to be Cuba’s worst since Hurricane Ian hit the island as a Category 3 storm in 2022 and damaged power installations. It took days for the government to fix them. Local authorities initially said the outage stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residential air conditioners. Later, the blackout got worse because of breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained, and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/oscar-cuba-storm-caribbean-8c07aa1fe2b2b46dc9465a83acbaa745	2024-10-22T09:24:44-07:00	
The little airline that could — Lebanon's national carrier braves Israeli airstrikes	BEIRUT (AP) — Since Israel began bombarding Beirut's southern suburbs as part of its offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, Lebanon's national air carrier has become a local icon simply by continuing to do its job. Middle East Airlines is the only commercial airline still operating out of the Beirut airport, located on the coast next to the densely-populated suburbs where many of Hezbollah's operations are based. Unlike the bruising monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, in which an Israeli strike almost immediately took Lebanon's only commercial airport out of commission, it has not been targeted in the current conflict. Capt. Mohammed Aziz, adviser to MEA chairman Mohamad El-Hout, said the airline has received assurances that Israel won't target its planes or the airport as long as they are used solely for civilian purposes. The carrier conducts a risk assessment each day to determine if it's safe to fly, he said. 'As long as you see us operating, it means our threat assessment says that we can operate,' Aziz said. 'We will never jeopardize the life of anyone.' Still, the sight of jetliners rising and descending as fire and clouds of smoke blacken the Beirut skyline can be alarming. Some of the most dramatic images making the rounds on social media depicting jets landing in fiery hellscapes have been AI-generated. And, Aziz said, the plumes of smoke that appear in news footage are often farther away from the airport than they appear. Still, some strikes have landed too close for comfort. On Monday night, one hit the coastal area of Ouzai, about 200 meters (650 feet) from one of the runways. There were no planes in the area at the time. Since the escalation began, many embassies have chartered extra commercial flights to get their citizens out. Other flights have carried Lebanese citizens to nearby destinations like Turkey and Cyprus to wait out the conflict. The number of daily MEA flights ranges from 32 to 40 — not much below the usual number for this time of year, Aziz said. The difference: now the flights usually depart Beirut full and return two-thirds or three-quarters empty. While many Lebanese have fled, others continue to fly in and out for business or family reasons. Elie Obeid, a business consultant, was scheduled to fly to Brussels this month for a seminar. After his original flight on Turkish Airlines was canceled, he booked on MEA. As his return flight was landing Saturday, heavy airstrikes were underway in the surrounding area. Onboard, Obeid was unaware of what was happening until the plane landed and he opened his phone to a barrage of messages. He said he had mixed feelings about the experience. 'I do appreciate the fact that they are still flying, since that’s our only connection with the outer world currently,' he said. 'But at the same time it is very risky. We should have been told that strikes were happening, and maybe even they could have told the pilot to request to land in Cyprus for a while until the strikes ended.' John Cox, a U.S.-based former airline pilot who is now an aviation-safety consultant, said when there's a potential threat, it's the captain’s call whether or not to proceed, and it’s not unusual for passengers to be left in the dark. Telling them about a threat they can’t control 'doesn’t really do any good, and it stresses them out. So, I would be very hesitant to do that,' he said. But, he added, 'I’m not sure that I want to fly into an area of open conflict like that with passengers on board.' It is 'pretty unusual,' Cox said, for a commercial airline to decide that operating in an active war zone is an 'acceptable level of risk.' 'When you’re in an area with ongoing military operations there’s an awful lot of variables,' he said. 'Even just keeping the airplanes ... so that they’re not in the same airspace at the same time, that becomes very difficult.' Aziz said the airline is in 'continuous coordination' with the Lebanese government and security agencies, and attempts to mitigate the risk by spacing out flights so the airport is not too crowded at any given time. About 20% of its fleet is parked outside of Lebanon to reduce potential damage. They have also taken measures to adjust for the frequent GPS jamming that is used by Israel to ward off missile and drone attacks but also disrupts civilian navigation technology. Other airlines have different considerations, Aziz said. Their trips to Lebanon might be 'one flight out of 200 or 300 flights per day, so spending two or three hours a day just to make a risk assessment for one flight is a waste of time for them,' he said. 'But for us it’s a necessity, because if we don’t do it we’ll stop operation completely.' He added, 'It’s our duty, of course, to maintain this link between Lebanon and the outside world.' For many, having that link is a comfort — even if the journey might be harrowing. Marie-Jose Daoud, editor-in-chief of an online journalism platform, flew to Cyprus with her parents a few days after the massive strike in Beirut's southern suburbs that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. As they were waiting for their flight, she saw on the news that the Israeli military had issued evacuation notices for two areas close to the airport. Soon after, she heard the muffled sounds of airstrikes through the airport's soundproofed walls. As the plane took off, the crew and most of the passengers remained calm. One man pointed out the window to show his young son the smoke rising. The plane made it safely to Cyprus. Daoud said her parents want to return home despite the risks, so she is traveling back with them in a few days. She plans to leave again soon after, but she knows she can 'come back at a day's notice' if her family needs her. 'As long as the airport is open, I know that (MEA) are going to be flying,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-middle-east-airlines-mea-4abfae7f6165b7b34083e2512272ce54	2024-10-22T09:09:52-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: Images capture exact moments an Israeli missile strikes building in Beirut	BEIRUT (AP) — Taking cover behind a large tree, an Associated Press photographer pointed his camera toward a Beirut apartment building the Israeli military warned was in its sights. When a missile plunged from the sky moments later, journalist and lens were perfectly positioned to document the trail of destruction — second by second, frame by frame. 'I heard the sound of the missile whistling, headed toward the building and then I started filming,' photographer Bilal Hussein said Tuesday, hours after Israeli forces launched the attack. The images Hussein captured of the projectile, frozen in mid-flight before obliterating the structure, provide a striking look at the speed, power and devastation of modern warfare. The strike on Tuesday came roughly 40 minutes after an Israeli military spokesman posted a warning in Arabic on social media, notifying people in and around a pair of buildings on Beirut’s southern outskirts that that they should evacuate the area. He did not explain why the buildings were being targeted, other than to say they were near 'interests and facilities' associated with the Hezbollah militant group. The warning prompted many people to flee the busy, densely populated neighborhood, even as others, including a few journalists, kept watch. By the time of the attack the building had been evacuated and there were no reports of casualties Tuesday. Minutes before the missile brought down the building, two smaller projectiles were fired at the roof in what Israel’s military often refers to as warning strikes, according to AP journalists at the scene. It is a practice Israel has followed in staging strikes in Gaza during past wars. When the primary missile hurtled toward the building Tuesday it was a blur, but Hussein’s camera provided witness. One picture showed the missile arching through the air. Another captured it a fragment of a second before it smashed through a lower-floor balcony. In the images that followed, a cloud of smoke and debris billowed outward as the building collapsed.

A UN report says it could take 350 years for Gaza to rebuild if it remains under a blockade	U.N. agencies have long warned that it could take decades to rebuild Gaza after Israel's offensive against Hamas, one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns since World War II. Now, more than a year into the war, a new report speaks in terms of centuries. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said in a report released Monday that if the war ends tomorrow and Gaza returns to the status quo before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, it could take 350 years for its battered economy to return to its precarious prewar level. Before the war, Gaza was under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade imposed after Hamas seized power in 2007. Four previous wars and divisions between Hamas and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank also took a toll on Gaza's economy. The current war has caused staggering destruction across the territory, with entire neighborhoods obliterated and roads and critical infrastructure in ruins. Mountains of rubble laced with decomposing bodies and unexploded ordnance would have to be cleared before rebuilding could begin. 'Once a ceasefire is reached, a return to the pre-October 2023 status quo would not put Gaza on the path needed for recovery and sustainable development,' the report said. 'If the 2007–2022 growth trend returns, with an average growth rate of 0.4 percent, it will take Gaza 350 years just to restore the GDP levels of 2022.' Even then, GDP per capita would decline 'continuously and precipitously' as the population grows, it said. Israeli officials did not respond to a request for comment on the report. 350 years is more of a calculation than a prediction Three hundred and fifty years is a long time. It would be as though England and the Netherlands were only now recovering from the wars they fought against each other in the late 1600s. Rami Alazzeh, author of the report, said he based the calculation on the decimation of the economy during the first seven months of the war, and how long it would take to restore it at the GDP growth rate Gaza averaged from 2007 until 2022. Gross domestic product, or GDP, is the sum total of all goods and services produced in a country or territory. 'The message is the recovery in Gaza depends on the conditions in which the recovery would happen,' he said. 'We’re not saying that it will take Gaza 350 years to recover because that means that Gaza will never recover.' At the end of January, the World Bank estimated $18.5 billion of damage — nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022. That was before some intensely destructive Israeli ground operations, including in the southern border city of Rafah. A U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage found roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza had been destroyed or severely damaged. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage. The Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, calculated how long it would take to rebuild all the destroyed homes under what was known as the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism. That process was established after the 2014 war to facilitate some reconstruction under heavy Israeli surveillance. It found that under that setup, it would take 40 years to rebuild all the homes. Even in best-case circumstances, recovery could take decades The report says that even under the most optimistic scenario, with a projected growth rate of 10%, Gaza’s recovery would still take decades. 'Assuming no military operation, and freedom of movement of goods and people and a significant level of investment, and population growth of 2.8 percent per year, UNCTAD estimates that Gaza’s GDP per capita will return to its 2022 level by 2050,' it said. A separate report released by the U.N. Development Program on Tuesday said that with major investment and the lifting of economic restrictions, the Palestinian economy as a whole, including the West Bank, could be back on track by 2034. In the absence of both, its predictions align with those of UNCTAD. The more positive scenarios appear unlikely. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250 when they stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Around 100 captives are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don't distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children. It has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, forcing hundreds of thousands into squalid tent camps. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms and is unlikely to lift it as long as the group has a presence inside Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control over the territory. Since May, Israel has controlled all of Gaza's border crossings. U.N. agencies and humanitarian groups say they have struggled to bring in food and emergency aid because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order inside Gaza. There's also no indication that international donors are willing to fund the rebuilding of Gaza as long as it remains in the grip of war or under Israeli occupation. Arab Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they will only do so if there is a pathway to a Palestinian state, something to which Netanyahu is deeply opposed. Meanwhile, the war rages with no end in sight. This month, Israel launched another major operation in northern Gaza — the most heavily destroyed part of the territory — saying Hamas had regrouped there. 'Everybody now calls for a cease-fire, but people forget that once the cease-fire is done, the 2.2 million Palestinians will wake up having no homes, children having no schools, no universities, no hospitals, no roads,' Alazzeh said. All that will take a long time to rebuild, and could prove impossible under the blockade. 'If we go back to where it was before, and we shouldn’t go back to the way it was before,' he said, 'then I think it means that Gaza’s done.' ___ Follow AP’s Gaza coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-gaza-reconstruction-un-0ac47ddba7401e102b2bb95e85f3e105	2024-10-22T09:06:32-07:00	
Biden heaps praise on Slovenia PM for aiding release of Americans in major US-Russia prisoner swap	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden heaped praise on Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob on Tuesday for his role in the recent seven-nation prisoner swap that freed Americans Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva and Paul Whelan from Russian prison. The deal, completed in August, was the largest U.S.-Russian prisoner swap in post-Soviet history, involving 24 people, many months of negotiations and concessions from other European countries — including Slovenia — that released Russians in their custody as part of the exchange. 'I want to thank you for your diplomacy and for your support and your leadership,' Biden said at the start of his Oval Office meeting with the Central European leader. 'You made it possible. That’s not hyperbole. You made it possible.' Slovenia agreed to the release of Artem Viktorovich Dultsev and Anna Valerevna Dultseva, two Russian spies who were living for years in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana while posing as Argentines operating a startup IT company and an online art gallery. The couple, who had two children, reportedly used Ljubljana as their base to travel to neighboring NATO and EU member states, relay orders from Moscow and bring cash to other Russian sleeper agents. They were arrested in 2022. Golob said the prisoner swap demonstrated that with a 'little help of true friends, nothing is impossible.' He is just the third Slovenian prime minister to be invited to Washington for a White House sit down with a president. Prime Minister Janez Jansa was the country's last prime minister to get a White House meeting with a U.S. president, when George W. Bush hosted him in 2006. (Prime Minister Borut Pahor visited the White House in February 2011 to meet then U.S. Vice-President Biden. During that visit President Barack Obama briefly joined both leaders.) Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, had spent 16 months in a Russian prison; Kurmasheva, a Russian-American editor for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also arrested last year; and Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, had been in Russian detention since his 2018 arrest. Russia convicted all three on what the White House rejected as trumped-up charges of espionage for Gershkovich and Whelan and spreading of false information for Kurmasheva. Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara Murza, an American green card holder who won a Pulitzer Prize while in Russian detention, was also released as part of the swap. Kara-Murza, 42, is a Russian politician, author and historian who has been imprisoned in Russia since April 2022. He was convicted of treason last year for denouncing the war in Ukraine. 'We made it clear to anyone who questions whether our allies matter,' Biden said. The two leaders' agenda included talks on the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, energy security, and their countries' shared approach to the Western Balkans, according to the White House. Golob has also been an outspoken critic of Israel's handling of the war in Gaza. Last month, Golob in his address at the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to 'stop the bloodshed.' 'Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now,' he said, pounding the lectern for emphasis. The meeting with Golob comes on the heels of Biden's visit to Berlin last week that was made in part to thank German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his country's cooperation in the prisoner swap. Scholz agreed to release Vadim Krasikov, a Russian who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a 40-year-old Georgian citizen and later claimed asylum in Germany.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-slovenia-prisoner-exchange-nato-2305a3f501b31c421333fa805cc20cdb	2024-10-22T07:53:59-07:00	
France defends restrictions on Israeli firms supplying Middle East wars and says it's not a boycott	PARIS (AP) — France's government on Tuesday defended its decision to bar Israeli companies supplying the wars in the Middle East from exhibiting at an upcoming trade fair outside Paris. Organizers of the Nov. 4-Nov. 7 naval defense exhibition, called Euronaval, posted on the event's website that Israeli firms can take part in the show and 'may have an exhibition stand, provided that their products are not used in military operations in Gaza and Lebanon.' The organizers attributed the restrictions to French government decisions taken earlier this month. Addressing parliament Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the policy doesn't amount to a boycott of Israeli firms. But he also said it would be 'incoherent' for France to allow the promotion of weapons used in the wars when Paris is also pushing for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Therefore, we have indicated to the Israeli authorities, with whom we communicate very regularly, that the participation in the form of stands by companies should respect this balance,' Barrot said. 'Also, companies whose equipment is not used in offensive actions in Gaza and Lebanon will naturally be able to have stands at the exhibition,' he said. In a post Sunday on X, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz urged French President Emmanuel Macron to rescind the restrictions, calling them 'unacceptable' and 'anti-democratic.' 'France, as well as the entire Western world, should stand with us -- not against us,' Katz posted. Barrot reiterated that France supports Israel's right to defend itself. The minister cited, as an example, France's decision to continue exporting components that he said are used in Israel's 'Iron Dome' air-defense system. 'On the other hand, it would be incoherent to enable any promotion of weapons used in Gaza and Lebanon, which lead to unacceptable damage for the civilian populations, when this government and our country is calling for an immediate cease-fire,' the French minister said.	https://apnews.com/article/france-israel-euronaval-middle-east-wars-205705adbf8c2e94ea4092f0c85ef34e	2024-10-22T07:00:02-07:00	
Several casualties feared after a gasoline truck explodes by a highway near Uganda's capital	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — A Ugandan police spokesman says several people might be dead after a fuel truck exploded next to a highway in the East African country. Patrick Onyango said the truck had overturned after an accident and later exploded in a town just outside Kampala, the capital. A video shared online by an onlooker appeared to show people scooping up fuel from the truck, a dangerous scene that echoed a similar incident in Nigeria last week that killed more than 140 people, including children. People who rush to collect fuel from stricken trucks hope to sell it for money. There have been similar incidents over the years across East Africa. At least 62 people were killed in Tanzania in 2019 as they attempted to siphon fuel out of a damaged truck.	https://apnews.com/article/uganda-fuel-truck-explosion-ae9b329cbd20e0799fab949cf5e8aefe	2024-10-22T06:45:17-07:00	
EU observers flag irregularities and 'alteration of results' in Mozambique elections	JOHANNESBURG (AP) — European Union election observers have flagged irregularities in Mozambique's election as the country awaits the announcement of official results this week amid protests by opposition supporters and the recent killing of two prominent opposition figures. The EU observer mission said Tuesday that some of its 179 election observers deployed to the country had been prevented from observing tabulation processes in some districts, provinces and at national level. The mission also noted 'unjustified alteration' of election results at some polling stations. 'The EU EOM (election observer mission) has continued to observe the electoral process, although EU observers were prevented to observe tabulation processes in some districts and provinces, as well as at the national level. 'To date, the EU EOM has noted irregularities during counting and unjustified alteration of election results at polling station and district level,' chief observer Laura Ballarín said in a statement on Tuesday. Ballarin called on electoral bodies in the country to conduct the tabulation process in a transparent way to ensure the credibility of the election results. 'The publication of disaggregated results by polling stations is not only a matter of good practice, but also a strong safeguard for the integrity of results,' Ballarin said. Tensions around the country's election escalated after the killing of two prominent opposition figures last Friday, followed by protests by opposition supporters on Monday, which were quelled by police firing tear gas at protesters. Elvino Dias, a lawyer and adviser to opposition presidential candidate Venancio Mondlane, was killed when gunmen riddled his car with bullets in the capital, Maputo. Paulo Guambe, the spokesperson for the PODEMOS opposition party that is backing Mondlane, was also in the car and was killed. Mondlane this week called for nationwide protests, alleging that the governing Frelimo party was rigging the election and his supporters faced off with security forces, raising concerns about further election violence once official results have been released. The U.S State Department on Monday condemned the killing of both men and called for a thorough investigation, while urging those aggrieved by election results to file their complaints through official channels. 'We urge all state institutions, political leaders, citizens and stakeholders to resolve electoral disputes peacefully and lawfully, rejecting violence and inflammatory rhetoric. 'We also call on all Mozambicans to turn to peaceful means of filing electoral grievances and reject violence and violent rhetoric,' it said. The election results are expected to be announced this week before being validated by the country's Constitutional Council, which will validate them after handling all the disputes raised by political parties. The governing Frelimo party's candidate, David Chapo, is expected to succeed President Filipe Nyusi as the party leads the polls so far and is expected to extend its 49-year rule. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-irregularities-results-protest-killings-50ea2d587e563dece5454253547897d4	2024-10-22T06:30:02-07:00	
Poland alleges Russian sabotage and is closing one of Moscow's consulates	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s foreign minister said Tuesday that he is ordering the closure of one of three Russian consulates in the country in response to acts of sabotage including arson attacks that he said were sponsored by Moscow. Radek Sikorski demanded that Russia stop what he called hybrid war actions against Poland and its Western allies, warning that Poland reserves the right 'to take further decisive action' if they don't stop. 'As the minister of foreign affairs, I have information that the Russian Federation is behind attempts at sabotage, both in Poland and in allied countries,' Sikorski told reporters in Warsaw. He said he was withdrawing consent for the Russian Consulate in Poznan, and that its personnel would be unwelcome in Poland. Russia also has consulates in Gdansk and Krakow. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova promised 'a painful response to yet another hostile act' in comments to state news agency RIA Novosti. Sikorski cited the arrest in January of a Ukrainian citizen who he said admitted that Russian agents told him to carry out an arson attack in the city of Wroclaw. The attack was foiled, and the 51-year-old man, identified only as Serhii S., is awaiting a court trial. Sikorski alleged that about 20 such sabotage suspects are under investigation in Poland, and that he has knowledge of other such arson plans in allied countries. 'Putin must be deterred,' the foreign minister said in an interview Monday on the private TVN broadcaster. 'We have other such arson attacks all over Europe, all over Europe, and we know about the Russian plans for further arson attacks.' The pro-European Union government in Warsaw says Russia is pursuing acts of hybrid war against Poland and other Western countries in retaliation for their support for Poland's neighbor Ukraine in its struggle against Russia’s invasion. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/poland-russia-ukraine-hybrid-war-sabotage-66a7c9c683e00f08dc46e4178776d7b9	2024-10-22T06:28:08-07:00	
Black motorist fatally shot by London police officer in 2022 was a member of a violent gang	LONDON (AP) — A Black motorist killed by a London police marksman who was acquitted of murder this week was a member of a violent gang and allegedly shot a rival a week earlier, according to court records that were allowed to be published Tuesday. Jurors were not told about Chris Kaba’s gang ties during the trial that ended with Sgt. Martyn Blake being found not guilty Monday in the Central Criminal Court. Kaba, 24, was shot on Sept. 5, 2022, after ramming police vehicles during a traffic stop. Police did not know who was driving the vehicle, but it was an Audi Q8 that had been used as a getaway car in an unsolved shooting a night earlier. Blake fired a single round through the windshield of the Audi because he said he thought fellow officers’ lives were in danger. Kaba was found to be unarmed. Prosecutors defended their decision to charge Blake in an exceptionally rare case against a British police officer for a death in the line of duty. They argued at trial that Blake misjudged the risk to his colleagues, exaggerated the threat after the shooting and aimed for Kaba’s head. Blake denied those assertions. A judge had said the details of Kaba's criminal record and alleged involvement in other shootings were irrelevant for jurors to consider in determining whether Blake used unreasonable force. Justice James Goss ordered news media not to report any of those details. Following the trial, the news media challenged Goss' order, and he lifted the restrictions on the information that had emerged during earlier proceedings. The Metropolitan Police supported the release of the information to remove any 'misleading impression' about Kaba's character in the hopes it could quell violence toward officers, particularly on Saturday when an annual demonstration is held in London by family members of people who have died in police custody. 'If the information in relation to Mr. Kaba’s character is shared with the public, those who would seek to provoke anti-police violence would gain less support and the overall likelihood of disorder and the risk to public safety would reduce,' Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy said in a court statement. Kaba’s mother, Helen Lumuanganu, had asked the court not to release the details until an inquest could be held into her son’s death, which could take years. Dozens of demonstrators held a peaceful protest Monday night outside the Old Bailey courthouse where the trial was held, chanting for justice for Kaba. 'Despite this verdict, we won’t be silenced,' his family said in a statement. 'We are deeply grateful to everyone who stood by us and fought for justice. We will continue fighting for Chris, for justice, and for real change. Chris’ life mattered, and nothing can take that away from us.' Information from previous trials indicated Kaba had shot a gang rival on the dance floor of a nightclub on Aug. 30 and then chased the victim outside and shot him again before fleeing. The victim, who was hit twice in the leg, survived. The vehicle he was driving on the night he was killed had been used to drive him to the club that night and was also linked to another shooting in May. Kaba had convictions for fighting and possessing a knife and had served several stints behind bars, including a four-year sentence in 2017 for possessing an imitation firearm. Kaba, who had been a rapper and was about to become a father, was facing a possible court order aimed at curbing gang behavior at the time of his death. Fatal shootings by police in the U.K. are rare. In the year to March 2023, officers in England and Wales who are authorized to carry a gun fired their weapons at people 10 times and killed three, according to official statistics. The shooting renewed racism allegations against the Met police, also known as Scotland Yard, as it had been trying to restore confidence following a series of scandals and an independent review that found it mired in sexism, homophobia and institutional racism. The decision to charge Blake created a backlash from some of his specially trained firearms colleagues who refused to carry their weapons in a show of solidarity. The Met was briefly forced to call on neighboring departments and the military for backup. The union representing Met police officers applauded the decision to lift the reporting restrictions on Kaba's gang involvement and said Blake never should have faced trial.	https://apnews.com/article/london-police-acquitted-black-motorist-8e1242c9be7543f0c41d4efc8c62dc13	2024-10-22T06:01:21-07:00	
FBI says it's investigating leak of secret documents on Israel's possible attack plans	WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI said Tuesday that it is investigating the unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel’s preparation for a potential retaliatory attack on Iran. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the Biden administration is still not certain if the classified information was leaked or hacked but that officials don’t have any indication at this point of 'additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain.' The Associated Press reported Saturday that U.S. officials were investigating the release. The FBI confirmed the investigation for the first time on Tuesday and said in a statement that it is 'working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community.' It did not comment further. The documents are attributed to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel is still moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran’s blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were shareable within the 'Five Eyes,' an intelligence alliance comprised of the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Marked top secret, the documents first appeared online Friday on the Telegram messaging app and quickly spread among Telegram channels popular with Iranians.	https://apnews.com/article/fbi-israel-classified-documents-iran-c12111c65413a132ee3301684825259a	2024-10-22T05:10:15-07:00	
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's posthumous memoir is a testament to resilience	NEW YORK (AP) — In a memoir released eight months after he died in prison, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny never loses faith that his cause is worth suffering for while also acknowledging he wished he could have written a very different book. 'There is a mishmash of bits and pieces, a traditional narrative followed by a prison diary,' Navalny writes in 'Patriot,' which was published Tuesday, and is, indeed, a traditional narrative followed by a prison diary. 'I so much do not want my book to be yet another prison diary. Personally I find them interesting to read, but as a genre — enough is surely enough.' The final 200 pages of Navalny's 479-page book do, in some ways, have the characteristics of other prison diaries or of such classic Russian literature as Alexander Solzhenitsyn's 'One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.' He tracks the boredom, isolation, exhaustion, suffering and absurdity of prison life, while working in asides about everything from 19th century French literature to Billie Eilish. But 'Patriot' also reads as a testament to a famed dissident's extraordinary battle against despair as the Russian authorities gradually increase their crackdown against him, and even shares advice on how to confront the worst and still not lose hope. 'The important thing is not to torment yourself with anger, hatred, fantasies of revenge, but to move instantly to acceptance. That can be hard,' he writes. 'The process going on in your head is by no means straightforward, but if you find yourself in a bad situation, you should try this. It works, as long as you think everything through seriously.' In recent years, Navalny had become an international symbol of resistance. A lawyer by training, he started out as an anti-corruption campaigner, but soon turned into a politician with aspirations for public office and eventually became the main challenger to Russia’s longtime president, Vladimir Putin. Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, oversaw the book’s completion. In a promotional interview for 'Patriot,' she told the BBC that she would run for president if she ever returned to Russia -– an unlikely move with Putin in power, Navalnaya acknowledged. She has been arrested in absentia in Russia on charges of involvement with an extremist group. Putin 'needs to be in a Russian prison, to feel everything what not just my husband, but all the prisoners in Russia' feel, Navalnaya said during an interview on CBS' '60 Minutes.' Navalnaya has vowed to continue her late husband’s fight. She has recorded regular video addresses to her supporters and has been meeting with Western leaders and top officials, advocating for Russians who oppose Putin and his war in Ukraine. She had two children with her husband, who in his book writes of his immediate attraction to her and their enduring bond, praising Navalnaya as a soulmate who 'could discuss the most difficult matters with me without a lot of drama and hand-wringing.' During the first section of his book, Navalny reflects on the fall of the Soviet Union, his disenchantment with 1990s Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, his early crusades against corruption, his entry into public life, and his discovery that he did not need to look far for a politician 'who would undertake all sorts of needed, interesting projects and cooperate directly with the Russian people.' 'I wanted and waited, and one day I realized I could be that person myself,' he wrote. His vision of a 'beautiful Russia of the future,' where leaders are freely and fairly elected, official corruption is tamed, and democratic institutions work -– as well as his strong charisma and sardonic humor -– earned him widespread support across the country's 11 time zones. He had young, energetic activists by his side — a team that resembled 'a fancy startup' rather than a clandestine revolutionary operation, according to his memoir. 'From the outside we looked like a bunch of Moscow hipsters,' he writes, and together they put out colorful, professionally produced videos exposing official corruption. Those garnered millions of views on YouTube and prompted mass rallies even as the authorities cracked down harder on dissent. The authorities responded to Navalny’s growing popularity by levying multiple charges against him, his allies and even family members. They jailed him often and shut down his entire political infrastructure -– the Foundation for Fighting Corruption he started in 2011 and a network of several dozen regional offices. In 2020, Navalny survived a nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin, which denied involvement. He describes it in great detail in the very beginning of the book, recounting, 'This is too much, and I'm about to die.' His family and allies fought for him to be airlifted to Germany for treatment, and after recovering there for five months, he returned to Russia, only to be arrested and sent to prison, where he would spend the last three years of his life. In the memoir, Navalny recalls telling his wife while still hospitalized in Berlin that 'of course' he will go back to Russia. The pressure on him continued behind bars, intensifying after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and ratcheted its clampdown on dissent to unprecedented levels. In messages he was able to get out of prison, Navalny described harrowing conditions of solitary confinement, where he was placed for months on end for various minor infractions prison officials relentlessly accused him of, sleep deprivation, meager diet and lack of medical help. In October 2023, three of his lawyers were arrested and two more were put on a wanted list. In December 2023, the authorities transferred Navalny to a penal colony of the highest security level in the Russian penitentiary system in a remote town above the Arctic Circle. In February 2024, 47-year-old Navalny suddenly died there; the circumstances and the cause of his death still remain a mystery. Yulia Navalnaya and his allies say the Kremlin killed him, while the authorities argue that Navalny died of 'natural causes,' but wouldn’t reveal any details of what happened. Tens of thousands of Russians attended his funeral on the outskirts of Moscow in March in a rare show of defiance in a country where any street rally or even single pickets often result in immediate arrests and prison. For days afterward, people brought flowers to the grave, and a handful even came Tuesday. 'I dream of as many people as possible reading this book, because it seems to me that everyone will learn something new about Alexei. (Everyone) will laugh and cry a bit. He was so cool: strong and brave, kind and funny. The best. And the dearest,' Yulia Navalnaya said on X. Navalny's team has said the book will be available in Russian, the language he wrote it in, but shipping to his homeland and its neighbor Belarus won't be possible 'as we cannot guarantee delivery and the absence of problems at customs.' The Kremlin and Russian state media ignored the release, much as they ignored many other developments related to Navalny, whose name Putin and other top officials almost never uttered in public. —- Litvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.	https://apnews.com/article/navalny-memoir-putin-russia-opposition-patriot-8e12b158f1ae44e8274eebbdad194847	2024-10-22T04:08:30-07:00	
IMF's view: The global fight against high inflation is 'almost won'	WASHINGTON (AP) — The global war against inflation has largely been won — and at surprisingly little cost to economic growth, the International Monetary Fund declared Tuesday. In its latest assessment of the global economy, the IMF predicted that worldwide inflation will cool from 6.7% last year to 5.8% this year and to 4.3% in 2025. It estimates that inflation will fall even faster in the world’s wealthy countries, from 4.6% last year to 2.6% this year and 2% — the target range for most major central banks — in 2025. The slowdown in inflation, after years of crushing price increases in the aftermath of the pandemic, led the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to cut interest rates this year after they had aggressively raised them to try to tame inflation. 'The battle against inflation is almost won,″ Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, told reporters Tuesday. 'In most countries, inflation is hovering close to central bank targets.″ Inflation had accelerated when the world economy recovered with unexpected speed from the COVID-19 recession, leaving factories, freight yards, ports and businesses overwhelmed with customer orders and creating shortages, delays and higher prices. The high borrowing rates engineered by major central banks, along with the end of supply chain logjams, brought inflation dramatically down from the four-decade highs it hit in mid-2022. And to the surprise of forecasters, the economy — especially the largest, in the United States — continued to grow and employers kept hiring despite higher borrowing costs. 'The decline in inflation without a global recession is a major achievement,'' Gourinchas wrote in a blog post that accompanied the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook. The IMF, a 190-nation lending organization, works to promote economic growth and financial stability and reduce global poverty. On Tuesday, besides sketching a milder inflation outlook, it upgraded its economic expectations for the United States this year, while lowering its estimates for growth in Europe and China. The IMF left its forecast for global growth unchanged at a relatively lackluster 3.2% for 2024. The IMF expects the U.S. economy to expand 2.8% this year, down slightly from 2.9% in 2023 but an improvement on the 2.6% it had forecast for 2024 back in July. Growth in the United States has been led by strong consumer spending, fueled by healthy gains in inflation-adjusted wages. Next year, though, the IMF expects the U.S. economy to decelerate to 2.2% growth. With a new presidential administration and Congress in place, the IMF envisions the nation's job market losing some momentum in 2025 as the government begins seeking to curb huge budget deficits by slowing spending, raising taxes or some combination of both. The IMF expects China's economic growth to slow from 5.2% last year to 4.8% this year and 4.5% in 2025. The world’s No. 2 economy has been hobbled by a collapse in its housing market and by weak consumer confidence — problems only partly offset by strong exports. The 20 European countries that share the euro currency are collectively expected to eke out 0.8% growth this year, twice the 2023 expansion of 0.4% but a slight downgrade from the 0.9% the IMF had forecast three months ago for 2024. The German economy, hurt by a slump in manufacturing and real estate, isn’t expected to grow at all this year. Now that interest rates are coming down and likely to aid the world’s economies, the IMF warned, the need to contain enormous government deficits will likely put a brake on growth. The overall world economy is expected to grow 3.2% in both 2024 and 2025, down a tick from 3.3% last year. That’s an unimpressive standard: From 2000 through 2019, before the pandemic upended economic activity, global growth had averaged 3.8% a year. The IMF also continues to express concern that geopolitical tension, including antagonism between the United States and China, could make world trade less efficient. The concern is that more countries would increasingly do business with their allies instead of seeking the lowest-priced or best-made foreign goods. Still, global trade, measured by volume, is expected to grow 3.1% this year and 3.4% in 2025, improving on 2023’s anemic 0.8% increase. Gourinchas also suggested that economic growth could end up being weaker than expected if countries take steps to reduce immigration, which has helped ease labor shortages in the United States and other advanced economies. And he said armed conflicts, like those in Ukraine and the Middle East, could also threaten the economic outlook. India’s economy is expected to 7% this year and 6.5% in 2025. While still strong, that pace would be down from 8.2% growth last year, a result of consumers slowing their spending after a post-pandemic boom. The IMF predicts that Japan’s economy, hurt by production problems in the auto industry and a slowdown in tourism, will expand by a meager 0.3% this year before accelerating to 1.1% growth in 2025. The United Kingdom is projected to register 1.1% growth this year, up from a dismal 0.3% in 2023, with falling interest rates helping spur stronger consumer spending.	https://apnews.com/article/imf-global-economy-inflation-growth-federal-reserve-715442446ade21f91548095ed46ba312	2024-10-22T04:02:21-07:00	
The Latest: Trump and Harris court Latino voters as early voting starts in key battleground states	With just over two weeks before the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are hitting the campaign trail in strategic battleground states. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump again rails against green power sources He claimed that switching to all-electric trucks would require rebuilding every one of the country’s bridges and that solar fields kill rabbits. He says he recently saw a a solar field 'that looked like it took up half the desert.' 'It’s all steel and glass and wires. And it looks like hell,' he said. 'You see rabbits, they get caught in it.' Trump often rails against wind power, saying the turbines 'kill all the birds' and confuse whales. He’s been more complimentary of electric cars since he received the backing of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. But he is criticizing their range and weight at an event with Latino supporters Tuesday, claiming the nation would need to rebuild every one of its bridges if truck fleets swap diesel for electric vehicles to handle the extra weight. Trump criticized the Biden administration for the leak of secret documents detailing Israel’s preparation for a potential retaliatory attack on Iran He called it a 'bad thing.' 'Can you imagine somebody doing that? That’s the enemy. I guess that maybe is the enemy from within,' he said, repeating the phrase he’s used in recent speeches to refer to Democratic lawmakers such as U.S. Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff. 'We just can’t stand for this incompetence anymore.' The FBI said Tuesday that it’s investigating the unauthorized release of these documents. At his event, Trump compliments Goya, the largest, Hispanic-owned food company in the country The company’s CEO, Bob Unanue, is a vocal supporter. 'It’s actually quite good out of the can,' Trump says of the company known for its beans and other products. 'I eat it whenever I can,' he claims. Bruce Springsteen is holding campaign concerts for Kamala Harris starting Thursday in Atlanta Former President Barack Obama will also be there. Springsteen will hold another concert with Obama on Monday in Philadelphia. A senior campaign official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said more concerts will be announced in the coming days. — Chris Megerian Trump is using the roundtable with Latin American leaders to complain about negative ads against him and criticize Harris’ intellect At the event, Trump said Harris is 'slow' and has a 'low IQ.' 'We don’t need another low IQ person,' he said. Trump criticized Harris for her schedule Tuesday, which includes meetings in Washington and interviews with Telemundo and NBC, but no public events 'She’s sleeping right now,' he said. 'This is not what you want.' Trump’s jabs come after Harris tried to cast him as 'exhausted' after he pulled out of several interviews — though Trump has had a busy schedule of interviews with conservative outlets and podcasts. Trump will be speaking to Hispanic voters and leaders in a smaller gathering at Trump National Doral Miami In the opening remarks, notable Florida Republicans including Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott proclaimed Trump’s record in supporting the Hispanic community during his previous term. Suarez was one of three Florida Republicans running for president in the earlier campaign cycle, but despite running against Trump, the mayor endorsed the former president in March. Suarez said that under Trump’s term, Hispanics experienced the lowest unemployment and the biggest reduction in poverty. Scott, who’s running for reelection, emphasized Trump would be the best to handle Latin American conflicts and fight against dictatorial regimes, where the families of many voters in the crowd escaped from. Miami is home to one of the largest Hispanic communities in the country, with about 70% of Miami-Dade County’s population identifying as Hispanic according to 2023 Census data. Trump is starting his day at a roundtable with Latino leaders at his Doral golf club in Florida It’s a beautiful day in Miami, with blue skies framing the property’s many palm trees. US Sen. Rick Scott spoke to a crowd of about 100 Hispanic voters at the Trump National Doral Miami Scott’s main message to Hispanic voters was that under Trump’s presidency, Hispanic voters were better off, because the border was more secure and inflation was lower. Scott is saying Harris’ policy will institute price controls, which is socialism. He said her administration would raise taxes. 'The Hispanic vote is the deciding factor. If you want someone to fight for Latin America, Trump’s going to do it,' Scott said. Those early Zoom meetings got people fired up for Harris. Now they’re trying to get them to vote When Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and Kamala Harris jumped in, a cascade of Zoom meetings with hundreds of thousands of participants popped up seemingly out of nowhere and helped propel her to the Democratic nomination. Now organizers are trying to turn that burst of digital enthusiasm into traditional get-out-the-vote efforts like phone banking and door knocking. They’ve created a loose constellation of volunteer networks operating independently of the Harris campaign, all geared toward marshaling local or online communities behind the vice president. People are sending postcards, texting friends, canvassing battleground states, making friendship bracelets with campaign messages, and sometimes surprising themselves by getting involved in ways they’ve never done before. The question is whether the Zoom meetings that drew so much attention during the summer — for Black women, Black men, white women, white dudes, cat ladies, Taylor Swift fans and more — will turn out to be a short-lived phenomenon or a powerful catalyst for Harris to beat Republican nominee Donald Trump. ▶ Read more about Zoom organizing by Democrats. With less than two weeks before Election Day, Kamala Harris is heading Friday to the reliably red state of Texas But she’s not necessarily trying to sway voters there. She’s trying to highlight a make-or-break issue for Democrats: abortion rights. Harris will seek to show how Texas’ restrictive abortion ban is creating increasing medical distress for women. During her campaign, the Democratic presidential nominee has often highlighted the increasingly perilous landscape for women since the fall of Roe, and she links it to Donald Trump, who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned the landmark abortion rights ruling. But it’s unusual for her to do it from a state she’s highly unlikely to win. Campaign officials say the plan is a nontraditional way to capture the attention of voters in battleground states who are inundated with campaign ads and run-of-the-mill campaign events. But Harris also thinks the issue is resonating for Republican voters, too, particularly women. In hard-fought Pennsylvania, fast-growing Hispanic communities present a test for Harris and Trump Pennsylvania is arguably the hardest fought of the battleground states and happens to have one of the fastest-growing Hispanic communities in the country, in what is known as the 222 Corridor, after the highway that connects small cities and towns west and north of Philadelphia. It’s fertile ground for both Democrats and Republicans to test their strength among Latinos in a state where small margins decide who gets 20 electoral votes. It’s a place where Democratic nominee Kamala Harris can prove that her party still commands a large share of the demographic’s support, and where Republican Donald Trump’s campaign has been working to gain ground. 'This is the epicenter for Latino voters in Pennsylvania,' said Victor Martinez, who is of Puerto Rican descent and lives in and broadcasts his show from Allentown. 'I like the fact that Kamala Harris has to keep sending people over here to listen to us and talk to us. I like it. I like the fact that JD Vance has to keep coming back. I like it, because that means that they have to pay attention to us.' Pennsylvania’s Latino eligible voter population has more than doubled since 2000 from 208,000 to 579,000, according to the Latino Data Hub from the University of California, Los Angeles’ Latino Policy &amp; Politics Institute. The population in cities like Allentown and Reading is now more than half Hispanic, with a majority being of Puerto Rican descent and a sizable portion of Dominican origin. ▶ Read more about the Latino vote in this election. Biden administration awards $428M to help hard-hit coal communities transition to clean energy The Biden-Harris administration is awarding $428 million for 14 clean-energy manufacturing projects in Pennsylvania and other states hit hard by the decline of the U.S. coal industry. One of the larger grants, $87 million, will go to a Pennsylvania company to make state-of-the-art linear generators at a plant outside Pittsburgh, a key battleground in the presidential election. Linear generators can use any fuel source to produce low-carbon power for utilities, data centers and industry. Mainspring Energy plans to use Energy Department funds to create enough electricity annually to power more than 40,000 homes. Harris, like Biden, has pledged to help workers displaced by the transition to clean energy, a key-issue in energy-rich Pennsylvania. Mideast conflict looms over US presidential race as Harris and Trump jostle for an edge Two weeks out from Election Day, the crisis in the Middle East is looming over the race for the White House, with one candidate struggling to find just the right words to navigate its difficult cross-currents and the other making bold pronouncements that the age-old conflict can quickly be set right. Vice President Kamala Harris has been painstakingly — and not always successfully — trying to balance talk of strong support for Israel with harsh condemnations of civilian casualties among Palestinians and others caught up in Israel’s wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Former President Donald Trump, for his part, insists that none of this would have happened on his watch and that he can make it all go away if elected. Both of them are bidding for the votes of Arab and Muslim American voters and Jewish voters, particularly in extremely tight races in the battleground states of Michigan and Pennsylvania. ▶ Read more about the Mideast conflict’s role in the election. How Project 2025’s rightward vision became a flashpoint in this year’s election For the past year, Project 2025 has endured as a persistent force in the presidential election, its far-right proposals deployed by Democrats as shorthand for what Donald Trump would potentially do with a second term at the White House. Even though the former president’s campaign has vigorously distanced itself from Project 2025, the sweeping Heritage Foundation’s proposal to gut the federal workforce and dismantle federal agencies aligns closely with his vision. Project 2025’s architects come from the ranks of Trump’s administration and top Heritage officials have briefed Trump’s team about it. It’s rare for a complex 900-page policy book to figure so dominantly in a political campaign. But from its early start at a think tank, to its viral spread on social media, the rise and fall and potential rise again of Project 2025 shows the unexpected staying power of policy to light up an election year and threaten not only Trump atop the ticket but down-ballot Republicans in races for Congress. Through it all, Project 2025 hasn't gone away. It exists not only as a policy blueprint for the next administration, but as a database of some 20,000 job-seekers who could staff a Trump White House and administration and a still unreleased '180-day playbook' of actions a new president could employ on Day One. ▶ Read more about Project 2025. Early voting kicks off in battleground Wisconsin with push from Obama and Walz In-person early voting kicks off Tuesday across battleground Wisconsin, with former President Barack Obama and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz hosting a rally in liberal Madison and Republicans holding events to encourage casting a ballot for Donald Trump before Election Day. Trump lost Wisconsin by just under 21,000 votes in 2020, an election that saw unprecedented early and absentee voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are expecting another razor-thin margin in Wisconsin and both sides are pushing voters to cast their ballots early. Trump was highly critical of voting by mail in past elections, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud. But this election, he and his backers are embracing all forms of voting, including by mail and early in-person. Trump himself encouraged early voting at a rally in Dodge County, Wisconsin, earlier this month. ▶ Read more about early voting in Wisconsin. Harris’ campaign says her ‘opportunity agenda’ will expand opportunity for Latino men Harris is set to discuss how her plan will lower costs, increase their chances for homeownership and expand job opportunities for Latino men in an interview she’s taping Tuesday in Washington with Telemundo, the Spanish-language TV network. The campaign says Harris, running mate Tim Walz and her husband, Doug Emhoff, are giving interviews to several Hispanic media outlets this week in a bid to get her message across to Latino men. Harris’ Telemundo interview is set to air Wednesday night.	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-2024-13fcbdcabcc7d52cd33d9da6a21a69c0	2024-10-22T03:41:58-07:00	
About 140 Rohingya Muslims on wooden boat off Indonesia's coast as residents refuse to let them land	LABUHAN HAJI, Indonesia (AP) — About 140 weak and hungry Rohingya Muslims, mostly women and children, were on a wooden boat anchored about 1 mile (0.60 kilometers) off the coast of Indonesia’s northernmost province of Aceh on Tuesday, officials said, and local residents refused to allow them onto land. The blue-painted boat has been floating off the coast since Friday. Three Rohingya died during the nearly two-week-long trip from Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh to the waters off Labuhan Haji in South Aceh district, local police said. Authorities have transferred 11 Rohingya to a government hospital since Sunday after their health worsened. 'Our community, the fishing community, refuses to let them land because of what happened in other places. They have caused unrest to local residents,' said Muhammad Jabal, the chief of the fishing community in South Aceh. A large banner hanging at the seaport read: 'The people of South Aceh Regency reject the arrival of Rohingya refugees in the South Aceh Regency area.' The group left Cox’s Bazar on Oct. 9, according to an Aceh police report, and intended to reach Malaysia. Some passengers on the boat had reportedly paid to be transported to other countries. Local residents have given the group food, Jabal said, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has also provided them food. There were 216 people on board when the boat departed Bangladesh and 50 of them reportedly disembarked in Indonesia’s Riau province, according to police. Aceh police have arrested three suspects for alleged people smuggling. About 1 million of the predominately Muslim Rohingya live in Bangladesh as refugees from Myanmar. They include about 740,000 who fled a brutal counterinsurgency campaign in 2017 by Myanmar’s security forces, who were accused of committing mass rapes and killings. The Rohingya minority in Myanmar faces widespread discrimination. Most are denied citizenship. Indonesia, like Thailand and Malaysia, is not a signatory to the United Nations’ 1951 Refugee Convention and is not obligated to accept them. However, the country generally provides temporary shelter to refugees in distress. In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from atop the overturned hull of a boat off the coast of Aceh. Another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, had been killed when the boat capsized, according to the UNHCR. AP reported that the captain and crew had tortured women and girls before the the boat capsized. ___ Tarigan reported from Jakarta.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-aceh-rohingya-muslims-myanmar-refugees-e449e93984ea308c24efedb84be0f6e8	2024-10-22T03:06:34-07:00	
Lee Kuan Yew's youngest son says the UK has granted him asylum from persecution in Singapore	LONDON (AP) — Lee Hsien Yang, the estranged brother of former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said Tuesday that he is now a 'political refugee' after the U.K. government granted him asylum from what he described as persecution at home. The Lee brothers are the sons of Singapore's first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, widely regarded as the city-state's modern founding father. They have been engaged in a public spat since 2017 over the late patriarch’s family home, and Lee Hsien Yang has accused Singapore's government of persecuting him, his wife and his son. In a Facebook post Tuesday, he said that he sought asylum protection in 2022 'as a last resort.' 'The Singapore government’s attacks against me are in the public record. They prosecuted my son, brought disciplinary proceedings against my wife, and launched a bogus police investigation that has dragged on for years,' he wrote. 'On the basis of these facts, the U.K. has determined that I face a well-founded risk of persecution and cannot safely return to Singapore.' 'I remain a Singapore citizen and hope that someday it will become safe to return home,' he added. The Guardian published an interview with Lee Hsien Yang on Tuesday in which he strongly criticized the Singapore government and alleged it facilitated money laundering. 'People need to look beyond Singapore’s bold, false assertions and see what the reality really is like,' he was quoted as saying. 'There is a need for the world to look more closely, to see Singapore’s role as that key facilitator for arms trades, for dirty money, for drug monies, crypto money.' The Singapore government said in a statement there was no basis to the allegations in the Guardian's report. The city-state has a 'robust system to deter and tackle money laundering and other illicit financial flows, which is consistent with international standards,' it said. 'In Singapore, no one is above the law. Anyone, including the offspring of the founding prime minister, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, can be investigated and brought before the courts,' it added. Lee Hsien Yang and his sister, Lee Wei Ling, who died earlier this month, accuse their eldest brother of abusing his power to stop them from demolishing the family home according to the wishes of their father, who died in 2015 after leading Singapore with an iron grip for more than three decades. The family feud saw Lee Hsien Yang and his wife entangled in official investigations over allegations that the pair provided false evidence in judicial proceedings regarding Lee Kuan Yew's will. Lee Hsien Loong stepped down in May after two decades at the helm. He handed power to his deputy, Lawrence Wong, but still holds a Cabinet post as senior minister. Lee Hsien Yang joined the opposition party in the 2020 general elections, saying the governing party led then by his brother had 'lost its way.' The U.K. Home Office didn't immediately comment when asked about Lee Hsien Yang's asylum status. ___ Eileen Ng reported from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.	https://apnews.com/article/singapore-lee-hsien-yang-asylum-uk-d5bee7c0f88f23a1c041a1b2a0367ea5	2024-10-22T02:57:37-07:00	
Austria's chancellor asked to form new government after parties refuse to work with far-right leader	VIENNA (AP) — Austria's president on Tuesday tasked incumbent Chancellor Karl Nehammer with forming a new government after all other parties refused to work with the leader of the far-right Freedom Party, which last month won a national election for the first time. The Freedom Party finished first in the Sept. 29 election with 28.8% of the vote, ahead of Nehammer’s conservative Austrian People’s Party, which took 26.3%. The center-left Social Democrats were third with 21.1%. The outgoing governing coalition of Nehammer’s party and the environmentalist Greens lost its majority. Whoever leads the next government will need to build a coalition to have a parliamentary majority. But Nehammer's party has said it wouldn't work with the Freedom Party under its leader, Herbert Kickl. The other three parties in the new parliament said they wouldn't work with the Freedom Party at all. And Kickl said the Freedom Party would only go into government with him as chancellor. President Alexander Van der Bellen on Oct. 9 asked the leaders of the three biggest parties to hold talks on possible cooperation, dispensing with a tradition of giving the election winner the task of trying to form a new government. The party leaders reported back to him on Monday, and Van der Bellen said all had stuck to their positions. As a result, he said he was asking Nehammer to form a government and talk to the Social Democrats. There was no immediate public response from the chancellor or the far-right party.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-president-nehammer-chancellor-government-far-right-b7c91e9030d266d92f348f52acd9e5a8	2024-10-22T02:55:30-07:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy says only a US green light on a NATO invitation will sway a reluctant Germany	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's president is hoping allies will take a more positive stance on his so-called victory plan after the U.S. election, but concedes that its key demand — an invitation to join NATO — is not welcome by some key Western partners, in particular Germany. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was also likely looking at the postelection scenario in the U.S. to assess the possibility of cease-fire talks with Ukraine. He assessed that if partial cease-fire deals could be reached over attacks on energy infrastructure and Black Sea shipping routes, it would signal the end of the 'hot phase' of the war. Zelenskyy spoke to journalists on Monday and his comments were embargoed until Tuesday. On NATO, Zelenskyy said France, Britain and Italy have shown signs of support. Germany has reservations, however, and Zelenskyy believes only a U.S. green light will convince Berlin to accept the idea. 'The German side is skeptical about our NATO membership — that’s a fact. I believe their stance is softer than it was before — this is also a fact. But when it comes to the invitation I’m talking about now, they are afraid of ... Russia’s reaction,' he said. 'I believe that their position will be influenced by a bigger alliance. A bigger alliance in supporting us — a confident 'Yes' from the United States.' Many significant issues will hinge on decisions taken following the fraught election period, the president said. 'After the elections, we hope for a more positive reaction from the US — not because of a change in the president, but because the focus of the United States is now on the elections, and I believe that any sharp statements from the U.S. today might be inappropriate or carry risks. I think they don’t want unnecessary risks,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-nato-germany-zelenskyy-dea72695475ebcf3d5b22f3a9c8aecac	2024-10-22T02:36:48-07:00	
Switzerland to close 9 centers for asylum-seekers as fewer people arrive than expected	GENEVA (AP) — Swiss authorities said Tuesday they will shut nine temporary centers for asylum-seekers because the number of people seeking asylum recently has been below expectations. Switzerland has been building up refugee accommodation since 2022, putting in place 36 centers for asylum-seekers across the country. The State Secretariat for Migration said that just over half the places are currently occupied. It said that, unlike in previous years, there hasn't been a rise in new asylum-seekers in the summer and fall. In August, there were 23% fewer applications than a year earlier, and there was a 40% drop in September. 'The situation on the migration routes toward Western Europe does not point to a dramatic increase in the coming months,' the secretariat said in a statement. The nine centers being shut can accommodate 1,735 people. It said that, following their closure, the remaining ones will be able to put up about 7,000 people from March onward — a number that could be increased again if there is a sharp increase in new arrivals.	https://apnews.com/article/switzerland-migration-asylum-centers-closing-b8c1a396a28323196705ddd7f1cf26e9	2024-10-22T02:02:18-07:00	
Tunisia's president is inaugurated for a second term following a crackdown on his opponents	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Tunisia's President Kais Saied has been inaugurated for a second term, following a monthslong crackdown and string of arrests against his political opponents. Weeks after winning re-election with a 90.7% share of the vote, the 66-year-old former law professor in his inauguration speech Monday called for a 'cultural revolution' to combat unemployment, fight terrorism and root out corruption. 'The aim is to build a country where everyone can live in dignity,' Saied said in a speech addressing members of Tunisia's parliament. Saied's Oct. 7 re-election came after a turbulent first term during which he suspended the country's parliament, rewrote its post-Arab Spring constitution and jailed dozens of his critics in politics, media, business and civil society. He has justified elements of the crackdown as necessary to fight corruption and enemies of the state, using populism to appeal to Tunisians disillusioned with the direction that those who preceded him took the country after nationwide protests led to the 2011 ouster of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. He promised to target the 'thieves and traitors on the payroll of foreigners' and blamed 'counterrevolutionary forces' for obstructing his efforts to buoy Tunisia's struggling economy throughout his first term in office. 'The task was not easy. The dangers were great,' he said. 'The arms of the old regime were like vipers circulating everywhere. We could hear them hissing, even if we couldn’t see them.' Though Saied proclaimed a commitment to respecting freedoms, many journalists were prevented from covering his swearing-in on Monday, leading to a rebuke from the National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists, which expressed 'its firm condemnation of the ongoing blackout policy and restrictions on journalistic work' in a news release on Monday.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-president-kais-saied-f911f1dfc86445ef8be157a3a792e1e2	2024-10-22T01:53:38-07:00	
Tropical Storm Oscar swirls toward the Bahamas after hitting Cuba as a hurricane	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Tropical Storm Oscar chugged toward the Bahamas on Tuesday after making landfall in Cuba as a Category 1 hurricane, killing at least six people as it unleashed heavy rains on an island also hit by an unrelated massive power outage. Oscar was located 45 miles (75 kilometers) south-southeast of Long Island in the Bahamas on Tuesday morning. It had winds of 40 mph (65 kph) and was moving north-northeast at 12 mph (19 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 'Oscar is at best barely a tropical storm at this time,' the center said. It was expected to drop up to 5 inches (13 centimeters) of rain across the southeastern Bahamas, with up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) in isolated areas. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the central and southeastern Bahamas. The storm made history as the smallest recorded hurricane, with a wind field of only about 6 miles (10 kilometers) across. It caught many by surprise as it made landfall in Grand Inagua Island in the Bahamas on Saturday and a second landfall in eastern Cuba late Sunday. 'It’s not often we see a colossal failure in hurricane forecasting,' Michael Lowry, a hurricane specialist and storm surge expert, wrote in an analysis. He noted no models indicated Oscar would strengthen into a hurricane. Oscar dropped at least 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain in parts of eastern Cuba on Monday, with forecasters warning of heavy flooding and possible landslides. The six deaths were reported in Guantánamo. The storm hit as Cuba struggles to recover from a massive blackout that sparked a handful of small protests and a stern government warning that any unrest will be punished. Oscar is the 15th named storm and 10th hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season, which begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures. It forecast 17 to 25 named storms before the season ends, with four to seven major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Kristy swirled over open waters in the Pacific Ocean. It was located 375 miles (605 kilometers) west-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico on Tuesday. It had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 15 mph (24 kph). Kristy was expected to become a hurricane by Tuesday night.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-oscar-cuba-bahamas-hurricane-c61b9266c182c4ace4544d73b5cedd3a	2024-10-22T01:48:36-07:00	
India bringing in a new law to curb the menace of hoax bomb threat calls disrupting airlines flying	NEW DELHI (AP) — The Indian government plans a new law to punish those making hoax bomb threats against flights, which disrupt the schedules of airlines and cause massive inconvenience to thousands of passengers. In less than two weeks, more than 120 flights operated by Indian carriers have received bomb threats, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan said on Monday that the government is planning to introduce legislation that would put offenders on a no-fly list and amend the 1982 Civil Aviation Act so that they can be arrested and investigated without a court order. On Tuesday, IndiGo, a private Indian airline, said nine of its flights destined for Jeddah and Dammam in Saudi Arabia and some flights from Turkey had received such hoax calls. The flights were diverted to the nearest airports for security checks. 'We worked closely with the relevant authorities and followed standard operating procedures,' the airline said in a statement. The hoaxers have largely gone untraced so far. The Mumbai police said they detained a 17-year-old boy from eastern Chhattisgarh state on Wednesday for allegedly posting bomb threat messages on the social media of various airlines. Police officer Maneesh Kalwaniya said the boy's motive was to implicate another person involved in a business dispute with him. The Press Trust of India said 30 domestic and international flights operated by Indian airlines, including IndiGo, Vistara, and Air India, received bomb threats on Monday night alone. 'Even though bomb threats are hoaxes, things cannot be taken non-seriously,' Rammohan said.	https://apnews.com/article/india-bomb-threat-calls-airlines-ac9cf86f8f64b46a980596b52bc37569	2024-10-22T01:23:16-07:00	
South Korea warns it can send arms to Ukraine after reports of North's troops in Russia	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea warned Tuesday it could consider supplying weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea allegedly dispatching troops to Russia, as both North Korea and Russia denied the movements. The South Korean statement is apparently meant to pressure Russia not to bring in North Korean troops in its war against Ukraine. South Korean officials worry that Russia may reward North Korea by giving it sophisticated weapons technologies that can boost the North’s nuclear and missile programs that target South Korea. In an emergency National Security Council meeting, top South Korean officials condemned North Korea’s alleged dispatch of troops as 'a grave security threat' to South Korea and the international community. They described North Korea as 'a criminal group' that forces its youths to serve as Russian mercenaries for an unjustifiable war, the South Korean presidential office said in a statement. The officials agreed to take phased countermeasures, linking the level of their responses to progress in Russian-North Korean military cooperation, according to the statement. Possible steps include diplomatic, economic and military options, and South Korea could consider sending both defensive and offensive weapons to Ukraine, a senior South Korean presidential official told reporters on condition of anonymity in a background briefing. The official said North Korea could attempt to get high-tech Russian technologies to perfect its nuclear missiles. The official said Russia's possible help for North Korea's efforts to modernize its outdated conventional weapons systems and acquire a space-based surveillance system would pose a serious security threat to South Korea as well. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and shipped humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv. But it has avoided directly supplying arms to Ukraine in line with its policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. South Korea’s spy agency said last week it had confirmed that North Korea sent 1,500 special operation forces to Russia this month. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join invading Russian forces. North Korea and Russia intensify cooperation North Korea and Russia have been sharply boosting their cooperation in the past two years. In June, they signed a major defense deal requiring both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. South Korea said at the time it would consider sending arms to Ukraine, a similar statement that it made Tuesday. South Korea's spy agency said that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. North Korea and Russia have denied the North Korean troop deployment as well as the purported weapons transfer. At a U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia dismissed the South Korean assertion as well as Western allegations of Iran supplying Russia with missiles and China providing arms components. He accused the West of 'circulating scaremongering with Iranian, Chinese and Korean bogeymen, each one of which is more absurd than the one before.' At a separate U.N. committee meeting, a North Korean diplomat said his delegation feels no need to comment on the troop dispatch, calling it 'groundless, stereotype rumors aimed at smearing the image' of the North and undermining the legitimate cooperation between two sovereign states. Also Tuesday, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called South Korean and Ukraine governments 'lunatics' as she slammed them for making 'reckless remarks against nuclear weapons states.' The U.S. and NATO haven’t confirmed North Korea’s troop deployment, but they warned against the danger of such a development if true. U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N. Robert Wood said that if true, the North Korean troop dispatch marks 'a dangerous and highly concerning development' and noted that the U.S. was 'consulting with our allies and partners on such a dramatic move.' __ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-south-russia-troops-ukraine-3bf74624cfa6856edd4f15fb3992bfa0	2024-10-22T01:19:08-07:00	
A man who allegedly planned a bomb attack for the Islamic State group is indicted in Germany	BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors said Tuesday they have filed an indictment against a man who allegedly joined the Islamic State group in Iraq and planned to carry out an attack in Germany on its behalf. The Iraqi national, identified only as Mahmoud A. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested in June in Esslingen, near Stuttgart. The federal prosecutor's office said he has now been formally charged at the state court in Stuttgart with membership in a foreign terrorist organization and preparing a serious act of violence. The suspect joined IS in Iraq in May 2016, and fought and carried out guard duties for the extremist group until October 2017, according to prosecutors. He then allegedly went to Turkey in consultation with IS, and continued to Germany in October 2022. From January onward, he planned a bomb attack, prosecutors said. After looking up how to make a bomb on the internet, he allegedly procured the necessary chemicals and components for an ignition device. He was arrested before he could carry out any plan for an attack.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-islamic-state-attack-suspect-indicted-d03a5b20ce0d104ede6b216eb37c3879	2024-10-22T00:57:49-07:00	
Putin hosts Global South leaders at BRICS summit meant to counterbalance Western clout	KAZAN, Russia (AP) — China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi and other global leaders arrived Tuesday in the Russian city of Kazan for a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies that the Kremlin hopes to turn into a rallying point for defying what some see as the Western liberal order. For Russian President Vladimir Putin, the three-day meeting also offers a powerful way to demonstrate the failure of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine. Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov touted the summit as 'the largest foreign policy event ever held' by Russia, with 36 countries attending and more than 20 of them represented by heads of state. The alliance that initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa has expanded rapidly to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and a few others have expressed interest in joining. Observers see the BRICS summit as part of the Kremlin's efforts to showcase support from the Global South amid spiraling tensions with the West and help expand economic and financial ties. Proposed projects include the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. Putin is set to hold about 20 bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit, including Tuesday's encounters with China’s Xi, India’s Modi and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. The summit underlined the close relationship between Xi and Putin, who announced a 'no-limits' partnership weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. They already have met at least twice this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July. Russia’s cooperation with India has also flourished as New Delhi considers Moscow a time-tested partner since Cold War times despite Russia’s close ties with India’s main rival, China. Western allies want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, but Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. Modi, who last visited Russia in July, said this visit reflects the close friendship between the countries. Speaking at the start of his meeting with Putin, he also reaffirmed New Delhi's push for peace in Ukraine. Putin hailed what he described as a 'privileged strategic partnership' between Russia and India. On Thursday, Putin is also set to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will be making his first visit to Russia in more than two years. Guterres has repeatedly criticized Russia’s actions in Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-brics-summit-china-india-ukraine-war-39e90fce8443b922f4d224c65c2ec932	2024-10-22T00:33:12-07:00	
Blinken arrives in Israel as US looks to renew cease-fire efforts after the killing of Hamas leader	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Tuesday on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. hopes to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, but so far all the warring parties appear to be digging in. Israel is still at war with Hamas more than a year after the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack, and with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where it launched a ground invasion earlier this month. Israel is also expected to strike Iran in response to its ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. Blinken landed just hours after Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel, setting off air raid sirens in the country’s most populated areas and its international airport, but causing no apparent damage or injuries. The Israeli military said it intercepted most of the five projectiles, with one landing in an open area. Another 15 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel at around the same time, it said. Hospitals in Lebanon fear being targeted by Israel The death toll from Israeli airstrikes late Monday that destroyed several buildings facing one of Beirut’s main hospitals climbed to 13. Lebanon's Health Ministry said 57 others were wounded, including seven who were in critical condition. The Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah target, without elaborating, and said that it had not targeted the hospital itself. Associated Press reporters visited the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the country’s largest public hospital, on Tuesday. They saw broken windows in the hospital’s pharmacy and dialysis center, which was full of patients at the time. The force of the explosions also destroyed some of the hospital’s solar panels. Staff said that in the midst of their own panic, they had to deal with wounded patients streaming into the hospital in the aftermath of the strikes across the street. Staff at another Beirut hospital feared it would be targeted after Israel alleged that Hezbollah had stashed hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold in its basement, without providing evidence. The director of the Sahel General Hospital denied the allegations and invited journalists to visit the hospital and its two underground floors on Tuesday. AP reporters saw no sign of militants or anything out of the ordinary. The few remaining patients had been evacuated after the Israeli military's announcement the night before. The rest had left earlier because of repeated airstrikes in the surrounding neighborhood. 'We have been living in terror for the last 24 hours,' said hospital director Mazen Alame. 'There is nothing under the hospital.' Many in Lebanon fear Israel could target its hospitals in the same way it has raided medical facilities across Gaza. The Israeli military has accused Hamas and other militants of using hospitals for military purposes, allegations denied by medical staff. Hospitals can lose their protection under international law if they are used for military purposes. Blinken expected to focus on Gaza The State Department said ahead of the visit that Blinken would focus on ending the war in Gaza, securing the release of hostages held by Hamas and alleviating the suffering of Palestinian civilians. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Blinken would underscore the need for a dramatic increase in the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, something that Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made clear in a letter to Israeli officials last week. That letter reminded Israel that the Biden administration could be forced by U.S. law to curtail some forms of military aid should the delivery of humanitarian aid continue to be hindered. Blinken's previous trips have yielded little in the way of ending hostilities, but he has managed to increase aid deliveries to Gaza in the past. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have brokered months of talks between Israel and Hamas, trying to strike a deal in which the militants would release dozens of hostages in return for an end to the war, a lasting cease-fire and the release of Palestinian prisoners. But both Israel and Hamas accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands over the summer, and the talks ground to a halt in August. Hamas says its demands have not changed following the killing of Sinwar. US and Iran both step up outreach ahead of expected Israeli strike Blinken is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials, and to visit a number of Arab countries, likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has been criss-crossing the region in recent days to try and built support ahead of Israel’s threatened retaliatory strike. Speaking in Kuwait on Tuesday, he said Gulf Arab countries had assured him they would not allow their territory to be used for any Israeli strike. 'All the neighbors assured us that they will not allow their lands and air to be used against Iran,' Araghchi said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. The Arab Gulf countries have not publicly offered such assurances. Gulf Arab nations like the UAE and Qatar host major military installations, and there are concerns that an all-out regional war could draw them in. Iran has repeatedly vowed to respond to any Israeli strike. War rages in Lebanon and northern Gaza The U.S. has also tried to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, but those efforts fell apart as tensions spiked last month with a series of Israeli strikes that killed the militant group’s top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel is currently waging another major operation in already-devastated northern Gaza, which has killed hundreds of Palestinians over the last two weeks, according to local health authorities. In Lebanon, Israel has carried out waves of heavy airstrikes across southern Beirut and the country’s south and east, areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, including some that have reached the country’s populous center. Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 hostage. Around 100 of the captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Hezbollah began attacking Israel the day after the Hamas attack. Both groups are backed by Iran. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded tens of thousands, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children. It has also caused massive devastation across the territory and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million. ___ El Deeb reported from Beirut.

2 transgender women stabbed to death at home in northwest Pakistan	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Two men armed with daggers killed two transgender women at their home in conservative northwest Pakistan overnight before fleeing the scene, police said, a sign of increasing violence against trans people in the country. The killings happened Sunday night in Mardan, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police chief Fahim Khan said. He said the motive behind the murders was unclear and officers are still investigating. Transgender people are often subjected to harassment, abuse and attacks in Muslim-majority Pakistan. They are also among the victims of so-called honor killings carried out by relatives to punish perceived sexual transgressions. Farzana Jan, President of the Trans Action rights group in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said another nine trans people have been killed in gun attacks in the province since January. She said none of the attackers involved in the previous cases had been brought to justice, mainly because families pardoned the attackers or prosecutors did not pursue the cases seriously. The transgender community has threated to protest if the attackers are not arrested. 'We have given a three-day deadline to the police for arresting those behind the latest killings in Mardan,' Jan said. 'We will stage rallies if the killers of two members of our community are not arrested,' she said. There are no exact figures about the number of trans people in Pakistan, but Jan estimated that about 75,000 live in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Mardan is located about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Peshawar.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-trans-women-stabbed-killed-northwest-fe0eef893e486013d51cc5f470a6807e	2024-10-21T21:58:48-07:00	
Middle East latest: Over a dozen killed in Israeli strikes near one of Beirut's main hospitals	Israeli airstrikes in and around Beirut caused significant damage to the country's largest public hospital and killed more than a dozen people, Lebanese health officials said, as Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel hours before U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in the region. Lebanon's health ministry said that 60 others were wounded in airstrikes late Monday that destroyed several buildings facing the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, located on the outskirts of southern Beirut. The Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah target, without elaborating, and that it had not targeted the hospital itself. The State Department said Blinken would focus on ending the war in Gaza, securing the release of hostages held by Hamas and alleviating the suffering of Palestinian civilians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Here's the latest: France's government defends decision to bar some Israeli companies from exhibiting at upcoming trade fair PARIS — France’s government is defending its decision to bar Israeli companies supplying the war in the Middle East from exhibiting at an upcoming trade fair outside Paris. Organizers of the Nov. 4-7 naval defense exhibition, called Euronaval, posted on the event’s website that Israeli firms can take part in the show and 'may have an exhibition stand, provided that their products are not used in military operations in Gaza and Lebanon.' Addressing parliament on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the policy does not amount to a boycott of Israeli firms. But he also said it would be 'incoherent' for France to allow the promotion of weapons used in the war when Paris is also pushing for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Therefore, we have indicated to the Israeli authorities, with whom we communicate very regularly, that the participation in the form of stands by companies should respect this balance,' Barrot said. In a Sunday post on the social platform X, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz urged French President Emmanuel Macron to rescind the restrictions, calling them 'unacceptable' and 'anti-democratic.' Lebanon's health ministry says 63 people were killed and 234 wounded in past 24 hours BEIRUT — Lebanon’s health ministry said that 63 people were killed and 234 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,546 killed and 11,862 wounded. Lebanon’s crisis response unit recorded 125 airstrikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon and the Nabatiyeh province. Some 1,095 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities, and other institutions — are currently sheltering 191,516 people, including 44,124 families, displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report said. Among these shelters, 908 have now reached full capacity. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the U.N. children’s agency. Despite a major border crossing between Lebanon and Syria being out of commission after Israel struck the road several times, crowds have continued to flow across the border seeking relative safety in Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 22, Lebanese General Security recorded 343,404 Syrian and 147,608 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syria, the report said. Yellen says the US is working to ‘ensure that legitimate aid flows reach Gaza,’ among other things WASHINGTON — The U.S. is working to 'ensure that legitimate aid flows reach Gaza,' as well as 'imposing sanctions on Israeli violent extremist settlers and pressing Israel to maintain vital correspondent banking relationships with Palestinian banks,' U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a speech ahead of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings this week. 'We look forward to the Israeli cabinet extending the waivers to preserve correspondent banking relationships for banks in the West Bank by the end of the month deadline to support economic stability in the West Bank,' she added. The agreement will expire on October 31, after Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich agreed to extend it for only three months during the summer. U.S. officials have warned that a failure to extend the banking relationship risks an economic collapse in the occupied West Bank and of the Palestinian Authority. Death toll from strike near Beirut hospital rises to 18 BEIRUT — The death toll from Israeli airstrikes late Monday that destroyed several buildings facing one of Beirut’s main hospitals climbed to 18. Lebanon’s health ministry said 60 others were wounded in the strikes, including seven who were in critical condition. Netanyahu's private residence was hit, damaged during weekend drone attack TEL AVIV, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence was hit and lightly damaged during a drone attack over the weekend, according to footage of the attack published by Israeli media on Tuesday. A photo of the attack showed damage to the bedroom window, which had a spiderweb of cracks and some burn marks. There were no injuries in the attack and neither Netanyahu nor his wife were in the home at the time of the attack. Earlier on Tuesday, Hezbollah’s chief spokesman took responsibility for the drone attack. 'The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate the Prime Minister, it’s clearly a grave mistake,' said David Mencer, Israeli government spokesman. Israel’s military has at times struggled to intercept drones, which are smaller, fly more erratically and are harder to track and intercept. Last week, a Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and wounded 67 others, the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon three weeks ago. Israeli airstrike levels building in southern Beirut suburb BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike leveled a building in the southern Beirut suburb of Beirut on Tuesday. The strike came 40 minutes after Israeli military Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued a warning, claiming the two buildings targeted contained 'Hezbollah facilities.' The building stood in a heavily trafficked area across the street from a large park, which has become a refuge for many displaced families. It is also not far from the French ambassador’s residence. No immediate casualties were reported. The Israeli military did not have immediate comment about the target of the strike. At the time of the warning, Hezbollah’s chief spokesperson was holding a pre-scheduled press conference just a few hundred meters from the targeted area. The event was quickly cut short, with journalists and the spokesperson evacuating the location. The Israeli military did not have an immediate comment about the target of the strike. Amnesty International criticizes Israel's strikes on al-Qard al-Hassan JERUSALEM — Human rights group Amnesty International has criticized Israel’s targeting of branches of a Hezbollah-linked financial institution, saying the round of strikes this week 'likely violates international humanitarian law.' Amnesty said Tuesday the attack on al-Qard al-Hassan must be investigated as a war crime because financial institutions are considered civilian infrastructure under the laws of war unless they are being used for military purposes. 'Even if as the Israeli military alleges, the institution does provide financing to Hezbollah, it is not likely to meet the definition of a military objective, particularly for branches serving civilian customers,' said Erika Guevara Rosas, Amnesty’s senior director for research, advocacy, policy and campaigns. Israel’s strikes overnight Sunday into Monday hit at least 15 branches of al-Qard al-Hassan in Lebanon. Israel says the bank is used to fund attacks, and it issued evacuation warnings ahead of the strikes. Many ordinary Lebanese keep their savings at the financial institution. Hezbollah says it was behind drone attack on Netanyahu's house BEIRUT — Hezbollah’s chief spokesman says the group was behind the weekend drone attack that targeted Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house without inflicting casualties. Mohammed Afif told reporters in Beirut Tuesday that if in the previous attack Netanyahu was not hurt, 'the coming days and nights and the (battle) fields are between us.' Afif was hinting that Hezbollah might carry out such attempts in the future. Afif said Hezbollah is fully responsible for the drone attack that targeted Netanyahu's house. He added that the group did it on its own. Netanyahu’s office said the drone on Saturday targeted his house in the Mediterranean coastal town of Caesarea. Neither he nor his wife was there. It wasn’t clear if the house was hit. Journalists taken on a tour of the Beirut hospital where Israel claimed Hezbollah stored cash and gold BEIRUT — An Associated Press team was among journalists taken on a tour inside a hospital in Beirut’s southern suburb where the Israeli army claimed without offering evidence that Hezbollah was storing hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold in tunnels underneath. The Sahel General Hospital had already been emptied of most patients and staff following intense bombardment of the area in recent days, and the few remaining ones were hastily evacuated late Monday after the Israeli claim. 'We have been living in terror for the last 24 hours,' hospital director Mazen Alame said Tuesday. 'There is nothing under the hospital.' Journalists were taken to the two floors under the hospital, the first of which had two rooms for surgeries and the other had oxygen bottles stored inside. The second floor included a morgue with six doors in one room and a giant water tank in another. Alame said the hospital has no affiliation with any political group or religious institution and has been working under the supervision of Lebanon’s health ministry since its founding. Israel has made similar claims about tunnels used by Hamas militants under hospitals in Gaza. Omar Mneimne, a doctor at the hospital’s emergency department, said he fears a repeat scenario in Lebanon. 'We fear that,' Mneimne said, adding that the international community should act to defend health facilities in Lebanon. 'It’s extremely hard. It’s very stressful for the community.' 7 Jerusalem residents arrested over an alleged Iranian-guided plot TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli authorities said Tuesday they have arrested seven Jerusalem residents in connection with an alleged Iranian-guided plot to assassinate an Israeli scientist and mayor. It was the latest in a series of similar alleged spy rings foiled by Israel and blamed on Iran, highlighting the ongoing shadow war between the two countries even as their conflict has become more direct during the war in Gaza. A statement by Israel’s domestic security agency Shin Bet did not name the scientist or the mayor targeted. It said the seven people arrested were assigned various tasks as part of the alleged plot, including blowing up a police car and lobbing a grenade at a home. The Iranian agent promised the seven roughly $50,000 in exchange for the acts, the Shin Bet said. It said police found multiple credit cards, tens of thousands of shekels and a fake police car license plate. Those arrested were not identified but were from a predominantly Palestinian area of Jerusalem, the Shin Bet said. Tensions between Israel and Iran have soared since the killing in Tehran of Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh — an attack blamed on Israel — and an Iranian missile attack on Israel earlier this month, for which Israel is expected to respond. Death toll from strike near Beirut hospital rises to 13 BEIRUT — The death toll from Israeli airstrikes that destroyed several buildings facing one of Beirut’s main hospitals late Monday has climbed to 13. Lebanon’s health ministry said 57 others were wounded in the strikes, including seven who were in critical condition. It said the airstrikes significantly damaged Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the country’s largest public hospital, located on the outskirts of southern Beirut. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. State Department source says progress on day-after plan is key to US hopes for cease-fire TEL AVIV, Israel — The U.S. is making an eleventh hour effort to resuscitate aspects of the halted cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas weeks before the presidential election and as Israel’s invasion of neighboring Lebanon intensifies, according to a senior U.S. State Department official. Since negotiations fell apart over the summer, Americans have focused on a postwar plan for Israel and Gaza. The State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity late Monday to preview Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s strategy, said stakeholders have reached consensus on some aspects of the so-called day-after plan and that the U.S. is hopeful the progress will bring the parties back to the table on a cease-fire. The official added that the decision to go to Israel before meeting with Arab partners was a shift in the U.S.'s negotiation strategy. The U.S. has long pushed for a postwar settlement in which a reformed Palestinian Authority would govern Gaza with help from Arab states and Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel. Arab leaders insist such plans would depend on a pathway to Palestinian statehood, something to which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is deeply opposed. He has ruled out any postwar role for the PA and says local Palestinians will administer Gaza, with Israel maintaining open-ended security control. Blinken also planned to reiterate concerns about the humanitarian aid crisis in Gaza that U.S. officials outlined in a recent letter to Israel, the official said. But the official said an anticipated Israeli retaliation against Iran is looming over the meeting, which will likely be the last time Blinken and Netanyahu meet before the U.S. presidential election. — By Farnoush Amiri Blinken arrives in Israel on mission to restart cease-fire talks U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Tuesday on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, as the U.S. hopes to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Blinken is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials. Following Israel, he’s expected to visit several Arab countries, likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Here more here. Iran keeps up pressure as Israeli retaliation looms DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran said Tuesday that its Arab Gulf neighbors wouldn’t allow their territory to be used for an expected Israeli strike as the Islamic Republic once again vowed to respond to any attack. The comments from Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi come as speculation grows over how Israel will retaliate for Tehran’s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack on Israel. Speaking in Kuwait as part of a Mideast tour, Araghchi insisted that Gulf Arab neighbors he’s spoken to wouldn’t allow their territory to be used. 'All the neighbors assured us that they will not allow their lands and air to be used against Iran,' Araghchi said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. 'This is an expectation from all friendly and neighboring countries and we consider this a sign of friendship.' However, many Gulf Arab nations host major U.S. military installations, like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as a hedge against any possible attack by Iran. Washington also has based aircraft carriers around the region as tensions have persisted in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the subsequent wars raging across the Mideast. Gulf Arab nations have not made any public pledges like those described by Araghchi. There have been tensions in the Persian Gulf and among Gulf Arab countries since Tehran launched a series of attacks targeting shipping in the region in 2019 over the U.S.'s unilateral withdrawal from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers as well. Separately, Pezeshkian warned that Israel will face a 'corresponding answer' for any attack it carries out. Another Israeli strike hits Lebanon-Syria border crossing BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state news agency says another Israeli airstrike has targeted the country’s main border crossing with Syria, leaving a second large crater on the highway running through it. The National News Agency reported that the early Tuesday airstrike was closer to the Syrian side of the crossing, known as Jdeidet Yabous. Syrian TV also reported an airstrike in the border area. An Israeli airstrike on Oct. 5 blocked a highway and left a giant crater near the Lebanese side of the crossing, known as Masnaa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Beirut. That strike prevented vehicles from going through the crossing, which tens of thousands of people have used to flee to Syria. People now have to cross by foot in or around the two large craters several kilometers (miles) away. The Israeli military has accused the Hezbollah militant group of using the Masnaa crossing to truck in military equipment from Syria. There was no immediate comment on the latest strike. Hezbollah fires rockets into central Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel on Tuesday, setting off air raid sirens in the country’s most populated areas but causing no apparent damage or injuries. The Israeli military said five projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israel and most were intercepted by Israel’s missile defense system. One landed in an open area. Israeli police said there were no reports of damage or injury following the salvo. The Israeli military said that at the same time, about 15 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel. Earlier Tuesday, air raid sirens went off in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after a rocket was launched from Lebanon, the Israeli military said. Homes in the Palestinian village of Shuqba were damaged. The rocket fire came as Israel stepped up its strikes in Lebanon, targeting a Hezbollah-run financial institution, and as Israeli troops pushed ahead in their invasion of southern Lebanon.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-22-october-2024-9fc49430fd9824a0143b3ba6dd0f0d6c	2024-10-21T21:01:20-07:00	
A Samoan village prepares to welcome King Charles but fears an uncertain future for its reef	SIUMU, Samoa (AP) — Under clear skies, shortly after sunrise in the beachside fishing village of Siumu, Samoa, on Tuesday a dozen men and children prepared their small boats for a day at sea. But underwater a mile off the coast, lay the hulking shape of a sunken New Zealand naval vessel them is forcing them to travel further away to fish than before. They had arrived home from Monday's trip just a few hours earlier. The village, festooned with Samoan and British flags, is bustling with preparations to host King Charles III and Queen Camilla when the royals arrive on Wednesday for a biennial meeting of leaders from 56 Commonwealth countries. It is the first time a Pacific Island nation has hosted the event. But Siumu was already busy. New Zealand and Samoan officials have been working along miles of the nearby coastline for weeks to monitor and curb environmental damage caused by the sinking of the HMNZS Manawanui, which ran aground on the reef, caught fire and sank earlier this month. The 75 people on board the specialist dive and hydrographic vessel — one of nine ships in New Zealand's navy — were all evacuated safely. Early fears of a catastrophic fuel spill were later quashed by officials who said oil had not gushed from the ship as it sank. But many who live in Siumu and surrounding villages are worried that damage to the reef from the wreck threatens their longer-term survival. 'I don’t know when it’s going to be good again and to back to the normal as we have before,' said Netina Malae, who has temporarily closed her small resort at nearby Tafitoala. The colorful fales, or huts, lining the beach sit empty. Recovery efforts on the reef have focused on removing three large shipping containers left after the sinking, one of them laden with food. New Zealand's military hoped to float the final one — which is empty and damaged — to shore on Tuesday, although winds and tides threatened to foil their efforts. Meanwhile, fishers who once spent their days where the boat foundered face longer and more expensive trips, they told The Associated Press. 'We doubled the amount of petrol to go far out to get fish,' said Faalogo Afereti Taliulu, citing advice from Samoa’s government that seafood from the area around the sunken ship should not be eaten. 'That’s why that’s our concern. It’s financially affecting us.' Taliulu and others from the village on Upolu, the largest island of Samoa, fish mostly for tuna. It is their biggest industry and a family affair. His cousin, Taula Fagatuai, said currents and tides meant the fishers were unsure if seafood they were catching further afield than the exclusion area was safe to eat. Repercussions for the fragile marine ecosystem of damage caused by the vessel, its anchor chain and shipping containers are not yet clear. 'That boat is going to be ruining our reef,' Fagatuai said. Some in Siumu and surrounding villages are urging New Zealand’s government to pay compensation for their lost earnings, but a swift resolution is unlikely. The cause of the ship’s sinking is unknown and a court of inquiry has been established to investigate the episode. How much fuel is seeping from the vessel is another contested matter. New Zealand’s Defense Minister Judith Collins said last week that a residual 'trickle' of diesel from the ship was evaporating quickly from the ocean's surface. She said the amount of fuel that had spilled into the ocean was less than what had been reported by Samoan officials and that much of what the ship was carrying burned out in the fire. Samoa's Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata’afa assured reporters last week that there was 'no evidence of any leaks' from the vessel's main tanks. But the amount of diesel that flowed from the ship as it sank is not known, Commodore Andrew Brown, the senior national representative for the New Zealand’s military in Samoa, told the AP on Tuesday. Retrieving the remaining fuel from the sunken vessel was 'a priority,' he added. There are not yet plans to raise the vessel from its resting place. The diesel sheen on the water surface and its movement in the currents is observed daily, Brown said. 'We’re also monitoring the coastline.' Officials from both countries have said there is no visible damage to Samoa's beaches or wildlife. But some in the surrounding villages, who say they have encountered oil in the water and seen it coating people or fish, are not reassured. 'My children went to the spot where they surf. And when they came back they said that everywhere there is oil,' Malae said. 'And then I touched their bodies -- slippery with the oil. So I’m sure that this oil was there.' The disaster unfolded as Samoa prepared to host the British royals — who will stay at a resort near Siumu's fishing village — and other world leaders at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Meetings among civil society leaders have already begun, with an official opening ceremony scheduled for Friday. But the uncertainty over the impact of the sunken ship has curtailed tourism opportunities during the event. Malae usually takes visitors out to sea on fishing or surfing trips or to spot turtles. Now, she said, 'it's all stopped.' ___ Graham-McLay reported from Wellington, New Zealand.	https://apnews.com/article/samoa-king-charles-zealand-navy-boat-sank-be10fb9b6d85ff74c25f07daaafa9198	2024-10-21T20:41:04-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares fall after Wall Street pulls back from its records	TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares outside of China declined in cautious trading Tuesday ahead of earnings reports both in the region and overseas, after Wall Street’s long, record-breaking rally ran out of steam. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dove 1.1% to 38,496.44. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 1.6% to 8,213.00, while South Korea's Kospi slipped nearly 1.0% to 2,579.56. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.5% to 20,576.07 while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.5% to 3,285.49 following a cut to interest rates that took effect on Monday. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.2% to 5,853.98, coming off a sixth straight winning week, its longest such streak of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8% from its own record that was likewise set on Friday, to 42,931.60. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3% to 18,540.00. Real-estate stocks fell to the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500 index, while homebuilders Lennar and D.R. Horton both fell at least 4.3%. Home Depot’s 2.1% drop was one of the heaviest weights on the S&amp;P 500. The declines mean at least a pause in Wall Street’s rally to records, which was built in large part on optimism that the U.S. economy can make a perfect escape from the worst inflation in generations, one that ends without a painful recession that many investors had worried could be inevitable. With the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to keep the economy humming, optimists hope stocks can rise even further. But critics are warning stock prices look too expensive given they’ve climbed much faster than corporate profits. That puts pressure on companies to deliver growth in profits to justify their stock prices, and more than 100 companies in the S&amp;P 500 are scheduled to give details this week about their performances during the summer. That includes such heavyweights as AT&amp;T, Coca-Cola, IBM, General Motors and Tesla. Tesla slipped 0.8% ahead of its report. Its stock has been shaky recently, including a tumble after an update on its highly anticipated robotaxi included fewer details than investors were hoping for. Boeing is reporting its latest results on Wednesday. It rose 3.1% after reaching an agreement with the union representing its striking machinists on a contract proposal. The union’s members could vote Wednesday on the deal, which could end a costly walkout that has crippled production of airplanes for more than a month. Trump Media &amp; Technology Group rose 5.8% to top $31, continuing its strong run since it briefly dipped below $12 last month. The company behind former President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform is still losing money, but its stock often moves more with his perceived chances of reelection than anything else. Markets appear to be rotating towards a possible Trump win, according to Michael Wilson and other strategists at Morgan Stanley. They point to how stocks of financial companies have helped to lead the market this month, and consumer companies that could be hurt by tariffs are lagging. Bond yields are also rising, along with some precious metals prices and cryptocurrencies. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.19% from 4.08% late Friday. The Bank of Canada will also announce its latest decision on interest rates Wednesday, where it could cut by half a percentage point. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude lost 21 cents to $70.35 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 18 cents to $74.11 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 150.96 Japanese yen from 150.69 yen. The euro was unchanged at $1.0819. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-earnings-rates-0323c07ea21f8a000c26b9c7f2a6cb64	2024-10-21T19:42:44-07:00	
In annual religious pilgrimage, Panamanians crawl to reach the Black Christ of Portobelo	PORTOBELO, Panama (AP) — At dawn, pilgrims like Ernesto Troya undertook the hardest stretch of their journey to reach the statue of the Black Christ of Portobelo in Panama. Moved by faith, they crawled for several hours along the street toward the image of the saint. It is one of the most striking scenes to happen every year in the northern province of Colón. Every Oct. 21, the province celebrates the festival of the Black Christ of Portobelo. It is considered one of the largest Catholic pilgrimages in the Central American country and dates back centuries. Portobelo is a tourist destination that is part of Panama’s historical and cultural heritage. The city served as a port and trade center during the Spanish colonial times in the Caribbean Sea. According to some historians, legend has it that a fisherman found the statue of the Black Christ wrapped in a 'cayuco,' or wooden boat, off the coast of Portobelo on Oct. 21, 1658. When the Spaniards discovered the presence of the saint, they decided to move it to another country on the continent. However, every time the boat tried to set sail with the statue, a storm came and prevented it from leaving port. The settlers, many of them of slave and African descent, adopted the image as their patron saint. Thousands of pilgrims arrive at the church of San Felipe, which houses the Black Christ on an altar. After walking long distances in what is known as 'mandas' they give thanks for a favor or miracle granted. Many pilgrims like Troya, a 46-year-old security guard, made a dramatic final run through the streets of the town. Crawling to the image of the Christ, the pilgrimage usually causes cramps and knee injuries. 'If one gets on their knees with the faith one has (in the saint) everything will go well. With faith everything is possible,' said Troya.	https://apnews.com/article/panama-black-christ-pilgrimage-religion-portobelo-1394eb0de3ac6b6fe2d77f23e88505b3	2024-10-21T19:06:04-07:00	
China holds live-fire drills opposite Taiwan, a week after large-scale exercise	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China is holding live-fire drills off the coast of its southern Fujian province facing Taiwan, just a week after a massive air-and-sea drill it described as punishment for Taiwan's president rejecting Beijing's claims of sovereignty. The live-fire drills were being held near the Pingtan islands, according to a notice from the Maritime Safety Administration. It warned ships to avoid the area. It did not offer additional details. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said China's drills were part of an annual exercise and it was tracking them. 'It cannot be ruled out that it is one of the ways to expand the deterrent effect in line with the dynamics in the Taiwan Strait,' the statement added. Taiwan is a self-ruled island that Beijing claims is part of China. Tensions around the issue have flared in recent years. China has increased its presence in the waters and skies around Taiwan. It now increasingly sends large numbers of warplanes and navy vessels to military exercises near Taiwan, and its coast guard carries out patrols. Last week, China held a one-day military exercise aimed at practicing the 'sealing off of key ports and key areas.' Taiwan counted a record one-day total of 153 aircraft, 14 navy vessels and 12 Chinese government ships. Taiwan's premier, Cho Jung-tai, called on China to stop its exercises aimed at Taiwan. 'Like all democratic countries in the world, we believe that China’s military exercises are a threat to regional peace and stability. Regardless of the scale of the exercise, China’s military exercises should not frequently approach Taiwan to make meaningless declarations,' he said. In response to Chinese moves, the U.S. has continued what it calls 'freedom of navigation' transits through the Taiwan Strait. On Sunday, the destroyer USS Higgins and the Canadian frigate HMCS Vancouver transited the narrow band of ocean that separates China and Taiwan. Germany sent two warships through the Taiwan Strait last month as it seeks to increase its defense engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. China has also exerted diplomatic pressure on Taiwan, poaching its allies. South Africa, which does not recognize Taiwan as a country, asked the island last week to move its liaison office outside the capital, Pretoria, as a concession to China. Taiwan on Monday said it would fight the request. —— AP senior video producer Johnson Lai contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-taiwan-live-fire-drills-4f7b62d187f68878acdacdd4d55fb891	2024-10-21T19:01:54-07:00	
King Charles III's Commonwealth visit to Samoa will highlight climate change ... and dance	LONDON (AP) — King Charles III should be prepared to dance when he visits Samoa this week. Freddie Tuilagi made sure of that when he visited St. James' Palace recently wearing nothing but a bark cloth wrap and a necklace historically worn by orator chiefs. Charles, in a blue suit and carefully knotted tie, grinned while gamely trying to follow along as Samoa’s honorary consul to the U.K. moved through the steps of a traditional dance. 'He loves it. He said he wants to learn the dance,' Tuilagi said afterward, showing off his moves once again. Tuilagi, who moved to Britain to play professional rugby, said the 75-year-old king can expect more of the same when he arrives in the South Pacific island nation on Wednesday. Villagers throughout the country of 220,000 people have taken steps to decorate and show how much they appreciate Charles’ visit, he said. Charles, the symbolic head of the Commonwealth, is traveling to Samoa for a meeting of top government officials from each of the 56 independent nations that make up the organization. At the top of the agenda is the fight against climate change, an issue Charles has championed for decades. The king can count on Samoans to be receptive. Its islands are at the forefront of the climate emergency, facing increasing threats from rising sea levels, warming ocean temperatures and more intense storms. The royal visit is attracting global media attention. Many Samoans hope that images of the king and Queen Camilla strolling on the islands’ breathtaking beaches will help attract European tourists and boost the economy. 'It’s an opportunity to showcase our culture, showcase our heritage and how ... proud (of) that we are as a country,’’ Tuilagi told The Associated Press. 'To host the king and the leaders of the Pacific, you know, the Commonwealth coming to Samoa is something special for us.’’ Before his Samoa trip, Charles visited Australia, where not everyone welcomed him. On Monday, Sen. Lidia Thorpe, shouted 'you are not my king,'' at a parliamentary reception for the king to protest the former British Empire's treatment of Indigenous peoples and to call on Australia to sever ties with the monarchy. But Samoa has a different relationship with the monarchy. Unlike Australia, Samoa is not one of the 14 independent countries outside the United Kingdom where the British monarch remains the head of state. Tuilagi said he hopes his demonstration of Samoan dance and song will help the king when he arrives. He particularly hoped that he would make an impression since he wore national dress, which includes leaving the shirt at home. Think joy. That's Tuilagi's point. 'It’s not every day the king will see a chief from Samoa topless ... at the palace,’’ he said, chuckling.	https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-samoa-commonwealth-dance-89b658cf3b0529b7a19c0361208a29c8	2024-10-21T18:27:27-07:00	
King Charles III ends first Australian visit by a reigning British monarch in 13 years	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — King Charles III ends the first visit to Australia by a reigning British monarch in 13 years Tuesday with anti-monarchists hoping his journey is a step toward an Australian citizen becoming head of state. Controversy interrupted the visit on Monday when Indigenous independent senator Lidia Thorpe yelled at Charles during a reception that he was not her king and Australia was not his land. Esther Anatolitis, co-chair of the Australian Republic Movement, that campaigns for an Australian citizen to replace the British monarch as Australia’s head of state, said while thousands turned out to see the king and Queen Camilla at their public engagements, the numbers were larger when his mother Queen Elizabeth II first visited Australia 70 years ago. An estimated 75% of Australia’s population saw the queen in person during the first visit by a reigning British monarch in 1954. 'It’s understandable that Australians would be welcoming the king and queen, we also welcome them,' Anatolitis said. 'But it doesn’t make any sense to continue to have a head of state appointed by birth right from another country.' Anatolitis acknowledged that getting a majority of Australians in a majority of states to vote to change the constitution would be difficult. Australians haven’t changed their constitution since 1977. 'It’s tricky, isn’t it? We’ve got that hurdle, of course,' Anatolitis said. Constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey said an Australian republic was not something that Charles, 75, need worry about in his lifetime. She said the failure of a referendum last year to create an 'utterly innocuous' Indigenous representative body to advise government demonstrated the difficulty in changing Australia’s constitution. 'It’s just that on the whole people aren’t prepared to change the constitution,' Twomey said. 'So a republic, which would be a much more complex constitutional question than the one last year, would be far more vulnerable to a scare campaign and to opposition,' she said. 'So unless you had absolutely unanimous support across the board and a strong reason for doing it, it would fail,' she added. Philip Benwell, national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, which wants to maintain Australia’s constitutional link to Britain, said he was standing near Thorpe at the Canberra reception when she started yelling at the king and demanding a treaty with Indigenous Australians. 'I think she alienated a lot of sympathy. If anything, she’s helped to strengthen our support,' Benwell said. Thorpe has been criticized, including by some Indigenous leaders, for shouting at the king and failing to show respect. Thorpe was unrepentant. She rejected criticism that her aggressive approach toward the monarch was violent. 'I think what was unacceptable is the violence in that room, of the King of England praising himself, dripping in stolen wealth, that’s what’s violent,' Thorpe told Australian Broadcasting Corp. 'The violence is from the colonizer being in that room asserting his authority, being paid for by every taxpayer in this country.' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wants Australia to become a republic but has ruled out a referendum during his first three-year term. A vote remains a possibility if his center-left Labor Party wins elections due by May next year. Australians decided in a referendum in 1999 to retain Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. That result is widely regarded to have been the consequence of disagreement about how a president would be chosen rather than majority support for a monarch. Sydney University royal historian Cindy McCreery suspects Australia is not yet ready to make the change. 'There's interest in becoming a republic, but I think what we may forget is that logistically speaking we're not going to have a referendum on that issue any time soon,' McCreery said. 'I, as a historian, think that it's probably not realistic to expect a successful referendum on a republic until we've done more work on acknowledging our ... complicated history,' she said. 'Becoming a republic doesn't mean that we've somehow thrown off British colonialism. It hopefully has meant that we're engaging with our own history in an honest and thoughtful way,' she added. Charles and Camilla’s Tuesday began watching Indigenous dancers perform at a Sydney Indigenous community center. The couple used tongs to cook sausages at a community barbecue lunch at the central suburb of Parramatta and later shook the hands of well-wishers for the last time of their visit outside the Sydney Opera House. Their final engagement was an inspection of navy ships on Sydney Harbor in an event known as a fleet review. Charles's trip to Australia was scaled down because he is undergoing cancer treatment. He arrives in Samoa on Wednesday.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-king-charles-republic-monarchy-2bdb86c1e7e492f4447288efd84c74ed	2024-10-21T18:22:50-07:00	
Two plead guilty to murder of former Air India suspect Ripudaman Singh Mali	NEW WESTMINSTER, British Columbia (AP) — Two men accused of killing of former Air India bombing suspect Ripudaman Singh Malik have pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in a Canadian court. The courthouse in New Westminster, British Columbia, confirmed the pleas on Monday from Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez in the shooting death of Malik, who was acquitted in 2005 of the bombings that killed 331 people in 1985. Fox and Lopez, who were originally charged with first-degree murder, will next appear in court on Oct. 31 for sentencing. In a statement, Malik’s family said while the family is 'grateful' that Fox and Lopez were brought to justice, they are urging the two men to cooperate with police 'in bringing those that hired you to justice.' Malik, 75, was shot dead in his vehicle outside his business in Surrey, British Columbia, on July 14, 2022. He was a one-time supporter of the separatist Khalistan movement in India. Malik and a co-defendant were found not guilty of murder and conspiracy in the 1985 Air India bombings. A high-altitude bombing of one plane caused it to crash in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 passengers and crew. The terror attack was the worst act of mass murder in Canadian history. Roughly one hour later, a bomb destined for another Air India plane exploded prematurely at an airport in Japan, killing two baggage handlers. Inderjit Singh Reyat, the only man convicted in the bombings, testified for the prosecution at Malik and Bagri’s trial and was later convicted of perjury. The alleged suspects in the bombings were Sikhs in the Khalistan movement, an effort to create a separate homeland for Sikhs in India’s Punjab state. Police said before charging Fox and Lopez that people waited for hours in a vehicle for Malik before the shooting. Malik’s son, Jaspreet Singh Malik, has said family members had never heard of Fox or Lopez, and he did not know why anyone would kill his father. In the latest statement, the Malik family called the killing an assassination without identifying who they believe to be involved. 'Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez were hired to commit this murder,' the statement said. 'Until the parties responsible for hiring them and directing this assassination are brought to justice, the work remains incomplete. 'To Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez we say: You have taken a good first step in taking responsibility for your actions. Now take the next step and co-operate with the RCMP in bringing those that hired you to justice.' Earlier this month, Royal Canadian Mounted Commissioner Mike Duheme said the force had launched a special unit to investigate multiple cases of extortion, coercion and violence, including murders, linked to agents of the Indian government. Duheme said the RCMP were speaking out due to what it deemed as a serious threat to public safety. Canada expelled six Indian diplomats who police have named as persons of interest in the cases. They were not specific about which murders may be involved in the allegations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Parliament last year that there was credible intelligence linking India’s government to the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a temple leader shot while in his truck in the parking lot of the gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia. Four men have been charged in that murder. Police are alleging that diplomats used their position to collect information on Canadians within the Khalistan movement. Mounties alleged the diplomats passed the information on to criminal gangs who targeted individuals directly, allegations that India has denied. Court documents show both Fox and Lopez have previous criminal records.	https://apnews.com/article/air-india-bombing-suspect-murder-canada-98257bb3ff8522ee4aaa3901353eff3f	2024-10-21T17:21:22-07:00	
Peru’s ex-president Toledo gets more than 20 years in prison in case linked to corruption scandal	LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peru’s former President Alejandro Toledo on Monday was sentenced to 20 years and six months in prison in a case involving Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht, which became synonymous with corruption across Latin America, where it paid millions of dollars in bribes to government officials and others. Authorities accused Toledo of accepting $35 million in bribes from Odebrecht in exchange for allowing the construction of a highway in the South American country. The National Superior Court of Specialized Criminal Justice in the capital, Lima, imposed the sentence after years of legal wrangling, including a dispute over whether Toledo, who governed Peru from 2001 to 2006, could be extradited from the United States. Judge Inés Rojas said Toledo’s victims were Peruvians who 'trusted' him as their president. Rojas explained that in that role, Toledo was 'in charge of managing public finances' and responsible for 'protecting and ensuring the correct' use of resources. Instead, she said, he 'defrauded the state.' She added that Toledo 'had the duty to act with absolute neutrality, protect and preserve the assets of the state, avoiding their abuse or exploitation,' but he did not do so. Odebrecht, which built some of Latin America’s most crucial infrastructure projects, admitted to U.S. authorities in 2016 to having bought government contracts throughout the region with generous bribes. The investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice spun probes in several countries, including Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador. In Peru, authorities accused Toledo and three other former presidents of receiving payments from the construction giant. They alleged Toledo received $35 million from Odebrecht in exchange for the contract to build 650 kilometers (403 miles) of a highway linking Brazil with southern Peru. That portion of the highway was initially estimated to cost $507 million, but Peru ended up paying $1.25 billion. Rojas at one point read parts of the testimony from Jorge Barata, a former Odebrecht executive in Peru, who told prosecutors that the former president called him up to three times after leaving office to demand that he be paid. Toledo lowered his gaze and looked at his hands as Rojas read the expletive-laden remarks that Barata recounted to prosecutors. Toledo has denied the accusations against him. His attorney, Roberto Siu, told reporters after the hearing that they will appeal the sentence. The former president on Monday frequently smirked, and at times laughed, particularly when the judge mentioned multimillion-dollar sums central to the case as well as when she struggled to read transcripts and other evidence in the case. Throughout the hearing, he also leaned to his right to speak with his attorney. In contrast, last week, he asked the court with a broken voice and his hands together, as if he were praying, to let him return home citing his age, cancer and heart problems. Toledo, 78, was first arrested in 2019 at his home in California, where he had been living since 2016, when he returned to Stanford University, his alma mater, as a visiting scholar to study education in Latin America. He was initially held in solitary confinement at a county jail east of San Francisco but was released to house arrest in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and his deteriorating mental health. He was extradited to Peru in 2022 after a court of appeals denied a challenge to his extradition and he surrendered to authorities. He has since remained under preventive detention. Rojas said Toledo will get credit for time served starting in April 2023. He will serve the remainder of his sentence at a prison on the outskirts of Lima that was built specifically to house former Peruvian presidents. Prosecutor José Domingo Pérez after the hearing described the sentence as 'historic' and said it shows Peruvians that 'crimes and corruption are punished.' Odebrecht rebranded as Novonor in 2020. ____ Garcia Cano reported from Mexico City. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/peru-toledo-prison-sentence-odebrecht-5f23c3d8fd176dfc6ca8125e96b2e3ec	2024-10-21T14:11:02-07:00	
Hundreds mourn Catholic priest and Indigenous peace activist killed in southern Mexico	SAN ANDRES LARRAINZAR, Mexico (AP) — Hundreds gathered Monday to mourn Catholic priest Marcelo Pérez, an activist for Indigenous peoples and farm laborers who was killed in the southern Mexico state of Chiapas. It was a killing that many say was a tragedy foretold, in a state where drug cartels have caused thousands of people to flee their homes. Mourners gathered in San Andres Larrainzar, near the city of San Cristobal de las Casas, where Pérez was killed on Sunday. Pérez, a leading activist for peace in the violence-torn state, was from San Andrés Larrainzar. A mass in his honor Monday was held in Spanish and Tzotzil, the Indigenous language he spoke. Pérez, 50, had often received threats, but nonetheless continued to work as a peace activist. Human rights advocates said Pérez did not receive the government protection he needed. 'For years, we insisted that the Mexican government should address the threats and aggressions against him, but they never implemented measures to guarantee his life, security and well-being,' The Fray Bartolome de las Casas human rights center wrote. While there was no immediate information on the killers — President Claudia Sheinbaum only said that 'investigations are being carried out' — Rev. Pérez's peace and mediation efforts may have angered one of the two drug cartels that are currently fighting for control of Chiapas. The state is a lucrative route for smuggling both drugs and migrants. 'Father Marcelo Pérez was the subject of constant threats and aggressions on the part of organized crime groups,' according to the rights center, adding that his killing 'occurred in the context of a serious escalation of violence against the public in all the regions of Chiapas.' For at least the last two years, the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels have been engaged in bloody turf battles that involve killing whole families, and forcing villagers to take sides in the dispute. Hundreds of Chiapas residents have had to flee to neighboring Guatemala for their own safety. 'They should look for an intelligent way to disarm those groups,' said Cardinal Felipe Arizmendi, who once served as the bishop for the area. 'They shouldn't wait for people to file complaints, and people are going to file complaints because their lives are at risk.' Together with continued drug violence in the northern state of Sinaloa, and the army killings of six migrants earlier this month, the killing of Pérez was another embarrassment for the government. Sheinbaum took office Oct. 1 and has pledged to follow the policy of her predecessor and mentor, former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, of not confronting the drug cartels. The policy has failed to significantly reduce violence. 'This is a reflection of the whole country,' Cardinal Arizmendi said following the mass for Pérez. 'They shouldn't say everything is fine in Mexico. Please.' he continued. 'This strategy has not worked.' The state prosecutors’ office said Rev. Pérez was shot dead by two gunmen when he was in his van, just after he had finished celebrating Mass.

A New Zealand airport wants you to hug goodbye faster	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Emotional farewells are a common sight at airports, but travelers leaving the New Zealand city of Dunedin will have to be quick. A new three-minute time limit on goodbye hugs in the airport's drop-off area is intended to prevent lingering cuddles from causing traffic jams. 'Max hug time three minutes,' warn signs outside the terminal, adding that those seeking 'fonder farewells' should head to the airport’s parking lot instead. The cuddle cap was imposed in September to 'keep things moving smoothly' in the redesigned passenger drop-off area outside the airport, CEO Dan De Bono told The Associated Press on Tuesday. It was the airport’s way of reminding people that the zone was for 'quick farewells' only. The signs had polarized social media users, De Bono said. 'We were accused of breaching basic human rights and how dare we limit how long someone can have a hug for,' he said, adding that others had welcomed the change. The signs were meant as an alternative to those at other airports warning of wheel clamping or fines for drivers parked in drop-off areas. Some in Britain have imposed fees for all drop-offs — however brief. Dunedin's airport — a modest terminal serving a city of 135,000 people on New Zealand's South Island — preferred a 'quirky' approach, De Bono said. Three minutes was 'plenty of time to pull up, say farewell to your loved ones and move on,' he said. 'The time limit is really a nicer way of saying, you know, get on with it.' A 20-second hug is long enough to release the wellbeing-boosting hormones oxytocin and serotonin, De Bono said. Anything longer was 'really awkward.' But passengers need not worry unduly about enforcement. 'We do not have hug police,' De Bono said. Visitors might, however, be asked to move their lingering embraces to the parking lot, where they can cuddle free of charge for up to 15 minutes.	https://apnews.com/article/new-zealand-airport-goodbye-hugs-time-limit-d6176082ffb6ab66e8d2f05dd590b8aa	2024-10-21T13:23:53-07:00	
President Paul Biya returns to Cameroon amid rumors his health is failing	YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) — Cameroon’s President Paul Biya returned to his home country after weeks abroad amid rumors that his health is failing, a state-run television station reported Monday. The 91-year-old president of the West African country appeared on television at the airport in the capital Yaounde, shaking hands with officials next to his wife Chantal and greeted by a cheering crowd of supporters. 'Finally, this is not a phantom, it is President Paul Piya having a lengthy discussion with government officials,' a presenter from the state-run broadcaster Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV) said. Questions about Biya's health and whereabouts grew after he was last seen in public at the China-Africa summit in Beijing a month ago. Since then, he has not attended gatherings where he had been expected, including the United Nations General Assembly and the International Organization of La Francophonie summit in France. Biya, who is known for traveling often to Europe, is known to be sick but no details have been publicly shared. Biya is Africa’s second-longest-serving leader and Cameroon’s second president since independence in 1960. He has been in power since 1982. He is the only leader many in the country have ever known. His government faces various challenges, including the secessionist movement in Cameroon’s English-speaking provinces that has resulted in deadly clashes with security forces as well as Islamic extremist violence by the Boko Haram group based in neighboring Nigeria.	https://apnews.com/article/cameroon-president-biya-return-health-60c15abc848d5de766b72c1139d147f3	2024-10-21T10:41:44-07:00	
What is the Hezbollah-linked financial institution Israel is targeting in Lebanon?	BEIRUT (AP) — The Israeli military has carried out a wave of airstrikes targeting branches of a financial institution affiliated with Lebanon’s Hezbollah, saying the quasi-banking system is being used to fund the militant group's military wing. The strikes destroyed more than a dozen branches of al-Qard al-Hasan across Lebanon Sunday night, and came two weeks after an airstrike killed the man who many referred to as Hezbollah’s 'finance minister.' After assassinating most of Hezbollah’s top political and military commanders, including the group’s longtime leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and pummeling its communities with devastating airstrikes, Israel says it is now going after the Shiite group’s funders and financial institutions in an attempt to further disrupt it and its base of support. Hezbollah started attacking Israeli military posts along the border with Lebanon a day after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostage. Hezbollah said that by launching attacks along the Lebanon-Israel border it was backing up its Hamas allies in the Gaza Strip. What is al-Qard al-Hasan and who benefits from it? Al-Qard al-Hasan is officially a non-profit charity institution operating outside the Lebanese financial system, and one of the tools by which Hezbollah entrenches its support among the country’s Shiite population. In addition to its military wing, Hezbollah has branches that run schools, hospitals, low-price grocery stores, as well as al-Qard al-Hasan, from which hundreds of thousands of its supporters benefit. Israel says the institution finances arms purchases and is used to pay Hezbollah fighters. The U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on it since 2007, saying it is 'used by Hezbollah as a cover' to manage the militant group’s financial activities 'and gain access to the international financial system.' Founded four decades ago, soon after Hezbollah’s inception, the association, whose name in Arabic means 'the benevolent loan,' offers interest-free loans and allows people to deposit gold as collateral in return for the credit, enabling them to pay for school fees and weddings, buy a car or open a small business. People can also open savings accounts. Al-Qard al-Hasan has more than 30 branches around Lebanon. Following Lebanon’s 2019 financial collapse, the institution provided a lifeline for many Lebanese. Unlike banks around the country that imposed limits on how much people could withdraw from their bank accounts, people with deposits at al-Qard al-Hasan were still able to withdraw their cash. In 2021, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on seven individuals in connection with Hezbollah and al-Qard al-Hasan. A year later, the Biden administration slapped terrorism sanctions on two others, including al-Qard al-Hasan’s director, Adel Mansour, and two companies in Lebanon for providing Hezbollah with financial services. Mansour did not respond to messages left by The Associated Press for comment. After sanctions were imposed against him two years, he told the AP: 'I am proud and this is a medal of honor for me.' A senior official at the central bank in Beirut refused to comment about the Israeli targeting of al-Qard al-Hasan branches when contacted by the AP on Monday. David Asher, an expert on illicit financing who has worked at the U.S. Defense and State Departments and is now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said the Israeli attacks were 'a big deal.' 'Al-Qard al-Hasan is part of Hezbollah’s central financial unit,' which is akin to its treasury, he said. Faysal Abdul-Sater, a Lebanese political analyst who closely follows Hezbollah’s affairs, said the militant group is not funded through al-Qard al-Hasan. He said the money deposited at the institution belongs to individuals and companies, and the system benefits people with low incomes. 'This is a symbolic strike,' Abdul-Sater said about targeting al-Qard al-Hasan. How harmful are the Israeli strikes? The systematic destruction of al-Qard al-Hasan branches, coming after assassinations that took out almost all of Hezbollah’s top leadership and displaced hundreds of thousands of the group’s supporters, is bound to add to the chaos and fears within Hezbollah’s base of support. But experts say it is unlikely to harm Hezbollah's finances in and of itself. Al-Qard al-Hasan tried to reassure customers, saying in a statement late Sunday that it had evacuated all its branches and relocated gold and other deposits to safe areas. Lebanese economist Louis Hobeika said destroying al-Qard al-Hasan branches will have no effect on Hezbollah’s funding as its money comes from Iran and wealthy supporters around the world. The group's salaries are known to be paid in cash in dollars. 'As long as Iran and Hezbollah’s allies are funding the group it will not be affected,' Hobeika said, adding that the flow of 'bags of cash' from abroad will continue just like in the past. Lina Khatib, an associate fellow at Chatham House who focuses on the Middle East, said al-Qard al-Hasan customers still have faith that 'Hezbollah will be able to compensate them for their losses.' Khatib noted that al-Qard al-Hasan's operations, like those of any financial institution, are not limited to any physical assets the strikes targeted. A Lebanese woman who gave only her first name, Zahraa, for safety reasons, said she was in need of cash and deposited a gold necklace and several rings earlier this year in return for an $800 loan. The woman said she has been repaying it in $50 monthly installments. 'I don’t care whether I get the gold or not at a time when men are sacrificing their souls in south Lebanon,' Zahraa said referring to Hezbollah gunmen who are fighting invading Israeli forces. Who was the Hezbollah financier killed? Israel began going after Hezbollah's finances earlier this month, when an Israeli airstrike destroyed the top two floors of a south Beirut building, killing Mohammed Jaafar Qassir, who the U.S. Treasury and Israel accused of transferring hundreds of millions of dollars from Iran to Hezbollah over the years. The U.S. had offered $10 million for information leading to the disruption of the financial mechanisms of Hezbollah. The U.S. Treasury said Qassir provided funding for Hezbollah operations through a number of 'illegal smuggling and procurement activities and other criminal enterprises.' It added that Qassir was also a critical conduit for financial disbursements from the powerful Quds Force branch of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard that are used to fund Hezbollah’s activities. The Israeli military said Qassir was in charge of Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, which ships weapons from Iran to Lebanon, and supervised Hezbollah’s development of precision-guided missiles. Hezbollah did not comment on Qassir’s killing. Days after Qassir was killed in Beirut, an airstrike in Damascus, Syria, blamed on Israel killed his brother Hasan, who was married to Nasrallah’s daughter, Zeinab. ____ Associated Press writers Adam Schreck in Jerusalem and Mohammad Zaatari in Sidon, Lebanon, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/alqard-alhassan-hezbollah-lebanon-israel-airstrikes-67220b894b55500b0be799a0be4245c3	2024-10-21T08:40:11-07:00	
Finnish conductor and composer Segerstam will be honored with a tribute event after his funeral	HELSINKI (AP) — The prolific Finnish conductor and composer Leif Segerstam, who was one of the most colorful personalities in the Nordic country’s classical music scene, will be remembered in a tribute event at the Finnish National Opera following his funeral next month, his family said Monday. His son Jan Segerstam told The Associated Press that the Nov. 8 memorial for his father, who died in Helsinki on Oct. 9 at age 80 from complications following pneumonia, will showcase his musical history. He said it will include musical tributes for the artist who composed his first work at age 6 and was also a violinist. As a composer, Segerstam became known for creating 371 symphonies, which he claimed was a world record. The large number is partly explained by the brevity of many works. Even illness didn’t stop his composing. 'He was creating music at the hospital, together with visiting music friends, still a few days before his death,' his son said. The last symphony created by Segerstam premiered in Helsinki during his 80th birthday in March. In an interview by Finnish news agency STT to mark his birthday, he said conducting an orchestra supported his composer’s work, as it gives 'a deeper knowledge of the soul life of the tunes.' From 1963 on, he conducted a variety of orchestras in Europe, including the Finnish National Opera, the Royal Swedish Opera, the Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra. He also guest-conducted for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Born in the coastal city of Vaasa in western Finland, Segerstam was brought up in a musical family. He initially trained as a violinist and pianist and studied at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki and The Juilliard School in New York. From 1997 until 2013, he was a professor of orchestra conducting at the Sibelius Academy, where his students included now-prominent Finnish and international conductors. 'Leif was a very colorful human being,' his son said. 'He was a peculiar person who lived through the feelings of his music. That was his context. For many people coming from a more conventional background, he seemed to be an eccentric.' Segerstam was married and divorced twice and is survived by five children from the two marriages.	https://apnews.com/article/leif-segerstam-finland-obituary-composer-music-4714857dddcf924bfb9f103312c879cc	2024-10-21T08:33:33-07:00	
Russia investigates the claimed shoot-down of a cargo jet in Sudan's Darfur region	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces said Monday they shot down a cargo jet in the country’s far western reaches of Darfur, a claim that Russian diplomats said they were trying to investigate in the war zone. Mobile phone footage showed what appeared to be a debris field with fighters from the paramilitary force, known as the RSF, showing off what appeared to be identity documents recovered from the crash. However, documents also shown in the footage from the crash site suggest the aircraft was affiliated with an airline previously linked to an effort by the United Arab Emirates to arm the RSF in the war, something that has been strenuously denied by the UAE despite evidence. A message from Russia's Embassy in Khartoum confirmed its diplomats were investigating the incident in Sudan's Malha region in northern Darfur near the border with Chad. The embassy's message said Russians may have been on board at the time. The RSF has been at war with the Sudanese army since April 2023.The paramilitary force claimed in a statement it shot down a 'foreign warplane' that had been aiding the Sudanese military. It alleged without providing evidence that the aircraft had been dropping 'barrel bombs' on civilians. 'All foreign mercenaries aboard the aircraft were eliminated in the operation,' the statement said. Mobile phone footage showed fighters among the burning wreckage, claiming they shot down the aircraft with a surface-to-air missile. Identity documents shown included a Russian passport and an ID that linked back to a UAE-based company, whose phone number was disconnected. A crumpled safety card, also purportedly from the aircraft, identified the plane as an Ilyushin Il-76 flown by New Way Cargo of Kyrgyzstan. Civil aviation officials in Kyrgyzstan did not respond to a request for comment late Monday. The group Conflict Observatory, which is funded by the U.S. State Department and has been monitoring the Sudan war, linked New Way Cargo's Ilyushin Il-76s to arming the RSF in a report this month. It said the airline had facilitated the UAE arms transfers through flights to Aéroport International Maréchal Idriss Deby in Amdjarass, Chad — flights the UAE has claimed have been for supporting a local hospital. Amdjarass is just across the border from Malha, where the shoot-down reportedly happened. 'The UAE has used the airport as a waypoint to facilitate weapons to the RSF,' the report said, noting that the Emirates offered a $1.5 billion loan to rapidly expand the airport. 'Absent evidence of a significant local humanitarian crisis and a lack of significant Sudanese refugees in the area casts significant doubt on the UAE’s claims that the airport construction is only for a hospital.' United Nations experts have said accusations that the UAE armed the RSF were 'credible.' Emirati officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the reported plane shoot-down. Sudan's war has killed over 24,000 people so far, according to the group Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, which has been monitoring the violence since the conflict's start. The Sudanese army has been pursuing an intensified offensive near Khartoum, while forces allied with it have been battling the RSF in Darfur. Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. The short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when two generals, the army's chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF, joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021. They began battling each other in 2023. Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in Darfur with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. say the RSF and allied Arab militias again are attacking ethnic African groups in the war. ___ Associated Press writer Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/sudan-cargo-jet-shot-down-russia-rsf-war-2ddf073f44918eacd3d09357f0d39529	2024-10-21T08:25:32-07:00	
Biden is 'deeply concerned' about the release of secret documents on Israel's possible attack plans	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is 'deeply concerned' about the unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel's preparation for a potential retaliatory attack on Iran, a White House spokesman said Monday. The Biden administration is still not certain if the classified information was leaked or hacked, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. Officials don’t have any indication at this point of 'additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,' he said. Kirby added that the Pentagon is investigating. U.S. officials on Saturday had confirmed an investigation by the administration. 'We’re deeply concerned, and the president remains deeply concerned about any leakage of classified information into the public domain. That is not supposed to happen, and it’s unacceptable when it does,' Kirby said. The documents are attributed to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, and note that Israel was still moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran’s blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' an intelligence alliance comprised of the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Marked top secret, the documents first appeared online Friday on the Telegram messaging app and quickly spread among Telegram channels popular with Iranians. Analysts at the SITE Intelligence Group, a consultancy that monitors and analyzes online threats from extremist groups, tracked the release of the documents to a Telegram channel popular with Iran-backed militias. The channel contained posts from an anonymous user with a long history of posting other supposedly top-secret content who said they had access to the documents. The user also wrote that they had sold some of the material and provided it to the Iranian military. The Telegram channel identifies itself as being based in Tehran, Iran’s capital. It previously published memes featuring Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and material in support of Tehran’s self-described 'Axis of Resistance,' which includes Middle East militant groups armed by the Islamic Republic. One of the two documents resembled the style of other material from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency leaked by Jack Teixeira, an Air National Guardsman who pleaded guilty in March to leaking highly classified military documents about Russia’s war on Ukraine and other national security secrets. The release comes at a pivotal time in the Middle East, as Israel considers its response to Iran's attack. The U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and press for a cease-fire in Gaza and has likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand military operations in the north in Lebanon and risk a wider regional war. However, Israel’s leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let Iran’s missile attack go unanswered. The investigation into the release of the documents may take some time as authorities look for digital or physical clues that could reveal how the information got out, and what implications it may have for information management and intelligence sharing with U.S. allies, according to Gavin Wilde, a senior fellow in the Technology and International Affairs Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'I imagine they'll eventually get to the bottom of it,' said Wilde, who formerly worked on the National Security Council. 'The intelligence community has gotten a lot better at digital chain of custody — who has seen a particular document, how many times it's been shared, and with whom.' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday declined to comment on what changes the government has made to better safeguard top secret information in the aftermath of the Discord leak. She added that Biden has 'complete confidence' in the Pentagon, Justice Department and intelligence community following the latest unauthorized disclosure. The nation's spy agencies have worked to bolster cybersecurity since the Discord leak and the conviction of former NSA contractor Reality Winner. Accounting for human behavior, however, can be a harder challenge, according to Shawnee Delaney, a former officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency who is now CEO of the Vaillance Group, a private threat analysis firm. 'Cybersecurity isn’t just a technological issue,' Delaney told The Associated Press. 'It’s a human one, and humans are wholly unpredictable.' Spokespeople for the Pentagon and the NSA said officials were aware of the incident but had no further comment.	https://apnews.com/article/united-states-israel-iran-classified-documents-5cc9b0f30b7119a039d122599bf0c285	2024-10-21T07:39:24-07:00	
Slovakia and former Czech leader settle lawsuit over collaboration with communist secret police	PRAGUE (AP) — Slovakia’s Interior Ministry agreed in a lawsuit settlement Monday that former former Czech populist Prime Minister Andrej Babis did not knowingly collaborate with communist-era secret police in what was then Czechoslovakia The ministry said it acknowledged that any interpretations of documents in the archives of the StB secret police agency that Babis was a secret agent were unjustified Babis welcomed the settlement of a case that dated to 2012. 'I had no doubt that I’d win the dispute,' he said. Babis, who was born in Slovakia, was originally suing the Institute for National Memory, which holds parts of his secret police files following the division of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993. In a decision published on Feb. 1, Slovakia’s Constitutional Court, the highest legal authority in the country, upheld the previous rulings by lower courts dismissing the case. Some of the files were destroyed, but the institute said those that still exist contain evidence that Babis was an agent under the code name 'Bures' from 1982. Babis vehemently denied that. The regional court in the capital, Bratislava, originally rejected the lawsuit in 2018, but the Constitutional Court ordered a retrial, saying the institute could not be sued and the respondent should be the Slovak Interior Ministry. The ministry said its decision was based on two legal analyses of the case. Babis, a billionaire, is currently in opposition after his populist ANO centrist movement lost the 2021 parliamentary election. He was running to become the Czech president in the election for the largely ceremonial post in January last year but lost to Petr Pavel, a retired army general.	https://apnews.com/article/slovakia-babis-secret-police-collaboration-case-df786bf38b9e0d0acd9e20c1aa9c6f0d	2024-10-21T07:33:20-07:00	
London police officer who fatally shot a Black motorist is acquitted of murder	LONDON (AP) — A London police officer who fatally shot a Black motorist two years ago was acquitted Monday of murder in a case that intensified mistrust of Britain's largest police force among many in the city’s Black communities. Metropolitan Police marksman Martyn Blake, 40, was cleared by a London jury in the death of Chris Kaba, who was unarmed but was driving a vehicle that had been involved in a shooting a day earlier. Kaba, 24, was shot in the head after the vehicle was boxed in by two police cars on a narrow residential street in the Streatham Hill neighborhood on Sept. 5, 2022. Blake fired a single round through the windshield of the Audi because he thought fellow officers’ lives were in danger when Kaba began ramming the police cars in an attempt to break free. A prosecutor said Blake misjudged the risk to his colleagues, exaggerated the threat in statements after the shooting and aimed for Kaba's head. Blake denied those assertions. The shooting renewed racism allegations against the Met police, also known as Scotland Yard, as it had been trying to restore confidence following a series of scandals and an independent review that found it mired in sexism, homophobia and institutional racism. The rare decision to prosecute Blake, who had been suspended, created a backlash from some of his specially trained firearms colleagues who refused to carry their weapons in a show of solidarity. The Met was briefly forced to call on neighboring departments and the military for backup. Fatal shootings by police in the U.K. are rare. In the year to March 2023, officers in England and Wales who are authorized to carry a gun fired their weapons at people 10 times and killed three, according to official statistics. Prosecutions of British officers for murder or manslaughter for actions performed on duty are exceptionally rare. Jurors in London's Central Criminal Court deliberated for about three hours before finding Blake not guilty. Blake let out a puff of relief as the verdict was read. Kaba’s family, seated in the courtroom, showed no visible reaction. The family later said they were devastated and would continue to fight for justice. 'The not guilty verdict leaves us with the deep pain of injustice adding to the unbearable sorrow we have felt since Chris was killed,' the family said in a statement issued by the justice advocacy group Inquest. 'Chris was stolen from us, and this decision shows his life — and many others like him — does not matter to the system. Our son deserved better.' Prosecutors said their thoughts were with the Kaba family, but they respected the jury’s decision. 'We recognize that firearms officers operate under enormous pressure, but it is our responsibility to put cases before a jury that meet our test for prosecution, and we are satisfied that test was met in this case,' Frank Ferguson, head of the Crown Prosecution Service Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said Blake paid 'a huge personal and professional sacrifice' for 'a split-second decision on what he believed was necessary to protect his colleagues and to protect London.' Defense lawyer Patrick Gibbs said during his closing argument that Blake was not a 'RoboCop with total vision and nanosecond reactions like a computer.' 'He is not a robot, he is a human being with a human brain who did this to the best of his ability,' Gibbs said. Another firearms officer said he would have taken the shot if Blake had not and another said he was fractions of a second from pulling the trigger.	https://apnews.com/article/london-police-officer-acquitted-shooting-black-man-4d0fb07a538bad09f14fc3b238d23f8a	2024-10-21T06:24:04-07:00	
Police in Mozambique fire tear gas at opposition politician as post-election tensions soar	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Police in Mozambique fired tear gas at the country's leading opposition politician and supporters as he spoke with reporters Monday, forcing them to run for cover as the nation remains on edge following a disputed election and the slaying of two prominent opposition figures. Venancio Mondlane, the main challenger to the decades-long governing party in the Oct. 9 presidential election, was giving interviews on a road in the capital, Maputo, near the spot where his lawyer and a senior opposition party official were killed in their car by unidentified gunmen Friday night. Police officers fired tear gas in Mondlane's direction, according to a video posted on his Facebook page. The video shows Mondlane, aides, supporters and journalists running as tear gas canisters land around them. One journalist was injured, according to local media. Mondlane previously called for a nationwide shutdown and urged people to stay away from work on Monday in protest at what he and other parties have called fraudulent elections. He and some supporters had planned to gather near the site of the killings to protest. Police fired tear gas at protesters earlier in the day. The election is likely to see the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique party, or Frelimo, extend its 49-year rule since the southern African country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. The final results are expected later this week, but official preliminary results show Frelimo candidate Daniel Chapo with a comfortable lead on Mondlane, who ran as an independent but was supported by the new Podesa opposition party. If he wins, Chapo would succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served the allowed two terms. The killings of the opposition figures heightened tensions following the election. Podesa said Mondlane’s lawyer and the party’s top spokesperson were chased down by gunmen in two vehicles who sprayed their car with bullets. The attack is widely viewed in Mozambique as politically motivated. Mondlane's lawyer, Elvino Dias, was closely involved in preparations to challenge the election results at the supreme electoral body. The European Union, which sent a team of election observers, called for an immediate investigation into the killings 'that will bring to justice those responsible for this outrageous crime.' The killings were also condemned by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. Frelimo has often been accused of rigging elections, which it has denied, while Mozambique's security forces have been criticized for clamping down on dissent and breaking up peaceful protests with deadly force. Mondlane told reporters that police had tried to keep him at his house and prevent him from joining the protests on Monday. 'The whole of last night, police cars were at my doorstep,' he said. 'I was trying to find other ways to leave the house without being noticed. I did. I won’t say how.' ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-protests-police-opposition-95f53c6b33b6685dc196e87d3baca5d8	2024-10-21T04:49:17-07:00	
Police in Haiti battle gang coalition trying to seize control of the entire capital	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Police on Monday clashed with gunmen trying to take over one of the few communities in Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, that is not controlled by gangs. Solino has been under attack since Thursday, with residents calling radio stations pleading for help as they fled their homes. Officers have seized control of several areas in Solino as they keep pursuing gang members, Haiti’s National Police said in a statement late Sunday. In a video posted on social media, gang members hoisted automatic weapons in the air and cheered as they claimed control over parts of Solino, warning that all those who are not part of a gang coalition known as 'Viv Ansanm' will be 'burned to ashes.' The coalition also has attacked other neighborhoods, including Tabarre 27, forcing hundreds of residents to flee in recent days. Gangs that control 80% of Port-au-Prince also have threatened journalists covering the most recent attacks, calling them out by name and ordering that they be killed. Viv Ansanm, which means 'Living Together,' formed in September 2023, creating a coalition between two large gang federations that were enemies. It was responsible for launching large-scale attacks on critical government infrastructure starting in February, eventually leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry. The coalition also has unified to fight a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence in Haiti that began earlier this year. After the coalition was formed, armed clashes between gangs fell by 78% from March to August, compared with the previous six months, according to a report published this month by ACLED, a U.S. nonprofit that collects data on violent conflicts worldwide. 'The consolidation of the Viv Ansanm alliance has enabled gangs to focus their resources on criminal activities and confrontations with security forces, rather than engaging in infighting,' it said. The report also warned that 'despite the volatile relationships among gang members, Viv Ansanm is likely to endure as long as it faces the shared threat of an international security force.'	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gangs-violence-solino-un-mission-c6bea0069973d723d51d23cbd9110e49	2024-10-21T03:29:06-07:00

In 388 places across the U.S. where English isn’t the primary language among communities of voters, the federal Voting Rights Act requires that all elections information be made available in each community’s native language. Such translations are meant to help non-native English speakers understand what they’re voting for. But vague or technical terms can be challenging, even more so when it comes to Indigenous languages that have only limited written dictionaries. For example, there’s no single word for abortion in the native language of the Ute Mountain Ute tribe in Colorado’s Montezuma County. New York’s referendum doesn’t even use the word 'abortion,' making it all the more challenging to convey intent, advocates complain. And how exactly should the science of 'viability' in the Florida and Nevada measures be explained in the oral traditions of the Seminole and Shoshone tribes? The Navajo and Hopi tribes get more material translated than most, and they have more than enough voters to sway outcomes. ▶ Read more about translating ballot measures into other languages. Most voters think the economy is poor, but split on whether Trump or Harris can fix it: AP-NORC poll Voters remain largely divided over whether they prefer Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris to handle key economic issues, although Harris earns slightly better marks on elements such as taxes for the middle class, according to a new poll. A majority of registered voters in the survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research describe the economy as poor. About 7 in 10 say the nation is going in the wrong direction. But the findings reaffirm that Trump has lost what had been an advantage on the economy, which many voters say is the most important issue this election season above abortion, immigration, crime and foreign affairs. 'Do I trust Trump on the economy? No. I trust that he’ll give tax cuts to his buddies like Elon Musk,' said poll respondent Janice Tosto, a 59-year-old Philadelphia woman and self-described independent. An AP-NORC poll conducted in September found neither Harris nor Trump had a clear advantage on handling 'the economy and jobs.' But this poll asked more specific questions about whether voters trusted Trump or Harris to do a better job handling the cost of housing, jobs and unemployment, taxes on the middle class, the cost of groceries and gas, and tariffs. ▶ Read more about the poll. Trump takes questions at a barbershop in the Bronx Donald Trump went to a barbershop in the Bronx section of New York for a segment with commentator Lawrence Jones that aired Monday on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' He took questions from clients at the business about immigration, energy and taxes. The barbers wore a black shirt with the phrase 'Make Barbers Great Again.' One of the clients asked Trump if, once he generated enough revenue with some of his proposals, it would be possible to eliminate federal taxes. 'There is a way. There is a way,' Trump said, adding that in the 1890s, people did not have to pay income taxes. The business owner, who leases the building, told him his main challenge was paying for his energy bill, which had shot up from $2,100 to $15,000 in the last seven months. 'What?' Trump said. 'How many heads can you take care of? That’s a lot.' Trump asked how much average hair cuts cost and how much they had gone up. He was told they had gone up from a range between $12 and $15 to between $30 and $40. Toward the end of the visit, Trump told the men 'you guys are the same as me. It’s the same stuff. We were born the same way.' Some Jewish voters in presidential swing states reconsider their longtime devotion to Democrats For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump. It’s in her Facebook feed. It’s in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It’s in her own family. 'The family that is my generation and older generations, I don’t think anybody is voting for Harris, and we’ve never voted Republican, ever,' Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. 'My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.' How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she’s an exception. Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas’ brutal attack on Israelis last year. ▶ Read more about Jewish voters in this election.	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-2024-6d5141e5ce6be797fc4d65ae9be34a65	2024-10-21T03:22:08-07:00	
Today in History: October 27, 11 killed in Pittsburgh synagogue shooting	Today is Sunday, Oct. 27, the 301st day of 2024. There are 65 days left in the year. Today in history: On Oct. 27, 2018, a gunman shot and killed 11 congregants and wounded six others at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history; authorities said the suspect, Robert Bowers, raged against Jews during and after the rampage. (Bowers was convicted and sentenced to death in 2023.) Also on this date: In 1787, the first of the Federalist Papers, a series of essays calling for ratification of the United States Constitution, was published. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was shot down while flying over Cuba, killing the pilot, U.S. Air Force Maj. Rudolf Anderson Jr. In 1995, a sniper killed one soldier and wounded 18 others at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. (Paratrooper William J. Kreutzer was convicted in the shootings and condemned to death; the sentence was later commuted to life in prison.) In 1998, Hurricane Mitch cut through the western Caribbean, pummeling coastal Honduras and Belize; the storm caused several thousand deaths in Central America in the days that followed.

Blinken heads to Mideast for 11th time since Gaza war; prospects for a truce remain uncertain	WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading again to the Middle East, making his 11th trip to the region since the Gaza war erupted last year and as Israel steps up attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon. The State Department said Blinken will depart on Monday for a weeklong trip to Israel and a number of Arab countries, on a visit that also comes as Israel weighs retaliation against Iran for ballistic missile attacks earlier this month. The trip had been expected after President Joe Biden said last week he would dispatch Blinken to the region following Israel’s killing of Hamas military chief Yahya Sinwar, a move that some believe could open a window for new talks on a cease-fire proposal that has been languishing for months. 'Throughout the region, Secretary Blinken will discuss the importance of bringing the war in Gaza to an end, securing the release of all hostages, and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people. He will continue discussions on post-conflict period planning and emphasize the need to chart a new path forward that enables Palestinians to rebuild their lives and realize their aspirations free from Hamas’ tyranny,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. He said Blinken would also underscore the need for a dramatic increase in the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, something that Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made clear in a letter to Israeli officials last week. That letter reminded Israel that the Biden administration could be forced by U.S. law to curtail some forms of military aid should the delivery of humanitarian assistance continue to be hindered. In addition to the conflict in Gaza, Blinken will also raise the importance the administration places on reaching a diplomatic resolution to the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and elsewhere. 'He will reaffirm the U.S. commitment to work with partners across the region to de-escalate tensions and provide lasting stability,' Miller said in the statement. Since the Hamas attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and the Israeli response, Blinken has traveled to the Middle East 10 times seeking an end to the crisis. His previous trips have yielded little in the way of ending hostilities but he has managed to increase aid deliveries to Gaza in the past.	https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-ba3c1e1eb131916818e62c81ead22f36	2024-10-21T01:29:54-07:00	
Lebanon assesses damage after Israel strikes Hezbollah-run financial institution	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese were surveying the damage on Monday after overnight Israeli strikes hit nearly a dozen branches of a Hezbollah-run financial institution that Israel says is used to fund attacks but where many ordinary people keep their savings. The strikes targeted Al-Qard Al-Hassan branches in the southern neighborhoods of Beirut, across southern Lebanon and in the eastern Bekaa Valley, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. One strike flattened a nine-story building in Beirut with a branch inside it. Smoke rose from several locations on Monday. The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings ahead of the strikes. There were no reports of casualties. Israel invaded Lebanon earlier this month, saying it aims to push Hezbollah from the border after more than a year of rocket, missile and drone attacks that began after Palestinian Hamas militants launched their surprise Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel from the Gaza Strip. Israeli airstrikes have pounded large areas of Lebanon for weeks, forcing over a million people to flee their homes. The United States is hoping to revive diplomatic efforts to resolve both conflicts after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in the Gaza Strip last week, but so far all sides appear to be digging in. Hezbollah-run lender filled gaps left by Lebanon's troubled banks The Arabic language spokesman for the Israeli military, Avichay Adraee, said warplanes targeted several locations 'used to store money for the military arm of Hezbollah,' including Al-Qard Al-Hassan, which he said finances arms purchases and is used to pay fighters. He said Hezbollah stores hundreds of millions of dollars in the branches, without providing evidence, and that the strikes were aimed at preventing the group from rearming. The institution has more than 30 branches across Lebanon. It tried to reassure customers, saying it had evacuated all branches and relocated gold and other deposits to safe areas. Many customers are civilians unaffiliated with Hezbollah. The registered nonprofit, sanctioned by the United States and Saudi Arabia, has long served as an alternative to Lebanon's banks, which have imposed restrictions in the face of a severe financial crisis that began in 2019. Bulldozers cleared mounds of rubble at the site of one strike. Clothes, furniture and the remains of a beauty salon were seen in the debris. Al-Qard al-Hassan documents were scattered across the area, but there was no sign of cash or other valuables. US envoy says UN resolution that ended past war is ‘no longer enough’ U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has spent much of the past year trying to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, was back in Lebanon on Monday for talks with senior officials. He said U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, was 'no longer enough' to ensure peace and a new mechanism was needed to enforce it. The resolution called for Hezbollah to withdraw from the border with Israel and for U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army to control southern Lebanon, without any Hezbollah or Israeli presence. Israel says the resolution was never implemented and that Hezbollah built up extensive military infrastructure right up to the border. Lebanon has long accused Israel of violating its airspace and failing to abide by other provisions of the resolution. '1701 was successful at ending the war in 2006, but we must be honest that nobody did anything to implement it,' Hochstein said after meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a political ally of Hezbollah who is involved in cease-fire talks. In a separate development, the Israeli military apologized for a strike on Sunday in southern Lebanon that killed three Lebanese army soldiers. It said it targeted a vehicle in an area that Hezbollah had recently used for attacks without realizing it belonged to the Lebanese military. Lebanon’s army is a respected institution within the country, but it is not powerful enough to impose its will on Hezbollah or defend Lebanon from Israel’s invasion. The army has largely kept to the sidelines as Israel and Hezbollah have traded blows over the past year. US tries to revive Gaza cease-fire talks after Sinwar’s death The United States has expressed hope that the killing of Hamas leader Sinwar could give new impetus for a cease-fire in Gaza, which would give a major boost to parallel efforts to halt the fighting in Lebanon. The head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency, Ronen Bar, visited Egypt for the second time in less than a week and had an hours-long meeting with Egyptian officials on Sunday, according to an Egyptian official who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said Egypt, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, remains opposed to any Israeli presence along the Gaza-Egypt border, a key sticking point in talks that sputtered to a halt in August. Hamas has said its demands remain unchanged after the killing of Sinwar. The militant group has said it will only release dozens of Israeli hostages in return for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a lasting cease-fire and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and recover all the captives, and says Israel must maintain an open-ended security presence in Gaza to keep Hamas from re-arming. Israel has been waging a major operation in northern Gaza, the hardest-hit part of the territory, for more than two weeks, and its forces have repeatedly returned to other areas of Gaza after saying Hamas had regrouped. Palestinian medical officials said on Monday they collected over a dozen bodies of people killed in Israel’s ongoing air and ground operation in northern Gaza. They included six men killed early Monday when they were trying to get drinking water in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, the main focus of the operation, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Four others, including two women, were killed in a strike on an area sheltering displaced people in Jabaliya, the ministry said. Another three people were killed in a strike on a school-turned-shelter in the border town of Beit Hanoun. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 captives are still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don’t distinguish combatants from civilians but say most of the dead were women and children. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Becky Sauerbrunn and over 100 women's soccer players protest FIFA deal with Saudi oil giant Aramco	ZURICH (AP) — Former U.S. national team captain Becky Sauerbrunn and Netherlands forward Vivianne Miedema are among more than 100 women's soccer players who have signed an open letter protesting FIFA's sponsorship deal with Saudi Arabian state oil giant Aramco. The letter calls the deal, which includes sponsorship at the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil, 'much worse than an own goal,' citing Saudi Arabia's record on the rights of women and LGBTQ+ people and the impact of Aramco's oil and gas production on climate change. Sauerbrunn voiced concern for women who are imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. 'The safety of those women, the rights of women, LGBTQ+ rights and the health of the planet need to take a much bigger priority over FIFA making more money,' Sauerbrunn said in comments via campaign group Athletes Of The World. The letter calls on FIFA to replace Aramco 'with alternative sponsors whose values align with gender equality, human rights and the safe future of our planet,' and to give players a voice on the ethical implications of future sponsorship deals. 'This letter shows that as players this is what we don’t want to stand for and accept within women’s football. It’s simple: this sponsorship is contradicting FIFA’s own commitments to human rights and the planet,' Miedema said. FIFA's deal with Aramco was announced in April as part of ever-closer ties between Saudi Arabia and world soccer's governing body. FIFA is expected to confirm Saudi Arabia as host of the 2034 men's World Cup in December. It is the only candidate for the tournament. 'FIFA values its partnership with Aramco and its many others commercial and rights partners. FIFA is an inclusive organisation with many commercial partners also supporting other organizations in football and other sports,' world soccer's governing body said in an emailed statement Monday, adding that commercial revenue is reinvested into developing women's soccer. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/fifa-saudi-arabia-aramco-becky-sauerbrunn-cb41913acfa00adba988cf73e0fc70b7	2024-10-21T00:30:53-07:00	
A Japanese police chief apologizes to a man acquitted after 50 years on death row	TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese police chief on Monday apologized in person to Iwao Hakamada for his decades-long suffering that started from an overbearing investigation and wrongful conviction that had kept him on death row until last month, when he was acquitted in a retrial. The 88-year-old Hakamada, a former boxer, was acquitted by the Shizuoka District Court, which said police and prosecutors had collaborated to fabricate and plant evidence against him, and forced him to confess with violent, hourslong closed interrogations. The acquittal was finalized earlier this month when the prosecution waived its right to appeal — though it complained about the ruling — finally ending Hakamada’s nearly 60-year legal battle to prove his innocence. Shizuoka Prefectural Police chief Takayoshi Tsuda on Monday visited Hakamada at his home and offered an apology in person. As he entered the room where Hakamada, his sister Hideko Hakamada and their supporter waited, Hakamada silently rose from his sofa to greet him. 'We are sorry to have caused you unspeakable mental distress and burden for as long as 58 years from the time of the arrest until the acquittal was finalized,' Tsuda said, as he stood straight in front of Hakamada and bowed deeply. 'We are terribly sorry.' Tsuda promised a 'meticulous and appropriate investigation.' Hakamada, who has difficulty carrying out conversation due to his mental condition from the decades of death row confinement, responded: 'What it means to have the authority ... Once you have the power, you’re not supposed to grumble.' Hakamada’s 91-year-old sister, who had stood by her brother through the long process to clear his name and now lives with him, thanked the police chief for visiting them. 'There is no use complaining to him after all these years. He was not involved in the case and he only came here as his duty,' she told reporters afterward. 'But I still accepted his visit just because I wanted (my brother) to have a clear break from his past as a death row inmate.' He was arrested in August, 1966, in the killing of an executive at a miso bean paste company and three of his family members in Hamamatsu, central Japan. He was initially sentenced to death in a 1968 district court ruling but was not executed because of the lengthy appeal and retrial process in Japan. It took nearly three decades for the Supreme Court to deny his first appeal for a retrial. His second appeal for a retrial, filed by his sister in 2008, was granted in 2014. The court ordered his release from his death row solitary cell but without removing his conviction, pending the retrial process. Hakamada was the world’s longest-serving death row prisoner and only the fifth death row inmate to be acquitted in a retrial in postwar Japan, where criminal trials take years and retrials are extremely rare. His case and acquittal have triggered calls for more transparency in the investigation, legal change to lower hurdles for a retrial and debate over death penalty in Japan.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-death-row-police-apology-hakamada-7226946cfbf17524a12a95370fa55733	2024-10-21T00:19:15-07:00	
Self-exiled Turkish spiritual leader Fethullah Gülen dies in the US	SAYLORSBURG, Pa. (AP) — Fethullah Gülen, a reclusive U.S.-based Islamic cleric who inspired a global social movement while facing accusations he masterminded a failed 2016 coup in his native Turkey, has died. Abdullah Bozkurt, the former editor of the Gülen-linked Today’s Zaman newspaper, who is now in exile in Sweden, said Monday he spoke to Gülen's nephew, Kemal Gülen, who confirmed the death. Fethullah Gülen was in his eighties and had long been in ill health. The Alliance for Shared Values, a New York-based group that promotes Gulen’s work in the U.S., confirmed his death on X and its website 'with sorrowful hearts and humble acceptance of Allah’s will.' It did not provide details. Gülen spent the last decades of his life in self-exile, living in a gated compound in Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains and wielding influence among his millions of followers. He espoused a philosophy that blended Sufism — a mystical form of Islam — with staunch advocacy of democracy, education, science and interfaith dialogue. It is not known who, if anyone, will lead the movement now. Gülen began as an ally of Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan but became a foe. He called Erdogan an authoritarian bent on accumulating power and crushing dissent. Erdogan cast Gülen as a terrorist, accusing him of orchestrating the attempted military coup on July 15, 2016, when factions within the military used tanks, warplanes and helicopters to try to overthrow Erdogan’s government. Heeding a call from the president, thousands took to the streets to oppose the takeover attempt. The coup-plotters fired at crowds and bombed parliament and other government buildings. A total of 251 people were killed and around 2,200 others were wounded. Around 35 alleged coup plotters were killed. Gülen adamantly denied involvement, and his supporters dismissed the charges as ridiculous and politically motivated. Turkey put Gülen on its most-wanted list and demanded his extradition, but the United States showed little inclination to send him back, saying it needed more evidence. Gülen was never charged with a crime in the U.S., and he consistently denounced terrorism as well as the coup plotters. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday that Gülen’s death 'will not make us complacent or relaxed. This organization has been a threat rarely seen in the history of our nation.' He called on Gülen’s followers to turn away from 'this treasonous wrong path.' In Turkey, Gülen’s movement — sometimes known as Hizmet, Turkish for 'service' — has been subjected to a broad crackdown. The government arrested tens of thousands of people for their alleged link to the coup plot, sacked more than 130,000 suspected supporters from civil service jobs and more than 23,000 from the military, and closed hundreds of businesses, schools and media organizations tied to Gülen. Gülen called the crackdown a witch hunt and denounced Turkey’s leaders as 'tyrants.' 'The last year has taken a toll on me as hundreds of thousands of innocent Turkish citizens are being punished simply because the government decides they are somehow ‘connected’ to me or the Hizmet movement and treats that alleged connection as a crime,' he said on the one-year anniversary of the failed coup. Ozgur Ozel, the leader of Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party, said Gülen’s vast network remained a threat to Turkey. 'The founder is dead but the organization remains. No one should think that this danger has passed or is over. Everyone should be on guard against this organization,' Ozel said. Fethullah Gülen was born in Erzurum, in eastern Turkey. His official birth date was April 27, 1941, but that has long been in dispute. Y. Alp Aslandogan, who leads a New York-based group that promotes Gülen’s ideas and work, said Gülen was actually born sometime in 1938. Trained as an imam, or prayer leader, Gülen gained notice in Turkey some 50 years ago. He preached tolerance and dialogue between faiths, and he believed religion and science could go hand in hand. His belief in merging Islam with Western values and Turkish nationalism struck a chord with Turks, earning him millions of followers. Gülen’s acolytes built a loosely affiliated global network of charitable foundations, professional associations, businesses and schools in more than 100 countries, including 150 taxpayer-funded charter schools throughout the United States. In Turkey, supporters ran universities, hospitals, charities, a bank and a large media empire with newspapers and radio and TV stations. But Gülen was viewed with suspicion by some in his homeland, a deeply polarized country split between those loyal to its fiercely secular traditions and supporters of the Islamic-based party associated with Erdogan that came to power in 2002. Gülen had long refrained from openly supporting any political party, but his movement forged a de facto alliance with Erdogan against the country’s old guard of staunch, military-backed secularists, and Gülen’s media empire threw its weight behind Erdogan’s Islamic-oriented government. Gülenists helped the governing party win multiple elections. But the Erdogan-Gulen alliance began to crumble after the movement criticized government policy and exposed alleged corruption among Erdogan’s inner circle. Erdogan, who denied the allegations, grew weary of the growing influence of Gülen’s movement. The Turkish leader accused Gülen’s followers of infiltrating the country’s police and judiciary and setting up a parallel state, and began agitating for Gülen’s extradition to Turkey even before the failed 2016 coup. The cleric had lived in the United States since 1999, when he came to seek medical treatment. In 2000, with Gülen still in the U.S, Turkish authorities charged him with leading an Islamist plot to overthrow the country’s secular form of government and establish a religious state. Some of the accusations against him were based on a tape recording on which Gülen was alleged to have told supporters of an Islamic state to bide their time: 'If they come out too early, the world will quash their heads.' Gülen said his comments were taken out of context. The cleric was tried in absentia and acquitted, but he never returned to his homeland. He won a lengthy legal battle against the administration of then-President George W. Bush to obtain permanent residency in the U.S. Rarely seen in public, Gülen lived quietly on the grounds of an Islamic retreat center. He left mostly only to see doctors for ailments that included heart disease and diabetes, spending much of his time in prayer and meditation and receiving visitors from around the world. Gülen never married and did not have children. ___ Associated Press Writer Suzan Fraser contributed from Ankara, Turkey.	https://apnews.com/article/fethullah-gulen-turkey-dead-d808184b89acffcd1c9b24ba87d3d5f5	2024-10-21T00:11:37-07:00	
South Korea calls for immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops allegedly in Russia	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea on Monday demanded the immediate pullout of North Korean troops allegedly deployed in Russia as it summoned the Russian ambassador to protest deepening military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. South Korea's spy agency said Friday it had confirmed that North Korea sent 1,500 special operation forces to Russia this month to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join invading Russian forces. During a meeting with Russian Ambassador Georgy Zinoviev, Vice South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun 'condemned in the strongest terms' North Korea's troop dispatch that he said poses 'a grave security threat' to South Korea and the international community, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Kim said that South Korea in collaboration with the international community will mobilize all available means to deal with an act that threatens its vital national security interests, according to the statement. The Russian Embassy quoted Zinoviev as saying that the Russian-North Korean cooperation is not aimed against the security interests of South Korea. In a telephone call with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said that Seoul won’t sit idly by 'reckless' military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Yoon said South Korea will soon send a delegation to NATO to exchange information about Russian-North Korean cooperation, according to Yoon’s office. Rutte wrote on X that North Korea possibly fighting alongside Russia would 'mark a significant escalation.' The U.S. and NATO haven't confirmed that North Korean troops were sent to Russia. But the reports of their presence have already stoked concerns in South Korea that Russia might provide North Korea with sophisticated technologies that can sharply enhance the North's nuclear and missile programs in return for its troop dispatch. North Korea's advancing nuclear arsenal is a major security threat to South Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recently took steps to permanently terminate all relations with South Korea and threatened to use nuclear weapons preemptively. Some observers say South Korea will likely consider supplying weapons to Ukraine if Russian transfers of high-tech nuclear and missile technologies to North Korea are verified. South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. But South Korea hasn’t directly provided arms to Kyiv, citing its longstanding policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. Russia has earlier denied using North Korean troops in its war with Ukraine. North Korea's state media hasn't commented on the matter. Ukrainian officials released a video allegedly showing North Korean soldiers lining up to collect Russian military clothes and bags at an unknown location. The Associated Press couldn’t verify the footage independently. Asked about the North Korean troops during a conference call with reporters Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that 'we are seeing a lot of contradictory information.' 'South Koreans say one thing, then the Pentagon says it has no confirmation of such statements. There is a lot of contradictory information,' Peskov said. 'It must be treated as such.' North Korea's troop deployment to Russia would be its first participation in a major war since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Many experts question how much North Korean troops would help Russia on the battlefield, citing their lack of combat experience. Cooperation between North Korea and Russia has flourished over the past two years. The U.S., South Korea and their partners have accused North Korea of supplying conventional arms to Russia in return for economic and military assistance. In June, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked. __ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-south-korea-russia-ukraine-27780e4b672ee638b96099ec5f5168e4	2024-10-20T23:32:47-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israel apologizes for strike that killed 3 Lebanese soldiers	The Israeli military apologized Monday for a strike that killed three Lebanese soldiers in southern Lebanon, saying it is not battling the country's military and its troops believed they were targeting a vehicle belonging to the Hezbollah militant group. Israeli strikes meanwhile hit nearly a dozen branches of a Hezbollah-run financial institution that Israel says is used to fund attacks but where many ordinary people keep their savings. Last week, Hezbollah said it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, as the region reckoned with the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a battle with Israeli forces in Gaza. Sinwar was a chief architect of the attack on southern Israel that precipitated the latest escalating conflicts in the Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Here's the latest: Over a dozen bodies collected in northern Gaza, medical workers say CAIRO — Palestinian medical officials say they have collected over a dozen bodies of people killed in Israel’s ongoing air and ground operation in northern Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service said they included six men killed early Monday when they were trying to get drinking water in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, the main focus of the operation. Four others, including two women, were killed in a strike on an area sheltering displaced people in Jabaliya, it said. Another three people were killed in a strike on a school-turned-shelter in the border town of Beit Hanoun. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiyya, the director of the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, said it was overwhelmed with wounded people and patients. Israel launched the operation more than two weeks ago, saying Hamas militants had regrouped in Jabaliya after several previous military operations there. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians. Israeli authorities have dramatically reduced the amount of aid allowed into Gaza, raising fears among Palestinians that they are implementing a surrender-or-starve plan advocated by retired Israeli generals. Israel ordered the entire population of the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, to evacuate to the south in the war’s opening weeks and reiterated those instructions this month. Around 400,000 people are believed to have remained in the north, which is encircled by Israeli forces and off limits to Palestinians who fled their homes there. Israeli police arrest 7 citizens allegedly paid by Iran to gather intelligence JERUSALEM — Israeli police have arrested seven citizens who they say were paid by Iran to collect intelligence for over two years. In a statement released Monday, Israel’s internal security agency and police said that the seven collected information about other Israelis and photographed Israeli military installations, including missile defense systems, air force and naval sites, and power plants. Iran paid them paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, often in cryptocurrency, the statement said. It did not provide evidence for the alleged plot. Israeli authorities say they have foiled several recent plots by Iran that involved recruiting Israelis for espionage or assassinations. Israel has vowed to retaliate for Iran’s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack. Israeli air defenses shot down most of the missiles, but some hit Israeli military installations. Israel and Iran have waged a shadow war for years that burst to the surface after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel and Iran exchanged fire directly for the first time in April. Iran supports armed groups across the region, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Macron calls for a cease-fire in a phone call with Netanyahu PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron called once again for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, the Elysee Palace said in a statement. Macron said the elimination of Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar last week in Gaza 'must be an opportunity to begin a new phase of negotiation' for a cease-fire, the release of hostages and the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Macron alo called for Israel to preserve infrastructure and protect civilians in Lebanon. Macron shared his intention to keep communication channels open with Teheran, 'to obtain guarantees on Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic program and regional policy,' the statement. Relations between the two leaders became tense recently after Macron called for 'a halt to arms exports for use in Gaza,' drawing strong criticism from Netanyahu. Head of Israel's security agency visited Cairo to discuss cease-fire talks CAIRO — The head of Israel’s internal security agency has visited Cairo to discuss reviving Gaza cease-fire talks after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, officials said. Israel and Hamas, as well as Egypt, which has served as a key mediator, appear to still be divided over whether Israel would retain control over parts of Gaza, a dispute that dragged the talks to a halt in August. An Egyptian official said Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency, held an hourslong meeting Sunday with Egypt’s newly appointed intelligence chief, Hassan Mahmoud Rashad. An Israeli official also confirmed the visit, speaking on condition of anonymity because it was not publicized. The visit was widely reported by Israeli media. The Egyptian official, who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said they discussed the possibility of reviving the negotiations after the death of Sinwar, who was killed in an Israeli military operation last week. The official said Egypt is still opposed to any Israeli presence in a strip of land running the length of the Gaza side of the territory’s border with Egypt, and that Hamas is unlikely to lift its demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas has said its demands for a lasting cease-fire, Israel’s full withdrawal from Gaza and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners in return for dozens of hostages held in Gaza for over a year have not changed following Sinwar’s death. Bar also visited Egypt last Tuesday, before Sinwar’s death. — By Samy Magdy in Cairo and Julia Frankel in Jerusalem Lebanon's caretaker PM calls for implementation of UN resolution to end fighting BEIRUT — Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister says implementing a nearly 2-decade-old U.N. resolution still offers the best path to ending the Israel-Hezbollah war. In an interview with the Al-Arabiya network broadcast Monday, ahead of the arrival of a U.S. envoy, Najib Mikati said a new resolution appeared unlikely. 'There is no solution but a diplomatic solution, and the diplomatic solution is currently on the table,' he said. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, called for Hezbollah to withdraw from the border and for U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army to control southern Lebanon, without any Hezbollah or Israeli presence. Israel says the resolution was never implemented and that Hezbollah built up extensive military infrastructure right up to the border. Lebanon has long accused Israel of violating its airspace and failing to abide by other provisions of the resolution. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who was in Beirut on Monday, said U.N. resolution 1701 is 'no longer enough' and a new mechanism must be put in place to ensure it is implemented 'fairly, accurately, transparently.' '1701 was successful at ending the war in 2006, but we must be honest that nobody did anything to implement it,' Hochstein said in a news conference after meeting with Berri. 'The lack of implementation over those years contributed to the conflict that we are in today.' Hezbollah, which said it would continue attacks on Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, appears to have softened that position in recent weeks as Israeli strikes have eliminated much of its top leadership and pounded large areas of Lebanon. Hezbollah now says it supports the diplomatic efforts of Mikati and Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a political ally of the militant group. Both Lebanese leaders have said they are no longer seeking to tie a cease-fire in Lebanon to one in Gaza. Israeli military apologizes for strike that killed Lebanese soldiers JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has apologized for a strike in southern Lebanon that killed three Lebanese soldiers. The military said it struck a truck on Sunday that had entered an area where it had previously targeted a Hezbollah truck transporting a launcher and missiles. The military said soldiers were not aware that the second truck belonged to the Lebanese army. The military said it is 'not operating against the Lebanese Army and apologizes for these unwanted circumstances.' Lebanon’s army is a respected institution within the country, but it is not powerful enough to impose its will on Hezbollah or defend Lebanon from Israel’s invasion. The army has largely kept to the sidelines as Israel and Hezbollah have traded blows over the past year. Israeli forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of the month and have been operating in a narrow strip along the border. Israeli airstrikes have pounded large areas of the country, targeting what Israel says are Hezbollah sites. The militant group has fired thousands of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel since Oct. 8, 2023, the day after its ally Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, triggering the war in Gaza.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-21-october-2024-b6a1782da26a614fcb3a3d4e42df0635	2024-10-20T23:22:09-07:00	
Moldova narrowly votes to secure path toward EU membership after accusing Russia of interference	CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldovans voted by a razor-thin majority in favor of securing the country’s path toward European Union membership, electoral data showed Monday, after the pro-Western president accused foreign interference and 'criminal groups' of trying to undermine the vote in the former Soviet republic. The 'No' vote appeared to be ahead until the last few thousand votes were counted from the large diaspora of Moldova, whose authorities have accused Russia of trying to destabilize the country. With 99.41% of votes counted in the EU referendum held Sunday, the 'Yes' vote stood at 50.39% and the 'No' vote at 49.61%, according to the Central Electoral Commission. A loss would have been a political disaster for the pro-Western government, which strongly supported the pro-EU campaign. On Monday, President Maia Sandu reiterated claims that unprecedented voter fraud and foreign interference had undermined the voting, calling it a 'vile attack' on Moldova’s sovereignty. 'Unfortunately, the justice system failed to do enough to prevent vote-rigging and corruption,' she told a news conference. 'Here, too, we must draw a line, correct what went wrong, and learn the lesson. We heard you: we know we must do more to fight corruption.' Moldovan authorities claim that Moscow has intensified a 'hybrid war' campaign to destabilize the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections and backing a major vote-buying scheme. Russia has repeatedly denied it is interfering in Moldova. Moldova applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and was granted candidate status that summer, alongside Ukraine. Brussels agreed in June to start membership negotiations. In Brussels, the EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, said its services had noted 'unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and its proxies, aiming to destabilize the democratic processes' in Moldova, and it underlined its continued support for Moldova on its EU accession path. Spokesperson Peter Stano told reporters that allegations of vote-buying, the bussing of voters and disinformation are only the most recent forms of Russian interference, and that attempts to undermine Moldova and its support for the EU have been going on for months. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told Moldova's people: 'You’ve done it again! In the face of Russia’s hybrid tactics, Moldova shows that it is independent, it is strong and it wants a European future!' In the presidential race that was held at the same time, Sandu won the first round with 42% of the vote in a field of 11, short of an outright majority. She will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who outperformed polls with around 26% of the vote, in a runoff on Nov. 3. By the time polling stations closed at 9 p.m. Sunday, more than 1.5 million voters — about 51% of eligible voters — had cast ballots, according to the Central Electoral Commission. Moldova has a population of about 2.5 million. Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told The Associated Press that earlier polls might have 'overestimated the pro-EU feeling' inside Moldova and the referendum would have failed to pass without votes from outside the country. 'It’s going to be particularly problematic because ... it’s going to feed into narratives that are pushed by the Kremlin and pro-Russian forces,' he said. The White House on Monday called the referendum a 'historic step forward in Moldova’s European integration' but warned that Russia would try to interfere in next month’s runoff in the presidential race. 'The last several months Moscow has dedicated millions of dollars towards these efforts,' said U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby. 'Now, Russia did not succeed. The results demonstrate democracy is strong, as is the will and desire of the Moldovan people to advance toward European integration.' In early October, Moldovan law enforcement said it had uncovered a massive vote-buying scheme orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled pro-Russia oligarch who currently lives in Russia, which paid 15 million euros ($16.2 million) to 130,000 people to undermine the two ballots. Shor was convicted in absentia last year of fraud and money laundering and sentenced to 15 years in prison in the case of $1 billion that went missing from Moldovan banks in 2014. He denied the allegations, saying the payments were legal and citing a right to freedom of expression. Shor’s populist Russia-friendly Shor Party was declared unconstitutional last year and banned. On Thursday, Moldovan authorities foiled another plot in which more than 100 young Moldovans received training in Moscow from private military groups on how to create civil unrest around the two votes. Some also attended more advanced training in 'guerrilla camps' in Serbia and Bosnia, police said, and four people were detained for 30 days. A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, a year after Sandu won the presidency. A parliamentary election will be held next year. ___ Associated Press writers Raf Casert and Lorne Cook contributed from Brussels; Aamer Madhani from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/moldova-elections-eu-referendum-russia-325cb2c13beb1d76565a6e2aadef971a	2024-10-20T23:14:36-07:00	
US defense chief visits Kyiv for talks on how to keep supporting Ukraine's fight against Russia	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit Monday, hours after a Russian drone attack on the Ukrainian capital and as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pushes Western partners to keep providing military support for the war. Austin said on the X platform that his fourth visit shows 'that the United States, alongside the international community, continues to stand by Ukraine.' Ukraine is having difficulty holding back a ferocious Russian campaign along the eastern front that is gradually compelling Kyiv’s forces to give up a series of towns, villages and hamlets. Zelenskyy is urging Western allies to support his so-called ‘victory plan’ to end the almost three-year war, which is Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II and has cost tens of thousands of lives on both sides, including many civilians. His strategy includes a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western long-range missiles to strike military targets in Russia — steps Kyiv’s allies have previously balked at supporting. The Western response has been lukewarm, and Austin was expected to discuss the plan with Ukrainian officials in Kyiv. Zelenskyy said in a Sunday evening video address that his plan had won the backing of France, Lithuania, Nordic countries and 'many other allies' in the European Union which he didn’t name. The key country, however, is the United States, which is Ukraine’s biggest military supplier. Zelenskyy said he had received 'very positive signals from the United States,' but he stopped short of saying he had secured Washington’s endorsement for the plan. Russia fired three missiles and 116 Shahed drones at Ukraine overnight from Sunday to Monday, Ukraine's air force said. Machine gun fire and the noise of drones’ engines was heard in Kyiv’s center throughout the night. Authorities reported minor damages to civilian infrastructure caused by falling drone debris in the three districts of the city. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-us-austin-zelenskyy-562b5bd0ce4c8849d29b5a3d0fa7dfb4	2024-10-20T22:36:58-07:00	
Tropical Storm Oscar brings winds and heavy rains to eastern Cuba	HAVANA (AP) — Tropical Storm Oscar advanced across eastern Cuba early Monday after making landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the island already beleaguered by a massive power outage. Its maximum sustained winds were blowing at 60 mph (95 kph) early Monday as Oscar moved west-southwest at 5 mph (8 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Oscar made landfall in the eastern province of Guantanamo, near the city of Baracoa, on Sunday evening with winds of 75 mph (120 kph). Rain and flooding in low-lying areas were reported in eastern provinces. Cuban media said 2-meter (6.5-feet) swells were hitting the coast and roofs and walls in Baracoa had been damaged. The storm is expected to move across the island into Monday and approach the central Bahamas on Tuesday, U.S. forecasters said. Cuba suffered an islandwide power blackout Friday. Some electrical service was restored Saturday, but most residents remain without power. The country's energy minister expressed hope the grid could be restored Monday or Tuesday.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-oscar-cuba-power-outage-b03e933253e5bc99e986489994b15d72	2024-10-20T21:48:49-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian markets are mixed after another winning close on Wall Street	BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares were mixed on Monday after U.S. stocks rose to records to close out their latest winning week. U.S. futures also were mixed and oil prices climbed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng sank 1.5% to 20,869.39, while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.2% to 3,268.11. The A-share index of the smaller market in Shenzhen picked up 1.6%. China cut its one-year and five-year Loan Prime Rates, which are reference rates for lending. Lower rates can help reduce pressure on borrowers, particulary property developers that have suffered following a crackdown on excessive borrowing several years ago. But any impact on market sentiment appeared to be short-lived. Given that the main constrain is weak demand, the 'heavy lifting' will have to come from government spending, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report. China's Finance Ministry has pledged to ramp up such outlays in coming months, 'However, we are still skeptical that fiscal easing will be large enough to deliver anything more than a modest and short-lived pick-up in activity.' Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1% lower to 38,954.60, while the Kospi in Seoul advanced 0.4% to 2,604.92. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 closed 0.7% higher at 8,344.40. Oil prices climbed after tumbling last week as worries receded that Israel will attack Iranian oil facilities as part of its retaliation for Iran’s missile attack early this month. Iran is a major producer of crude, and a strike could upend its exports to China and elsewhere. Concerns about the strength of demand from China have also hit oil prices. Early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude was up 52 cents at $69.21 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 41 cents to $73.47 per barrel. The dollar rose to 149.78 Japanese yen from 149.57 yen late Friday. The yen has weakened recently on expectations that the pace of interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan may be slower than earlier thought. The euro slipped to $1.0856 from $1.0866 late Friday. On Friday, Wall Street logged more records. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% to squeak past the all-time high it had set early this week, closing at 5,864.67. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1% higher to 43,275.91, another record. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6% to 18,489.55. Trading overall on Wall Street remained relatively calm, as the S&amp;P 500 closed its sixth straight winning week. That’s its longest such winning streak of 2024. Solid economic data has boosted hopes the U.S. economy can make a perfect escape from the worst inflation in generations, one that ends without a painful recession that many investors had seen as nearly inevitable. And with the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to keep the economy humming, the expectation among optimists is that stocks can rise even further. Traders are coalescing around the idea that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting in November. Expectations had been high earlier for the Fed to deliver another larger-than-usual cut of half a percentage point, but strong updates on the economy have eliminated those. The federal funds rate is currently sitting in a range of 4.75% to 5%.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-china-oil-e6f3d911ef800bea10aa6ec642f22f37	2024-10-20T20:22:43-07:00	
New Zealand revels in a weekend of sporting success	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand boasts that it punches above its weight in international sport and backed up that claim at the weekend with success around the world and in a variety of sports. The claim already had gained some credibility this year when the nation of 5.2 million placed 11th on the medal table at the Paris Olympics with 10 gold medals and 20 medals overall. Over the last 48 hours, New Zealand: Beat Great Britain 7-2 in the final of the 37th edition of sailing’s America’s Cup to win world sport’s oldest trophy for the third straight time. Team New Zealand is the only team in the modern era to win the trophy on three consecutive occasions. Beat India by eight wickets in the first cricket test at Bengaluru, winning in India for only the third time and the first time since 1988. The New Zealand Black Caps are only the fourth team to beat India at home this century. New Zealand bowled out India for 46 in its first innings, its lowest-ever total at home. Beat South Africa by 32 runs to win the women’s Twenty20 cricket World Cup for the first time and as underdogs. South Africa were favorites after beating six-time champion Australia in the semifinals. In addition: New Zealand’s Hayden Wilde won the final leg of the World Triathlon Championship Series at Torremolinos, Spain. Ally Woolaston won the women’s omnium event at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships for her second gold and third medal of the championships. The New Zealand women’s team beat Italy 6-1 in the final of the Canoe Polo world championships in Deqing, China. Auckland FC, part owned by American businessman Bill Foley, won its first-ever match in Australian soccer's A-League, beating the Brisbane Roar 2-0. New Zealand’s Liam Lawson finished ninth in the United States F1 Grand Prix in his first race of the season and after starting from 19th on the grid. 'In New Zealand’s history there haven’t been too many sporting weekends like the one we’ve just seen, with epic wins from Team New Zealand, the White Ferns, the Black Caps, the Silver Ferns (netball team) and the Paddle Ferns (canoe polo team),' New Zealand Sports Minister Chris Bishop said. 'I know lots of Kiwis will be bleary-eyed today after a couple of long nights watching our teams go up against the best. But I bet they’re as stoked at the results and as proud of our teams as I am. 'All in all, I think this was a weekend that will go down in New Zealand’s sporting annals. All five teams should know that their country is enormously proud of them. And I think Kiwi sports fans can be forgiven if they’re caught yawning at work today, after so much sporting excitement packed into one weekend!' ____ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports	https://apnews.com/article/new-zealand-sporting-success-336268f9b418bd33aaec015ac2736036	2024-10-20T19:59:28-07:00	
Cubans struggle with an extended power outage and a new tropical storm	HAVANA (AP) — Many Cubans waited in anguish and some took to the streets in protest as widespread blackouts stretched into their third day. Their concerns were heightened as a Hurricane Oscar hit Cuba’s eastern coast with winds and heavy rain. In Santo Suárez, part of a populous neighborhood in southwestern Havana, people went into the streets banging pots and pans in protest Sunday night. 'We haven’t had electricity for three nights, and our food is rotting. Four days without electricity is an abuse to the children,' resident Mary Karla, a mother of three children, told The Associated Press. She didn't give her surname. The protesters, who say they have no water either, blocked the street with garbage. Energy Minister Vicente de la O Levy said in a news conference he hopes the electricity grid will be restored on Monday or Tuesday morning. But he said that Oscar, which made landfall on the eastern coast Sunday evening, will bring 'an additional inconvenience' to Cuba's recovery since it will touch a 'region of strong (electricity) generation.' Key Cuban power plants, such as Felton in the city of Holguín, and Renté in Santiago de Cuba, are located in the area. Oscar later weakened to a tropical storm but its effects were forecast to linger in the island through Monday. Some neighborhoods had electricity restored in Cuba’s capital, where 2 million people live, but most of Havana remained dark. The impact of the blackout goes beyond lighting, as services like water supply also depend on electricity to run pumps. People resorted to cooking with improvised wood stoves on the streets before the food went bad in refrigerators. In tears, Ylenis de la Caridad Napoles, mother of a 7-year-old girl, says she is reaching a point of 'desperation.' The failure of the Antonio Guiteras plant on Friday, which caused the collapse of the island's whole system, was just the latest in a series of problems with energy distribution in a country where electricity has been restricted and rotated to different regions at different times of the day. The status of Cuba's other power plants was unclear. People lined up for hours on Sunday to buy bread in the few bakeries that could reopen. Some Cubans like Rosa Rodríguez have been without electricity for four days. 'We have millions of problems, and none of them are solved,' said Rodríguez. 'We must come to get bread, because the local bakery is closed, and they bring it from somewhere else.' The blackout was considered to be Cuba’s worst since Hurricane Ian hit the island as a Category 3 storm in 2022 and damaged power installations. It took days for the government to fix them. This year, some homes have spent up to eight hours a day without electricity. Cuba’s government had said Saturday that some electricity had been restored. But the 500 megawatts of energy in the island’s electricity grid, far short of the usual 3 gigawatts it needs, had quickly decreased to 370 megawatts. Even in a country that is used to outages as part of a deepening economic crisis, Friday’s collapse was massive. The Cuban government has announced emergency measures to slash electricity demand, including suspending school and university classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling nonessential services. Local authorities said the outage stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residential air conditioners. Later, the blackout got worse because of breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained, and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities. Cuba's energy minister said the country's grid would be in better shape if there had not been two more partial blackouts as authorities tried to reconnect on Saturday. De la O Levy also said Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Russia, among other nations, had offered to help. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-power-blackout-hurricane-oscar-b197e174af2c9f664d4c3aaf0c5a6e75	2024-10-20T19:49:59-07:00	
Gunmen kill 7 people working on a strategic tunnel project in Indian-controlled Kashmir	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Gunmen fatally shot at least seven people working on a strategic tunnel project in Indian-controlled Kashmir and injured at least five others, officials said on Monday. Police blamed militants who have been fighting against Indian rule for decades for the 'terror attack' at a camp for construction workers near the disputed region’s resort town of Sonamarg. No rebel group immediately claimed responsibility. Police said at least two gunmen fired 'indiscriminately' at officials and workers associated with the construction, leaving two dead on the spot. At least 10 others were taken to hospital, where five more died. The attack came shortly after workers returned to their lodgings on Sunday night. There was no immediate independent confirmation of the attack. The dead included five non-local laborers and officials, one Kashmiri worker and a Kashmiri doctor. Reinforcements of police and soldiers launched search operations in the area to nab the attackers. Omar Abdullah, the region's top elected official, condemned the attack in a post on social media platform X, calling it 'dastardly &amp; cowardly.' A key Kashmiri resistance leader said he was 'deeply saddened by the outrageous killings.' 'Another grim reminder of the unending cycle of violence and uncertainty we are suffering for decades,' Mirwaiz Umar Farooq wrote on X. Hundreds of people, mostly non-local laborers, are working on the ambitious tunnel project that aims to connect the Kashmir Valley with Ladakh, a cold desert region that is isolated for half the year because of massive snowfalls. Experts say the tunnel project is important to the military, which will gain significantly improved capabilities to operate in Ladakh. The strategically important region shares de facto borders with Pakistan and China, and Indian and Chinese soldiers have been engaged in a military standoff there since 2020. Both countries have stationed tens of thousands of soldiers there, backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets. Sunday’s attack was the second attack on a non-local worker in the region since a largely powerless local government was sworn into office Wednesday, following the first local elections since India stripped the region of semi-autonomy five years ago. On Friday, body of a worker from eastern Bihar state, riddled with bullet wounds, was recovered from a maize field in southern Shopian district, police said. They blamed militants for the killing. Kashmir has witnessed a spate of killings, many targeting workers from other parts of India, since 2021. Police say the killings, which have also included local Muslim village councilors, police officials and civilians, have been carried out by anti-India rebels. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists that Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-tunnel-project-migrant-laborers-sonamarg-39d00d362a518f67f699c1368617d51c	2024-10-20T19:44:52-07:00	
Israel's wars are expensive. Paying the bill could force tough choices	On top of the grievous toll in human life and misery, Israel's war against the Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups has been expensive, and the painfully high financial costs are raising concerns about the long-term effect of the fighting on the country's economy. Military spending has ballooned, and growth has stalled, especially in dangerous border areas that were evacuated. Economists say the country could face declining investment and higher taxes as the war strains government budgets and forces tough choices between social programs and the military. Here is a look at the monetary costs Israel faces as a result of the conflict: Spending on the military has soared The Israeli government is spending much more per month on the military, from $1.8 billion before Hamas started the fighting by attacking Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, to around $4.7 billion by the end of last year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The government spent $27.5 billion on the military last year, according to the institute, ranking 15th globally behind Poland but ahead of Canada and Spain, all of which have larger populations. Military spending as a percentage of annual economic output was 5.3%, compared with 3.4% for the United States and 1.5% for Germany. That pales in comparison to Ukraine, which spent 37% of its GDP and more than half its entire government budget on fighting off Russia’s invasion. The war hurt growth and the labor supply In the three months after Hamas attacked, Israel's economic output shrank 5.6%, the worst performance of any of the 38 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of mostly rich nations. The economy partly rebounded with growth of 4% in the first part of this year but grew only 0.2% in the second quarter. The war has inflicted an even heavier toll on Gaza’s already broken economy, where 90% of the population has been displaced and the vast majority of the workforce is unemployed. The West Bank economy has also been hit hard, where tens of thousands of Palestinian laborers lost their jobs in Israel after Oct. 7 and Israeli military raids and checkpoints have hindered movement. The World Bank says the West Bank economy contracted by 25% in the first quarter. In Israel, the war has imposed many economic burdens. Call-ups and extensions of military service threaten to crimp the labor supply. Security worries deter investment in new business, and disruptions in flights have kept many visitors away, cutting into the tourism industry. Meanwhile, the government is paying for housing for thousands of people who had to leave their homes in the south near the border with Gaza and in the north where they were exposed to fire from Hezbollah. One of the biggest concerns is the open-ended nature of the fighting, which has lasted more than a year. Israel's economy rebounded quickly from a 2006 war with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. But that conflict lasted only 34 days. Moody's Ratings cited that idea on Sept. 27, when it lowered the Israeli government's credit rating, two notches. The Baa1 rating is still considered investment grade, albeit with moderate risk, according to Moody’s. The Israeli economy is still strong, with modest debt Israel's economy is hardly collapsing. The country has a diversified, highly developed economy with a strong information-technology sector, which supports tax revenues and defense spending. Unemployment is low, and the TA-35 stock index is up 10.5% on the year. Even amid the fighting, tech companies raised some $2.5 billion in capital during the third quarter, according to Zvi Eckstein, head of the Aaron Institute for Economic Policy at Reichman University. Israel started the war 'in the best economic condition' regarding government debt, which stood at a relatively modest 60% of GDP, Eckstein said. 'We financed the war mainly with debt,' which has now risen to 62% but is still contained compared with France at 111% and in line with Germany at 63.5%. The institute foresees debt reaching 80% of GDP, assuming the fighting does not markedly intensify and some sort of cease-fire or conclusion can be reached by the end of next year. Even then, higher defense spending is likely, especially if Israel maintains a military presence in Gaza after the war. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s budget for 2025 foresees a deficit of below 4%, saying that will ensure that Israel’s debt burden remains stable. Smotrich said the country has a stable shekel currency, rising share prices, a tight jobs market, strong tax revenues and access to credit, and a rebounding tech sector. Moody’s questioned the deficit figures, forecasting a 6% deficit for next year. The credit downgrade will lead to higher borrowing costs, meaning Israelis are likely to see cuts to public services and higher taxes, said Karnit Flug, a former head of Israel’s central bank and now vice president of research at the Israel Democracy Institute. The U.S. stepped up military aid and could provide financial backing Before the war, American military aid to Israel amounted to around $3.8 billion per year under a deal signed during President Barack Obama's administration. That comes to roughly 14% of Israel’s prewar military spending, much of which goes to U.S. defense companies. Since the war in Gaza began and led to escalating conflict across the Middle East, the United States has spent a record of at least $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel, according to a report for Brown University’s Costs of War project that was released on the anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel. Beyond strictly military aid, the U.S. has offered critical financial support for Israel during times of trouble. Congress in 2003 approved $9 billion in credit guarantees that let Israel borrow at affordable rates after the economy suffered during the so-called second intifada, or Palestinian uprising. Some of those guarantees remain unused and could in theory be tapped to stabilize government finances if Israel faces unaffordable borrowing costs. What's the way forward? The government has convened a commission under former acting national security adviser Jacob Nagel, who negotiated Israel’s most recent U.S. aid package, to offer recommendations on the size of the future defense budget and to assess how increased defense spending could affect the economy. Economist Eckstein said a budget that includes some tax increases and cuts in social spending would be needed to support a postwar rebound and pay for likely higher ongoing defense costs. ___ Find more coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-war-cost-military-spending-32a53a86d946418022ca636539a83f4f	2024-10-20T19:42:02-07:00	
US and Canadian warships transit the Taiwan Strait a week after Beijing’s war games	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — U.S. and Canadian warships sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, almost a week after China held massive war games around Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory. The destroyer USS Higgins and the Canadian frigate HMCS Vancouver made a 'routine' transit of the Taiwan Strait meant to uphold the principle of freedom of navigation for all countries, read a statement Monday by the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet. The U.S. Navy, occasionally joined by ships from allied countries, regularly transits the sensitive waterway separating China from Taiwan. China condemned the maneuver, saying it undermined peace and stability in the region. The People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command said it mobilized naval and air forces to monitor the transit of the U.S. and Canadian ships 'in accordance with the law.' The transiting ships navigated 'through waters where high-seas freedom of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law,' read the U.S. Navy 7th Fleet statement. 'The international community’s navigational rights and freedoms in the Taiwan Strait should not be limited,' it added. The transit came less than a week after China conducted large-scale military exercises surrounding Taiwan and its outlying islands last Monday, simulating the sealing off of key ports in a move that underscores the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing employed a record 125 aircraft, as well as its Liaoning aircraft carrier and ships as part of the drills, which were in reaction to a National Day speech by Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te. Lai had emphasized his commitment to 'resist annexation or encroachment' by Beijing. Taiwan was a Japanese colony before being unified with China at the end of World War II. It split away in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists fled to the island as Mao Zedong’s Communists defeated them in a civil war and took power. The U.S. is Taiwan’s biggest unofficial ally and is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself.	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-canada-taiwan-strait-navy-74250cf8ed17221a92d9525e20e6be57	2024-10-20T19:11:01-07:00	
Putin hosts a summit in a bid to show the West it can't keep Russia off the global stage	In the coming days, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be shaking hands with multiple world leaders, including China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iran’s Masoud Pezeshkian. They will all be in the Russian city of Kazan on Tuesday for a meeting of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, defying predictions that the war in Ukraine and an international arrest warrant against Putin would turn him into a pariah. The alliance, which aims to counterbalance the Western-led world order, initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, but started to rapidly expand this year. Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia joined in January; Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia formally applied, and a number of others expressed a desire to be members. Russian officials already see it as a massive success. Putin’s foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said 32 countries confirmed participation, and more than 20 will send heads of state. Putin will hold around 20 bilateral meetings, Ushakov said, and the summit could turn into 'the largest foreign policy event ever held' on Russian soil. Optics and deals for the Kremlin Analysts say the Kremlin wants both the optics of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with its global allies amid continued tensions with the West, as well as the practicality of negotiating deals with them to shore up Russia's economy and its war effort. For the other participants, it’s a chance to amplify their voices and narratives. 'The beauty of BRICS is that it doesn’t put too many obligations on you,' says Alexander Gabuyev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. 'There are not that many strings attached, really, to being part of BRICS. And at the same time, there might be interesting opportunities coming your way, including just having more face time with all of these leaders.' For Putin, the summit is important personally because it shows the failure of Western efforts to isolate him, Gabuyev says. The gathering will demonstrate at home and abroad that 'Russia is really an important player that is leading this new group that will end the Western dominance -– that’s his personal narrative,' he says. The Kremlin will be able to talk to major players like India and China about expanding trade and bypassing Western sanctions. India is an important market for Russian commodities, while China is where Moscow hopes to get its hands on dual-use and various military-related goods, Gabuyev says. Russia also wants more countries participating in a payment system project that would be an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT, allowing Moscow to trade with its partners without worrying about sanctions. 'The Russian idea is that if you create a platform where there is China, Russia, India and Brazil and Saudi Arabia, many countries that are vital partners for the U.S., the U.S. will not be ready to go after this platform and sanction it,' Gabuyev said. Goals for Iran and China Russia also is expected to sign a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' treaty with Iran, bolstering the increasingly close ties between Moscow and Tehran. After the invasion of Ukraine, Iran provided Moscow with hundreds of drones and helped launch their production in Russia. The Iranian drone deliveries, which Moscow and Tehran have denied, have allowed for a constant barrage of long-range drone strikes at Ukraine’s infrastructure. Iran, in turn, wants sophisticated Russian weapons, like long-range air defense systems and fighter jets to help fend off a possible attack by Israel. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment when asked whether the treaty will include mutual military assistance. For China, BRICS is among several international organizations -– along with the security-focused Shanghai Cooperation Organization -– through which it seeks to promote an alternative to the U.S.-led world order. Xi pushed for enlarging BRICS, and the Kazan summit will consolidate economic, technological and military ties in the expanded bloc, said Willy Lam, a senior China fellow at the Jamestown Foundation. Beijing and Moscow also want to see if a new international trading currency could 'challenge so-called dollar hegemony,' Lam said. The summit will allow Xi and Putin to flaunt their close relationship. The two, who announced a 'no-limits' partnership only weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, already have met at least twice this year, in Beijing in May and at a SCO summit in Kazakhstan in July. Although they will continue to present a united front, experts are watching for subtle signs of Xi distancing himself from Putin over the war. 'While Putin will want the China-Russia relationship to appear as good as ever, Xi may also want to signal to Western states and others that Beijing officially remains ‘neutral’ in Russia’s war in Ukraine and is not a formal ally of Moscow,' said Eva Seiwert, a foreign policy and security expert with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. 'This will be crucial for conveying the image of China as a serious and legitimate peacemaker in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.' Balancing acts for India and Turkey An expected Modi-Putin meeting could see some rebalancing of their ties. Western friends want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the war. Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. New Delhi considers Moscow a time-tested partner from the Cold War, cooperating on defense, oil, nuclear energy, and space, despite Russia’s closer ties with India’s main rival, China. Their meeting will be the second in months. Modi visited Russia in July, saw President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine in August and traveled to the U.S. to see President Joe Biden in September. 'India can’t simply abandon Russia because of its deep defense ties, the question of the regional balance of power, and the logic of multi-alignment,' said Raja Mohan, a professor at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore. 'At the same time, it also builds and develops its relations with the U.S. and the West because that is where the logic of India’s major economic development and technological growth depends on partnership.' India and Brazil view BRICS primarily through an economic lens to promote a more equitable distribution of power in the international system, while 'China and Russia see it more as a geopolitical forum,' said Chietigi Bajpayee, who studies South Asia at the Chatham House in London. India and Brazil also don't want to be 'pulled into China's gravitational orbit,' said Theresa Fallon of the Center for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies. Another key participant is Turkey, which has applied to join the BRICS group. That comes at a time when the NATO member and European Union candidate is increasingly frustrated with the West. Turkey’s EU membership talks have stalled since 2016 due to disputes with Cyprus and concerns over human rights. Turkey’s relations with Washington have been strained over its removal from the F-35 fighter jet program after procuring a Russian missile defense system. Erdogan also has accused the U.S. and other Western allies of alleged 'complicity' in Israel’s military actions in Gaza. Membership in BRICS would help Erdogan 'strengthen his own hand' at a time when ties with the West are at a low, said Gonul Tol, director of the U.S.-based Middle East Institute’s Turkey program. Middle powers like Turkey 'try to extract more from both camps by being in-between camps, by having one foot in each camp,' he said. ___ Litvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.

King Charles and Queen Camilla lay wreaths at Australian War Memorial then greet well-wishers	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — King Charles III and Queen Camilla laid wreaths at the Australian War Memorial in the national capital Canberra on Monday then shook hands with well-wishers on the second full day of their visit. Charles, 75, is being treated for cancer, which has led to a scaled-down itinerary. It is Charles’ 17th trip to Australia and the first since he became king in 2022. It is the first visit to Australia by a reigning British monarch since his late mother Queen Elizabeth II traveled to the distant nation in 2011. Charles and Camilla rested the day after their arrival before they made their first public appearance of the trip at a church service in Sydney on Sunday. They then flew to Canberra where they visited the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier then a reception at Parliament House hosted by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The couple took their time leaving the war memorial to greet hundreds of people who gathered gathered under clear skies flying Australian flags. The temperature was forecast to reach a mild high of 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). The reception was not attended by the government leaders of all six Australian states, who declined invitations because they would prefer an Australian citizen as head of state rather than the British monarch. Albanese would also prefer Australia became a republic but has ruled out putting the question to a referendum during his current term. On Wednesday, Charles will travel to Samoa, where he will open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-canberra-king-charles-visit-4ea87d39d17c4a9fe3cbfab3455fb8f7	2024-10-20T17:48:26-07:00	
Environmental delegates gather in Colombia for a conference on dwindling global biodiversity	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Global environmental leaders gathered Monday in Cali, Colombia to assess the world’s plummeting biodiversity levels and commitments by countries to protect plants, animals and critical habitats. The two-week United Nations Biodiversity Conference, or COP16, is a follow-up to the 2022 Montreal meetings where 196 countries signed a historic global treaty to protect biodiversity. The accord includes 23 measures to halt and reverse nature loss, including putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030. In opening remarks on Sunday, Colombia's environment minister and COP16 president Susana Muhamad said the conference is an opportunity 'to collect the experience that has passed through this planet from all civilizations, from all cultures, from all knowledge ... to generate livable, relatively stable conditions for a new society that will be forged in the light of the crisis.' A real threat to biodiversity loss All evidence shows dramatic decline in species abundance and distribution, said Linda Krueger, director of biodiversity at The Nature Conservancy. 'A lot of wild species have less room to live, and they’re declining in numbers,' Krueger said. 'And we also see rising extinction rates. Things that we haven’t even discovered yet are blinking out.' The world is experiencing its largest loss of life since the dinosaurs, with around 1 million plant and animal species now threatened with extinction, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. In the Amazon rainforest, threats to biodiversity include the expansion of the agricultural frontier and road networks, deforestation, forest fires and drought, says Andrew Miller, advocacy director at Amazon Watch, an organization that protects the rainforest. 'You put all of that together and it’s a real threat to biodiversity,' Miller said. Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to the WWF and the Zoological Society of London biennial Living Planet report this month. The report said Latin America and the Caribbean saw 95% average declines in recorded wildlife populations. Indigenous communities key to biodiversity protection Indigenous people are on the front lines of protecting biodiversity and fighting against climate change, putting their lives at great risk, said Miller of Amazon Watch. 'A lot of discourse has been given about the voices of local communities … Indigenous peoples really playing a key role,' he said. 'So that’s one of the things that we’ll be looking for at COP16.' Indigenous peoples hold the solutions to combat the climate change and biodiversity crises, said Laura Rico, campaign director at Avaaz, a global activism nonprofit. 'They're who have been taking care of the land, healing the land through their governance systems, their care systems and their ways of life,' she said. 'So ... it's fundamental that the COP recognizes, promotes and encourages the legalization of their territories.' In Colombia’s capital, Bogota, the head of an Amazon Indigenous organization said the region's Indigenous people have been preparing for months for COP16. 'This is a great opportunity to make the impact that we need to demonstrate to all the actors that come from other countries the importance of Indigenous peoples for the world,' said José Mendez, secretary of the National Organization of the Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon. 'It's no secret to anyone that we ... are at risk right now,' he said. 'The effects that we are currently experiencing due to climate change, the droughts that the country is experiencing, the Amazon River has never gone through a drought like the current one. … This is causing many species to become extinct.' Nature can recover Environment minister Muhamad told local media this month that one of the conference's main objectives is to deliver the message that 'biodiversity is as important, complementary and indispensable as the energy transition and decarbonization.' Part of Colombia's first ever leftist government, Muhamad cautioned last year's World Economic Forum about the risks of continuing an extractive economy that ignores the social and environmental consequences of natural resource exploitation. Since the 2022 Montreal conference, 'progress has been too slow', says Eva Zabey, executive director of the coalition Business for Nature. 'There's been some progress,' she said. 'But the headline message is the implementation of the global biodiversity framework is too slow and we need to scale and speed up.' 'COP16 comes at an absolutely critical moment for us to move from targets setting to real actions on the ground,' Zabey said. Although biodiversity declines are grim, some environmentalists believe a reversal is possible. 'We’ve had some very successful species reintroductions and we’ve saved species when we really focus on what is causing their decline,' said The Nature Conservancy's Krueger. __ Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan __ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

In one portrait, an AP Photographer tells the story of how difficult the job of a miner is	STONAVA, Czech Republic (AP) — AP photographer Petr David Josek started working with The Associated Press in 2002 and became a full-time staffer in 2011, when he got the Prague bureau job. Since then, he has covered the Iraq War, eight Olympics and four World Cups among numerous sports and news assignments. Here’s what he had to say about this extraordinary photo. Why this photo? When walking through the dark shafts of the mine you come across quite a few miners, but this guy’s unique physique struck me. I figured it would be nice to get some portraits of the man. Luckily, he walked past me more than once, so I had few chances to shoot a couple of frames as he was doing his work. How I made this photo I shot this picture on 24mm 1.4 lens at 1000/sec. Going to the mine is somehow specific. It’s a very dusty and dark environment, so I figured less equipment is better for that. I took two cameras that I covered with foil for protection from the dust and two fixed lenses, 24 mm and 85 mm. I was equipped with a flashlight that you use to navigate through the mine - it also helped for the pictures, as you can light up your subject. Why it works I had several pictures of this man but I think in this one, the combination of his strong posture, his facial expression and the dirt on his body reflects the best, just how hard this job really is. Also, the fact that his eyes aren’t seen makes it a bit more mysterious.

Expelled Indian high commissioner denies involvement in murder of Sikh leader in Canada	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — India’s high commissioner to Canada has denied any involvement in the murder of a Canadian Sikh leader who was killed in British Columbia last year even though the Canadian government has named him as a person of interest in the assassination. Sanjay Kumar Verma, who was expelled last Monday along with five other Indian diplomats, said in an interview on CTV’s Question Period Sunday that the allegations are politically motivated. 'Nothing at all,' Verma said when asked if he had any role in in the shooting of Hardeep Singh Nijjar who was killed outside a cultural center in Surrey, British Columbia on June 18, 2023. 'No evidence presented. Politically motivated.' Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Nijjar’s murder and are awaiting trial. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police went public this week with allegations that Indian diplomats were targeting Sikh separatists in Canada by sharing information about them with their government back home. They said top Indian officials were then passing that information to Indian organized crime groups who were targeting the activists, who are Canadian citizens, with drive-by shootings, extortions and even murder. Verma denied the Indian government was targeting Sikh separatists in Canada. 'I, as high commissioner of India, have never done anything of that kind,' he said. Any action taken by Indian officials in Canada was 'overt,' said Verma. In the interview Verma condemned Nijjar’s death. 'Any murder is wrong and bad,' he said. 'I do condemn.' Verma also pushed back on comments made by Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly that compared India to Russia. She said Canada’s national police force has linked Indian diplomats to homicides, death threats and intimidation in Canada. 'Let me see the concrete evidence she’s talking about,' said Verma. 'As far as I’m concerned, she’s talking politically.' India has rejected the Canadian accusations as absurd, and its foreign ministry said it was expelling Canada’s acting high commissioner and five other diplomats in response. Verma said 'not a shred of evidence has been shared with us' about the Canadian allegations. The RCMP has said attempts earlier this month to share evidence with Indian officials were unsuccessful. Verma said the RCMP had not applied for the proper visas to visit India. 'A visa needs to be affixed,' he said. 'For any government delegation to travel to another country, you need an agenda to go by. There was no agenda at all.' Canada is not the only country that has accused Indian officials of plotting an assassination on foreign soil. The U.S. Justice Department announced criminal charges against an Indian government employee Thursday in connection with an alleged foiled plot to kill a Sikh separatist leader living in New York City. In the case announced by the Justice Department, Vikash Yadav, who authorities say directed the New York plot from India, faces murder-for-hire charges in a planned killing that prosecutors have previously said was meant to precede a string of other politically motivated murders in the United States and Canada. 'An indictment is not a conviction,' Verma said. 'It will follow its judicial process.' India has repeatedly criticized the Canadian government for being soft on supporters of what is known as the Khalistan movement, which is banned in India but has support among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada. The Khalistan movement supports the establishment of an independent Sikh state in India. The Nijjar killing in Canada has soured India-Canada ties for more than a year, but Verma doesn’t expect this will impact business relations between the two countries. 'I don’t see much impact on non-political bilateral relations,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-india-diplomats-sikh-5d0dc43576a99e8355e605785a9cb5ca	2024-10-20T11:36:44-07:00	
Cyprus thwarted a digital attack against the government's main online portal	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cyprus said Sunday that it has successfully thwarted a digital attack aimed at blocking access to the government’s central online portal, the latest in a string of similar attacks over a three-day period against state-run utilities and the Cypriot subsidiary of a Greek energy company. Cyprus’ Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy said in a statement that 'a quick and coordinated response' by authorities foiled the attack, whose purpose was exclusively to prevent access to specific government websites. The distributed denial-of-service attack, or DDoS, only affected the main government portal gov.cy 'for a few minutes' and that no other online government ministry or service website was affected. The deputy ministry didn’t say who was behind the attacks or what the possible motive may have been. Sunday’s attack came after Cyprus’ electricity and telecommunications authorities, as well as the operator of the island nation’s two airports, Hermes and fuel company EKO Cyprus Ltd., were targeted on Friday and Saturday. Officials told the Cyprus News Agency that all those attacks had also failed and that no client information had been leaked or compromised.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-cyber-digital-attack-a5971b2387269a8c154a09998e3697f5	2024-10-20T10:31:32-07:00	
Catholic priest and Indigenous activist Pérez killed by 2 gunmen in southern Mexico	TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) — Catholic priest Marcelo Pérez, an activist for Indigenous peoples and farm laborers in southern Mexico, was killed on Sunday. The prosecutors' office in the city of San Cristóbal de las Casas, in the state of Chiapas, said the religious leader was shot dead by two gunmen when he was in his van. Pérez was a member of the Tzotzil Indigenous people and had just finished serving a Mass when he was attacked. He served the community for two decades and was known as a negotiator in conflicts in a mountainous region of Chiapas where crime, violence and land disputes are rife. Pérez also led several marches against violence, which has brought him several death threats. Chipas Gov. Rutilio Escandón posted on X that he condemned 'the cowardly assassination of father Marcelo Pérez. 'We will collaborate with all the authorities so his death doesn't go unpunished and those guilty face the courts,' Escandón said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/catholic-priest-mexico-killing-455bc3fb6fe5005b7e47d4758e4c63cd	2024-10-20T09:54:40-07:00	
Hundreds gather in central London to mourn death of singer Liam Payne	LONDON (AP) — Hundreds gathered Sunday in London’s Kensington Gardens to mourn Liam Payne as fans around the world grieved for the One Direction singer who died this week. Directioners, as supporters of the massively successful boy band are known, left tributes in London, Glasgow, Paris, Sydney and New York this weekend as they celebrated the life of the 31-year-old who died Wednesday after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. In London, they clapped and sang after gathering near a statue of Peter Pan, the fictional boy who never grew up created by J.M. Barrie. The mourners, mostly young women, left heart shaped balloons, photographs and flowers at the base of the statute, which sits next to a narrow path next to a waterway known as The Long Water. Mindful of the crowds in the limited space, organizers asked fans to leave their tributes then move away to allow others to approach the statue. Fans Lauren Anderson and Natasha Bradley, both 23, said they wanted to be with others who shared their grief. 'Your parents, they don’t really understand how much (One Direction) really meant to you growing up,' Bradley said, explaining why she came to the park. The vigils followed those that took place outside the Casa Sur Hotel in the chic Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital immediately after Payne fell from his third-floor hotel room. The four surviving members of One Direction issued a joint statement saying they were 'completely devastated' by the death of their bandmate. In Paris' Tuileries Gardens, hundreds of fans — many of them crying and carrying flowers — gathered to remember Payne. They sang songs and consoled each other. Some lit candles. Others brought photos and artwork of Payne, as well as notes, letters and bouquets. About 400 people attended the gathering, overlooking Paris’ historic Place de la Concorde. Distraught 26-year-old Emilie Houdinet said she’d been a fan of the band since 2011. 'They helped me. They were there throughout my adolescence to age 18. They were a bit like dads to us,' she said. 'They were just a boys band but they were very important to us.' One Direction rose to worldwide popularity soon after the band was formed in 2010 from five young singers who auditioned for the X Factor, a British TV talent show. The band broke up in 2016 after producing five albums that sold more than 70 million copies. ___ Associated Press writer John Leicester in Paris contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-liam-payne-vigil-kensington-gardens-c14bec35ea2b14c27bf29368cfeed4b8	2024-10-20T09:22:12-07:00	
A group of 2,000 migrants in southern Mexico depart for the US weeks before election	TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) — A group of about 2,000 migrants left Mexico's southern border Sunday hoping to reach the country's north and ultimately the United States. The development comes weeks before the U.S. presidential election, in which immigration has been a key issue. Some migrants, like Venezuelan Joel Zambrano, believe a new administration in the U.S. could put an end to asylum appointments through an online system called CBP One. 'That is what makes us fearful. They say this could change because they could both close the CBP One appointment and all the services that are helping migrants,' he said. Both the lack of jobs in Mexico's south due to a new wave of incoming foreigners and a delay in asylum appointments in the U.S. have motivated more groups of migrants to leave the region in the past month. 'The situation in my country is very bad, the president doesn't do anything for us. We spent a week by the border, but getting documents takes time,' said Honduran Roberto Domínguez, 48. 'The documents we get are only for us to be in Tapachula and we cannot leave the city.' The group leaving Sunday was the third and the largest since the beginning of the administration of new Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who so far has made no changes in immigration policies established by her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Groups of 800 and 600 migrants left the region earlier in October. Activist Luis García Villagrán estimates about 40,000 migrants are currently stranded in southern Mexico. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-migration-south-us-elections-a79f782a126dad73cd7ca784e6fc03d7	2024-10-20T08:36:32-07:00	
Indonesia's new president announces Cabinet. It's the largest in the country's history	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced his Cabinet late Sunday, hours after he was inaugurated. The lineup of 109 ministers, vice ministers and head of national agencies was the largest in the country’s history, and he named it the 'Red and White Cabinet,' referring to the colors of Indonesia’s national flag. Subianto became the eighth president of Southeast Asia’s largest economy on Sunday. The Cabinet of Subianto’s predecessor, Joko Widodo, had 34 ministers and head of government agencies. Subianto has said earlier that he needs a strong administration, even though analysts said that his 'fat' Cabinet would bloat the bureaucracy. 'I want to create a strong government that would unite our multicultural society and diverse political interests,' Subianto said before inviting more than 100 people for interviews at his residence last week. 'It must be a big coalition, and some will say my Cabinet is fat.' The Cabinet features politicians from a coalition of seven parties who supported his victory in the February election, and figures allied with Widodo’s Cabinet, who were reappointed to continue their jobs under Subianto’s presidency. Analysts said the move was a political reward to Widodo for the latter’s tacit support in the election. Subianto was sworn in with his new vice president, 37-year-old Surakarta ex-Mayor Gibran Rakabuming Raka. He chose Raka, who is Widodo’s son, as his running mate, with Widodo favoring Subianto over the candidate of his own former party. The former rivals became tacit allies, even though Indonesian presidents don’t typically endorse candidates. Subianto was a longtime rival of the Widodo, who ran against him for the presidency twice and refused to accept his defeat on both occasions, in 2014 and 2019. But Widodo appointed Subianto as defense chief after his reelection, paving the way for an alliance despite their rival political parties. During the campaign, Subianto ran as the popular outgoing president’s heir, vowing to continue signature policies like the construction of a multibillion-dollar new capital city and limits on exporting raw materials intended to boost domestic industry. Backed by Widodo, Subianto swept to a landslide victory in February’s direct presidential election on promises of policy continuity. Subianto reappointed nearly half of Widodo’s Cabinet members, including Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, making her the first person to hold the ministry under three different presidents. Indrawati, 62, who has served as the executive director of the International Monetary Fund and managing director of the World Bank, is one of Indonesia’s longest-serving finance ministers, having held the post for long stretches under Presidents Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Joko Widodo. She has earned considerable respect in international circles, particularly for her reforms of the chaotic Indonesian taxation system and her role in steering Indonesia through the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. 'We regularly consulted with each other to discuss strategies for strengthening the Finance Ministry and the state finances to support his programs,' Indrawati told reporters after meeting with Subianto last week. Other ministers from Widodo’s Cabinet include Interior Minister Tito Karnavian, Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan, Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia and State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir. Subianto has announced an ambitious goal of increasing annual economic growth to 8% by the end of his five-year term, and embarking on an ambitious spending program, including an increase in defense spending, hikes in civil servants’ salaries, and a program to give 83 million children free meals.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-new-cabinet-prabowo-subianto-6b1f915d584c823aa16dbc38374c739c	2024-10-20T08:16:58-07:00	
Cubans struggle as power not fully restored to the island after days of blackout	HAVANA (AP) — Many Cubans were waiting in anguish on Sunday as electricity on much of the island has yet to be totally restored after days of blackout. Some neighborhoods had electricity restored in Cuba’s capital, where 2 million people live, but most of Havana remained dark. The impact of the blackout goes beyond lighting, as services like water supply also depend on electricity to run pumps. People resorted to cooking with improvised wood stoves on the streets before the food went bad in refrigerators. In tears, Ylenis de la Caridad Napoles, mother of a 7-year-old girl, says she is reaching a point of 'desperation.' The failure of the Antonio Guiteras plant on Friday, which caused the collapse of the island's whole system, was just the latest in a series of problems with energy distribution in a country where electricity has been restricted and rotated to different regions at different times of the day. People lined up for hours on Sunday morning to buy bread in the few bakeries that could reopen. Some Cubans like Rosa Rodríguez have been without electricity for four days. 'We have millions of problems, and none of them are solved,' Rodríguez said. The blackout was considered to be Cuba’s worst in two years after Hurricane Ian made landfall as a Category 3 storm in 2022 and damaged power installations. It took days for the government to fix them. This year, some homes have spent up to eight hours a day without electricity. There is no official estimate for when the blackout will end. Even in a country that is used to outages as part of a deepening economic crisis, Friday’s collapse was massive. The Cuban government has announced emergency measures to slash electricity demand, including suspending school and university classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling nonessential services. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-power-outage-blackout-struggles-e5330cbf1d7ffc8dab62b69e1782869f	2024-10-20T06:00:33-07:00	
Yehuda Bauer, prominent Israeli Holocaust scholar, dies at 98	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Yehuda Bauer, one of Israel’s foremost Holocaust scholars who shaped the way people around the world study and learn about the Holocaust, has died in Jerusalem. He was 98. No specific cause of death was given by the Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, which announced his death Friday evening. Bauer published dozens of books and founded numerous international Holocaust education initiatives over a career that spanned more than six decades. He spoke Czech, Slovak, German, Hebrew, Yiddish, English, French and Polish, and learned Welsh while studying at Cardiff University in Wales. His mastery of languages allowed him to study source material in its original form and connect directly with audiences across the world. 'One of his important points was that the Holocaust is not only a particular event that affected particular people, but that the Holocaust was also universal,' said Dr. David Silberklang, a senior historian at the International Institute for Holocaust Research at Yad Vashem who worked closely with Bauer for years. 'Once it happened, and human beings did what they did, it has entered the playbook, the potential of what human beings could do and therefore could be done again,' he said. Bauer was born in Prague in 1926. As a teenager, his family was able to flee Europe in 1939 and came to British Mandate Palestine via Romania. After returning from university in Wales, he joined Kibbutz Shoval in southern Israel and studied at the Hebrew University. He lived in Jerusalem for the last decades of his life. Bauer launched his academic career in the 1960s, during a time when people in Israel were just starting to talk more openly about the Holocaust. In the immediate years after the Holocaust, as many survivors were shattered and trying to build their lives, very few people spoke openly about what had happened. Silberklang said that the country needed time and perspective before it could start examining the Holocaust under an academic lens, and that Bauer was one of the first wave of scholars to begin rigorous research on a topic that had previously been too painful to discuss. In Israel, shame and guilt swirled around perception that European Jews had gone 'like sheep to the slaughter.' Bauer’s research delved into different aspects of Jewish resistance and began to change the narrative of how victims of the Holocaust had found ways to resist the Nazis beyond just armed struggle, such as smuggling or continuing to observe religious or cultural traditions. Some of his most well-known publications include 'American Jewry and the Holocaust,' probing the American response to WWII; 'Jews for Sale?' about negotiations to rescue Jews during the Holocaust; 'Death of the Shtetl' about the decimation of the small Jewish communities in Europe; and 'Rethinking the Holocaust,' examining fundamental questions about how to define and explain the Holocaust and how or whether the Holocaust can be compared to other genocides. Bauer was known for directly engaging with non-academic audiences and spoke widely around the world. With European heads of state, Bauer helped create the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) in 1998, a coalition of more than 35 countries that requires its members to devote government funding to Holocaust education and commemoration. With IHRA, Bauer also helped author the Working Definition of Antisemitism, which is used by many governments and organizations to help define hate crimes and discrimination against Jews. Bauer was awarded the Israel Prize, one of the country’s highest honors, in 1998. Silberklang said Bauer remained engaged and active until the end of his life, including writing Op Eds and contributing to academic discussions. Silberklang said Bauer disagreed with the comparison of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack against Israel to the Holocaust, noting that the Palestinian militant group is not as strong or organized as the Nazis and the state of Israel exists to provide a military response. A lover of music, Bauer had a deep baritone and was known to sing duets with some of his academic partners or break out into traditional Welsh folk songs he learned as a university student, Silberklang said. He is survived by two daughters, three step-children, and numerous grandchildren.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-holocaust-scholar-yehuda-bauer-dead-febc76ad8836b85019781f55599526ec	2024-10-20T03:19:17-07:00	
French league condemns homophobic chants made by PSG fans about Marseille and Rabiot	PARIS (AP) — The French soccer league has condemned homophobic chants made by some Paris Saint-Germain fans during the home game against Strasbourg on Saturday. PSG is playing its bitter rival next Sunday in Marseille and the offensive slurs were made about the club and its midfielder Adrien Rabiot. He is a former PSG player who made more than 200 appearances for the club from 2012-19, and his move to Marseille is seen as a betrayal. 'These latest discriminatory chants made by Paris Saint-Germain supporters are unacceptable when, at the same time, the whole of professional soccer has been working to ban homophobic behavior and chants from stadiums,' the league, known as LFP, said in a statement. While the chanting was happening, the stadium announcer at Parc des Princes twice asked for the chants to stop and was jeered. The LFP said its disciplinary committee would look into evidence. Last season, some PSG players received a one-match suspended sentence by the league's disciplinary committee for offensive chants aimed at Marseille after a home league match. Ousmane Dembélé, Achraf Hakimi, Randal Kolo Muani and Layvin Kurzawa were filmed using insults while celebrating at the end of a 4-0 win against Marseille. The four players issued apologies. That match was also marred by homophobic chanting by sections of PSG fans targeting Marseille players. As a result, the league ordered the closure of the Auteuil stand behind one of the goals for two matches, including one that was suspended. The French government also condemned the chants and said France's sports minister Gil Avérous will meet with the LFP president early next week to discuss measures to stop this happening again. French champion PSG hosts PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Tuesday. PSG fans are banned from attending next Sunday's game in Marseille at Stade Velodrome for security reasons, with a history of clashes between rival fans. The rivalry between the clubs has been one of the most vehement in French soccer since the 1990s, when Marseille was enjoying its heyday and PSG was becoming more ambitious with the backing of television broadcaster Canal Plus. PSG has been bankrolled by Qatari investors QSI since 2011 and has become the most successful French club domestically with 12 league titles — two more than Marseille and Saint-Etienne. Although Marseille has not won the league since 2010 it still claims the ultimate bragging right over PSG. Marseille is the only French club to win the Champions League, beating Italian giant AC Milan 1-0 in the 1993 final, while PSG lost its only final 1-0 against Bayern Munich in the pandemic-shortened 2020 campaign. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/psg-homophobic-chants-marseille-rabiot-18c54ca03ac50b2713deae307c3f2c62	2024-10-20T01:37:25-07:00	
Palestinian officials say 87 dead or missing after Israeli strikes on northern Gaza	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — At least 87 people are dead or missing after Israeli strikes on multiple homes in the northern Gaza Strip overnight and into Sunday, the territory's Health Ministry said. It said another 40 people were wounded in the strikes on the town of Beit Lahiya, which was among the first targets of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago. There was no immediate comment on the strikes from the Israeli military, which said it was 'continuing to operate across Gaza in both aerial strikes and ground operations.' Israel has been carrying out a major operation in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, also in northern Gaza, for the last two weeks. The military says it launched the operation against Hamas militants who had regrouped there. The north has already suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, and has been encircled by Israeli forces since late last year, following the deadly Hamas' attack on Israel. Israel ordered the entire population of the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, to evacuate to the south in the opening weeks of the war and reiterated those instructions earlier this month. Most of the population fled last year, but around 400,000 people are believed to have remained in the north. Palestinians who fled the north at the start of the war have not been allowed to return.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-lebanon-10-20-2024-42ea48ce0f6a31d53a25dc50f16796bc	2024-10-20T00:48:04-07:00	
Kyiv launches more than 100 drones over Russia as a missile strike on Ukraine injures 17	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian air defenses shot down more than 100 Ukrainian drones Sunday over Russia’s western regions, Moscow officials said, while 17 people were injured in the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih in a ballistic missile attack. The Russian Defense Ministry said 110 drones were destroyed in the overnight barrage against seven Russian regions. Many targeted Russia’s border region of Kursk, where 43 drones were reportedly shot down. Social media footage appeared to show air defenses at work over the city of Dzerzhinsk in the Nizhny Novgorod region, close to a factory producing explosives. Local Gov. Gleb Nikitin wrote on social media Sunday that four fighters had been injured repelling a drone attack over Dzerzhinsk's industrial zone, but did not give further details. Such large-scale aerial attacks are still relatively rare over Russia 2 1/2 years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A similar attack at the end of September saw Russia’s Ministry of Defense report the destruction of 125 drones across seven regions. Meanwhile, 17 people were injured in Ukraine’s Kryvyi Rih after the city was hit with two Russian ballistic missiles, officials said Sunday. The attack late Saturday evening damaged homes and businesses, said local administration head Oleksandr Vilkul. In a statement on social media, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia had launched some 800 guided aerial bombs and more than 500 attack drones over Ukraine in the past week alone. 'Every day, Russia strikes our cities and communities. It is deliberate terror from the enemy against our people,' he said, renewing calls for continued air support from the country’s allies. 'United in defense, the world can stand against this targeted terror.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drone-strike-missiles-kryvyi-rih-b6d8d5f42fcb3c08d839410fea64afa8	2024-10-19T23:58:53-07:00	
Iraq's Kurdish region goes to the polls with a flagging economy and political infighting top of mind	IRBIL, Iraq (AP) — Residents of Iraq’s semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region went to the polls in long-awaited parliamentary elections Sunday under the shadow of ongoing rivalries, economic instability, and unresolved disputes with Baghdad. The primary competitors are the two dominant Kurdish parties: the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Historically, these two parties have controlled different parts of the region, with the KDP overseeing Irbil and Dohuk and the PUK governing Sulaymaniyah. This division has frequently led to political deadlock. The parliamentary elections, originally set for 2022, were postponed several times amid disputes over the election law and procedures. Ministry of Interior personnel and peshmerga forces — the regional military — voted in special elections Friday, with the general public voting Sunday. In Friday’s special election, the KDP secured a significant lead, capturing 60% of the votes, while the PUK got around 30%. The New Generation Movement, an opposition party that has seen a gradual rise in support, garnered 5.3% of the total, up from 3% in the 2018 special election. In that special election, the KDP garnered 40% of the vote and the PUK 28.5%. While New Generation’s appeal continues to grow, particularly among younger voters frustrated with the traditional political system, it still faces significant challenges in competing with the well-established dominance of the KDP and PUK. The region’s economic struggles are voters’ primary concern. Despite its oil wealth, the Kurdish region faces significant economic issues, including delayed payment of salaries to civil servants, fluctuating oil prices, and budget cuts from Baghdad. The public is deeply dissatisfied with the economy and lack of opportunities, and many blame political leaders for mismanagement. 'People want to have electricity and get paid their salary on time, and to have more jobs. This is all they want,' said Ghazi Najib, who went to the polls in Irbil. Corruption is also among the central issues in the election. For years, the regional government has faced allegations of nepotism and lack of transparency. Many voters, particularly in the younger generation, are calling for reforms to address these concerns. Many voters, however, have lost hope for reforms and are also skeptical of opposition parties’ ability to make changes, given the longstanding hold the two major parties have over the political landscape. Political cooperation with the central government is another key electoral issue. Relations between Irbil and Baghdad have remained tense since a 2017 referendum over independence for the Kurdish region, particularly over issues of oil revenue sharing and budget allocations. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani in a recent visit to Irbil said, 'We are committed to ensuring the rights of the Kurdish people, but this must be done within Iraq’s constitution.' In certain areas, the current elections are significantly influenced by security concerns since Islamic State sleeper cells are still active in areas that are disputed between the regional and central governments. 'We hope that Kurdistan will be more developed, and to see more safety and reconstruction in Kurdistan,' said Jamila Mohammed Amin, a voter in Irbil, using the region's local name. 'All political parties and entities should work together and achieve these goals and protect it against enemies.' ___ Associated Press journalist Salar Salim in Irbil contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iraq-kurdish-region-elections-krg-kdp-puk-21784b4ca26ded5ef15d2ccb3ff04f25	2024-10-19T23:07:33-07:00	
German authorities arrest Libyan man suspected of planning attack on Israeli Embassy	BERLIN (AP) — German authorities said Sunday that they have arrested a Libyan national with suspected ties to the extremist Islamic State group who was allegedly planning a firearms attack on the Israeli Embassy. Police and other security forces detained the man on Saturday evening in Bernau, a town just outside of Berlin, and searched his home there, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said in a statement. The prosecutor’s office said the suspect was a Libyan national whom they identified only as Omar A. 'He intended to carry out a high-profile attack with firearms on the Israeli Embassy in Berlin,' the statement said. In his planning, the statement added, 'the accused exchanged information with a member of IS in a messenger chat.' Security forces also searched the home of another person who is considered a witness and not a suspect, the prosecutor's statement said. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said that German security authorities 'struck in time to thwart possible plans to attack the Israeli Embassy in Berlin.' 'This shows that protecting Jewish and Israeli institutions in our country is vital and of the utmost importance to us,' she added. The suspect brought on Sunday before an investigating judge at the country’s highest court, the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe. Israeli Ambassador Ron Prosor thanked the German security authorities 'for ensuring the security of our embassy,' German news agency dpa reported. News of the case first came from the Bild newspaper, which reported that a heavily armed elite police unit stormed the suspect’s home in Bernau. It said German authorities acted after receiving a tipoff from an unspecified foreign intelligence agency. 'We are acting with the utmost vigilance and attention in view of the high threat posed by Islamist, antisemitic and anti-Israel violence,' Faeser said. According to Bild, the suspect is a 28-year-old who arrived in Germany in November 2022 and applied for asylum. Dpa reported that his asylum request was rejected. Justice Minister Marco Buschmann also warned Sunday of a 'very serious' threat of Islamist terrorism in Germany. 'Israeli institutions are particularly often the target of terrorists,' he told dpa. A sharp increase in antisemitic incidents has been recorded in Germany since Hamas' attack on Israeli on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the ongoing wars in the Middle East.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-extremism-arrest-633b63aed3a28d74381279a970a9c7d9	2024-10-19T22:48:15-07:00	
Moldovans cast votes to choose president and decide on EU path as Russian interference claims spike	CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldovans cast their ballots in two key votes Sunday that could determine whether the European Union candidate country, which neighbors Ukraine, remains on a pro-Western path amid allegations that Russia has tried to undermine the electoral process. Incumbent President Maia Sandu was the favorite to secure another term in office in a presidential race in which 11 candidates were running. Voters will also choose 'yes' or 'no' in a referendum on whether to enshrine in the country’s constitution its path toward the 27-nation EU. Polls by WatchDog, a Chisinau-based think tank, showed a clear majority of more than 50% support the EU path. The referendum needed a one-third turnout to be valid. Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and are expected to close at 9 p.m. (1800 GMT). By 8 p.m., more than 1.5 million voters — about 50% of eligible voters — had cast ballots, according to the Central Electoral Commission. By 6 p.m., 42% had voted in the EU referendum, passing the validation threshold. 'I think that all the efforts of Russia to meddle in our elections and attempting to limit the participation of our citizens so far failed,' Iulian Groza, executive director of the Institute for European Policies and Reforms think tank, told The Associated Press. 'We are way beyond the threshold of one-third.' If Sandu fails to win an outright majority Sunday, a runoff will be held on Nov. 3, which could pit her against Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who is polling at around 10%. The two pivotal ballots are held amid ongoing claims by Moldovan authorities that Moscow has intensified an alleged 'hybrid war' campaign to destabilize the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections, and backing a major vote-buying scheme. U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby echoed those concerns this week, saying in a statement that 'Russia is working actively to undermine Moldova’s election and its European integration.' Moscow has repeatedly denied it is interfering in Moldova. 'In the last several months, Moscow has dedicated millions of dollars to influencing Moldova’s presidential election,' Kirby said. 'We assess that this money has gone toward financing its preferred parties and spreading disinformation on social media in favor of their campaigns.' In early October, Moldovan law enforcement said it had uncovered a massive vote-buying scheme orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled pro-Russia oligarch who currently resides in Russia, which paid 15 million euros ($16.2 million) to 130,000 individuals to undermine the two ballots. Shor was convicted in absentia last year and sentenced to 15 years in prison on fraud and money laundering in the case of $1 billion that went missing from Moldovan banks in 2014. He denied the allegations, saying 'the payments are legal' and cited a right to freedom of expression. Shor’s populist Russia-friendly Shor Party was declared unconstitutional last year and banned. Constantin Celac, a 37-year-old multimedia producer, said in central Chisinau that he cast his ballots in favor of Sandu and EU integration because 'it is the best way' forward for Moldova. He said that while he does have concerns about Russian meddling, 'I trust our government … to fight against them.' On Thursday, Moldovan authorities foiled another plot in which more than 100 young Moldovans received training in Moscow from private military groups on how to create civil unrest around the two votes. Some also attended 'more advanced training in guerrilla camps' in Serbia and Bosnia, police said, and four people were detained for 30 days. Sandu cast her own ballot in the capital on Sunday and told the media that 'Moldovans themselves must choose their own fate, and not others, nor the dirty money or the lies.' 'I voted for Moldova to be able to develop in peace and liberty,' she said. A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, a year after Sandu won the presidency. A parliamentary election will be held next year. Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.5 million, applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and was granted candidate status that summer, alongside Ukraine. Brussels agreed in June to start membership negotiations. Loredana Godorogea, a 29-year-old IT manager who lives in Chisinau, said she also voted in favor of the incumbent president and the path toward the EU. 'I think in the next five years we can be more close economically with the European Union, and I also think a big factor will be the war in Ukraine,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/moldova-elections-referendum-eu-russia-sandu-9411ab04ffb3230a83a4f8751c4e2414	2024-10-19T22:23:03-07:00	
Indonesia swears in Prabowo Subianto as the country's eighth president	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Prabowo Subianto was inaugurated Sunday as the eighth president of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, completing his journey from an ex-general accused of rights abuses during the dark days of Indonesia’s military dictatorship to the presidential palace. The former defense minister, who turned 73 on Thursday, was cheered through the streets by thousands of waving supporters after taking his oath on the Quran, the Muslim holy book, in front of lawmakers and foreign dignitaries. Banners and billboards to welcome the new president filled the streets of the capital, Jakarta, where tens of thousands gathered for festivities including speeches and musical performances along the city’s major throughfare. Wearing a blue Betawi traditional cloth and a dark baseball cap, Subianto stood up in the sunroof of a white van and waved, occasionally shaking peoples' hands, as his motorcade struggled to pass through the thousands of supporters calling his name and chanting 'Good luck Prabowo-Gibran,' filling the road leading from the parliament building to the presidential palace. 'I see a firm and patriotic figure in him,' said Atalaric Eka Prayoga, a 25-year-old Jakarta resident. 'That’s a figure we need to lead Indonesia.' 'I have high hopes that he can build Indonesia to be more advanced and improve the current gloomy economic situation,' said another resident, Silky Putri. Subianto was a longtime rival of the immensely popular President Joko Widodo, who ran against him for the presidency twice and refused to accept his defeat on both occasions, in 2014 and 2019. But Widodo appointed Subianto as defense chief after his reelection, paving the way for an alliance despite their rival political parties. During the campaign, Subianto ran as the popular outgoing president’s heir, vowing to continue signature policies like the construction of a multibillion-dollar new capital city and limits on exporting raw materials intended to boost domestic industry. Backed by Widodo, Subianto swept to a landslide victory in February’s direct presidential election on promises of policy continuity. Subianto was sworn in with his new vice president, 37-year-old Surakarta ex-Mayor Gibran Rakabuming Raka. He chose Raka, who is Widodo’s son, as his running mate, with Widodo favoring Subianto over the candidate of his own former party. The former rivals became tacit allies, even though Indonesian presidents don’t typically endorse candidates. But how he’ll govern the biggest economy in Southeast Asia — where nearly 90% of Indonesia’s 282 million people are Muslims — remains uncertain after a campaign in which he made few concrete promises besides continuity with the popular former president. Subianto, who comes from one of the country’s wealthiest families, is a sharp contrast to Widodo, the first Indonesian president to emerge from outside the political and military elite who came from a humble background and as president often mingled with working-class crowds. Subianto was a special forces commander until he was expelled by the army in 1998 over accusations that he played a role in the kidnappings and torture of activists and other abuses. He never faced trial and went into self-imposed exile in Jordan in 1998, although several of his underlings were tried and convicted. Jordanian King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein was expected to attend Sunday’s ceremony, but canceled at the last minute because of escalating Middle East tensions, instead deciding to send Foreign Affairs Minister Nancy Namrouqa as his special envoy. Subianto and Abdullah met in person in June for talks in Amman on humanitarian assistance to people affected by the war in Gaza. Subianto, who has never held elective office, will lead a massive, diverse archipelago nation whose economy has boomed amid strong global demand for its natural resources. But he’ll have to contend with global economic distress and regional tensions in Asia, where territorial conflicts and the United States-China rivalry loom large. Leaders and senior officials from more than 30 countries flew in to attend the ceremony, including Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and leaders of Southeast Asia countries. U.S. President Joe Biden sent Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Adm. Samuel Paparo, the U.S. Commander of the Indo-Pacific Command, was also among the American delegation. Army troops and police, along with armored vehicles, fire trucks and ambulances, were deployed across the capital, and major roads were closed to secure the swearing-in. The election outcome capped a long comeback for Subianto, who was banned for years from traveling to the United States and Australia. He has vowed to continue Widodo’s modernization efforts, which have boosted Indonesia’s economic growth by building infrastructure and leveraging the country’s abundant resources. A signature policy required nickel, a major Indonesian export and a key component of electric car batteries, to be processed in local factories rather than exported raw. He has also promised to push through Widodo’s most ambitious and controversial project: the construction of a new capital on Borneo, about 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) away from congested Jakarta. A rousing speaker, Subianto railed against widespread corruption in his inauguration speech, saying many people are unbale to get jobs, children are malnourished and their schools are not well maintained. 'Too many of our brothers and sisters are below the poverty line, too many of our children go to school without breakfast and do not have clothes for school,' Subianto said. Before February’s presidential election, he also promised to provide free school lunches and milk to 78.5 million students at more than 400,000 schools across the country, aiming to reduce malnutrition and stunted growth among children. 'We must dare to see all of this and we must dare to solve all of these problems,' Subianto said Sunday. He also pledged to continue a non-aligned foreign policy and to be a good neighbor. 'We will stand against all colonialism and we will defend the interests of oppressed people worldwide,' Subianto said. Indonesia is a bastion of democracy in Southeast Asia, a diverse and economically bustling region of authoritarian governments, police states and nascent democracies. After decades of dictatorship under President Suharto, the country was convulsed by political, ethnic and religious unrest in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since then, it has consolidated its democratic transition as the world’s third-largest democracy, and is home to a rapidly expanding middle class. ___ Associated Press journalists Edna Tarigan and Andi Jatmiko contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-new-president-prabowo-subianto-sworn-44f1cb606ab8aa825b20b7f154ba9721	2024-10-19T18:43:15-07:00

Children greet King Charles III and Queen Camilla outside a Sydney church	SYDNEY (AP) — King Charles III and Queen Camilla were greeted by children Sunday outside a Sydney church in their first public appearance of their Australian visit. Charles’ arrival Friday marked the first reigning British monarch visit to Australia since his late mother Queen Elizabeth II made her 16th journey to the distant nation in 2011. Charles, 75, is being treated for cancer, which has led to a scaled-down itinerary. The couple spent a rest day on Saturday at Admiralty House, the official Sydney residence of the monarch’s representative in Australia, Governor-General Sam Mostyn. The royals' first public engagement was at a service at St. Thomas’ Anglican Church in North Sydney. As Charles and Camilla made their way to the front of church, Sunday school children waving Australian flags cheered and shook hands with the couple. Inside, dozens of phones pointed in their direction, while excited whispers echoed through the room. After the service, the king and queen were greeted outside by hundreds of cheering people hoping to catch a glimpse or snap a photo. Sunday’s service was restricted to the local congregation, with only a few special guests allowed to attend, such as Mostyn and New South Wales state Governor Margaret Beazley. A small group of protesters demonstrated nearby under a banner that read, 'Empire Built on Genocide.' The couple later attended the New South Wales state Parliament to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Australia's first legislature. Charles gifted Parliament an hourglass, which is traditionally used to limit the duration of lawmakers' speeches. 'So with the sands of time encouraging brevity, it just remains for me to say what a great joy it is to come to Australia for the first time as sovereign and to renew a love of this country and its people which I have cherished for so long,' Charles said. It is Charles’ 17th trip to Australia and the first since he became king in 2022. The couple will attend a reception in the national capital, Canberra, on Monday. All government leaders of Australia’s six states have declined invitations to attend, which monarchists have interpreted as a snub. The non-attendants are all republicans who would prefer an Australian citizen as the nation’s head of state, rather than Britain’s monarch. On Wednesday, Charles will travel to Samoa, where he will open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. ___ This story corrects that the king gave the hourglass, he did not receive it.	https://apnews.com/article/sydney-church-king-charles-royals-visit-australia-8f0ac202a948d450bbcfe3532e915536	2024-10-19T16:53:42-07:00	
What to know about the electrical grid failure that plunged Cuba into darkness	HAVANA (AP) — Millions of people in Cuba were left without electricity for two days after the nation's energy grid went down when one of the island's major power plants failed. The widespread blackout that swept across the county was the worst in years. Authorities were able to restore power to some people by Saturday, but it was unclear when the power would be fully restored across the country. Here are a few things to know: What happened and why? About half of Cuba was plunged into darkness on Thursday evening, followed by the entire island on Friday morning after the failure of the Antonio Guiteras thermoelectric plant in Matanzas Province east of Havana. Even in a country that for decades has been accustomed to frequent outages amid a series of economic crises, the grid failure was unprecedented in modern times, aside from incidents involving powerful hurricanes, such as one in 2022. Even as Cuba worked to fix the power problems Saturday, the country issued hurricane watches for the far eastern Guantanamo, Holguin and Las Tunas provinces as a tropical storm developed into Hurricane Oscar, the 10th hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. Authorities said the outage that began Thursday stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residences’ air conditioners — as many as 100,000 additional ones this year alone. They also blamed breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained because of a lack of hard currency due to U.S. sanctions, as well as insufficient fuel to operate some facilities. Has this happened before? While some homes have spent up to eight hours a day this year without electricity as the grid has grown more unstable, the current power failure is considered Cuba’s worst in years. Officials said that 1.64 gigawatts went offline during peak hours, about half the total demand at the time. The government implemented emergency measures to slash demand, suspended classes, and shut down some state-owned workplaces and canceled non-essential services. Another major collapse occurred two years ago after Hurricane Ian, an intense Category 3 storm, damaged power installations and the government took days to fix them. Any political consequences? It's unknown how Cubans will react if the current blackout endures or recurs. But problems in the electrical grid have helped sparked street protests several times in recent years, including large demonstrations in July 2021 that led to international criticism of the government for its harsh response. There were also smaller demonstrations due to blackouts in October 2022 and March of this year. Authorities now say changes to electricity rates for small- and medium-sized companies, which have proliferated since they were first authorized by the communist government in 2021, are being considered. What's next? Officials said the state-owned power company UNE was using distributed generation to provide power to some areas of the island and that a gas-fired thermoelectric plant was starting operations. Cuba gets its power from huge thermoelectric plants like Antonio Guiteras and some smaller ones, which require crude oil to operate. The country produces about half of the crude needed, but must purchase some of the rest on the international market, which can be difficult and costly due to U.S. sanctions. It has also depended on allies like Venezuela and Russia for cheaper fuel. Authorities have been working since last year on a project to upgrade the island’s electrical grid through the use of alternative power sources. A project to build 31 centers generating solar energy is under way and projected to be completed next year. 'We are devoting absolute priority to addressing and solving this highly sensitive energy contingency,' Cuba’s President Miguel Díaz-Canel wrote on X. 'There will be no rest until its restoration.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-power-outage-explained-f610223f714afe994c3ad9658bb4de7d	2024-10-19T15:18:44-07:00	
US investigating unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel attack plans	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel's plans to attack Iran, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press. A fourth U.S. official said the documents appear to be legitimate. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents, which are marked top secret, were posted online to Telegram and first reported by CNN and Axios. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained — including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the U.S. intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack — and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, the official said. As part of that investigation, officials are working to determine who had access to the documents before they were posted, the official said. The documents emerged as the U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and press for a ceasefire in Gaza, and has likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand military operations in the north in Lebanon and risk a wider regional war. However, Israel's leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let Iran's missile attack go unanswered. In a statement, the Pentagon said it was aware of the reports of the documents but did not have further comment.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-us-documents-attack-e7e23d09a2f1fc14498e64b38d74576f	2024-10-19T15:11:32-07:00	
Vasso Papandreou, champion of women in Greek politics, dies at 79	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Vasso Papandreou, a trailblazing Greek politician who served as a government minister, European commissioner and leading advocate for women’s representation in politics, has died at her home in an Athens suburb. She was 79. No cause of death was given, but she had been in poor health for several years. Her funeral was held Saturday outside Aegio, near the town of her birth in southern Greece, and was attended by former Socialist prime minister Costas Simitis and other veteran politicians. Politicians across party lines paid tribute to Papandreou following her death Thursday, recognizing her contributions to Greece and dedication to social justice. 'Even though we found ourselves on opposite sides, I must admit she was a strong personality ... she earned the devotion of her friends and the respect of her opponents,' said the conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Papandreou was a founding member of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement in 1974. She was unrelated to the party founder, Andreas Papandreou, but they had a brief affair in the mid-1970s, after which she left for the U.K. to complete her graduate studies. She served in various ministerial positions in the Costas Simitis governments from 1996 to 2004, including minister of economic development, minister of interior, and minister for the environment, physical planning and public works. Papandreou broke barriers as Greece’s first female European Commissioner from 1989 to 1992, overseeing employment, industrial relations and social affairs in the second commission led by Jacques Delors and was admired for her strong advocacy of democratic rights. A champion for women’s representation, Papandreou led efforts to increase female participation in Greek politics. She successfully pushed for legislation requiring 33% female representation on candidate lists, starting with municipal elections in 2002 — building a foundation for greater gender balance in Greek politics. Throughout her career, she advocated for workers’ rights, educational opportunities and support for mothers and individuals with special needs. Papandreou won election to Parliament in six consecutive elections, from 1993 to 2009. For her first election, in a year when the Panhellenic Socialist Movement returned to power, she had prepared for a candidacy in the central Athens multi-seat constituency, but was shifted to the much larger Athens B constituency, in the capital’s suburbs, which, at that time, had 32 seats. The result was that she received a still-standing record 256,831 preference votes, many from female PASOK supporters who intended their vote as a rebuke to the party leadership. In late 1994, she and three other lawmakers, including Simitis, formed what was called 'the Group of Four' aiming to push the ailing party founder, Andreas Papandreou, into retirement. The group met several times at her home to coordinate their strategy. Andreas Papandreou finally bowed out in 1996 after his health took a significant downturn and was succeeded as prime minister and party leader by Simitis. Born on Dec. 9, 1944, Papandreou studied economics in Athens before earning a Ph.D. from the University of Reading in the U.K., where she started her career as an academic before shifting to politics as Greece emerged from a seven-year military dictatorship.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-vasso-papandreou-politics-minister-women-3e0283811d247d4fcb3f687b1a48061d	2024-10-19T12:35:16-07:00	
Singer Zayn postpones US tour after the death of his former bandmate Liam Payne	English singer Zayn Malik on Saturday postponed a planned tour to the U.S. following the death of his former One Direction bandmate Liam Payne. Zayn, as the singer often goes by, wrote on X that he’d made the decision 'Given the heartbreaking loss experienced this week.' He said the dates for the U.S. leg of his 'Stairway to the Sky' tour would be rescheduled for January and he'd post the new dates within the coming days. Zayn had gigs scheduled next week in San Francisco and Las Vegas, and the following week in Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and New York. 'Your tickets will remain valid for the new dates,' Zayn wrote. 'Love you all and thank you for your understanding.' Payne, 31, was found dead Wednesday after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. His death prompted an outpouring of shock and sadness from friends, collaborators and fellow musicians. Payne's sister Ruth Gibbins was the latest to share her thoughts in an Instagram tribute. 'I don't believe this is happening. Many times have I poured my heart out publicly with pride about Liam but never much about life as his sister,' she wrote. She said her brother was 'born with music in his veins' and that what she loved most about him was his ability to make her laugh. 'I don't feel this world was good enough or kind enough to you,' she wrote. One Direction was the internet's first boy band with a level of fame comparable to Beatlemania. Band members in their teens had to cope with their sudden fame and then navigate a breakup while trying to build solo careers. The exact circumstances of Payne's death remain unclear although Argentine authorities said there were suspicious elements and drugs were possibly involved. The results of toxicology tests are expected in the coming weeks. Payne had acknowledged struggling with alcoholism, saying in a YouTube video posted in July 2023 that he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment.	https://apnews.com/article/liam-payne-death-zayn-postpones-tour-a4d63e3c777f80c99a4a77c30ba19bc8	2024-10-19T11:09:11-07:00	
A small blast in Myanmar's second-biggest city damages Chinese Consulate	BANGKOK (AP) — The Chinese Consulate in Myanmar’s second-largest city has been slightly damaged by an explosive device, but there were no casualties, the military, independent media and a city resident said Saturday. No public claims of responsibility were made for the attack on Friday in Mandalay. China is a major ally of Myanmar’s military, which came to power after ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 but is now fighting fiercely against resistance forces challenging its rule. The military said in a statement sent to journalists on Saturday evening that roof tiles on the two-story Chinese Consulate were damaged by a explosion Friday afternoon. The security forces are investigating in order to arrest the 'terrorists' behind the blast, it said. The army is engaged in nationwide fighting against pro-democracy guerrillas and ethnic minority militias. It was forced onto the defensive late last year when ethnic armed organizations dealt it major defeats in the country’s northeast, seizing important territory along the border with China. Those gains, made by armed ethnic groups who separately maintained their own good relations with China, have weakened the army’s position all over the country, causing Beijing concern about the military government’s stability. China has reportedly sought to have some of the more powerful ethnic minority groups with which it maintains good ties to discourage the groups that seized territory in the northeast from continuing their offensive, which they launched in October last year. China was widely believed to have initially given its tacit approval to that offensive, which was seen as a way of curbing rampant criminality, particularly large-scale online scamming carried out in enclaves, which also involved human trafficking. The criminal enterprises were largely run by ethnic Chinese, embarrassing Beijing. China, along with Russia, is a major arms supplier to Myanmar’s military. It also is Myanmar’s biggest trading partner and has invested billions of dollars in Myanmar’s mines, oil and gas pipelines and other infrastructure. The military government is shunned and sanctioned by many Western nations for its 2021 takeover and for major human rights violations. Myanmar's independent media have reported that Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the ruling military council, would travel to China in the coming weeks for the first time since taking power Independent online media including The Irrawaddy and Khit Thit, on Saturday also reported the attack with an explosive device on the Chinese Consulate in Mandalay’s Chanmyathazi township. A Chanmyathazi resident living near the consulate told The Associated Press that the already strict security around the site has since been tightened, with nearby roads closed after the explosion. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared being arrested by the military. The shadow National Unity Government, the main group coordinating opposition to military rule, condemned the attack on the consulate in a statement, saying that it will persistently oppose any action that may cause racial and religious conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/china-consulate-attack-myanmar-bombing-mandalay-c5be224fc967cab8fdcf065a14c260b8	2024-10-19T11:00:05-07:00	
Ukraine’s ‘victory plan’ receives mixed reactions from Western allies	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s plan to end Ukraine’s nearly three-year war with Russia has received mixed reactions from Western allies so far. The 'victory plan' that Zelenskyy outlined at home and abroad includes a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western long-range missiles to strike military targets in Russia — two steps Kyiv's allies have been reluctant to support before. U.S. backing is crucial if Zelenskyy is to get support from other allies for proposals he believes are necessary to strengthen Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and ahead of any peace negotiations. But analysts say the Biden administration is unlikely to make a decision before the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5, as it may not appeal to voters. 'They seem to be just doing very little now and waiting for the election,' said Phillips O'Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. 'So much of the strategy will live or die in Washington.' Analysts said the plan is a step in the right direction for Ukraine's military efforts. They also described it as ambitious, given allies’ fears of escalation with nuclear-armed Russia. Ukraine has previously secured Western support for requests once deemed unrealistic, such as Patriot air defense systems and F-16 jets. Presenting the plan now puts on the radar for the next U.S. administration, analysts said, though it's unknown how the next president will receive it. After returning from making his case to the European Council, Zelenskyy said he expects the White House to provide feedback. 'They will be here soon with some form of response,' he said. Will the plan bring victory to Ukraine? Zelenskyy laid out the five-point plan as Ukraine’s troops struggle to hold back Russian slow but steady advances in eastern Ukraine. The plan includes three 'secret annexes' that were presented only to some leaders. It also addresses partners’ concerns about Ukraine’s strategy after the failed summer 2023 counteroffensive. Zelenskyy described the main goal as 'to strengthen us and force Russia to come to the negotiating table with all partners.' The plan won’t immediately alter the battlefield situation, but it will help Ukraine wear down Russia and give more means to keep going in the attrition war. 'I think people were potentially expecting some sort of more operational plan on winning the war,' said Justin Crump, a former British tank commander who heads Sibylline, a strategic advisory firm. 'That’s a naive opinion to have expected a plan to have provided operational details that would obviously be of use to the enemy.' Some Ukrainian analysts blame the name of the plan, adding that it was likely chosen for marketing purposes. Ukrainian analyst Yurii Bohdan said the goal is get resources. 'To win such war (of attrition), Ukraine needs to increase its resilience and exhaust its opponent,' said Hlib Voloskyi, an analyst from a Ukrainian think tank, Come Back Alive Centre of Initiatives. 'The side that falls last wins.' What was the allies’ response? U.S. reaction was muted and noncommittal, though it did issue a new $425 million package of security assistance for Ukraine the day that Zelenskyy presented the plan to lawmakers. 'It’s not my position to publicly evaluate his plan,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. 'We have been supporting him by providing security assistance in a major way for 2 1/2 years. We are going to continue to do that.' In Europe, reactions ranged from categorical opposition to strong support. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot stated in Kyiv on Saturday that he will work with Ukrainian officials to rally other nations to get behind the proposal. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stood by his refusal to supply Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Kyiv. 'Our position is clear: We are supporting Ukraine as strongly as possible,' he said. 'At the same time, we are taking care that NATO does not become a party to the war so that this war doesn’t culminate in an even bigger catastrophe.' Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, widely seen as having the warmest relations of any EU leader with Russian President Vladimir Putin, called Zelenskyy’s plan 'more than frightening' in a Facebook post. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov mocked Zelenskyy’s plan as 'ephemeral,' and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called it 'a set of incoherent slogans.' What's at stake for Ukraine? Without an invitation to join NATO, Ukraine won’t have an 'assurance that its geopolitical future will not be a bargaining chip with Russia,' said Ukrainian analyst Hlib Voloskyi. Ukrainian officials say there are no other guarantees for Ukraine besides NATO to protect against Russia's aggression after the war. Zelensky made ambiguous comments suggesting that nuclear weapons are the only other security alternative. Some thought he was talking about self-made nuclear weapons, sparking strong reaction among Ukrainians, many of whom were pessimistic about the prospects for an invitation to NATO. Zelensky later clarified that he was highlighting the dire situation for Ukraine by referencing the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine relinquished its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees from major nuclear powers, including the U.K., the U.S., and Russia. Without Western support, Ukraine will struggle to endure a protracted war with Russia, backed by North Korea, Iran, and China. If Ukraine falls, it will be forced to negotiate on Russia’s terms. 'Getting help from outside is a key part of winning the war,' O’Brien said. ___ Associated Press reporters Danica Kirka in London, Geir Moulson in Berlin, Tara Copp and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/victory-plan-ukraine-russia-war-zelenskyy-1a66e6b1655fcaa421526ad174e618bd	2024-10-19T10:38:29-07:00	
Iraq moves to revoke Saudi broadcaster's license after report angered militia supporters	BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq’s commission governing media announced Saturday that it would take steps to revoke the license of a Saudi television station to operate in the country. That came hours after dozens of supporters of Iraqi militias stormed and looted the office of the broadcaster, MBC, in Baghdad in protest over a report that described a number of Iranian-linked militant figures — including a prominent Iraqi militia leader — as 'terrorists.' The report on 'terrorists' who had been killed this century mentioned former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden alongside a roster of Iran-backed figures. They included Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a veteran Iraqi militant who was the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of mostly Shiite paramilitaries and founder of the Kataeb Hezbollah, or Hezbollah Brigades. Iraq’s Media and Communications Commission said in a statement that MBC had violated the country’s broadcasting regulations through 'attacks on the martyrs, leaders of victory and heroic resistance leaders who are fighting the battle of honor against the usurping Zionist entity,' referring to Israel, and that it would order its executive office to cancel the station’s work license. The station had already closed its doors following the attack. Saudi Arabia's regulatory authority for media subsequently announced that it had referred 'officials of a TV channel to investigation due to a news report that violates the Kingdom’s media regulations and policy.' It didn't name MBC. The controversy came against the backdrop of heightened regional tensions surrounding the wars between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have played a minor role in the conflict, launching drone attacks on bases housing U.S. troops in the country in retaliation for Washington’s support of Israel’s involvement in the wars and, increasingly in recent months, firing at targets within Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/iraq-saudi-arabia-tv-station-mbc-license-b9967708309d6a5342661448840f59e2	2024-10-19T10:02:07-07:00	
Demonstrators in France praise Gisèle Pélicot's courage in harrowing drug and rape trial	PARIS (AP) — Women and men demonstrated together Saturday in Paris and other French cities in support of Gisèle Pélicot and against sexual violence highlighted by the harrowing trial of her ex-husband and dozens of other men being prosecuted for rapes while she was drugged and unconscious. The demonstrations outside Paris' criminal court, in the southeastern city of Lyon and elsewhere underscored how Pélicot's courage in speaking out about her ordeal is inspiring people in France and beyond, even as they've been horrified by the scale and brutality of the abuse she suffered over the course of a decade. Since the Sept. 2 beginning of the extraordinary trial, during which Pélicot has faced 51 of her alleged rapists, she has been praised for her composure and decision to keep the hearings public — after the court initially suggested that they be held behind closed doors. 'She has decided to make this an emblematic trial,' said Elsa Labouret, one of the Paris demonstrators and a spokesperson for the women’s group 'Osez le féminisme!' (Dare to be feminist!) 'Victims don’t have to do what she did. They have a right to have their anonymity protected. It’s not necessarily a duty of any victim. But what she decided to do is very, very important because now we cannot ignore the violence that some men can resort to,' she said. Demonstrators denounced what they said is laxity from the French justice system toward sexual violence and fears of being raped and assaulted that they said stalk women day-in, day-out. Placards they held up read: 'Shame must change sides,' 'Stop the denial,' 'Not your punching ball' and 'We are all Gisele. Are you all Dominique???' Dominique Pélicot admitted during the trial that for nearly a decade, he repeatedly drugged his unwitting wife and invited dozens of men to rape her while she lay unconscious in their bed. He told the court that he also raped Gisèle and that the 50 other men also standing trial understood exactly what they were doing. She has divorced him since his arrest. The trial is expected to run until December. The defendants range in age from 26 to 74. Many of them deny having raped Gisèle Pélicot, saying her then-husband manipulated them or that they believed she was consenting. 'You can never know who is a rapist or who is a monster. Like, it could be your neighbor, it could be anyone,' said Paris demonstrator Khalil Ndiaye, a student. 'It’s really disgusting somehow to think that it could be people that you know, people that you hang out with every day and, like, they could do things like that.' He said he regards Gisèle Pélicot as an icon. 'Because in her pain, she decided not to give up and not to just lie down,' he said. 'She decided to fight. And we’re all here today because she’s fighting and she’s inspiring us to fight, too.'	https://apnews.com/article/france-rape-trial-gisele-pelicot-abuse-3c43489858f17f1577017f5a94f695ff	2024-10-19T09:43:22-07:00	
Hurricane Oscar makes landfall in the Bahamas and heads toward Cuba	MIAMI (AP) — Hurricane Oscar made landfall early Sunday in the southeastern Bahamas and was heading toward Cuba, an island recently beleaguered by a massive power outage. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm's center arrived on Great Inagua island. It is expected to produce a dangerous storm surge that could translate into significant coastal flooding there and in other areas of the southeastern Bahamas. Two to four inches of rainfall are expected, with isolated areas seeing up to six inches. Forecasters said five to 10 inches of rain are expected across eastern Cuba through Tuesday, with some isolated locations getting up to 15 inches. Oscar formed Saturday off the coast of the Bahamas and brushed past the Turks and Caicos islands to the south. The National Hurricane Center earlier characterized the storm as 'tiny,' but hurricane warnings were in place Sunday for southeastern Bahamas and portions of Cuba. The storm’s maximum sustained winds were clocked at 80 mph (130 kph) with higher gusts. Its center was located about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east-northeast of Guantanamo, Cuba. The storm was heading west at 12 mph (19 kph) and was expected to reach Guantanamo or Holguin, Cuba, on Sunday afternoon at hurricane strength. The hurricane's approach comes as Cuba tries to recover from its worst blackout in at least two years, which left millions without power for two days last week. Some electrical service was restored Saturday. Philippe Papin of the National Hurricane Center said it was somewhat unexpected that Oscar became a hurricane Saturday. 'Unfortunately the system kind of snuck up a little bit on us,' Papin said. Hours earlier Tropical Storm Nadine formed off Mexico’s southern Caribbean coast. It degenerated into a tropical depression as it moved over land.	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-tropical-weather-oscar-nadine-02649631f0ca88ab3b0f643b51541da9	2024-10-19T09:14:09-07:00	
Main zoo in North Macedonian capital shut down after avian flu case detected	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — The main zoo in North Macedonia’s capital Skopje was closed Saturday after authorities confirmed the presence of a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu. According to a press statement, the flu was detected in a goose that died in a pond. 'Laboratory results confirmed a case of the presence of a pathogenic strain of the Avian influenza H5N1 virus,' the statement said. Authorities immediately put down dozens of ducks, geese, chickens and one jackdaw, which inhabited the same pond. The zoo will be closed for at least three weeks. During that period, authorities will disinfect the place, inspect other animals and apply other biosecurity measures aimed to prevent the spread of the disease. The last cases of bird flu in North Macedonia, all in wild birds, were detected in 2022. The virus can cause heavy losses in the poultry industry and lead to restrictions on the import and export of live birds and poultry products. Highly pathogenic strains of avian flu can also be transmitted to humans. Founded in 1926, Skopje’s zoo is one of the most visited places in the capital, with hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, not only from the country but also from across the Western Balkans. In the past, the zoo had been the target of much criticism over the animals’ living conditions. Starting in 2008, authorities poured large sums of money into improvements, working with the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) to bring the zoo up to modern standards.	https://apnews.com/article/avian-flu-zoo-shutdown-goose-biosecurity-522ee65ebb5664ecf5a3ba3150693698	2024-10-19T08:59:04-07:00	
Video published by Ukraine purports to show North Korean soldiers in Russia	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A video purporting to show dozens of North Korean recruits lining up to collect Russian military fatigues and gear aims to intimidate Ukrainian forces and marks a new chapter in the 2 1/2-year war with the introduction of another country into the battlefield, Ukrainian officials said. The video, which was obtained by Ukraine’s Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security, which operates under the Culture and Information Ministry, is said to show North Korean soldiers standing in line to pick up bags, clothes and other apparel from Russian servicemen. The Associated Press could not verify the video independently. 'We received this video from our own sources. We cannot provide additional verification from the sources who provided it to us due to security concerns,' said Ihor Solovey, head of the center. 'The video clearly shows North Korean citizens being given Russian uniforms under the direction of the Russian military,' he said. 'For Ukraine, this video is important because it is the first video evidence that shows North Korea participating in the war on the side of Russia. Now not only with weapons and shells but also with personnel.' The center claims the footage was shot by a Russian soldier in recent days. The location is unknown. It comes after the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said in local media reports that about 11,000 North Korean infantrymen were currently training in eastern Russia. He predicted they would be ready to join fighting by November. At least 2,600 would be sent to Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an incursion in August, he was quoted as saying. 'The emergence of any number of new soldiers is a problem because we will simply need new, additional weapons to destroy them all,' Solovey told AP. 'The dissemination of this video is important as a signal to the world community that with two countries officially at war against Ukraine, we will need more support to repel this aggression.' The presence of North Korean soldiers in Ukraine, if true, would be another proof of intensified military ties between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Last summer, they signed a strategic partnership treaty that commits both countries to provide military assistance. North Korean weapons have already been used in the Ukraine war.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-video-d84e70171378f30b5dabd0cbe27a5cec	2024-10-19T06:51:13-07:00	
Cuba gets some electricity back after major power outage left millions in the dark	HAVANA (AP) — Cuba's government on Saturday said that some electricity was restored on the island after one of the country's major power plants failed and left millions without electricity for two days. Energy Minister Vicente de la O Levy said the country had 500 megawatts in its electrical grid early Saturday, as compared to 3 gigawatts that are normally generated. He posted on X that 'several substations in the west now have electricity.' O Levy also said two thermoelectric power plants are back and two more will resume their operations 'in the next few hours.' About half of Cuba was plunged into darkness on Thursday evening, followed by the entire island on Friday morning after one of the plants failed. Havana's electricity company said in a statement earlier on Saturday that a part of its western system was disconnected 'after the exit of one of the plants that was delivering service.' That issue has left some parts of the city in the dark once again. The streets of Cuba's capital, where 2 million people live, were quiet on Saturday, with few cars driving by after a night that was lit by candles and lamps. The impact of the blackout goes beyond lighting, and services like water supply also depend on electricity to run pumps. This is considered to be Cuba's worst blackout in two years, after a category 3 hurricane damaged power installations and it took days for the government to fix them. This year the electricity service worsened, with several homes in the dark for hours every day. In addition to the Antonio Guiteras plant, whose failure on Friday affected the entire national system, Cuba has several others and it wasn’t immediately clear whether or not they remained functional. There is no official estimate for when the blackout will end. Even in a country that is used to outages as part of a deepening economic crisis, Friday’s supply collapse was massive. The Cuban government has announced emergency measures to slash electricity demand, including suspending classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling nonessential services. Officials said that 1.64 gigawatts went offline during peak hours, about half the total demand at the time. Local authorities said the outage, which started in a smaller scale on Thursday, stemmed from increased demand from small and medium-sized companies and residences’ air conditioners. Later, the blackout got worse due to breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities. Changes to electricity rates for small- and medium-sized companies, which have proliferated since they were first authorized by the communist government in 2021, are also being considered. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-power-outage-blackout-minister-8c1447bb14f4105f18317986fa949dc8	2024-10-19T05:55:55-07:00

Guatemalan judge grants investigative journalist Zamora house arrest and his family celebrates	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — The family of a Guatemalan journalist on Saturday celebrated his transfer to house arrest following his jailing for more than two years amid his daily newspaper's anti-corruption investigations. José Rubén Zamora founded El Periódico, which specialized in anti-corruption reporting and closed a year ago. 'At last, he can defend himself as he always should have, free from a baseless and abusive process,' his son José Carlos Zamora said in a statement. 'We are delighted by this long-awaited moment and deeply grateful for the support and solidarity that sustained us. There is still a long road ahead, but this marks a victory for my father, our family, and freedom of the press in Guatemala.' Judge Erick García Alvarado ruled that Zamora should be released because his preventive arrest in one of the cases had already expired. Zamora, 68, had been imprisoned since July 2022, when he was charged with money laundering, amounting to around $38,000, and in June 2023 he was sentenced to six years in prison. The sentence was overturned by an appeals court because of errors in the process, but he's waiting to see if he will be granted a retrial. International organizations had been calling for Friday's hearing to take place so the journalist could be freed from imprisonment. Many of them said that Zamora had been jailed because of his investigations into those in power. Zamora has said previously that he was exposed to psychological torture during his imprisonment, spending long hours without daylight, isolation and being awakened several times a night by guards. The Guatemalan journalist told reporters after his release that he's both happy and calm after the decision, but that he would go to a hospital to regain his health. 'As for the prosecutor (Rafael Curruchiche, who heads the prosecutor’s office that accuses him), the attorney general would do well to open a scholarship fund to send them to study law again,' Zamora said. Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo, who took office earlier this year, celebrated the journalist's release from prison. 'Zamora returns home. Justice is beginning to arrive, the dark cycle is going to end,' Arévalo posted on X. Eight journalists and columnists from El Periódico, which was founded in 1996, have left the country since Guatemala's prosecutor's office started investigating them. Zamora was initially convicted and sentenced to six years in jail over the first charges against him and was imprisoned in July 2022. The decision was later overruled, but he didn't leave jail because of another case against him. Curruchiche told reporters that he hopes Zamora will face justice now that he is free.	https://apnews.com/article/guatemala-investigative-journalist-zamora-released-house-arrest-c3eb82dbd44c86e6c10b02b68b933a1d	2024-10-19T04:42:23-07:00	
Israeli footage showing the last minutes of Hamas leader's life sets off a debate over his legacy	The world’s final glimpse of Hamas’ leader was rough and raw, showing him wounded and cornered as he sat in a bombed-out Palestinian home and faced down the Israeli drone filming him, hurling a stick at it. For Israel, the scene was one of victory, showing Yahya Sinwar, the architect of Oct.7, broken and defeated. But many in the Arab and Muslim world — whether supporters of Hamas or not — saw something different in the grainy footage: a defiant martyr who died fighting to the end. Clips from the released drone footage went viral on social media, accompanied by quotes from Sinwar's speeches in which he declared he would rather die on the battlefield. An oil painting of a masked Sinwar sitting proudly on an armchair was widely shared, apparently inspired by the last image of him alive. 'By broadcasting the last minutes of the life of Yahya Sinwar, the occupation made his life longer than the lives of his killers,' Osama Gaweesh, an Egyptian media personality and journalist, wrote on social media. In Gaza, reactions to Sinwar’s death were mixed. Some mourned his killing, while others expressed relief and hope that it could bring an end to the devastating war triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that he is said to have directed. Across the Arab and Muslim world, and away from the devastation in Gaza, opinions varied. One thing, though, was clear. The footage was hailed by supporters and even some critics as evidence of a man killed in confrontation who at least was not hidden in a tunnel surrounded by hostages as Israel has said he was for much of the last year. Three days after he was killed, Israel’s military dropped leaflets in south Gaza, showing another image of Sinwar lying dead on a chair, with his finger cut and blood running down his forehead. 'Sinwar destroyed your lives. He hid in a dark hole and was liquidated while escaping fearfully,' the leaflet said. 'I don’t think there is a Palestinian leader of the first rank who died in a confrontation (like Sinwar), according to what the leaked Israeli version shows,' said Sadeq Abu Amer, head of the Palestinian Dialogue Group, an Istanbul-based think tank. Sinwar's demise was different Unlike Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in his hotel room in Iran, or the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group Hassan Nasrallah, bombed in an underground bunker by dozens of massive munitions, Sinwar was killed while apparently fighting Israeli forces, more than a year after the war began. Iran, the Shiite powerhouse and a main backer of Hamas, went further. It contrasted Sinwar’s death with that of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Tehran’s archenemy. In a statement by Iran’s U.N. Mission, it said Saddam appeared disheveled out of an underground hole, dragged by U.S. forces while 'he begged them not to kill him despite being armed.' Sinwar, on the other hand, was killed in the open while 'facing the enemy,' Iran said. In a strongly worded statement, the Cairo-based Al-Azhar, the highest seat of Sunni Muslim learning in the world, blasted Israel’s portrayal of Sinwar as a terrorist. Without naming Sinwar, the statement said the 'martyrs of the resistance' died defending their land and their cause. In Israel, the army’s Arabic-speaking spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, described Sinwar as 'defeated, outcast, and persecuted.' Many celebrated the news of the killing of the architect of the Oct. 7 attack. Video posted online showed a lifeguard on a Tel Aviv beach announcing the news to applause, while Israeli media showed soldiers handing out sweets. Residents of Sderot, a town that was attacked by Hamas militants, were filmed dancing on the streets, some wrapped in Israeli flags. On Telegram, some shared pictures of a dead Sinwar, likening him to a rat. But there were also protests from families of hostages and their supporters who want Israeli leaders to use the moment to bring the hostages home. Some are energized, not demoralized Susan Abulhawa, one of the most widely read Palestinian authors, said the images released by Israel were a source of pride. Israel 'thought that publishing footage of Sinwar’s last moments would demoralize us, make us feel defeat,' she wrote on X. 'In reality, the footage immortalizes Sinwar and galvanizes all of us to have courage and resolve until the last moment.' In the Palestinian territories and Lebanon, some remembered with him with respect, while others expressed anger. 'He died as a fighter, as a martyr,' said Somaia Mohtasib, a Palestinian displaced from Gaza City. For Saleh Shonnar, a resident of north Gaza now displaced to the center, tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed. 'Hundreds, tens of senior leaders were martyred and replaced with new leaders.' In Khan Younis, Sinwar’s birthplace, mourners in a bombed-out mosque recited the funeral prayer for a Muslim when the body is missing. Israel has kept Sinwar's body. Dozens of men and children took part in the prayers. And in Wadi al-Zayne, a town in Lebanon’s Chouf region with a significant Palestinian population, Bilal Farhat said Sinwar’s death made him a symbol of heroic resistance. 'He died fighting on the front line. It gives him some sort of mystical hero aura,' Farhat said. Some Palestinians took to X to criticize Sinwar and dismiss his death in comparison to their own suffering. One speaker on a recorded discussion said there is no way of telling how he died. Another blamed him for 18 years of suffering, calling him a 'crazy man' who started a war he couldn’t win. 'If he is dear, we had many more dear ones killed,' one yelled. In the long run, the think tank’s Abu Amer said, the effect of the support and empathy for Sinwar after his death is unlikely to change the Arab public’s view of Oct. 7 and what followed. 'Those who supported Oct. 7 will continue to, and those who opposed Oct. 7 — and they are many — will keep their opinions, even if they show sympathy or admiration for him. Most Palestinians are now focused on ending the war,' he said. ___ Khaled reported from Cairo.

Romania scrambles fighter jets second time this week over breach of airspace	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania raised fighter jets early on Saturday for the second time this week after an unidentified object breached its airspace by the Black Sea, the Ministry of Defense said. The small object was detected over the Black Sea moving toward Romania, a European Union and NATO member, at around 2:30 a.m, the ministry said in a statement. Romania shares a 650-kilometer (400-mile) border with Ukraine and has previously complained over Russian drones entering its airspace as Moscow attacks Ukrainian targets along the Black Sea and Danube River. Fragments of Russian drones have also been repeatedly found on Romanian territory near the Ukrainian border. Two F-18 jets of the Spanish Air Force and two F-16s of the Romanian Air Force were dispatched but did not spot the target, which disappeared from the radar, the ministry said. Two Spanish F-18s and two Romanian F-16s also were dispatched on Thursday in a similar incident.	https://apnews.com/article/romania-fighter-jets-russia-ukraine-17a5220542937a1deb6971e110c2ad21	2024-10-19T03:31:36-07:00	
France vows support for Ukraine's plan to end Russian invasion	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot pledged his support for Ukraine’s plan for ending the 2 1/2-year war with Russia, telling reporters in Kyiv on Saturday that he will work with Ukrainian officials to secure other nations’ backing for the proposal. Unveiled by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this week, Kyiv’s so-called 'victory plan' hopes to compel Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine through negotiations. The proposal is being considered by Ukraine’s Western partners, whose help is vital for Kyiv to resist its bigger neighbor. A key element would be a formal invitation into NATO, which Western backers have been reluctant to consider until after the war ends. 'A Russian victory would be a consecration for the law of the strongest and would push the international order toward chaos,' Barrot said at a joint press conference with his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha. 'That is why our exchanges should allow us to make progress on President Zelenskyy’s victory plan and rally the greatest number possible of countries around it.' Since the 2022 invasion, France has been one of Ukraine’s staunchest military, diplomatic and economic supporters in Europe. It is currently training and equipping what will become a full new brigade of Ukrainian soldiers for front-line deployment. French President Emmanuel Macron has also previously pushed for a policy shift from Ukraine’s Western allies that could change the complexion of the war — allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by Western partners, which include missiles from France. Long-range strikes are a key part of Zelenskyy’s five-point plan but have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. Barrot also announced that France would deliver the first batch of Mirage 2000 combat jets to Ukraine in the first three months of 2025, with Ukrainian pilots and mechanics also trained to fly and maintain them. 'By resisting against the invader with exceptional courage, you are not only fighting for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, but you are also holding a front line that separates Europe from Vladimir Putin’s Russia, that separates freedom from oppression,' the French minister said in Kyiv. Russia and Ukraine exchange POWs Barrot’s visit coincided with a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine late Friday night that included 190 POWs traded by the two sides under a deal negotiated by the United Arab Emirates. Among the 95 Ukrainians were 34 Azov fighters who defended Mariupol and the Azovstal steelworks, the fortress-like plant in the now-occupied city of Mariupol where their last-ditch stand became a symbol of resistance against Moscow’s invasion. 'Ninety-five of our people are home again. These are the warriors who defended Mariupol and ‘Azovstal,’ as well as the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Kherson regions,' Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X. The head of the Azov Brigade, Denys Prokopenko, said on Facebook that 34 Azov fighters had been returned, but that another 900 remained in Russian captivity. A well-known Ukrainian human rights activist and service member, Maksym Butkevych, was also among the 95 exchanged. His release was announced by the ZMINA Human Rights Center, the organization that he co-founded. The swap follows the repatriation of 501 dead soldiers to Ukraine Friday in what appeared to be the biggest repatriation of war dead since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Most of the soldiers were killed in action in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine, mostly around the city of Avdiivka that Russian forces captured in February after a long and grueling battle, Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a statement. Russia also received the bodies of 89 of its soldiers, Russian lawmaker Shamsayil Saraliyev told reporters. Elsewhere, the Russian Ministry of Defense said that it shot down 16 Ukrainian drones over Russia’s Bryansk, Rostov, and Belgorod regions in the early hours of Saturday morning. Local social media channels shared images that appeared to show a blaze at a factory in the Bryansk region specializing in microelectronics. Russian authorities did not confirm the strike. ___ Associated Press writers John Leicester in Le Pecq, France, and Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-france-pows-22dbb9037a98c3185ca3a0e3470e074a	2024-10-19T01:28:12-07:00	
Train hits and kills 2 wild elephants in Sri Lanka as 2 of its fuel-carrying tankers derail	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — A train carrying thousands of gallons of fuel hit a herd of wild elephants in northeast Sri Lanka, killing two of the giant mammals and injuring one other as two of its tankers got derailed, authorities said. The collision happened in the town of Minneriya — about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the capital, Colombo — renowned for its nature park and wildlife. The train driver told The Associated Press that the herd of nearly 20 elephants suddenly tried to cross over the railway track Friday. 'There was about 10 meters (32 feet) between us. So, we couldn’t do anything. We pressed the breaks to their maximum capacity, but there was nothing much we could do. At least four elephants were knocked down.' N.W. Jayalath said. The train had eight tankers — five carrying diesel and another three petrol, each with a capacity of 50,000 liters (about 132,000 gallons), Jayalath said. Two of the petrol tankers got derailed, causing a significant leakage and severely damaging railway tracks and forcing authorities to suspend the train services on that line, he added. The train compartment harboring the conductor also got derailed. The train also had two other railway personnel besides the driver. None of the four were injured. 'This is the first time I saw this kind of incident,' V.J. Jackson, a Minneriya resident, said. 'We came here after hearing the honking of the train and the screaming of the elephants. We saw elephants lying everywhere and the train had derailed.' Hasini Sarathchandra, the publicity officer of the wildlife department said the two elephants were killed on site while the injured one was treated and released back to its herd. Minneriya National Park draws thousands of tourists each year hoping to see elephants in their wild habitats. It is part of the 'elephant corridor that connects Kaudulla and Wasgamuwa National parks' which allows for elephant sightings year-round. Though elephants are revered in the Indian Ocean island nation, they are endangered with their numbers dwindling from about 14,000 in the 19th century to 6,000 in 2011, according to the country’s first elephant census. Elephant-train collisions have gone up in recent years in Sri Lanka, with wild elephants attempting to cross over railway tracks in search of food and water. They are increasingly vulnerable because of the loss and degradation of their natural habitat and many venture closer to human settlements in search of food. Some are killed by poachers or farmers angry over damage to their crops. According to the government statistics, seven elephants have died this year after being knocked down by trains while 24 died in 2023.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-wild-elephants-train-collision-minneriya-48c7bbb66002fcee122956061f8edcfc	2024-10-19T00:41:41-07:00	
First migrants sent to Albania for processing are returned to Italy	SHENGJIN, Albania (AP) — An Italian navy ship on Saturday took back to Italy the first 12 migrants from newly opened asylum processing centers in Albania following a court decision in Rome. The court ruling on Friday represents an early stumbling block to a five-year deal between Italy and Albania for Tirana to host 3,000 migrants per month picked up by the Italian coast guard. They will be vetted for possible asylum in Italy or to be sent back to their countries. Italian Premier Minister Giorgia Meloni has hailed the deal as a new 'model' to handle illegal migration. The court in Rome rejected the detention of 12 of the migrants, arguing they cannot be sent back to their countries or origin -- Bangladesh and Egypt -- because the court did not deem them to be safe enough. The Italian navy ship took the 12 from the port of Shengjin, 66 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the capital Tirana. After arriving there this week, the four other migrants had already been rejected by center staff, two as vulnerable after undergoing health checks and two for being minors. Each migrant’s detention must be reviewed by special migration courts in Italy under Italian law. Meloni slammed the judges following the ruling, and said that deeming countries such as Bangladesh and Egypt unsafe means that virtually all migrants would be barred from the Albania program, making it unworkable. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the government would appeal the ruling. Speaking to reporters during a trip to Lebanon, Meloni said she would convene a Cabinet meeting Monday to discuss the issue. 'We’ll meet to approve some norms that will allow us to overcome this obstacle,' Meloni said. 'I believe it’s up to the government and not magistrates to establish which countries can be considered safe.' Although Bangladesh and Egypt are not at war or facing any large refugee crises, the judges in Rome said their decision was based on recent international rulings that consider discrimination or persecution in even a part of a country as grounds for such a determination. Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania. The controversial agreement to outsource the housing of asylum-seekers to a non-EU member country has been hailed by some countries that, like Italy, are experiencing a high level of migrant arrivals. The agreement was endorsed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of 'out-of-box thinking' in tackling the issue of migration into the European Union. Human rights organizations considered it as setting a dangerous precedent. ___ Semini reported from Tirana.

Strike launched toward Israeli prime minister's house	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s government said a drone was launched toward the the prime minister’s house Saturday, with no casualties. Sirens wailed Saturday morning in Israel, warning of incoming fire from Lebanon, with a drone launched toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in Caesarea, the Israeli government said. Neither he nor his wife were home and there were no casualties, said his spokesperson in a statement. The strikes into Israel come as its war with Lebanon’s Hezbollah — a Hamas ally backed by Iran — has intensified in recent weeks. Hezbollah said Friday that it planned to launch a new phase of fighting by sending more guided missiles and exploding drones into Israel. The militant group’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier in October. A standoff is also ensuing between Israel and Hamas, which it’s fighting in Gaza, with both signaling resistance to ending the war after the death of Hamas’ leader Yahya Sinwar this week. On Friday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Sinwar’s death was a painful loss but noted that Hamas carried on despite the killings of other Palestinian militant leaders before him. 'Hamas is alive and will stay alive,' Khamenei said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-10-18-2024-c49911f11a40b7d81b21bc8568ecfe11	2024-10-18T22:40:37-07:00	
EU candidate Moldova to hold two pivotal votes as officials denounce Russian 'hybrid attacks'	MAGDACESTI, Moldova (AP) — On a frigid evening in a village near Moldova’s capital, President Maia Sandu warned locals of Russian meddling as she seeks reelection and touted joining the European Union as the only way forward. Her message came days before key votes that could help to determine the country’s future. Sandu is seeking a second term in office in a presidential election Sunday in which she is opposed by several pro-Moscow candidates out of a total of 11. A 'yes' or 'no' referendum will also be held the same day on whether to enshrine the path toward joining the EU in the country's constitution. 'This decision will influence our lives not only for the next four years,' the pro-Western president told the crowd from an outdoor bandstand in Magdacesti, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the capital, Chisinau. 'This decision will influence our lives for decades to come.' A campaign flyer handed out by young supporters at the rally said that criminal groups paid 15 million euros ($16.2 million) last month to 130,000 individuals in a major vote-buying scheme 'to cause destabilization and chaos' in Moldova, a country of about 2.5 million. The purported scheme revealed on Oct. 3, which allegedly paid people through Russian banks, was linked to Ilan Shor, an exiled pro-Russia oligarch whose populist Russia-friendly Shor Party was declared unconstitutional last year and banned. It heightened concerns that Moscow was stepping up efforts to undermine the pivotal votes. Shor, who was convicted in absentia last year to 15 years in jail on fraud and money laundering in the case of $1 billion that went missing from Moldovan banks in 2014, denied allegations of illegally paying voters, saying 'the payments are legal' and cited a right to freedom of expression. Hours before Sandu’s appearance in Magdacesti on Thursday, Moldovan authorities said they foiled another plot in which more than 100 young Moldovans received training in Moscow by private military groups on how to create civil unrest, including using nonlethal weapons to create 'mass disorder' around the two votes. Some received 'more advanced training in guerrilla camps' in Serbia and Bosnia, authorities said, and four were detained for 30 days. A source close to law enforcement, who wasn't authorized to speak to the media about a sensitive national security matter, told The Associated Press that some of the young people implicated had criminal records or hailed from difficult families and were offered several thousand euros to attend. 'We expect Russian pressure to increase, not to decrease, and the closer we’ll be getting to the EU, the bigger the pressure will be from Russia,' said Stanislav Secrieru, the president’s national security adviser. 'We’re trying to find the right balance between freedoms and security.' He added that Moldovan law enforcement had strengthened in the face of 'intensive hybrid attacks' against Moldova, a former Soviet republic, since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Since then, Moldova has faced multiple crises including errant missiles landing on its territory, a severe energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced gas supplies, rampant inflation and recurring anti-government protests by pro-Russia parties. A pro-Western government has been in power since 2021, a year after Sandu won the presidency, and a parliamentary election will be held next year. Moldovan authorities have repeatedly said that Russia is conducting a vast 'hybrid war' against it — by funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, and meddling in local elections — to destabilize the country and try to derail its EU path. These concerns were echoed by the U.S., U.K., and Canada this summer in a joint statement, which alleged 'the Kremlin’s use of criminal groups' were trying to undermine Moldova’s democratic institutions. Russian actors, they said, were carrying out a plot to influence the outcomes of votes and 'intend to incite protests' should the outcomes prove unfavorable to Moscow. Russia has repeatedly denied that it's interfering in Moldova. In the bustling Stefan cel Mare park in central Chisinau, Ana Maria, a 30-year-old medical doctor, says the two upcoming votes will determine if Moldovans 'are all on the same page' regarding EU integration, but is also concerned about Russian influence. 'I think that most of us have some family member working in the EU, or who lives or studies there, more than in Russia,' she said. 'The Russian disinformation is rather worrying. It’s easier to maneuver people that are not well informed.' In recent weeks, large social media platforms such as Meta and Telegram announced they had removed fake accounts in Moldova that railed against the EU, Sandu, and expressed 'supportive commentary' about pro-Russia parties. The large majority of Moldovans speak Romanian as their first language, and the rest speak Russian. Relations between Chisinau and Moscow significantly soured after Moldova applied to join the 27-nation EU in the wake of the war next door, and was granted candidate status in June 2022, alongside Ukraine, and agreed in June to start membership negotiations. 'We believe that by 2030, the Republic of Moldova will be ready for accession and we will work day and night for this goal,' Sandu said in Magdacesti, 'but for that, we need the positive decision of our citizens.' The latest polls indicate that Sandu is leading the presidential race with more than 35% of the vote, while Alexandr Stoianoglo, a pro-Russian former prosecutor general, trails her at around 10%. However, if Sandu fails to win an outright majority in the first round she could face Stoianoglo in a run-off two weeks later. The EU referendum also shows a clear majority of more than 50% support the EU path but requires a one-third turnout to be valid. The polls also do not include Moldova's large diaspora, many of whom live and work in the EU. Several analysts and officials the AP spoke to in Chisinau expressed concerns that the number of voters registered nationally exceeds the latest population data, and that the discrepancy means that more votes are needed for the EU referendum to reach the threshold. Secrieru said Russian proxies could rally already established networks on the eve of the ballot urging them to boycott the EU vote. 'What they think is realistic is to depress participation in order to kill the referendum,' he said. The same source told the AP that tactics could be employed on Sunday to create chaos by disrupting voting infrastructure with tactics such as false bomb threats or cyberattacks. Iulian Groza, executive director of the Institute for European Policies and Reforms think tank, described the upcoming votes as a 'historic moment' in which turnout will be key. 'The choice is clear: either Moldova adheres and continues to advance toward the West, toward accession to the European Union, or is dragged by Russia proxies back into the hands of Russian influence,' he told the AP in his downtown Chisinau office. 'What will count very much is the ability of the citizens to mobilize … not to let others to choose their future.' Ivan Chesov, a 68-year-old retired construction engineer, said he believes that Moldova is 'closer to Europe' and that people should express their wishes by casting their ballots. 'I think there are chances for the referendum to pass,' he said, 'if people wake up and see the reality.' Back at the rally in Magdacesti as night drew in and the young and old mingled in the cold, Sandu told locals that the EU would help Moldova to develop and modernize and urged them to vote. 'We have no time to wait ... so many years have passed in which Moldova did not develop as it could have developed,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/moldova-election-eu-referendum-russia-639974a2d3acd8d647e787ede0fcbe24	2024-10-18T22:03:58-07:00	
Belgrade's landmark Hotel Yugoslavia faces likely demolition, with many opposed	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Belgrade’s iconic Hotel Yugoslavia, once a symbol of progress in the former socialist state of Yugoslavia that broke apart in the 1990s and a favorite gathering place for local residents as well as world leaders, now stands in eerie silence awaiting its likely demolition. The once-bustling landmark — a leading example of modernist architecture when it was built in the 1960s — has fallen into disrepair, its future clouded by debates over its historical significance and the push for advanced development. Its white facade, once polished and welcoming, is marred by crumbling concrete and graffiti. Inside, debris litters once-pristine red carpeted floors, while scattered pieces of broken furniture hint at the opulence that once filled its rooms and lobbies: Faded velvet armchairs, torn bed mattresses, sagging curtains and broken windows are all that remain of the luxury that once was. The wood-paneled presidential suite where top dignitaries would stay is now home to pigeons that fly in through the shattered glass. As the Serbian capital grapples with hectic growth and new high-rises that dot its skyline, the almost certain fate of the hotel has sparked controversy, with some seeing it as a relic worth preserving and others envisioning new possibilities rising from its ruins. In its heyday after it received its first guests in 1969, it was a five-star hotel boasting one of the biggest chandeliers in the world made of 40,000 Swarovski crystals and 5,000 bulbs. Its guest list included Queen Elizabeth II, United States Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, astronauts including Neil Armstrong, and Belgian and Dutch royals. The hotel, with a spectacular view of the Danube River in the capital's New Belgrade district, was damaged in NATO bombing in 1999 in an armed intervention over Serbia’s bloody crackdown on Kosovo Albanian separatists. Only parts of the hotel were fully renovated, and it kept receiving guests until a few months ago, when private investors announced plans to demolish the structure and build a new one in its place. Two 150-meter (500-foot) -tall towers containing a luxury hotel, offices and private apartments will be built, according to the new owners. Asked why the landmark hotel needs to be completely destroyed instead of incorporated into the new project, Zivorad Vasic, a spokesperson for the investors, said there were several reasons. 'One is during the bombing in 1999, quite a lot of parts of the hotel were destroyed. Second, the hospitality industry completely and tremendously changed. When you look at hotels now and how they looked before, they were completely different,' he said. Architect and tourist guide Matija Zlatanovic, who often takes tourists to the hotel to explain its rich history, said the plans for the new hotel are 'quite controversial,' especially because 'there are valid concerns about the size of the buildings that are going to be erected here.' 'It follows the trend of towerization of Belgrade and the erection of enormous high rises all over,' he said. 'And we yet have to see about the impact that they’re going to have on this neighborhood.' Neighbors who face living in the future shadows of the planned skyscrapers are not happy. Some are holding weekly protests against the new project, saying they will stop the demolition with their bodies if necessary. Svetlana Gojun, one of the protesters, said Hotel Yugoslavia 'represents a huge part of our history.' 'Half the world came to this hotel, from actors, musicians, politicians, writers,' she said. 'Everyone is tied to this hotel. The whole world knows about that hotel. And now we will allow something like that to disappear?'	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-hotel-yugoslavia-demolition-belgrade-3070e34868d217d447e473da9ef5d8e7	2024-10-18T21:05:39-07:00	
Freedom of expression threatened more seriously in Gaza than in any recent conflict, UN expert says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Freedom of expression has been threatened more seriously in Gaza than in any recent conflict, with journalists targeted in the war-torn territory and Palestinian supporters targeted in many countries, a United Nations expert said Friday. Irene Khan, the U.N. independent investigator on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, pointed to attacks on the media and the targeted killings and arbitrary detention of dozens of journalists in Gaza. 'The banning of Al Jazeera, the tightening of censorship within Israel and in the occupied territories, seem to indicate a strategy of the Israeli authorities to silence critical journalism and obstruct the documentation of possible international crimes,' she said. Khan also sharply criticized the 'discrimination and double standards' that have seen restrictions and suppression of pro-Palestinian protests and speech. She cited bans in Germany and other European countries, protests that were 'crushed harshly' on U.S. college campuses, and Palestinian national symbols and slogans prohibited and even criminalized in some countries. The U.N. special rapporteur also pointed to 'the silencing and sidelining of dissenting voices in academia and the arts,' with some of the best academic institutions in the world failing to protect all members of their community, 'whether Jewish, Palestinian, Israeli, Arab, Muslim, or otherwise.' While social media platforms have been a lifeline for communications to and from Gaza, Khan said, they have seen an upsurge in disinformation, misinformation and hate speech — with Arabs, Jews, Israelis and Palestinians all targeted online. She stressed that Israel’s military actions in Gaza and its decades of occupation of Palestinian territories are matters of public interest, scrutiny and criticism. Khan earlier presented her report on 'the global crisis of freedom of expression arising from the conflict in Gaza' to the General Assembly’s human rights committee. She said Israel responded to it, explained the country’s laws, and 'took the position that the conflict in Gaza was not really of global significance, and my mandate should not engage with it.' Israel’s U.N. mission declined to comment on her press briefing. The surprise attacks in southern Israel led by Hamas militants who controlled Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, killed about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and led to the abduction of about 250 others, around 100 of whom are still hostages. Israel’s military offensive in retaliation has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority were women and children. Khan, a former secretary-general of Amnesty International, stressed that 'no conflict in recent times has threatened freedom of expression so seriously or so far beyond its borders than Gaza.' She said attacks on the media 'are an attack on the right to information of people around the world who want to know what is happening there.' Khan said she has called on the U.N. General Assembly and Security Council to take measures to strengthen the protection of journalists 'as essential civilian workers.' ' Journalism should be seen as essential as humanitarian work,' she said. The information industry has changed, Khan said, and the issue of access to conflict situations by international media representatives — who have been banned from Gaza by Israel — must also be affirmed. 'It has to be clarified that it is not okay to just deny access to international media,' she said. Without naming any countries, Khan asked why nations that pride themselves as champions of the media have been silent in the face of unprecedented attacks on journalists in Gaza and the West Bank. 'My main message is that what is happening in Gaza is sending signals around the world that it is okay to do these things because it’s happening in Gaza and Israel is enjoying absolute impunity — and others around the world will believe that there will be absolute impunity, too,' Khan said.	https://apnews.com/article/un-freedom-expression-attacks-journalists-palestinians-israel-4ee19abb793df9b9fcce4364df7f2efe	2024-10-18T20:46:05-07:00	
Cher, Foreigner, Mary J. Blige, Dionne Warwick inducted into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame	CLEVELAND (AP) — Pure pop kicked off the inductions at the the Rock &amp; Roll Hall Fame induction ceremony on Saturday as Dua Lipa and Cher sang 'Believe' before ceding the stage to a medley of rump shakers by funk masters Kool &amp; the Gang, rock classics by Foreigner and Peter Frampton, and a powerhouse performance by gospel icon Dionne Warwick, bringing the house down at 83. The inductees this year also included: Mary J. Blige, A Tribe Called Quest, Ozzy Osbourne, Dave Matthews Band and posthumous recognition for Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Alexis Korner, John Mayall, Norman Whitfield and Big Mama Thornton. 'Where do I even begin? Cher is not one person,' Zendaya said when inducting Cher. 'Her name is just as legendary as her legacy.' Zendaya noted that Cher, 78, is the only woman to have a No. 1 hit on a Billboard chart in each of the past seven decades. 'Cher has got the goods,' Zendaya said before the singer performed a rocking version of 'If I Could Turn Back Time.' In her speech, Cher said she was inspired by Cinderella and thanked her mother for instilling in her to always get back up after defeat. 'The one thing I got from my mom is to never give up,' she said. 'I never give up. I'm talking to the women — down and out, we keep going.' Chuck D inducted Kool &amp; the Gang, saying 'This is a long-due celebration.' The band had 12 Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 including the 1980 chart-topper 'Celebration' as well as 'Cherish,' 'Get Down On It,' 'Jungle Boogie,' 'Ladies Night' and 'Joanna.' They’ve been eligible for the hall since 1994. The Roots helped the band do a medley of hits that got the crowd grooving led by Robert 'Kool' Bell — bass guitarist, co-founder and last original member — and longtime singer James 'JT' Taylor. Confetti shot into the arena and Taylor asked the crowd to use their cellphone lights as he read off the names of 10 members who were critical to the band's success. Dr Dre inducted Blige, who is credited with creating a completely new category of music — hip-hop soul. The nine-time Grammy-winner’s best-known song is 'Family Affair″ from her triple-platinum 2001 album 'No More Drama.' 'When you listen to Mary, you understand you’re not alone in heartbreak,' Dre said. Blige, wearing shiny black hat, a sparkly dress and long black gloves and boots, sang a mix of her hits, including 'Love No Limit,' 'Be Happy' and 'Family Affair.' At the end of her set, a dancer brought up a cloak to wrap around her, in an echo of James Brown. She thanked her fans, her mom — a single mother raising children in the projects — and Method Man and Dr. Dre, who helped her earn a Grammy and an Emmy. 'Move with grace. Trust the journey,' she advised. 'You are worthy.' Warwick arrived at the ceremony only a few days after attending a memorial to her longtime friend and collaborator, Cissy Houston, in Newark, New Jersey. Teyana Taylor called her 'truly one of a kind' as well as telling off the teleprompter operator for not putting 'Ms.' before her name. Jennifer Hudson sang 'I’ll Never Love This Way Again' and was joined by Warwick, who also sang 'Walk On By.' Warwick said this year was the third time she was nominated for the Hall. 'I am so pleased to be here,' she said. 'I'm just going to say this and get off the stage: Thank you, thank you, thank you.' Dave Chappelle helped induct A Tribe Called Quest — Q-Tip, Jarobi, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and the late Phife Dawg — the lone hip-hop group to make the cut this year. Chappelle said the group incorporated 'jazz and soul in a way hip-hop had never seen' and they also proved you could be 'cool and not necessarily gangster.' Queen Latifah, Busta Rhymes, Common, The Roots and De La Soul were on hand to perform a medley of Tribe hits, including 'Bonita Applebum,' 'Scenario' and 'Can I Kick It?' Sammy Hagar introduced Foreigner, and thanked their fans for their tenacity to demand inclusion. The English-American rockers — with hits like 'Cold as Ice,' and 'Waiting for a Girl Like You' — topped the charts in the 1970s and ’80s but never made it into the Hall — much less a ballot — until last year, despite being eligible for more than 20 years. Hagar noted that Foreigner currently tours without any original members. 'That's how good the songs are,' he said. 'Who deserves this more than Foreigner?' Demi Lovato and Slash joined the touring Foreigner for 'Feels Like the First Time' and Hagar then took lead for 'Hot Blooded.' Kelly Clarkson thrilled with a powerful 'I Want to Know What Love Is' but the arena erupted when original singer Lou Gramm joined her. Gramm thanked guitarist Mick Jones, sidelined in New York by Parkinson’s disease. Saturday's induction ceremony was held at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse in Cleveland, where the Hall has promised to return to every few years. A TV special with performance highlights will air on ABC on Jan. 1. Roger Daltrey of The Who inducted Frampton. 'It’s about bloody time!' he said. 'Peter has had the most amazing career of all time. It’s probably easier to name the people he hasn’t worked with than the people he has,' Daltrey said. Frampton earned his way into the Hall in large part on the strength of his 1976 live double album 'Frampton Comes Alive!,' buoyed by the hit songs 'Show Me the Way' and ″Baby, I Love Your Way.' Daltrey noted Frampton has always played with a wide smile. A fittingly grinning Frampton — who played at last year's ceremony to honor Sheryl Crow — brought on Keith Urban to trade licks on 'Do You Feel Like I Do' and showed why he is considered one of rock's great guitarists. He hooked up his famous talk box effect and the crowd roared. 'I really am a lucky guy to have this amazing career,' he said, thanking David Bowie for resurrecting his professional life after it had spun out. Dave Matthews — before his band's inducement — helped honor Buffett with an acoustic version of the late singer-songwriter’s 'A Pirate Looks at Forty.' James Taylor then came out to call Buffett — who popularized beach bum soft rock with the escapist song 'Margaritaville' — 'larger-than-life but at the same time right-sized and always authentic.' Taylor, Kenny Chesney and Mac McAnally then performed Buffett's 'Come Monday.' Artists must have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years before they’re eligible for induction. Nominees were voted on by more than 1,000 artists, historians and music industry professionals. John Sykes, president of entertainment enterprises at iHeartMedia and the chairman of the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, said before the ceremony that he and the Hall are trying to bring the inductions back to rock's roots, not expand the category. 'What I’m trying to do is bring over the aperture back up to where it was in the late '50s, where you had Brenda Lee and Hank Williams right next to Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, the Beatles. It was, at that time, this gumbo of artists. It kind of narrowed down over the years. All I can do is bring it back to its original roots.'	https://apnews.com/article/rock-roll-hall-fame-2024-ceremony-631f31bd3ef6d72bd58c532ed380c031	2024-10-18T19:07:49-07:00	
Israel unearths Hezbollah's web of tunnels in southern Lebanon	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli forces have spent much of the past year destroying Hamas’ vast underground network in Gaza. They are now focused on dismantling tunnels and other hideouts belonging to Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon. Scarred by Hamas’ deadly raid into Israel last year that sparked the war in Gaza, Israel says it aims to prevent a similar incursion across its northern border from ever getting off the ground. The Israeli military has combed through the dense brush of southern Lebanon for the past two weeks, uncovering what it says are Hezbollah’s deep attack capabilities — highlighted by a tunnel system equipped with weapons caches and rocket launchers that Israel says pose a direct threat to nearby communities. Israel’s war against the Iran-backed militant group stretches far inside Lebanon, and its airstrikes in recent weeks have killed more than 1,700 people, about a quarter of whom were women and children, according to local health authorities. But its ground campaign has centered on a narrow patch of land just along the border, where Hezbollah has had a longstanding presence. Hezbollah has deep ties to southern Lebanon Hezbollah, which has called for Israel’s destruction, is the Arab world’s most significant paramilitary force. It began firing rockets into Israel a day after Hamas' attack. After nearly a year of tit-for-tat fighting with Hezbollah, Israel launched its ground invasion into southern Lebanon on Oct. 1 and has since sent thousands of troops into the rugged terrain. Even as it continues to bolster its forces, Israel says its invasion consists of 'limited, localized and targeted ground raids' that are meant to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure so that tens of thousands of displaced Israelis can return home. The fighting also has uprooted more than 1 million Lebanese in the past month. Many residents of southern Lebanon are supporters of the group and benefit from its social outreach. Though most fled the area months ago, they widely see the heavily armed Hezbollah as their defender, especially as the U.S.-backed Lebanese army does not have suitable weapons to protect them from any Israeli incursion. That broad support has allowed Hezbollah to establish 'a military infrastructure for itself' within the villages, said Eva J. Koulouriotis, a political analyst specialized in the Middle East and Islamic militant groups. The Israeli military says it has found weapons within homes and buildings in the villages. Hezbollah built a network of tunnels in multiple areas of Lebanon With Israel’s air power far outstripping Hezbollah’s defenses, the militant group has turned to underground tunnels as a way to elude Israeli drones and jets. Experts say Hezbollah's tunnels are not limited to the south. 'It’s a land of tunnels,' said Tal Beeri, who studies Hezbollah as director of research at The Alma Research and Education Center, a think tank with a focus on northern Israel’s security. Koulouriotis said tunnels stretch under the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah's command and control are located and where it keeps a stockpile of strategic missiles. She said the group also maintains tunnels along the border with Syria, which it uses to smuggle weapons and other supplies from Iran into Lebanon. Southern Lebanon is where Hezbollah maintains tunnels to store missiles — and from where it can launch them, Koulouriotis said. Some of the more than 50 Israelis killed by Hezbollah over the past year were hit by anti-tank missiles. In contrast to the tunnels dug out by Hamas in the sandy coastal terrain of Gaza, Hezbollah's tunnels in southern Lebanon were carved into solid rock, a feat that likely required time, money, machinery and expertise. An Israeli military official said that using prior intelligence, Israel had found 'hundreds and hundreds and hundreds' of underground positions, many of which could hold about ten fighters and were stocked with rations. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military rules, said troops were blowing up the tunnels found or using cement to make them unusable. The group used tunnels during the monthlong 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, but the network has been expanded since, even as a United Nations cease-fire resolution compelled Lebanese and U.N. forces to keep Hezbollah fighters out of the south. In mid-August, Hezbollah released a video showing what appeared to be a cavernous underground tunnel large enough for trucks loaded with missiles to drive through. Hezbollah operatives were also seen riding motorcycles inside the illuminated tunnel, named Imad-4 after the group’s late military commander, Imad Mughniyeh, who was killed in Syria in 2008 in an explosion blamed on Israel. Hezbollah's tunnels could be hindering Israel's mission Israeli troops are pushing through southern Lebanon using tanks and engineering equipment, and air and ground forces have struck thousands of targets in the area since the invasion began. The military recently said it found one cross-border tunnel that stretched just a few meters into Israel but did not have an opening. Israel also exposed a tunnel shaft that was located about 100 meters (yards) from a U.N. peacekeepers ’ post, although it wasn't clear what the precise purpose of that tunnel was. Israel says the tunnels are stocked with supplies and weapons and are outfitted with lighting, ventilation and sometimes plumbing, indicating they could be used for long stays. It says it has arrested several Hezbollah fighters hiding inside, including three on Tuesday who were said to have been found armed. The Israeli military official said many Hezbollah fighters appear to have withdrawn from the area. Lebanese military expert, Naji Malaeb, a retired brigadier general, said he assessed that Hezbollah’s tunnels were preventing Israel from making major gains. He compared that achievement to the war in Gaza, where Hamas has used its tunnels to bedevil Israeli forces and stage insurgency-like attacks. Israeli authorities insist the mission in Lebanon is succeeding. It says it has killed hundreds of Hezbollah fighters since the ground operation in Lebanon began, though at least 15 Israeli soldiers have been killed during that time. Israel has encountered Hezbollah’s tunnels before. In 2018, Israel launched an operation to destroy what is said were attack tunnels that crossed into Israeli territory. Beeri said that six tunnels were discovered, including one that was 1 kilometer (1,000 yards) long and 80 meters (87 yards) deep, crossing some 50 meters (yards) into Israel. Israel believes Hezbollah was planning an Oct. 7-style invasion For Israel, the tunnels are evidence that Hezbollah planned what Israel says would be a bloody offensive against communities in the north. 'Hezbollah has openly declared that it plans to carry out its own Oct. 7 massacre on Israel’s northern border, on an even larger scale,' Israeli military spokesman Rear. Adm. Daniel Hagari said the day troops entered Lebanon. Israel has not released evidence that any such attack was imminent but has expressed concern that one might be launched once residents return. Former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by Israel last month while in an underground bunker, had signaled in speeches that Hezbollah could launch an attack on northern Israel. In May 2023, just months before Hamas’ attack, Hezbollah staged a simulation of an incursion into northern Israel with rifle-toting militants on motorcycles bursting through a mock border fence bedecked with Israeli flags. Hezbollah officials have at times framed calls for an attack against Israel as a defensive measure that would be taken in times of war. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-ground-invasion-tunnels-2f22d95269bdf3b5fa1304816f2fee81	2024-10-18T19:01:56-07:00	
This is the beginning': 91-year-old sister of longest death row inmate sees hope in his acquittal	HAMAMATSU, Japan (AP) — Hideko Hakamada, 91, spent much of her life working to free her brother from nearly a half-century on death row. Now that he has been acquitted she feels that the siblings are beginning a new chapter of their lives. She backed her brother, Iwao Hakamada, the world’s longest-serving death row inmate, through decades of frustrating, at times apparently hopeless, legal wrangling as his mental condition worsened. 'No matter what people said about me, I lived my own life and appreciated my freedom. I did not belittle myself as the sister of a death row inmate. I lived without shame,' she told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview at her home in the central Japanese city of Hamamatsu. 'My little brother only happened to be a death row inmate.' While working as an accountant to support herself, she helped cover her brother’s legal costs, made regular long trips to Tokyo to see him on death row and helped shape public opinion in his favor. It wasn’t easy, and there were times she felt helpless. 'I was desperately working to win him a retrial, because that was the only way to save his life,' she said. But sometimes she felt 'at a loss and even unsure who I should be fighting against. … It was like I was fighting against an invisible power.' To maintain a sense of herself, outside of her brother's legal fight, she invested her savings and took out loans to have a building constructed. She now rents out apartments in the building, where the siblings live. Iwao Hakamada, a former boxer, was acquitted in September by the Shizuoka District Court, which said police and prosecutors had collaborated to fabricate and plant evidence against him, and forced him to confess with violent, hourslong, closed interrogations. Earlier in the week, he received in the mail his voting ticket for Oct. 27 parliamentary elections, a verification his civil rights are being restored. Though he was freed from his solitary death row cell after a 2014 court order for a retrial, his conviction was not cleared and his rights were not fully restored until the recent decision. Hideko Hakamada said she is 'filled with happiness' over the acquittal, and that being able to vote 'means he has finally been allowed back into society.' 'I will definitely go vote with him. It doesn’t matter which candidate' he votes for, she said. 'To me what’s important is that he casts a vote.' Her brother's long death row confinement took a toll on his mental health. He often drifts between reality and his imagination. He understands his acquittal but doesn’t seem to be fully convinced, she said. Because of his difficulty carrying on a conversation and to avoid stress, Iwao Hakamada could not speak with the AP and left while his sister was interviewed. Volunteers took him on his daily ride and a brief walk. His supporters say he thinks he is going out 'patrolling' as a guardian for the neighborhood. He was convicted of murder in the 1966 killing of an executive at a miso bean paste company and three of his family members in Hamamatsu. He was sentenced to death in a 1968 district court ruling, but was not executed because of the lengthy appeal and retrial process in Japan’s labyrinth-like criminal justice system. It took 27 years for the Supreme Court to deny his first appeal for a retrial. His second appeal for a retrial was filed in 2008 by his sister, and that request was granted in 2014. Hideko Hakamada said her brother’s training as a professional boxer helped him survive. She maintained a rock-solid trust in her brother, who was the closest to her among their six siblings. For his first few years in prison, her brother wrote to his mother every day, repeating that he was innocent, asking about his mother’s health and expressing optimism about his fate. 'I am innocent,' he wrote in a letter to his mother while on trial in 1967. After the top court finalized his death penalty in 1976, Hideko Hakamada noticed changes in her brother. He expressed fear and anger at being falsely accused. 'When I go to sleep in a soundless solitary cell every night, I sometimes cannot help cursing God. I have not done anything wrong,' he wrote to his family. 'What a cold-blooded act to inflict such cruelty on me.' The only way for her to make sure he was alive was to go to visit him in person at the Tokyo Detention House. She could only see him for up to 30 minutes per visit. She also arranged care packages of fruit and sweets. There were times he refused to meet, presumably because of the deterioration of his mental health. Executions are carried out in secrecy in Japan, and prisoners are not informed of their fate until the morning they are hanged. In 2007, Japan began disclosing the names of those executed and some details of their crimes, but disclosures are still limited. Japan and the United States are the only two countries in the Group of Seven advanced nations that have capital punishment. Hakamada was the world’s longest-serving death row prisoner and only the fifth death row inmate to be acquitted in a retrial in postwar Japan, where prosecutors have near-perfect conviction rates and retrials are extremely rare. Hideko Hakamada wants that changed, based on the lessons learned from her brother’s case, which has raised criticism about prosecutorial actions. She rarely complained about her ordeal or the harsh public comments she faced or her fear that her brother would be executed despite her belief that he was wrongfully accused. She has been praised for her positive attitude and strength. But, she says, 'It is Iwao who deserves praise for surviving, for walking out of confinement after more than 50 years.' As her brother’s legal fight dragged on, she decided to build a home so she could feel a sense of achievement for herself. 'That became something to strive for,' she said. To stay fit enough for her regular trips from Hamamatsu to Tokyo to visit her brother, she started exercising every morning, a mix of stretching and gymnastic exercises. She still keeps up with her morning routine. 'I’m 91, but age has nothing on me. People say ordinary 91-year-olds live more quietly, but that's not what I’m doing. I want to do everything I can while I’m still in good health,' she said. 'I’m not done yet,' she said, with a laugh. 'This is the beginning.'	https://apnews.com/article/japan-death-row-inmate-sister-hideko-hakamada-50c65d210df27b91e2b95d0c9bff39c9	2024-10-18T17:30:26-07:00	
North Korea claims it discovered the remains of a South Korean drone in its capital	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Saturday it found the remains of a South Korean drone during a search in its capital, Pyongyang, claiming the drone proved the South’s military was behind the alleged drone infiltrations over the city’s skies earlier in the month. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency released photos showing a seemingly damaged aircraft with wide, V-shaped wings and winglets. It said a joint investigation by North Korea’s military and state security agencies concluded that the aircraft, which it said was found on Oct. 13, was the same type of drone that appeared in a South Korean military parade earlier in October. North Korea accused South Korea of flying drones over the night skies of Pyongyang three different times this month to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets. It threatened to respond with force if such flights occur again. The aircraft allegedly found in Pyongyang was likely one of the drones that were used to drop leaflets, North Korea’s Defense Ministry said, but further examinations were needed to verify that. Should South Korea deny that the aircraft was used to drop leaflets, that would only confess to a separate infiltration of North Korea’s airspace by the South’s military, the ministry said. If North Korea confirms another violation of its territorial ground, airspace and waters by the South’s military, that will be regarded as a 'declaration of war and an immediate retaliatory attack will be launched,' the ministry added. South Korea’s military didn’t immediately respond to North Korea’s report about the alleged drone discovery. South Korea’s defense minister initially made a vague denial after the North's Oct. 11 accusation that the South sent drones over Pyongyang. The South’s military adjusted its response hours later, saying it couldn’t confirm whether or not the North’s claims were true. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are now at their worst in years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ramps up his weapons tests and threats, and expands military cooperation with Russia, with South Korea claiming the North dispatched troops to support Russia’s war against Ukraine. The animosity has been exacerbated by Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns between the Koreas in recent months. Since May, North Korea has sent thousands of balloons carrying paper waste, plastic and other trash to drop on the South. The South’s military has responded by using loudspeakers at the border to broadcast propaganda and K-pop to North Korea. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of Kim’s authoritarian government and his family’s dynastic rule.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-south-drones-pyongyang-leaflets-c4e618792ee487715098c7aa271c4b34	2024-10-18T15:57:35-07:00	
Japan's ruling party headquarters is attacked with firebombs and suspect is arrested	TOKYO (AP) — A man threw several firebombs into the headquarters of Japan’s ruling party in Tokyo Saturday, then crashed his car into the fencing of the prime minister's residence, Tokyo police said. There were no reports of injuries. The man, identified by police as Atsunobu Usuda, 49, was arrested on the spot on charges of obstructing the performance of official duties, although additional charges can be added later. Although the motive for the attack was not immediately clear, Japanese media reports said social media posts believed to be Usuda's showed him complaining about the sums of money required to run for office under Japanese law, implying Usuda had political ambitions. The media reports also quoted unidentified sources as saying Usuda had taken part in protests against nuclear plants. Usuda was not immediately available for comment. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is increasingly unpopular with the public due to a ballooning money scandal involving dubious funding and suspected tax evasion. The party declined to comment on Saturday’s attack, referring all queries to the police. Voting for the lower house of Parliament is set for Oct. 27. Some tarnished politicians lost the official backing of the ruling party but are running as independents. The party recently chose a new leader, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, hoping to present a new image. But polls show its popularity plummeting, although it’s still unclear whether they will lose their majority grip on the lower house in the upcoming election given the splintered opposition. Some candidates have been heckled, which is relatively rare in Japanese culture. The Liberal Democrats have ruled Japan almost continuously over recent decades. They are credited with leading Japan as it became an economic powerhouse from the devastation of World War II. Then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated in 2022, while making a speech for a ruling party candidate during a parliamentary election. The killer used a handmade firearm, saying he resented Abe because his mother gave all the family money to the Unification Church, and he saw Abe as affiliated with that church. Such ties are still ongoing with some ruling party politicians. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/japan-crime-elections-politics-ldp-491eb0635a348793e679212d2dbb40cf	2024-10-18T14:41:25-07:00

UN expands arms embargo on Haiti to all types of arms and ammunition	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Friday to expand the arms embargo in Haiti to all types of weapons and ammunition, expressing grave concern at the extremely high levels of gang violence and criminal activities in the impoverished Caribbean nation. The resolution authorizes the 193 U.N. member nations to take 'appropriate steps to prevent the illicit trafficking and diversion of arms and related materiel in Haiti.' U.N. experts have said increasingly sophisticated weapons that end up in the hands of gang members and criminals are being trafficked from the U.S., especially from Florida. The resolution also extends a travel ban and asset freeze on individuals on the U.N. sanctions blacklist for a year. In late September, the council committee monitoring sanctions on Haiti added two people to the list, which included five gang leaders. One was Elan Luckson, leader of the Gran Grif gang, which killed at least 115 people in the town of Pont-Sondé in the Artibonite region next to the capital in early October in one of the biggest massacres in Haiti in recent history. The other was Victor Prophane, a former member of the Haitian parliament accused of being involved in arms trafficking. The power of gangs in Haiti has grown since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, and they are now estimated to control up to 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. They also have moved into surrounding areas. The surge in killings, rapes and kidnappings has led to a violent uprising by civilian vigilante groups. The Security Council voted unanimously in early October to extend the mandate of the Kenya-led multinational force trying to help the Haitian National Police quell the gangs. The leaders of Kenya and Haiti last week urged international partners to honor their commitment to the U.N.-backed force in Haiti, saying the mission needs more resources and that its budget will run out in March 2025. Kenyan President William Ruto, who met with Haiti Prime Minister Garry Conille in Nairobi a week ago, said Kenya would deploy 600 additional officers next month to join the 400 officers already in the country. Nearly two dozen police officers and soldiers from Jamaica are also in Haiti, but the numbers fall significantly short of the 2,500 pledged by various countries, including Chad, Benin, Bangladesh and Barbados, for the mission. The council resolution adopted Friday, co-sponsored by Ecuador and the United States, also encourages the Haitian government to reinforce the management of police weapons, ammunition as well as seized arms and 'to strengthen border and customs control to curb illicit trafficking and diversion.' It extends the panel of experts monitoring the implementation of sanctions for 13 months. Ecuador’s political coordinator, Irina Barba Bustos, told the council after the vote that sanctions are part of the comprehensive response that is essential to address the crisis in Haiti and promote a political solution and a peaceful and prosperous future for its people. The arms embargo previously applied to 'small arms, light weapons, and ammunition.' The resolution expands it to include 'arms and related materiel of all types.' Bustos said the expansion of the arms embargo 'bolsters our efforts to combat transnational organized crime, which uses all forms of violence against the civilian population, particularly against women.'	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gangs-sanctions-arms-embargo-un-a68d75f117e803372189a44e9f8eec37	2024-10-18T13:25:12-07:00	
What's next for Hamas after its leader Yahya Sinwar's death?	BEIRUT (AP) — The killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli forces in Gaza this week leaves the Palestinian militant group considering new leadership for the second time in less than three months. Will Hamas now turn away from its hard-line wing or will it double down, and what will it mean for the group’s future and for the revival of cease-fire and hostage exchange negotiations between Hamas and Israel? Sinwar replaced Hamas' previous leader, Ismail Haniyeh, after Haniyeh was killed in July in a blast in Iran that was widely blamed on Israel. As an architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in southern Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, Sinwar was a defiant choice at a time when some expected the militant group to take a more conciliatory approach and seek to end the conflict. Sinwar’s killing appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday. Sinwar's death has little immediate impact on Hamas Killing Sinwar marked a major symbolic victory for Israel in its yearlong war against Hamas in Gaza. But it has also allowed Hamas to claim him as a hero who was killed in the battlefield, not hiding in a tunnel. While the group is on the defensive and has been largely forced underground in Gaza, it continues to fight Israeli forces in the enclave and to exert political influence. Bassem Naim, a Qatar-based member of the group's political bureau, said in a statement that Israel had killed other Hamas leaders, including its founding leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, and his successor, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who were killed by airstrikes in 2004. 'Hamas each time became stronger and more popular, and these leaders became an icon for future generations,' he said. The impact of Sinwar's death on military operations in Gaza remains to be seen. But Sadeq Abu Amer, head of the Turkey-based think tank Palestinian Dialogue Group, said that 'there will be no significant impact on the political structure of Hamas.' When Sinwar was appointed, 'the situation was basically arranged so that Hamas could manage its political affairs and manage the organization independently of Sinwar' because of the difficulties of communication between Sinwar and Hamas' political leaders outside of Gaza, he said. Most matters were managed by 'collective leadership' between the head of the group’s Shura Council and officials in charge of the West Bank, Gaza and regions abroad, he said. The notable exception: Sinwar controlled all matters related to Israeli hostages in Gaza. The search for a replacement Sinwar’s term was a temporary one and would have expired in the second half of 2025. 'Hamas will not move urgently at the present time to choose a head of the political bureau,' Thabet al-Amour, a political analyst in Gaza, said. He noted that Khalil al-Hayya, Sinwar’s deputy based in Qatar, was already managing executive affairs and can continue to do so. Abu Amer agreed that Hamas might opt to keep running with the current 'formula of collective leadership.' Another possibility, he said would be the election of one of the three regional leaders: al-Hayya, who is in charge of Gaza; Zaher Jibril, in charge of the West Bank; or Khaled Mashaal, in charge of areas outside of the Palestinian territories. The group also might select a leader without publicly announcing the name 'for security reasons,' he said. Who are the contenders? If Hamas names a replacement for Sinwar, Khaled Mashaal and Khalil al-Hayya, both members of Hamas' political leadership based in Qatar, are widely considered the most likely contenders. Al-Hayya had served as Sinwar’s deputy and as the head of the group’s delegation in cease-fire negotiations, both in the current war and during a previous conflict in 2014. He is a longtime official with the group and survived an Israeli airstrike that hit his home in Gaza in 2007, killing several of his family members. Al-Hayya is seen as close to Iran, but as less of a hard-liner than Sinwar. He was close to Haniyeh. In an interview with The Associated Press in April, al-Hayya said Hamas was willing to agree to truce of at least five years with Israel and that if an independent Palestinian state were created along 1967 borders, the group would dissolve its military wing and become a purely political party. Mashaal, who served as the group's political leader from 1996 to 2017, is seen as a relatively moderate figure. He has good relations with Turkey and Qatar, although his relations with Iran, Syria and Hezbollah have been troubled due to his support for the Syrian opposition in the country's 2011 civil war. Moussa Abu Marzouk, a founding member of Hamas and the first head of its political bureau, is another potential candidate who is seen as a moderate. Some have suggested that Sinwar’s brother, Mohammed, a key military figure in Gaza, could replace him — if he is still alive. Al-Amour downplayed that possibility. 'Mohammed Sinwar is the head of the field battle, but he will not be Sinwar’s heir as head of the political bureau,' he said. Rather, al-Amour said the death of Sinwar, 'one of the most prominent hawks within the movement,' is likely to lead to 'the advancement of a trend or direction that can be described as doves' via the group’s leadership abroad. Cease-fire negotiations In the first public statement by a Hamas official after Sinwar's death, al-Hayya appeared to take a hard line on negotiations for a cease-fire deal that would see the release of some 100 Israeli hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attack that sparked the war and who are believed to be held in Gaza. There will be no hostage release without 'the end of the aggression on Gaza and the withdrawal (of Israeli forces) from Gaza,' al-Hayya said. But some believe that the group may now moderate its stance. In particular, Mashaal 'shows more flexibility when it comes to collaborating with the Qataris and Egyptians to reach cease-fire in Gaza, which would also have a positive impact on the situation in Lebanon,' Saad Abdullah Al-Hamid, a Saudi political analyst, said. But Sinwar's death could leave some 'practical difficulties in completing a prisoner exchange,' Abu Amer said. The Gaza-based leader was 'the only one in the Hamas leadership who held the secrets of this file,' he said, including the location of all the hostages. ——— Associated Press staff writer Fatma Khaled in Cairo contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/hamas-israel-sinwar-khalil-hayya-khaled-mashaal-a1c44df5cdabf0cf6459db9ea6eaa9b8	2024-10-18T10:30:26-07:00	
Cuba’s electrical grid goes offline after one of the island's major power plant fails	HAVANA (AP) — Cuba’s electrical grid went offline Friday after one of the island’s major power plants failed, the energy ministry said. The announcement came hours after the government announced that one of the nation’s main thermoelectric plants, La Antonio Guiteras, had ceased operations at about 11 a.m. local time, with authorities saying it was only offline temporarily. Hours earlier, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero had sought to assauge concerned citizens about the blackout that began Thursday evening. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. HAVANA (AP) — A massive outage left millions of Cubans without power and prompted the government Friday to implement emergency measures to slash demand, including suspending classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling non-essential services. Cuban officials said that the blackout, which started late Thursday, saw 1.64 gigawatts go offline during peak hours in the early evening, about half the total demand at the time. 'The situation has worsened in recent days,' Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said in a special address on national television in the early hours of Friday. 'We must be fully transparent ... we have been halting economic activities to ensure energy for the population.' During his address, Marrero was accompanied by Alfredo López, the chief of UNE, said the outage stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residences’ air conditioners, as well as breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities. Changes to electricity rates for small- and medium-sized companies, which have proliferated since they were first authorized by the communist government in 2021, are also being considered, Marrero said. Marrero sought to placate people’s concerns about the outage, citing an expected influx of fuel supply from Cuba's state-owned oil company. Even in a country accustomed to frequent outages amid a deepening economic crisis, the size of Thursday night’s blackout left millions of Cubans on edge. Residents shut their doors and windows they typically leave open at night, and candles or lanterns were visible inside their homes. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-power-outage-blackout-4ae305120a99fec17c79e7621e8dac4b	2024-10-18T09:52:25-07:00

One of the largest solar projects in the US opens in Texas, backed by Google	One of the largest solar projects in the U.S. opened in Texas on Friday, backed by what Google said is the largest solar electricity purchase it has ever made. Google executive Ben Sloss said at the ribbon cutting, about two hours south of Dallas, that the corporation has a responsibility to bring renewable, carbon-free electricity online at the same time it opens operations that will use that power. Google expects to spend $16 billion through 2040 globally to purchase clean energy, he said. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who attended, said the solar project is a posterchild for the administration's efforts to incentivize manufacturers and developers to locate energy projects in the U.S. 'Sometimes when you are in the middle of history, it’s hard to tell, because you are in the middle of it,' she said. 'But I'm telling you right now that we are in the middle of history being made.' SB Energy built three solar farms side by side, the 'Orion Solar Belt,' in Buckholts, Texas. Combined, they will be able to provide 875 megawatts of clean energy. That is nearly the size of a typical nuclear facility. In total, Google has contracted with clean energy developers to bring more than 2,800 megawatts of new wind and solar projects to the state, which it says exceeds the amount of power required for its operations there. Google, Amazon and Microsoft have all recently announced investments in nuclear energy to power data centers, too, as the tech giants seek new sources of carbon-free electricity to meet surging demand from data centers and artificial intelligence. Google has a commitment to get all of its electricity without contributing to climate change, regardless of time of day or whether the sun is up, but neither it nor other large companies are meeting those commitments with the rise of artificial intelligence. The International Energy Agency forecasts that data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt-hours in 2026, more than doubling from 2022. Estimates suggest one terawatt-hour can power 70,000 homes for a year. The demand for power is also growing globally as buildings and vehicles electrify. People used more electricity than ever last year, placing strain on electric grids around the world. In August, Google said it planned to invest more than $1 billion in Texas this year to support its cloud and data center infrastructure. Google will use about 85% of the project’s solar power for data centers in Ellis County and for cloud computing in the Dallas region. In Ellis County, Google operates a data center campus in Midlothian and is building out a new campus in Red Oak. The rest of the solar power will go to the state’s electrical grid. Thousands of sheep graze in the area, maintaining the vegetation around the solar arrays. 'This project was a spreadsheet and a set of emails that I had been exchanging and a bunch of approvals and so on. And then you come over the rise over there and you see it laid out in front of you and it kind of takes your breath away, right? Because there’s this enormous field of solar arrays,' Sloss said during the ceremony. 'And we actually collectively have done this. That is amazing.' SB Energy said most of the solar farm components are made in the United States, and that's only possible because the climate law formally known as the Inflation Reduction Act spurred clean energy manufacturing. The company expects the projects to be the first to qualify for an extra tax credit the law affords for using domestic content. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Ivory Coast dissolves student unions after deaths and a police raid	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Ivory Coast's government has announced a ban on all student unions following the deaths of two students and the arrest of 17 suspects in a confrontation between police and a student association with connections to some of the most powerful people in the country. The ban on Thursday came after a government raid on student housing controlled by a student union, known by its French acronym FESCI, that the government says was connected to the deaths. The National Security Council said that officers discovered large caches of weapons as well as several 'illegal businesses' within the student housing complex on the main campus of the University of Abidjan. The arrests targeted FESCI's leadership, including the general secretary, Sié Kambou, who was arrested in connection with the killings, according to a filing by chief prosecutor Koné Oumar. 'No crime can be committed in the FESCI environment without the named Sié Kambou being informed of it,' the court filing said. In a statement on Friday, FESCI called the decision 'a flagrant violation of the right to association, assembly and peaceful demonstration conferred by the Constitution' and denied any involvement in the deaths. The ban was the culmination of a government response to the death last month of FESCI member Agui Deagoué. According to the statement from the public prosecutor's office, Deagoué was Kambou's main rival within the union and was kidnapped off the street on his way to a meeting with him. FESCI was created in 1990 as a student association, but the group soon found itself at odds with then President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who had its leaders arrested for what he deemed illegal meetings and demonstrations. After Houphouët-Boigny's rival, Laurent Gbagbo, came to power in 2000, FESCI enjoyed a privileged status, and authorities looked the other way as members attacked opposition supporters on and off campus. In 2011, Gbagbo lost a presidential election, but refused to concede defeat, triggering an outbreak of violence in which FESCI and its former leaders allegedly attacked the outgoing government's opponents. One of FESCI’s former leaders, Charles Blé Goudé, faced trial for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, but was acquitted in 2019. 'FESCI was an avant-garde association serving students and pupils in Cote d’Ivoire,' Julien-Geoffroy Kouao, an Abidjan-based political scientist, told The Associated Press, using the French name for the country. 'Unfortunately, today it has deviated to become an association whose instruments of action are violence.' FESCI took control of much of the student housing across the country from the mid-2010s, and according to students, has been charging exorbitantly high rates for rooms that were often crowded or poorly maintained. But the union, whose 100,000 members make up a third of the Ivory Coast's student body, has been defended by some. FESCI as an organization shouldn't be blamed for the actions of some of its members, Désiré N’Guessan Kouamé, a local politician, told the AP. 'Today, some people call it a criminal (organization). Fine, but we must recognize that in any organization or society, there are black sheep,' Kouamé said. Following the decision by the National Security Council, government workers began to demolish the group's headquarters, but given FESCI's role in administering student housing, some students expressed doubt it would be enough to force the organization to close or even to dent its power significantly.	https://apnews.com/article/ivory-coast-students-deaths-fesci-unions-ban-1a67ea2e6cc253d9f73c44eab7d98f72	2024-10-18T08:42:13-07:00	
Gangs attack neighborhoods across Haiti's capital in new wave of violence	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Multiple gangs attacked several communities in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince on Friday, setting fire to homes and a church as bullets whizzed through the area. At least one woman was killed as gangs opened fire in Solino, St. Michel, Tabarre 27 and other neighborhoods, with panicked residents calling radio stations since late Thursday pleading for help. A police union also called for help Thursday on X, saying it had information that multiple gunmen were preparing to invade Solino. 'Immediate action is required!' it wrote. A spokesman for Haiti’s National Police didn't immediately respond to a message for comment. Radio Télé Métronome reported that the swearing in of Haiti's provisional electoral council scheduled for Friday in downtown Port-au-Prince was moved to a safer area. As the attacks continued, six officials from the Bahamas arrived in Haiti Friday to join a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to help quell gang violence. The officials are the first of a contingent of 150 soldiers from the Bahamas expected in upcoming months. It wasn't clear what prompted the latest attack, which comes just days after Haitian and Kenyan police launched an operation killed at least 20 suspected gang members in an area controlled by the 400 Mawozo gang that operates mainly in Tabarre. Gangs control 80% of Port-au-Prince, although communities like Solino have been fighting attempts by gunmen to control it.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-violence-attack-portauprince-90e0a57167393e874b85ac4017d2c31d	2024-10-18T07:11:30-07:00	
What to know about Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was killed in Gaza	Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was killed by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip, was the mastermind behind the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that sparked the war. He rose to the top position in August after the killing of the previous leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in an explosion in Iran that was blamed on Israel. On Thursday, Israel said troops in Gaza had killed Sinwar. A top Hamas political official confirmed the death Friday. Some things to know about Sinwar: From refugee camp to Hamas militant Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in the Gaza town of Khan Younis. He was an early member of Hamas, which was formed in 1987. He eventually led the group's security arm, which worked to purge it of spies for Israel. Israel arrested him in the late 1980s and he admitted to killing 12 suspected collaborators, a role that earned him the nickname, 'The Butcher of Khan Younis.' He was sentenced to four life terms for offenses that included the killing of two Israeli soldiers. A prison leader while jailed in Israel Sinwar organized strikes in prison to improve working conditions. He also studied Hebrew and Israeli society. He survived brain cancer in 2008 after being treated by Israeli doctors. Sinwar was released from prison in 2011 by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of an exchange for an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid. Rise to Gaza power with a reputation for ruthlessness When Sinwar returned to Gaza, he quickly rose through Hamas' leadership ranks with a reputation for ruthlessness. He was widely believed to be behind the 2016 killing of another top Hamas commander, Mahmoud Ishtewi, in an internal power struggle. Sinwar became head of Hamas in Gaza, effectively putting him in control of the territory, and worked with Haniyeh to align the group with Iran and its proxies around the region while also building the group's military capabilities. The October attack on Israel Sinwar, along with Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas' armed wing, is believed to have engineered the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel. The attack killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and the militants took some 250 people hostage, sparking the war with Hamas. The conflict has killed over 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. Hamas said it launched the attack in retaliation for Israel's treatment of Palestinians and to push the Palestinian cause back onto the world agenda. Israel said it killed Deif in an attack in July.	https://apnews.com/article/sinwar-hamas-gaza-israel-0ca09c4c9d03e4113ca80c0c8fc28e97	2024-10-18T07:04:30-07:00	
Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' top leader and a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, is dead at 61	BEIRUT (AP) — Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ top leader and a mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the longest, deadliest and most destructive war in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza. He was 61. In Gaza, no figure loomed larger in determining the war’s trajectory than Sinwar. Obsessive, disciplined and dictatorial, he was a rarely seen veteran militant who learned Hebrew over years spent in Israeli prisons and who carefully studied his enemy. He worked on bringing Hamas closer to the Iran-led alliance after it moved away following the start of Syria’s conflict in 2011. His death came in what appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday. Israel declared Thursday that the troops had killed him. A top Hamas political official confirmed the death Friday. The secretive figure feared on both sides of the battle lines engineered the surprise Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel, along with the even more shadowy Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas’ armed wing. Israel said that it killed Deif in a July airstrike in southern Gaza that killed more than 70 Palestinians. Soon after, Hamas’ leader in exile, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed while visiting Iran in an explosion that was blamed on Israel. Sinwar was then chosen to take his place as Hamas’ top leader, though he was in hiding in Gaza. Palestinian militants who carried out the October 2023 attack killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 others, catching Israel’s military and intelligence establishment off guard and shattering the image of Israeli invincibility. Israel’s retaliation was crushing. The conflict has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. It also has caused widespread destruction in Gaza, and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless and many on the verge of starvation. Sinwar held indirect negotiations with Israel to try to end the war. One of his goals was to win the release of thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli jails, much like the deal that got him released more than a decade ago. The war he ignited drew in Hezbollah, eventually leading to another Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and led Iran and Israel to trade fire directly for the first time, raising fears of an even more expansive conflict. To Israelis, Sinwar was a nightmarish figure. The Israeli army’s chief spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, called him a murderer 'who proved to the whole world that Hamas is worse than ISIS,' referring to the Islamic State group. Always defiant, Sinwar ended one of his few public speeches by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming in Gaza, 'I will walk back home after this meeting.' He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets. Among Palestinians, he was respected for standing up to Israel and remaining in impoverished Gaza, in contrast to other Hamas leaders living more comfortably abroad. But he was also deeply feared for his iron grip in Gaza, where public dissent is suppressed. In contrast to the media-friendly personas cultivated by some of Hamas’ political leadership, Sinwar never sought to build a public image. He was known as the 'Butcher of Khan Younis' for his brutal approach to Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. Sinwar was born in 1962 in Gaza’s Khan Younis refugee camp to a family that was among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians driven from what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. He was an early member of Hamas, which emerged from the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1987, when the coastal enclave was under Israeli military occupation. Sinwar convinced the group’s founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, that to succeed as a resistance organization, Hamas needed to be purged of informants for Israel. They founded a security arm, then known as Majd, which Sinwar led. Arrested by Israel in the late 1980s, he admitted under interrogation to having killed 12 suspected collaborators. He was eventually sentenced to four life terms for offenses that included the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers. Michael Koubi, a former director of the investigations department at Israel’s Shin Bet security agency who interrogated Sinwar, recalled the confession that stood out to him the most: Sinwar recounted forcing a man to bury his own brother alive because he was suspected of working for Israel. 'His eyes were full of happiness when he told us this story,' Koubi said. But to fellow prisoners, Sinwar was charismatic, sociable and shrewd, open to detainees from all political factions. He became the leader of the hundreds of imprisoned Hamas members. He organized strikes to improve conditions. He learned Hebrew and studied Israeli society. He was known for feeding fellow inmates, making kunafa, a treat of shredded dough stuffed with cheese. 'Being a leader inside prison gave him experience in negotiations and dialogue, and he understood the mentality of the enemy and how to affect it,' said Anwar Yassine, a Lebanese citizen who spent about 17 years in Israeli jails, much of the time with Sinwar. Yassine noted how Sinwar always treated him with respect even though he belonged to the Lebanese Communist Party, whose secular principles conflicted with Hamas’ ideology. During his years in detention, Sinwar wrote a 240-page novel, 'Thistle and the Cloves.' It tells the story of Palestinian society from the 1967 Mideast war until 2000, when the second intifada began. 'This is not my personal story, nor is it the story of a specific person, despite the fact that all the incidents are true,' Sinwar wrote in the novel’s opening. In 2008, Sinwar survived an aggressive form of brain cancer after treatment at a Tel Aviv hospital. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released him in 2011 along with about 1,000 other prisoners in exchange for Gilad Schalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid. Netanyahu was harshly criticized for releasing dozens of prisoners held for involvement in deadly attacks. Back in Gaza, Sinwar closely coordinated between Hamas’ political leadership and its military wing, the Qassam Brigades. He also cultivated a reputation for ruthlessness. He is widely believed to be behind the unprecedented 2016 killing of another top Hamas commander, Mahmoud Ishtewi, in an internal power struggle. He also married after his release. In 2017, he was elected head of Hamas’ political bureau in Gaza. Sinwar worked with Haniyeh to realign the group with Iran and its allies, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah. He also focused on building Hamas’ military power.	https://apnews.com/article/yahya-sinwar-hamas-leader-killed-obituary-gaza-6965bea4270313c1f1501335c705ac9a	2024-10-18T06:20:37-07:00	
Russia returns 500 dead soldiers to Ukraine as world leaders mull next steps	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia on Friday returned to Ukraine the bodies of 501 soldiers, Ukrainian authorities said, in what appeared to be the biggest repatriation of war dead since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Most of the soldiers were killed in action in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine, mostly around the city of Avdiivka that Russian forces captured in February after a long and grueling battle, Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a statement. Law enforcement agencies and forensic experts will identify the victims, who will then be handed over to family members for burial, it said. The war is believed to have killed tens of thousands of soldiers on each side, though there are no official or independently collated figures. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week disclosed parts of his so-called ‘victory plan’ aimed at compelling Russia to end the war through negotiations. That proposal is being considered by Ukraine’s Western partners, whose help is vital for Kyiv to resist its bigger neighbor. A key element would be a formal invitation into NATO, which Western backers have been reluctant to consider until after the war ends. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that Moscow is prepared to enter talks. He welcomed peace proposals previously tabled by China and Brazil, saying they could 'serve as a good basis for a search for peace.' Those proposals have failed to convince Kyiv. Speaking during a meeting with media leaders from the BRICS bloc of developing economies, Putin ruled out any concessions regarding the status of the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022, saying that 'those are our territories.' That would be unacceptable for Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden met Friday in Berlin with some European leaders and said that Ukraine’s Western allies must keep up their support for Kyiv. Zelenskyy says Russia is getting help from China, Iran and North Korea. South Korea’s spy agency said Friday that North Korea has dispatched troops to support Russia against Ukraine. The head of Ukrainian Military Intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, was quoted as saying 11,000 North Korean troops are currently training in Russia to join the fight against Ukraine. Budanov told defense news website The War Zone on Thursday that the first 2,600 North Korean soldiers are preparing to reinforce the Russian army in Kursk, the Russian border region where a Ukrainian incursion has held land since early August. The fighting has continued unabated while world leaders debate their next steps. Russia launched 135 Shahed drones, as well as some other unidentified drones, at various parts of Ukraine on Thursday night, the Ukrainian air force said, in what was one of the biggest single drone barrages of the war. Most of the drones were intercepted, the air force said. There was no official word on casualties or damage. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-soldier-bodies-pows-0fbe8d63b27f96cbbb0275af5807d776	2024-10-18T05:57:08-07:00	
Afro-Colombians fight the effects of gold mining through biodiversity projects in a violent region	SAN ISIDRO, Colombia (AP) — In an outdoor classroom surrounded by snake specimens preserved in jars, teacher Melqui Mosquera proudly talks about the nature reserve he set up in a Colombian region environmentally devastated by illegal mining. There are fish ponds with species native to the northwestern Choco region that were wiped out of the Atrato River due to contamination. A walk uphill leads to crystal water streams teeming with fish, jungle vegetation and chirping birds — a rare sound in many parts of the river now as wildlife has been pushed deep into the canopy by the loud machinery. Thanks to the support of a community council that liaises with the groups, mining has not yet reached the El Guayacan nature reserve, which was founded in 2013 with 13 hectares and today boasts over 200. Mosquera is pushing to achieve official legal status for the reserve, which could force the government to provide more protection. Mosaquera's reserve is one of many initiatives by ethnic communities in this impoverished region to fight back against the environmental devastation inflicted upon the Atrato, a river that weaves around some 750 kilometers (470 miles) through northern Colombian jungles. With no visible state presence and armed groups encroaching on the land for gold, these projects contain some of the last forms of protection for biodiversity in the region, supporting native plant life and fish populations no longer sustained by barren land and polluted waters. Outside the reserve, signs of devastation are everywhere The reserve in San Isidro is reachable only by boat. The marking of the Gaitanista Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or Gulf Glan — the letters AGC — is spray painted on the government-placed sign upon entry to the port. It's the country’s most powerful crime group and it controls the illegal gold mining operations that engulf the town. An enormous makeshift mining dredge dominates the entrance to San Isidro. Upon arrival, Associated Press journalists were approached by men patrolling the river by boat who warned not to record images of the machinery. 'We have clashed with them (AGC),' said 60-year-old Mosquera. 'Because there’s a part here with gold, you see. They’ve tried to take over to mine it.' The waters of the Atrato River, long a community life source, have been contaminated through years of intense gold mining which tears up the riverbed, leaks poisonous mercury into the waters and deforests the surrounding land. Mosquera has noticed worsening levels in biodiversity along the Atrato, especially on the Quito River tributary on which San Isidro is located. He says fish no longer breed there. 'On the banks of the rivers there were many roots, many branches, which was the refuge of the fish,' he said. 'Now there’s no more refuge, because mining has taken it all away.' Colombia’s environment ministry said Minister Susana Muhamad has been coordinating efforts with the Ministry of Defense 'to protect this important ecosystem.' But the AP saw no state presence along the river during its three-day visit to various locations along the river, and residents said it has been a long time since any operations have taken place against illegal mining infrastructure. Colombia will host the United Nations Biodiversity Conference, known as COP16, this month, a follow up to the 2022 biodiversity conference in Montreal, aimed at halting the rapid destruction of nature. Muhamad will serve as the conference’s president. Illegal gold mining in South America, and all the problems it brings, is one of the biggest threats to preserving biodiversity. But in Mosquera's classroom, the causes of the deforestation and contamination from mining are never discussed, out of fear of reprisals. Many of the student's families are involved in mining, as well as with armed groups, he said. 'We feel tied up... we know that we can’t talk. The mining part we can’t even mention in the classroom,' Mosquera said. 'We talk to students about global, regional environmental damage, but we don’t talk to them about what is going on here.' In Paimado, a group of women reforest the land Forty minutes by boat down the Atrato leads to the town of Paimado, where a group of women form another environmental project. At 6 a.m., rain lashes down while Dioselina Palacios, 49, carries a bag of fertilizer on her head and mounts a small wooden boat. A couple of minutes to the other side of the river to a plot of land degraded by mining and she is soon mixing soil collected from a nearby forest with the fertilizer, which was bought from a local woman who produces it in Paimado. Then, plant seedlings are brought from nearby forests and are replanted with the fertilizer. When they have grown, they are planted on the degraded land. Illegal gold mining with heavy machinery meant trees were ripped out and the land is left rocky and sedimented. Hugh swaths of land remain sunken where diggers excavated all they could in search of the lucrative metal. 'We are doing this work to see if we can replace a little bit of what has been lost,' said another of the women, Nereida Romaña, 65, wearing a green T-shirt with a print of the project's logo. 'Before, when there were no illegal machines, you lived a good life here ... Now you can’t even get fish.' Agricultural engineer David Antonio Navas, who supports the project, Asociacion Nuestra Casa Comun, or Our Community House Association, as part of Colombia’s Cordoba University, said the women have been taught how to stabilize the soil, and to collect different kinds of seeds in the forest like timber and fruit trees that are native to the area to take to the nurseries. 'Organic fertilizers are made from local resources, like organic waste we have from food, shells, skins,' he said. 'We don’t bring anything. All the resources we need for the soil, for pests, for everything, is already in the community.' Most of the women taking part in the small reforestation project say they have worked in gold mining for most of their lives to make a living. Palacios continues to today, with little other income possibilities. As part of Afro-Colombian tradition, the woman plant native trees in the area only during a full moon. They have also sown medicinal plants important in their culture. As impoverished region's gold is quickly vanishing, mothers like Palacios worry what will be left economically and environmentally for the next generations. Navas believes the communities should be paid to help reverse the damage caused to their ecosystem by third parties. 'We are aware that it should be the communities that support this process of restoration of degraded areas by mining,' he said. 'For this they should have a salary that allows them to generate the income to cover their needs.' But Palacios fears that despite all the initiatives, something has been permanently lost. 'I don’t think it’s going to come back again. It was a thick jungle,' she said. 'They work and they leave lots of holes and it’s not the same anymore.' ___ Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Prague bans nighttime pub crawls to deal with drunk and rowdy visitors	PRAGUE (AP) — The Czech capital has approved a ban on organized nighttime pub crawls, which have caused misery for residents and authorities alike. The popular outings of tourist groups moving from bar to bar in Prague’s historic district have been one of the outcomes of overtourism felt across Europe. Attracting more than 7 million tourists last year, Prague finally opted for the ban, which will take effect in November, after trying to deal with groups of rowdy and drunk visitors for years. It was adopted to address disturbing noise at night, garbage on the streets, and security and reputational concerns, said Adam Zabranský, a member of the city’s council who drafted the proposal that was approved this week. Zabranský said that the aim wasn't to prevent people from having a drink in this beer-loving country, but 'we don’t want to support cheap alco-tourism that’s unfortunately still quite common in Prague,' Zabranský told The Associated Press. The ban will be enforced by the city police force between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. with organizers of the pub crawls violating it facing fines of up to 100,000 koruna ($4,300). The radical move came after the previous efforts to deal with the issue failed, including the appointment of a night mayor in 2019, a city official whose job was to minimize the impact of nightlife on residents. 'It would be great if the owners of the establishments take their share of responsibility,' Zabranský said. 'As it is, the residents in the busy areas face the negative consequences while the bar owners participating in the pub crawls make profit and don’t care about the problems.' The move is part of the city’s long-term strategy to promote cultural tourism and in general to attract people to stay longer than just for a weekend and come back again. 'People coming to experience culture behave differently than those who arrive to drink all weekend long,' Zabranský said. An agency organizing the pub crawls called the ban 'a populist move,' while a group of dozens of participants on Thursday apparently enjoyed their experience. '(The pub crawl) was very nice,' Melissa Haine from Germany said. 'I think it's very funny, and you get to know new people.' The latest move by Prague doesn’t mean that visitors would face obstacles to tasting local beer in a country that is the world’s largest consumer of the drink per capita. 'Czechia has exceptional potential in beer tourism, thanks to its long history of brewing, unique breweries and the current trend of experiential and sustainable tourism,' said František Reismüller, the head of the country’s tourist authority. 'Our goal is to show that beer travel can be not only about tasting great beer, but also about learning about Czech culture, traditions and history.' ___ Stanislav Hodina contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/prague-pub-crawl-ban-tourism-18503491848410be28bfc02b48245548	2024-10-18T03:56:46-07:00

Liam Payne’s 1D bandmates, Cheryl, Simon Cowell and more mourn singer	LONDON (AP) — Friends, collaborators and fellow musicians have expressed shock and sadness over the death of former One Direction singer Liam Payne, who died in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Wednesday at age 31. A look at some of the reactions: __ 'We’re completely devastated by the news of Liam’s passing. In time, and when everyone is able to, there will be more to say. But for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother, who we loved dearly. The memories we shared with him will be treasured forever.' — the surviving members of One Direction, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles and Zayn Malik, in a statement. 'We are heartbroken. Liam will forever live in our hearts and we’ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul. We are supporting each other the best we can as a family and ask for privacy and space at this awful time.' — Payne’s family, in a statement. 'Liam was not only a pop star and a celebrity, he was a son, a brother, an uncle, a dear friend and a father to our 7 year old son. A son that now has to face the reality of never seeing his father again. What is troubling my spirit the most is that one day Bear will have access to the abhorrent reports and media exploitation we have seen in the past two days. It is breaking my heart further that I cannot protect him from that in his future.' — Cheryl, the Girls Aloud singer and mother of Payne's son Bear Grey Payne, on Instagram. 'Liam had an energy for life and a passion for work that was infectious. He was the brightest in every room and always made everyone feel happy and secure. ... We got to live out our wildest dreams together and I will cherish every moment we had forever.' — Horan, on Instagram. 'Liam lived wide open, with his heart on his sleeve, he had an energy for life that was infectious. He was warm, supportive, and incredibly loving. The years we spent together will forever remain among the most cherished years of my life. I will miss him always, my lovely friend.' — Styles, on Instagram. 'A message to you Liam if you’re listening, I feel beyond lucky to have had you in my life but I’m really struggling with the idea of saying goodbye. I’m so grateful that we got even closer since the band, speaking on the phone for hours, reminiscing about all the thousands of amazing memories we had together is a luxury I thought I’d have with you for life. I would have loved to share the stage with you again but it wasn’t to be.' — Tomlinson, on Instagram. 'I lost a brother when you left us and can’t explain to you what I’d give to just give you a hug one last time and say goodbye to you properly and tell you that I loved and respected you dearly. I will cherish all the memories I have with you in my heart forever.' — Malik, on Instagram. 'This is so difficult to put in words right now. I went outside today, and I thought about so many times we had together. I wanted to let you know what I would always say to the thousands of people who would always ask me. What is Liam like? And I would tell them you were kind, funny, sweet, thoughtful, talented, humble, focused. And how much you loved music. And how much love you genuinely had for the fans.' — Simon Cowell, mentor to One Direction and 'X Factor' judge who helped form the band, on Instagram. 'Talking about Liam in the past tense is utterly heartbreaking. He was such a loving and kind soul. I will treasure the moments I got to spend with him.' — James Corden, on Instagram. 'I’m devastated. He had the kindest soul, I will never forget. I loved working with him so much – he was just such a joy to be around on and off stage.' — singer Rita Ora on X. 'Just a boy.' — Anne Twist, mother of Styles, posted on Instagram with a broken-heart emoji. 'We are heartbroken by the sad passing of Liam Payne,' — 'X Factor' official account, on X.

Hezbollah vows a new phase in the war, as Israel says it has killed Hamas leader Sinwar	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah vowed to launch a new phase of fighting against invading Israeli troops Friday, a day after Israel said its forces in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza had killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the chief architect of last year’s brutal attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Sinwar’s killing in what appeared to be a chance frontline encounter with Israeli troops offers a potential window to shift the dynamic in the Gaza war even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah along its northern border with Lebanon and continues its aerial bombardment in other areas of Lebanon. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, which hailed Sinwar as a martyr who can inspire others in challenging Israel. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. Hamas has not yet commented directly on the Israeli announcement, but photos which were apparently taken by Israeli troops on the scene showed the body of a man who appeared to be Sinwar half-buried in rubble with a gaping wound in his head. A statement issued by one of Hamas’ political leaders abroad Friday seemed to be a reference to Sinwar's death and said Israel is mistaken if it 'believes that killing our leaders means the end of our movement and the struggle of the Palestinian people.' Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim, who is usually based in Qatar, said that past leaders in the organization had also been killed and 'Hamas each time became stronger and more popular, and these leaders became an icon for future generations to continue the journey towards a free Palestine.' He added that it is 'painful and distressing to lose beloved people, especially extraordinary leaders' but that the Palestinian militant group is sure it will be 'eventually victorious.' When asked if the statement was a confirmation of Sinwar’s death, however, Naim said it was not. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing Thursday night that 'our war is not yet ended.' But many, from the governments of Israel's allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the war. Iran’s mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Sinwar, emphasizing that he died on the battlefield and not in hiding, unlike the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who was hanged in 2006. 'When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed,' the statement said. 'However when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield — in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy — the spirit of resistance will be strengthened.' More than 1 million people on both sides were killed during the brutal Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. In Lebanon, Hezbollah issued a statement early Friday saying its fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones against Israel for the first time in recent days. The statement appeared to refer to an explosives-laden drone that evaded Israel’s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel last Sunday night, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced earlier this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. Hezbollah said its fighters were working according to 'plans prepared in advance' to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. It also announced several missile and artillery attacks on Israeli forces operating in villages in southern Lebanon’s border area overnight and Friday morning. In one case, the group said it fired a heavy missile barrage at Israeli soldiers who were trying to evacuate those wounded in an earlier strike. The group also said it had fired 'large missile salvos' at a military barracks in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights and at the Zvulun area north of Haifa. Earlier this week, Hezbollah’s acting leader Naim Kassem warned that the group will continue to target wider areas of Israel unless a cease-fire is implemented in Lebanon. As Israel fought militants in Lebanon and in Gaza, its military said Friday that its forces had killed two militants who crossed into Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea from neighboring Jordan. Such infiltrations are relatively rare, especially as Israel has ramped up border security since the Hamas attack in October 2023. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed vast swathes of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Abby Sewell and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed	https://apnews.com/article/sinwar-hezbollah-lebanon-killed-israel-hamas-39dde452082d4130556f13f87e700125	2024-10-18T02:07:03-07:00	
Body of Scottish independence champion Alex Salmond flown home from North Macedonia	LONDON (AP) — The body of former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond was flown back to Scotland on a private jet Friday, six days after the politician died suddenly in North Macedonia. A trumpet sounded as Salmond’s coffin, draped in Scotland’s blue-and-white Saltire flag, was loaded onto the plane at Ohrid airport in the country’s southwest by six members of North Macedonia's military. The 69-year-old politician died of a heart attack on Saturday while attending a conference in the lake resort city. The flight, chartered by Scottish businessman Tom Hunter, landed Friday afternoon in Aberdeen, near Salmond's home in northeast Scotland. A bagpiper played as the coffin was carried from the plane and met by Salmond's relatives and members of his Alba political party. Plans are being put in place for a private family funeral along with a public memorial service. Salmond led the Scottish National Party for a decade and a half, taking Scotland up to the brink of independence from the United Kingdom in a 2014 referendum. He transformed the SNP from a fringe party to a dominant force in Scottish politics and served as first minister from 2007 to 2014. In the referendum, Scots rejected independence, with 55% voting against and 45% in favor. Salmond subsequently resigned and was replaced by his longtime ally, Nicola Sturgeon. Their later split dominated Scottish politics for years. In 2019, Salmond was charged with sexual assault and attempted rape after allegations by nine women who had worked with him as first minister or for the party. He was acquitted after a trial in March 2020. In 2021 he left the SNP and created a new party called Alba — the Scottish Gaelic word for Scotland — to press for a new independence referendum.	https://apnews.com/article/alex-salmond-body-repatriated-scotland-c0e90b9514424b0825474f650aa1918e	2024-10-18T01:39:51-07:00	
Patriots practice on Winston Churchill's old stomping grounds in London	LONDON (AP) — They’ll toil and sweat but hopefully without the blood and tears. A London game is more than just a typical road trip for NFL teams. It’s a chance to learn about local history, too. In fact, the New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars — who play Sunday at Wembley Stadium — don’t even need to leave their practice facilities to do so. The Patriots trained Friday at the exclusive Harrow School, whose most famous alumnus is Winston Churchill. Farther out in the countryside, the Jaguars have been using a practice field that is nearly on top of a maze of World War II air raid shelters. Harrow consists of 324 acres on a hill overlooking London where Churchill spent his high school years before entering politics and leading Britain through World War II as prime minister. 'If any of the Pats players take a break from practice, they should walk around and see the school grounds because they’re quite grand,' said Lee Pollock, a director and senior adviser to the board of the International Churchill Society. A highlight is the Speech Room, where young Churchill recited 1,200 lines from the poem 'Lays of Ancient Rome' from memory and won a prize for the feat. 'At Harrow, he learned what he called the most noble thing in the world: the construction of a sentence in the English language,' Pollock said. Patriots coach Jerod Mayo noted another big character — a fictional one — from Harrow's more recent history. 'I’m definitely a big history guy and I would also say I just learned that there was a Harry Potter scene shot here as well, which I thought was pretty interesting,' Mayo said. Deatrich Wise Jr., a defensive end, said he already knew Churchill was an alum because 'someone said it on the way in.' Pockets of American politicians have long admired and quoted the cigar-chomping Churchill, and that's spilled over into sports too. San Diego Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh is a big fan. Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker cited Churchill in a social media post about courage, though he's not the first to misattribute a quote to him. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson had a large Churchill portrait in his office at the U.S. embassy when he was ambassador to the United Kingdom under then-President Donald Trump. Outside of his wartime leadership, Churchill’s legacy is more complex. The Jags are close to history, too. To avoid German bombing in WWII, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway bought the Grove estate in Watford and moved its headquarters there. It was called 'Project X.' Air raid shelters were built and are still intact — explorers have posted videos online even though the entrances appear to be at least partially blocked. At one point they were being used as 'bat roosts,' according to historical records. The Grove luxury hotel where the Jags now regularly stay opened in 2003. Several entrances to the shelters are visible in the woods next to the Jags' practice field. Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence, speaking generally about the team's annual London trip, says he's always up for learning more about the region. 'I do enjoy history and learning about things,' he said on Wednesday. 'I don’t know a ton about the area, to be honest. Usually when we’re here it’s pretty busy and we’re kind of focused on the game and trying to win that, but I am intrigued and I think it’s cool just everything here at the Grove but also just in London — it’s so much older than in America. 'The history behind it,' Lawrence continued, 'you pick up bits as you go ... it is interesting hearing different things about it.' ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl	https://apnews.com/article/churchill-patriots-jaguars-ww2-london-740994b3d014a1dcddde9c64333c76b8	2024-10-18T00:34:12-07:00	
Rwanda shrugs off 'sportswashing' criticism in pursuit of a winning development formula	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — He may be the president of a small, landlocked state in central Africa, but Paul Kagame has always had outsize dreams. In recent months, Rwanda’s president has embarked on perhaps the biggest of them all by pitching to bring a Formula 1 Grand Prix to a country that was mired in genocide 30 years ago but now sees itself as one of the continent’s leaders. Determined to overcome his country’s geographical disadvantages, Kagame has relentlessly pursued a political, diplomatic and economic strategy to make Rwanda an African heavyweight. In the past four years, he has sent troops to engage rebels in the Central African Republic and mount counterinsurgency operations in Mozambique. At home he has pursued economic reforms to lure foreign investors, transforming Rwanda into a country with a reputation as one of Africa’s least corrupt and most business friendly, despite Kagame’s own reputation as a democratic laggard. But when it comes to sport, his aspirations extend well beyond Africa. Since 2018, his government has secured sponsorship deals with some of Europe’s biggest soccer clubs, developed a partnership with the NBA and spent hundreds of millions of dollars in developing Rwanda’s sports facilities. Next year Rwanda will stage the world championships for bicycle road racing. Kagame himself has built a close working relationship with Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, which has opened an office in Rwanda and held its annual meeting there last year. Now he is taking the biggest step yet in his ambition to transform the country into a global sporting power, with F1 executives confirming that they are in exploratory talks with Kagame’s government about a possible Rwandan Grand Prix. Experts say that could require billions of dollars in investment and outlay. Given that Gross Domestic Product stands at just $14.1 billion and that there is at yet no track on which to host a race, the idea of a Rwandan Grand Prix might seem far-fetched. Yet with seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton pushing for an African F1 race and given Rwanda’s reputation as one of the continent’s more reliable and transparent states, it is not impossible either. Stefano Domenicali, F1’s chief executive, has described Rwanda’s proposal as 'serious', telling motorsport.com that 'they have presented a good plan.' 'We want to go to Africa, but we need to have the right investment, and the right strategic plan,' he added. The country’s motorsports profile may receive a boost when the FIA’s governing body hosts its annual general assembly and prize giving in Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, in December—the first time the ceremony has been held in Africa. Both the Kagame administration and F1 officials are reluctant to reveal details about what they describe as 'ongoing' discussions, but Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo said hosting an F1 race would allow the country to move 'from being a consumer of sport to a participant in the business of sports.' 'Rwanda’s interest in Formula 1 aligns with our strategy to leverage sports for transformative impact,' she said. 'We seek every opportunity to drive forward Rwanda’s development, including through global sporting partnerships.' Rwanda is not alone in seeking an F1 race, with potential competitors also in Africa. South Africa, which hosted Africa’s last Grand Prix in 1993, and Morocco, which staged 13 races between 1925 and 1958, are also reportedly keen to reenter the fray. That Rwanda is bidding at all reveals much about how Kagame views sport as an economic and geopolitical weapon. If Rwanda can navigate the obvious economic risks, its ambitious sporting strategy could yield big dividends, both financially and diplomatically. The Seoul Olympics in 1988 helped South Korea transform its global image as an insulated, war-ravaged backwater to an emerging economy open to the world. Although no other sub-Saharan country has quite such a comprehensive and ambitious strategy, Rwanda is following the example of countries like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar, which have used sport — including the hosting of Grand Prix races — to boost their reputations abroad. Like them, Rwanda has faced criticism that it is using sport to distract attention from a chequered human rights record. Kagame, who secured 99.2 percent of the vote in July’s presidential election, is accused of using increasingly repressive methods to consolidate his 30-year grip on power. Critics of his ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front have experienced intimidation, arrest and even death. Meanwhile, the United Nations has accused Kagame’s government of stoking, funding and arming a rebellion in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda’s troubled neighbour to the east. The United States cut military aid to Rwanda in protest. Both Rwanda and its international sporting partners have faced accusations that they are using sport to divert attention from Kagame’s rights record, a practice known as 'sportswashing.' In August, two U.S. senators, Republican Marsha Blackburn and Democrat Jeff Merkley, wrote to the NBA accusing it of 'putting profit over principle' by forging close ties with the Rwandan government. Some European lawmakers have raised similar objections to question Rwanda’s sponsorship of soccer clubs Arsenal, Paris Saint Germain and Bayern Munich, a strategy Kagame’s government says will boost tourism. The prospect of a Rwandan F1 race has renewed such criticism. 'The critical question is what kind of due diligence Formula 1 did to ensure it lives up to its own stated human rights commitments and avoid contributing to laundering the Rwandan government’s human rights record,' said Clementine de Montjoye, senior researcher in the Africa division at Human Rights Watch. 'Rwanda’s partners should open their eyes and see Kigali’s wide-reaching human rights abuse for what it is: the consequence of three decades of impunity for the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front.' Rwanda is far from the only country with a contentious rights record that has used sport to shape a different narrative about itself. Saudi Arabia, stung by scrutiny following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, has invested more than $10 billion in sport, including golf, F1 and soccer. Infantino has steered the men's 2034 World Cup hosting rights toward Saudi Arabia. Qatar, which has close commercial links with Rwanda, spent $230 billion on hosting the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Yet Rwanda is a financial minnow in comparison and depends on donor aid to fund 40 percent of government expenditure, leading to questions about the wisdom of seeking to emulate Gulf petrostates. 'The Saudis employed this sort of strategy to get people to forget about awkward things like dismembering journalists,' said Michela Wrong, author of 'Do Not Disturb,' a book critical of Kagame. 'But the difference is Saudi Arabia can afford these deals. Rwanda can’t. Rwanda is a very poor country, heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture and foreign aid, which is pouring millions of dollars into some of the world’s richest clubs. There is something innately distasteful about this.' There is little doubt that Kagame’s sports strategy is an economic gamble. Despite his business-friendly policies, Rwanda’s market has proved too small to lure significant inward investment, something that hosting big-ticket sporting events could go some way to address, particularly if it gains 'first mover advantage' by getting ahead of other African rivals. On the other hand, even richer states have struggled to make event hosting pay. 'Sporting events are incredibly expensive to stage and the net impact is very often negative rather than positive,' says Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy. 'For Rwanda, given its relative economic weakness, this will be a concern.'	https://apnews.com/article/rwanda-f1-sportswashing-kagame-1b4c178adaa2feef3c95bd2d8af0c425	2024-10-18T00:26:12-07:00	
Harris will campaign with the Obamas later this month in Georgia and Michigan	WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris will make her first campaign appearances with Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, two of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party, at get-out-the-vote events this month in Georgia and Michigan. It will be the former first lady's first time hitting the trail for Harris. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, is set to appear with Obama in Georgia on Oct. 24 and with Mrs. Obama in Michigan on Oct. 26, according to a Harris campaign senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss events before they are officially announced. The official did not disclose the cities where Harris will join the Obamas. The former president recently campaigned for Harris in Pittsburgh and has appearances scheduled Friday and Saturday in Arizona and Nevada, respectively, and next week in Wisconsin and Michigan. Early voting opens statewide in Michigan on Oct. 26, and Harris and the former first lady will encourage supporters to cast their ballots as soon as possible, the official said. In Georgia, where early voting opened this past Tuesday, more than 310,000 people voted on the first day, a record. The Obamas endorsed Harris in July and spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August in Chicago. They remain prodigious fundraising draws and popular surrogates at large campaign events for Democratic candidates. It was previously announced that Mrs. Obama will headline a rally in Atlanta on Oct. 29, three days after joining Harris in Michigan. The rally, which will feature celebrities and civic leaders, is being hosted by When We All Vote, a nonpartisan civic engagement organization that the former first lady founded in 2018 to reach out to people who are less likely to become involved in politics and elections. Among the group's celebrity co-chairs are NBA players Stephen Curry and Chris Paul; musical artists Jennifer Lopez and Janelle Monáe; beauty influencer Bretman Rock; and actors Tom Hanks, Selena Gomez, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Kerry Washington. The friendship between Harris and the Obamas goes back 20 years, when the former president and current vice president met during his campaign for the U.S. Senate. She was an early supporter of his 2008 presidential campaign and went door-knocking for him in Iowa before the caucuses.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-barack-michelle-obama-b31b662260f8e22131123a0d32888b56	2024-10-18T00:01:54-07:00	
South Korean intelligence says North has sent troops to aid Russia's war in Ukraine	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's spy agency said Friday that North Korea has dispatched troops to support Russia's war against Ukraine, a development that could bring a third country into the war and intensify a standoff between North Korea and the West. The National Intelligence Service said in a statement that Russian navy ships transferred 1,500 North Korean special operation forces to the Russian port city of Vladivostok from Oct. 8 to Oct. 13. It said more North Korean troops are expected to be sent to Russia soon. The North Korean soldiers deployed in Russia have been given Russian military uniforms, weapons and forged identification documents, the NIS said. It said they are currently staying at military bases in Vladivostok and other Russian sites such as Ussuriysk, Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk, and that they will likely be deployed to battle grounds after completing their adaptation training. The NIS posted on its website satellite and other photos showing what it calls Russian navy ship movements near a North Korean port and suspected North Korean mass gatherings in Ussuriysk and Khabarovsk in the past week. South Korean media, citing the NIS, reported that North Korea has decided to dispatch a total of 12,000 troops formed into four brigades to Russia. The NIS did not immediately confirm the reports. If confirmed, it would be North Korea's first major participation in a foreign war. North Korea has 1.2 million troops, one of the largest militaries in the world, but it lacks actual combat experience. Many experts question how much the North Korean troop dispatch would help Russia, citing North Korea’s outdated equipment and shortage of battle experience. Experts also said that North Korea likely received Russian promises to provide security support over the intense confrontations over its advancing nuclear program with the U.S. and South Korea. During a meeting in Pyongyang in June, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked, in what was considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. South Korea’s presidential office said in a statement that President Yoon Suk Yeol had presided over an emergency meeting earlier Friday to discuss North Korea’s troop dispatch to Russia. The statement said participants of the meeting agreed that North Korea’s troop dispatch poses a grave security threat to South Korea and the international community. But the presidential office gave no further details like when and how many North Korean soldiers have been sent to Ukraine and what roles they are expected to play. Russia has denied using North Korean troops in the war, with Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov describing the claims as 'another piece of fake news' during a news conference last week, according to Russia media. Ukrainian media reported earlier this month that six North Koreans were among those killed after a Ukrainian missile strike in the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region on Oct. 3. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his government has intelligence that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being prepared to join Russian forces fighting against his country, warning that a third nation wading into the hostilities could turn the conflict into a 'world war.' 'From our intelligence we’ve got information that North Korea sent tactical personnel and officers to Ukraine,' Zelenskyy told reporters at NATO headquarters. 'They are preparing on their land 10,000 soldiers, but they didn’t move them already to Ukraine or to Russia.' NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the western alliance 'have no evidence that North Korean soldiers are involved in the fight. But we do know that North Korea is supporting Russia in many ways, weapons supplies, technological supplies, innovation, to support them in the war effort. And that is highly worrying.' The U.S., South Korea and their partners have accused North Korea of supplying Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other equipment to help fuel its war on Ukraine Outside officials and experts say North Korea in exchange possibly received badly needed food and economic aid and technology assistance aimed at upgrading Kim’s nuclear-armed military. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have repeatedly denied the existence of an arms deal between the countries.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-war-troops-south-spy-9cd563c5570f68e9b314976009682810	2024-10-17T23:59:17-07:00	
A baby died and 65 people were rescued when a migrant boat sank during Channel crossing attempt	PARIS (AP) — French maritime authorities said Friday a baby died and 65 people had to be rescued when a migrant boat sank as it attempted to cross the English Channel toward Britain. Late on Thursday, French rescuers noticed the overloaded boat was in trouble and that several people were in the sea. Rescuers used semi-rigid boats to take them out of the water and saved 65 people, France’s maritime authorities said in a statement. As searches were continuing, rescuers found a baby who was unconscious and was later declared dead by a doctor, the statement said. The rescued migrants were brought back to the French port of Boulogne-sur-Mer to be handled by health care services and the border police. A series of shipwrecks has made 2024 the deadliest in recent years on the English Channel. Four migrants, including a 2-year-old child, died earlier this month in two separate incidents in similar crossing attempts. Last month, at least 20 migrants died in several shipwrecks in the Channel. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/migrants-channel-baby-death-france-britain-a4832ceebd01796963d05e75688eb503	2024-10-17T23:56:09-07:00	
Pakistan's Punjab province shuts schools for 2 days to contain protests over alleged on-campus rape	LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Authorities in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province shut all schools and universities for two days on Friday in an attempt to contain the spread of protests by students over an alleged on-campus rape. The closures in Pakistan's most populous province affect an estimated 18 million students. Tensions have been high on college campuses since reports of the alleged rape in the eastern city of Lahore spread on social media, and protests have broken out in four cities. In Gujrat in Punjab province, a security guard died in clashes between student protesters and police on Wednesday. Police arrested a person in connection with the death. The government and police have denied that any rape occurred on a campus of the private Punjab Group of Colleges in Lahore, the capital of Punjab. They are seeking the arrest of nearly three dozen people, including several journalists, saying they spread misinformation on social media that led to the protests. Students, however, announced they would hold a rally later Friday to demand justice for the alleged victim in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. The decision to shut all schools in Punjab came a day after hundreds of students ransacked a college building in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. Police fired tear gas and charged at the students, arresting more than 250 people. The protests appear to have begun spontaneously, as student unions have been banned in Pakistan since 1984. There are no organizations representing students, although political parties' youth wings exist. Separately, hundreds of supporters from the political party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan defied the ban on rallies and protested in Karachi and the northwestern city of Peshawar on Friday to oppose any amendments to the country's Constitution. Police swung batons and fired tear gas in Karachi to disperse the demonstrators. Khan's supporters could not hold any significant protests anywhere else due to the deployment of heavy police. Khan’s supporters say Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who replaced Khan after his ouster in 2022 in a no-confidence vote in parliament, wants to appoint judges of his own choosing and set up a new constitutional court in parallel with the Supreme Court. The government denies the allegations. Sexual violence against women is common in Pakistan but is underreported because of stigma in the conservative country. Protests about the issue have been rare. ___ Associated Press writers Asim Tanveer in Multan, Pakistan, and Riaz Khan in Peshawar, Pakistan, contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-punjab-bans-rallies-shut-schools-rape-41b44e196bf654e8f749d8c25ed41a02	2024-10-17T22:38:19-07:00	
Middle East latest: Hezbollah says its war with Israel is 'entering a new phase'	Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group said Friday it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, as the region continued to reckon with Israel's claim that top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been killed in a battle with Israeli forces in Gaza the previous day. Hamas has still not responded to the Israeli announcement, but its ally Iran released a statement commemorating the Palestinian militant leader via its mission to the United Nations. Sinwar was a chief architect of the attack on southern Israel that precipitated the latest escalating conflicts in the Middle East. Many, from the governments of Israeli allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar's death would pave the way for an end to the war, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing that 'Our war is not yet ended.' On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Here's the latest: Hezbollah says its war with Israel is entering ‘new phase’ BEIRUT — Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group says it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, adding that it has introduced new weapons over the past days. A statement from the group’s operations room early Friday said that Hezbollah’s fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones for the first time. The statement appears to refer to a drone laden with explosives that evaded Israel’s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced earlier this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The statement also said that Hezbollah’s air defense units shot down this week two Israeli Hermes 450 drones. Hezbollah said its fighters are working according to 'plans prepared in advance' to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. Iran commemorates Hamas leader whom Israel says it killed UNITED NATIONS — Iran’s Mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, after Israel said Thursday he had been killed in fighting: 'When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed. However when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield — in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy — the spirit of resistance will be strengthened. He will become a model for the youth and children who will carry forth his path for the liberation of Palestine. As long as occupation and aggression exist, resistance will endure, for the martyr remains alive and a source of inspiration.' Iran and Iraq fought a brutal war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. It killed more than 1 million people on both sides.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-18-october-2024-45c743c656cb85410a2d2b2fc84d6934	2024-10-17T21:59:12-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares gain as China releases plan for market support	BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares have mostly gained after China’s central bank released plans for supporting the stock market through share repurchases by companies and major shareholders. Beijing also reported that the Chinese economy slowed further in the last quarter, which spurred expectations the government will ramp up its latest stimulus efforts. The world's second-largest economy expanded at a 4.6% annual pace in July-September, down slightly from 4.7% in the previous quarter. Growth so far this year has averaged to 4.8%, below the official target of about 5%, as weakness in the property market has continued to weigh on demand. Meanwhile, the central bank issued guidelines for state banks to provide loans to companies and major shareholders for stock repurchases as part of an effort to stabilize China’s share markets, which have languished in recent years. The loans, which can be made only by 21 designated financial institutions, will have a maximum interest rate of 2.25%, the People’s Bank of China said in a statement that underscored plans for strict oversight of the effort to support the markets. The news helped drive a rally in Shanghai, where the Composite index was up 2.1% at 3,232.14. The benchmark for the smaller market in the southern city of Shenzhen jumped 3.2%. Shanghai’s benchmark has gained 9% in the past three months, though it had surged much higher last month with the release of new measures to counter the slowdown, before falling back as investors registered their disappointment over a lack of big government spending initiatives. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 2.2% to 20,519.78. Also Friday, China’s large state-run banks cut their deposit rates, to 0.1% from 0.15% for demand deposits and to 1.1% from 1.35% for longer term deposits. Elsewhere in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged 0.2% higher to 38,798.48 and the Kospi in Seoul shed 0.6% to 2,594.40. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gave up 0.9% to 8,283.20. The Taiex in Taiwan gained 1.9% and the SET in Bangkok was up 0.2%. India's Sensex slipped 0.2%. On Thursday, U.S. stocks drifted around their record heights Thursday following the latest signals that the U.S. economy continues to hum. The S&amp;P 500 finished virtually unchanged at 5,841.47 after flirting with its all-time high for much of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4% to 43,239.05, besting its own record set the day before. The Nasdaq composite added less than 0.1% to 18,373.61. Nvidia and other companies in the chip industry were some of the market’s strongest after global heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. But a 1.4% slide for Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and a 10.6% tumble for Elevance Health helped keep stock indexes in check. Elevance reported weaker profit for the latest quarter than expected. CSX fell 6.7% after falling short of analysts’ profit expectations for the latest quarter. The railroad also expects only modest volume growth the rest of the year as the Southeast rebuilds after two major hurricanes. In the bond market, Treasury yields rose following the latest encouraging reports on the U.S. economy. U.S. retailers made more in sales in September than in August, and underlying growth trends within the data were better than economists expected. A separate report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, a signal that layoffs nationwide are relatively low and aren’t damaging the job market. Such data bolster the hope that the economy could make a perfect escape from the worst inflation in generations, one that ends without a recession that many investors had seen as nearly inevitable. And with the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to keep the economy humming, the expectation among optimists is that stocks can rise even further. Critics, meanwhile, are warning that stock prices look too expensive given how much faster they’ve climbed than corporate profits. The European Central Bank on Thursday cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. That helped send stock indexes higher by 1.2% in France and 0.8% in Germany. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 25 cents to $70.92 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was 20 cents higher at $74.65 per barrel. The dollar fell to 149.85 Japanese yen from 150.21 yen. The euro rose to $1.0843 from $1.0827. ___ AP Business Writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-rates-cbcdd41e7ecc8cee33e9cd0e7ad0a612	2024-10-17T21:00:45-07:00	
UK Foreign Secretary Lammy says engagement with China is necessary at start of 2-day visit	BEIJING (AP) — Britain's foreign secretary has called engagement with China 'pragmatic and necessary' as he makes he makes the first visit by a Cabinet minister since the Labor government took control in July. David Lammy met Friday with Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang and was to hold talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi later the same day. His two-day trip is an attempt to reset ties with Beijing after relations turned frosty in recent years over spying allegations, China’s support for Russia in the Ukraine war and a crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, a former British colony now part of China. 'From stopping Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, to supporting a global green transition, we must speak often and candidly across both areas of contention as well as areas for cooperation in the U.K.’s national interest,' Lammy was quoted as saying in a Foreign Office news release. The release said that Lammy would urge China to stop its political and economic support of the Russian war effort. The U.S. sanctioned two Chinese companies on Thursday for allegedly helping Russia build long-range attack drones used in the war in Ukraine. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said the allegations were false. Lammy will also visit Shanghai, where he will meet with British business leaders, the Foreign Office release said. China including Hong Kong is the U.K.’s fourth largest trading partner. Human rights groups demanded that Lammy press the Chinese government over its crackdowns on dissent in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet. The spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that securing the release of British citizen Jimmy Lai is a priority. The Hong Kong media publisher has been in custoday since December 2020 and will testify next month in his defense at a landmark national security trial.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-china-foreign-secretary-lammy-visit-b6f7da40b721b069e7469fc7cf55eb6b	2024-10-17T19:54:34-07:00	
As Biden meets with European allies, the possibility of another Trump term hangs over their talks	BERLIN (AP) — Even in Germany, it's hard for President Joe Biden to escape the topic of Donald Trump. The U.S. president meets Friday with European allies for closed-door conversations about Russia's war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. But with the U.S. presidential election just weeks away and the race extremely tight, there are worries that a Trump victory could upset the relationships that Biden is hoping to pass on to Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. Trump, the Republican nominee, has an appetite for tariffing key U.S. security partners. He's expressed indifference to the security of Ukraine, refusing to say during a presidential debate if he wants the U.S. ally to win its war against Russia. He's voiced doubts about coming to the defense of NATO members if they come under attack. Speaking aboard Air Force One on the way to Berlin, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan rejected the notion that Biden wants to 'Trump-proof' U.S. foreign policy, because of the political implications of that term. But Sullivan's stated goals seem designed to thwart efforts by a potential Trump administration to stop military aid to Ukraine after more than two years of fighting. 'What the president is trying to do is to make our commitment to Ukraine sustainable and institutionalized for the long term,' Sullivan said. 'And every other ally agreed that that was the responsible thing to do.' But Sullivan cautioned that Biden ultimately can only speak for himself, not what his potential successor might do. 'What President Biden can do is what he’s done for four years, which is lay out his vision of America’s place in the world and point the way forward based on what he thinks are in America’s national security interests and in the interests of our close allies,' Sullivan said. 'Beyond that, he can’t speak for anyone else and doesn’t intend to.' Trump has said his approach will help the U.S. economy and prevent foreign countries from taking advantage of the United States. He maintains that if he were still president, Russia would never have invaded Ukraine in 2022 and Hamas would never have attacked Israel in 2023. 'I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III,' he said at a recent rally in Georgia. 'I can do that.' At home, the president has verbally tussled with Trump over falsehoods tied to the government's relief efforts after hurricanes Helene and Milton, with Biden saying the willingness of Trump and his allies to spread misinformation was 'un-American.' Harris, for her part, has voiced strong backing for Ukraine and tracks with Biden on support for Israel, while placing particular emphasis on the need to relieve the suffering of Palestinian civilians whose lives have been upended by the Hamas war. Biden has long said that his message to foreign leaders is that 'America is back' and engaged with allies after Trump's time in office. But the U.S. president recalled being met with skepticism: 'The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say, ‘We see America is back but for how long? But for how long?’' Biden did not want his term to end without visiting the German capital of Berlin, after having been to visit other key allies such as Japan, South Korea, France, India, the United Kingdom, Poland and Ukraine. He will start his Friday by going to Bellevue Palace and meeting with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Biden is then slated to receive Germany's Order of Merit, an honor that was also bestowed on former U.S. President George H.W. Bush for his support of German reunification. Biden will then meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the head of Germany's government. Biden and Scholz will later meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer before the U.S. president jets home late Friday afternoon. Biden and Scholz plan to discuss next steps in Ukraine and developments in Israel and Gaza after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. They also intend to touch on Lebanon and Iran, and coordinate their approaches to China as well as their respective industrial and innovation strategies. The pair are also set to talk about the development of artificial intelligence and renewable energy resources. While Biden wants to use the trip to emphasize the importance of democratic values, he has no plans to hold a news conference to answer questions from reporters. Sullivan pushed back against the idea that a news conference would reflect democratic values after reporters raised the subject with him aboard Air Force One. 'I mean, honestly, I think invoking democracy and suggesting that President Biden is somehow insufficiently committed to it because of the structure of his press engagement on one day in Germany is a bit ludicrous,' Sullivan said.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-germany-ukraine-trump-harris-047d46d4ef80804ebee515ee5d2d449c	2024-10-17T19:26:45-07:00	
Right-wing influencers hyped anti-Ukraine videos made by a TV producer also funded by Russian media	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Kremlin could not have asked for better publicity at a better time when Ben Swann, a self-described independent journalist who promotes conspiracy theories, released a 12-part video series he promised would reveal dark truths about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Swann’s flashy documentary-style videos were filled with innuendo, attacks on Zelenskyy’s character and commentary from guests sympathetic to Russia in its two-year war with Ukraine. The series, titled 'Zelenskyy Unmasked,' launched in April as Congress was debating increasing military assistance to Ukraine, and it quickly caught the attention of conservative social media influencers who hyped the project to their millions of followers. Among those who promoted the series was Donald Trump Jr., the former president’s eldest son. 'Curious about the billions of dollars and weapons Congress sent Ukraine?' Trump Jr. posted on X, Truth Social and Threads. 'You need to watch the first episode of the explosive 12-part series.' Unlike other conservative media personalities who last month expressed shock upon learning they may have been secretly financed by the Kremlin, Swann has no such qualms. He's worked for Russia’s state-owned media empire for years, with one of his companies earning millions of dollars for producing Kremlin-friendly shows. The creation of 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' and its viral spread reveal how widely Russia-backed talking points are traveling on social media — a trend that concerns current and former U.S. intelligence officials and disinformation experts. An investigation by The Associated Press also provides insights into the shadowy and profitable world of political influencers who are not required to disclose who is paying them, raising transparency concerns about their political endorsements in the largely unregulated realm of social media. Swann brought on a digital marketing firm to publicize 'Zelenskyy Unmasked,' and at least one creator acknowledged he was paid to promote the series. Dire warnings about Russian interference in U.S. politics The revelations about Swann’s work for Russia come as U.S. authorities have issued increasingly dire warnings about the threat posed by Russian disinformation campaigns. In addition to undermining Ukraine, the Kremlin is seeking to disrupt the presidential election and sow discord in the U.S. and elsewhere in the West, those officials have said. U.S. officials are particularly concerned about Russia’s covert efforts to take advantage of unwitting Americans to spread Moscow’s message and use artificial intelligence to quickly tailor false content. Russia’s influence operation also appears aimed at boosting support for GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has criticized Ukraine and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, the officials said. Trump has dismissed evidence of Russian influence operations, and he and many of his supporters have mocked the broader U.S. government effort to highlight Kremlin propaganda efforts. Registered agent Swann filed paperwork with the Justice Department two years ago to register one of his companies as working for Russian state media. In an interview with the AP, Swann said he has kept his work for Russian interests separate from what he produces for U.S. audiences. He has done this, Swann said, by operating two companies — one that generates content for Russian media and another that produces independent journalism, like 'Zelenskyy Unmasked,' for U.S. audiences. 'The only connection is that I own both companies,' Swann said. The AP, however, found that there was some overlap in how the two entities operated. A handful of guests on 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' also appeared on RT shows produced by Swann, according to a review of RT’s video archives and records filed with the Justice Department. Swann’s shows for U.S. audiences and RT also have similar themes. The Zelenskyy series, for example, echoed Russian state media’s messaging that the Ukrainian president is a would-be autocrat who has duped the West into supporting a conflict that Russia will inevitably win. From TV anchor to working for Russian state media Swann, 46, was a longtime TV journalist before he was fired from an Atlanta station in 2018 after promoting the debunked 'Pizzagate' conspiracy that alleged Democrats were abducting children to serve as sex slaves. He has since became a social media star who portrays himself as someone daring to ask uncomfortable questions on tough topics — revolving around unfounded claims such as whether the Sandy Hook school shooter acted alone, the coronavirus vaccine was a money-making ploy by big pharmaceutical companies, and Israel was a 'participant' in the massacre of Oct. 7, 2023. Swann joined Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccine organization, Children’s Health Defense, in a lawsuit pending against several news organizations, including the AP, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Swann said he worked as a correspondent for RT America, a cable channel that was part of a Russian state media outlet, until it went off the air following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. RT officials then asked if he wanted to produce shows for the network to air outside the U.S., Swann said. 'I said, ‘Well, I can’t produce shows for the United States, but if these shows are for overseas, I’ll help you produce them.’ So I started doing that for them, and we’ve been doing that ever since,' Swann said in a July interview. Producing shows at RT's old U.S. studios Swann said he produced 10 shows a week using RT America’s old studios in Washington, and he stressed that those shows don’t air in the U.S. or Western Europe, although they are visible across the globe on RT’s website. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, individuals must register with the Justice Department when they seek to influence U.S. policy and public opinion on behalf of foreign governments. Not doing so can result in criminal charges. Swann’s company, Rebel Media Productions, first registered with the Justice Department in August 2022, saying it worked for RT’s parent company and related entities. The disclosures show Rebel Media Productions was paid more than $6 million in less than two years by RT-related entities. RT, formerly known as Russia Today, is a major player in Russia’s sprawling propaganda apparatus, and a target of U.S. efforts to block Moscow’s covert influence. The Justice Department has said RT has links to Russian intelligence agencies, while the U.S. State Department recently unveiled new sanctions on Russian state media. The sanctions target RT’s parent organization, TV Novosti, which Swann contracted with for his Russia-related work. Stopped reporting work for Russia to Justice Department In February, Swann stopped reporting Rebel Media’s work for Russia to the Justice Department, even as his company kept producing RT shows. Swann said he ended that registration with the Justice Department because his attorneys told him it wasn’t necessary, despite his company’s continued work for RT. 'They said, ‘Why are you making things more difficult for yourself?’' Swann said. In response to the recent sanctions, Swann said his company last month severed all ties to RT. 'While we disagree with the censorship of our journalists, who were doing quality work on behalf of our client, we have and will continue to respect the rule of law,' Swann said in a statement. The Justice Department declined to comment. U.S. content funded by wealthy individuals Swann said he creates content — like the 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' series — for American viewers through another company, Truth in Media. Truth in Media, Swann said, isn’t profitable and is funded by wealthy U.S. individuals whom he refused to name. 'Most of them own very large companies,' he said, 'if not publicly traded companies.' Swann said the large payouts he received from Russian state media had not influenced his work on 'Zelenskyy Unmasked,' but he acknowledged Russia’s leaders probably liked the series’ tough take on Ukraine’s president. 'I don’t know, I assume they don’t like Zelenskyy,' Swann said. Many of the guests interviewed in 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' have been RT contributors and guests on its programs. That includes RT contributor Tara Reade, who briefly moved to Moscow after accusing President Joe Biden of assaulting her in the 1990s; former Ukrainian diplomat Andrii Telizhenko, who was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury on allegations he had close ties to a 'Russia-linked foreign influence network'; and Russell Bentley, an American citizen known to have fought with Kremlin-backed separatists and worked for Russian state media, who died earlier this year in Ukraine. Another guest who has appeared on RT shows and in the Zelenskyy videos is Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector sympathetic to Russia whose upstate New York home was raided in August by the FBI. Ritter told the AP that FBI agents in their questioning made clear that they were investigating his Russia-related work but did not ask specifically about his work with Swann. Ritter provided the AP with a copy of an email he said was from a booking producer for Swann’s RT shows asking him to appear in the Zelenskyy series. Ritter said an email invitation he received to participate in 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' indicated that its executive producer was Sean Stone, who hosted an RT show and is the son of the filmmaker Oliver Stone. Sean Stone did not respond to requests for comment, and Swann did not respond to a question about Stone’s involvement on the series. Swann said his RT-linked company had passed along guest contact details to his business producing 'Zelenskyy Unmasked.' The two entities did not share staff, he said. An ‘explosive’ series Truth in Media began teasing the 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' videos earlier this year on its website, writing the 'explosive' 12-part series would answer 'who is really benefitting from the $100 billion the U.S. has sent Ukraine.' At that time, hard-right congressional Republicans were fighting a proposal to send more money and weapons to Ukraine. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Turner and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, both Republicans, said some GOP lawmakers had been heavily influenced by Russian talking points. Turner said on CNN that some of those talking points were being 'uttered on the House floor.' To promote 'Zelenskyy Unmasked,' Swann said he paid for advertising on social media but believes the series received its most substantial boost in viewership thanks to promotion from conservative influencers. Swann's videos that were embedded in X posts garnered tens of millions of views. 'When you have different influencers that you can send it directly to, who can watch it for themselves, decide if they like it, and then share it, that’s a pretty powerful tool,' Swann said. 'That’s more powerful than the actual marketing of it on Meta or X.' With the assistance of the tech firm Bright Data, the AP identified a core group of influencers who played a significant role in helping promote the series. Posts by those influencers were shared by at least 9,300 other unique X accounts that have 33 million total followers, according to an AP analysis of 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' X data created by Syracuse University’s Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship. Influencers use nearly identical language to promote series The spread of 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' highlighted how such influencers are playing increasingly pivotal roles in politics, and many have become de facto campaign surrogates for Democratic and Republican candidates. Trump told a core group of conservative content creators — who met in a 'war room' during the last presidential debate — that they 'are more important than I am.' Some of those same influencers promoted the series, using identical or similar language to what Swann or Truth in Media promoted online. Chaya Raichik, the founder of the far-right Libs of TikTok social media accounts, echoed Truth in Media’s promotion of the series, tweeting: 'Where did $100 billion of our tax dollars that Congress sent to Ukraine go? Watch ‘Zelensky Unmasked’ to find out!' Raichik did not respond to requests for comment. When Truth In Media promoted the third episode in the series, it tweeted, 'The list of rich and powerful people profiting off the war in Ukraine includes President Biden and his son, but they’re far from the only ones.' A few days later, C.J. Pearson, co-chair of the Republican National Committee’s Youth Advisory Council, wrote the exact same thing in a tweet about 'Zelenskyy Unmasked.' Others who touted the series were former Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis; Morgonn McMichael, a young creator linked to the right-leaning group Talking Points USA; and Andrew Giuliani, a former New York gubernatorial hopeful and the son of Trump confidant Rudy Giuliani. Ellis, McMichael and Giuliani did not respond to requests for comment from the AP. Conservative influencer Xaviaer DuRousseau, another member of the RNC's Youth Advisory Council, said he was paid to promote 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' on X through Urban Legend, an influencer marketing firm led by a former Trump administration staffer. DuRousseau did not disclose how much he was paid, said he was unaware of Swann’s work for Russian state media until interviewed by the AP and said he would carefully consider any future collaborations. 'Is there maybe an ulterior motive to you being against Ukraine? Potentially,' he said. 'But I would stress myself out so much if I researched every single person in this industry that thoroughly, to be honest.' Swann said Truth in Media hired Urban Legend to help with marketing, but didn’t know the details of its work. 'We didn’t know whether or not they were talking to influencers,' Swann said in a statement. Urban Legend declined to discuss its financial relationships with specific influencers. The company said in a statement that it had been unaware of Swann’s ties to RT and would no longer work with Truth in Media. Among Swann’s most influential promoters was the former president’s son, Trump Jr., who did not respond to requests for comment from the AP. In a tweet on April 5, Trump Jr. hailed the series as 'explosive' for exposing 'the truth behind the war in Ukraine!' The social media platform’s users added a community note to his tweet that noted Swann's ties to Russia and said his claims 'are likely to be disinformation.' The warning did not seem to deter Trump Jr. A few days later, he again took to X to praise Swann's work — in identical language. ___ Associated Press data journalist Aaron Kessler in Washington contributed to this report. —- Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/	https://apnews.com/article/social-media-influencers-ben-swann-russia-trump-jr-ukraine-zelenskyy-9d4281756246b94eda05c478f3dac203	2024-10-17T19:11:34-07:00	
Russia flaunts its many doomsday weapons to keep the West from ramping up support for Ukraine	This year has seen President Vladimir Putin repeatedly brandish the nuclear sword, reminding everyone that Russia has the world’s largest atomic arsenal to try to deter the West from ramping up support for Ukraine. He ordered his military to hold drills involving battlefield nuclear weapons with ally Belarus. He announced Russia will start producing ground-based intermediate range missiles that were outlawed by a now-defunct U.S.-Soviet treaty in 1987. And last month, he lowered the threshold for unleashing his arsenal by revising the country’s nuclear doctrine. Putin is relying on those thousands of warheads and hundreds of missiles as an enormous doomsday machine to offset NATO's massive edge in conventional weapons to discourage what he sees as threats to Russia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. A look at Russia's atomic arsenal and the issues surrounding it: Russia's strategic weapons The Federation of American Scientists estimated this year that Russia has an inventory totaling 5,580 deployed and non-deployed nuclear warheads, while the U.S. has 5,044. Together, that’s about 88% of the world’s nuclear weapons. Most of these are strategic, or intercontinental-range weapons. Like the U.S., Russia has a nuclear triad of ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, long-range bombers and ICBM-armed submarines. Since Putin came to power in 2000, the Kremlin has worked to upgrade the Soviet-built components of the triad, deploying hundreds of new land-based missiles, commissioning new nuclear submarines and modernizing nuclear-capable bombers. Russia's effort to revamp its nuclear forces has helped prompt the U.S. to launch a costly modernization of its arsenal. Russia has reequipped its land-based strategic missile forces with mobile Yars ICBMs and recently began deploying the heavy, silo-based Sarmat ICBMs — designated 'Satan II' missiles in the West — to gradually replace about 40 Soviet-built R-36M missiles. Sarmat has had only one known successful test, and reportedly suffered a massive explosion during an abortive test last month. The navy commissioned seven new Borei-class atomic-powered submarines, each with 16 Bulava nuclear-tipped missiles, and plans to build five more. They are intended to form the core of the triad’s naval component alongside a few Soviet-era nuclear subs still operating. Russia still relies on Soviet-built Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. Moscow has restarted production of the supersonic Tu-160 that was halted after the 1991 Soviet collapse, aiming to build several dozen modernized aircraft with new engines and avionics. Russia's non-strategic nuclear weapons The U.S. estimates that Russia has between 1,000 and 2,000 non-strategic, or tactical, nuclear weapons intended for use on the battlefield that typically are far less powerful than the strategic warheads capable of destroying entire cities. Russia has high-precision ground-launched Iskander missiles with a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles), which can be fitted with either a conventional or a nuclear warhead. The air force has a fleet of MiG-31 fighter jets that carry a hypersonic Kinzhal missile, which can be equipped with a nuclear or conventional warhead. Russia has widely used conventional versions of both Iskander and Kinzhal against Ukraine. As part of the Kremlin’s nuclear messaging, Russia and ally Belarus held drills to train their troops with the battlefield nuclear weapons in May, shortly after Putin began his fifth term. MAD and Russia’s nuclear doctrine Moscow and Washington have relied for decades on nuclear deterrence under the concept of mutually assured destruction — MAD for short — based on the assumption that an overwhelming retaliation would discourage either side from launching an attack. Russia’s nuclear doctrine adopted in 2020 envisaged using such ultimate weapons in response to a nuclear strike or an attack with conventional weapons that threatens 'the very existence of the Russian state.' Moscow hawks criticized that document as too vague, urging Putin to toughen it. Last month, he warned the U.S. and NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons for strikes deep inside Russia would put NATO at war with his country. He reinforced the message by announcing a new version of the nuclear doctrine that considers a conventional attack on Russia by a nonnuclear nation that is supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack on his country — a clear warning to the U.S. and other allies of Kyiv. Putin also declared the revised document envisages possible nuclear weapons use in case of a massive air attack, holding the door open to a potential nuclear response to any aerial assault — an ambiguity intended to deter the West. Changes in the doctrine suggest Russia 'is doubling down on its strategy of relying on nuclear weapons for coercive purposes' in the war in Ukraine, said Heather Williams, director of the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a commentary. The future for arms control The 2010 New START U.S.-Russian arms reduction treaty, the last remaining arms control pact between Moscow and Washington that expires in 2026, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. In February 2023, Putin suspended Russia’s participation in New START, but vowed that Russia would abide by its limits. In July, Putin declared Russia will launch production of ground-based intermediate range missiles that were banned under the now-defunct U.S. Soviet INF Treaty. The 1987 pact banned missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,410 miles). He said Moscow will respond in kind to the planned deployment of U.S. intermediate-range missiles to Germany, taking steps to 'mirror' Washington’s move. Even as U.S.-Russian tensions soared to their highest point since the Cold War amid fighting in Ukraine, Washington has urged Moscow to resume dialogue on nuclear arms control. Putin rejected the offer, saying such negotiations are meaningless while the U.S. is openly seeking to inflict a strategic defeat to Russia in Ukraine. Resuming nuclear testing Russian hawks are calling for a resumption of nuclear tests to demonstrate Moscow’s readiness to use its atomic arsenal and force the West to limit aid for Kyiv. Putin said Russia could resume testing if the U.S. does so first, a move that would end a global ban in place after the demise of the USSR. Last month, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the nuclear test range on the Arctic archipelago of Novaya Zemlya is ready to resume tests if the U.S. does so. Prospective new weapons In 2018, Putin revealed an array of new weapons, claiming they would render any prospective U.S. missile defenses useless. They include the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, capable of flying 27 times faster than the speed of sound and making sharp maneuvers to dodge an enemy’s missile shield. The first such units have already entered service. Putin also mentioned the nuclear-armed and atomic-powered Poseidon underwater drone, designed to explode near coastlines and cause a radioactive tsunami. Earlier this year, he said Poseidon tests are nearing completion, without giving details. Also under development is an atomic-powered cruise missile, a concept that dates to the Cold War. But the missile, called the Burevestnik, or Petrel, has raised skepticism among experts, who cite technological obstacles and radiation safety concerns. During tests in 2019, an explosion at a naval range on the White Sea reportedly involving the Burevestnik killed five engineers and two servicemen, and caused a brief spike in radiation. Putin said this year its development was in the final stages and the military has reportedly built a base for the missiles in the Vologda region of northwestern Russia. —- The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation.

An American was reportedly kidnapped from a southern Philippine town and a search is underway	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine police said Friday it has launched a search after gunmen reportedly abducted an American national, who was shot in the leg as he tried to resist before being spirited away from a southern Philippine coastal town by speedboat. If confirmed to be a case of kidnapping for ransom, it would be the latest reminder of the long-running security problems that have hounded the southern Philippines, the homeland of a Muslim minority in the largely Roman Catholic nation. Police in Sibuco town in the southern province of Zamboanga del Norte tried to pursue the suspected abductors and their victim, who they identified as Elliot Onil Eastman, 26, from Vermont, after the reported abduction on Thursday night. 'We confirm that there was a report of the alleged abduction of an American national,' the regional police said in a statement. 'We want to assure the public, particularly the community of Sibuco, that we are doing everything in our power to secure the safe recovery of the victim.' The police asked the public to immediately provide any information that could help an ongoing investigation of the reported abduction. Two police reports seen by The Associated Press said that a resident of Sibuco, Abdulmali Hamsiran Jala, reported to police that four men in black clothing who were armed with M16 rifles and introduced themselves as police officers forcibly took Eastman, who tried to escape. One of the gunmen shot Eastman in the leg before dragging him into a speedboat then fled by sea further south toward the provinces of Basilan or Sulu, the police reports said. Policemen chased but failed to find the gunmen and Eastman and alerted other police and Philippine marine units in the region, according to the reports. Philippine authorities did not immediately provide background details of Eastman, but a person with a similar name has posted pictures and videos of himself on Facebook saying he had married a Muslim woman in Sibuco. The U.S. Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to questions about the reported abduction. The southern Philippines has bountiful resources but has long been hamstrung by stark poverty and an array of insurgents and outlaws. A 2014 peace agreement between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest of several Muslim separatist groups, has considerably eased widespread fighting in the south. Relentless military offensives have weakened smaller armed groups like the notoriously violent Abu Sayyaf group over the years, considerably reducing kidnappings, bombings and other attacks. The Abu Sayyaf group, which is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and the Philippines, is an offshoot of decades-long Muslim separatist unrest in the south and carried out mass kidnappings for ransom, beheadings and bombings more than two decades ago in the southern region. They targeted American and other Western tourists and religious missionaries, most of whom were freed after ransoms were paid. A few were killed, including an American who was beheaded on the island province of Basilan and a U.S. missionary who was killed while Philippine army forces were trying to rescue him and his wife in 2002 in a rainforest in Sirawai town near Sibuco. The Philippines will hold mid-term elections next year for more than 18,000 local, national and congressional posts, mostly provincial mayors and governors. In the traditionally volatile south, crimes including kidnappings and extortion have traditionally spiked as rogue politicians try to raise funds to fuel their campaigns ahead of elections in the past but only a few and isolated incidents have been reported in recent years, according to authorities.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-reported-abduction-american-sibuco-a7708d6483d43616df8cbddf65aed84e	2024-10-17T19:02:39-07:00	
Who is Prabowo Subianto, the former general who becomes Indonesia’s new president?	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A wealthy ex-general with ties to both Indonesia’s popular outgoing president and the country's dictatorial past will be inaugurated as its leader Sunday. He has promised to continue his predecessor's widely popular policies, but his human rights record has activists, and some analysts, concerned about the future of Indonesia’s democracy. At the election in February, Prabowo Subianto, 73, presented himself as heir to the immensely popular President Joko Widodo, the first Indonesian president to emerge from outside the political and military elite. Subianto, who was then defense minister, vowed to continue the modernization agenda that has brought rapid growth and vaulted Indonesia into the ranks of middle-income countries. In a speech last month, Subianto, who’s also the chair of the Gerindra Party, reminded party members to always remain loyal to the nation, not to him. He also vowed his unwavering commitment to defend the people, even at the cost of his life. 'Once you smell I’m on the wrong path, please leave me,' Subianto said, 'My life, my oath … I want to die for the truth, I want to die defending my people, I want to die defending the poor, I want to die defending the honor of the Indonesian nation. I have no doubt.' But Subianto will enter office with unresolved questions about the costs of rapid growth for the environment and traditional communities, as well as his own links to torture, disappearances and other human rights abuses in the final years of the brutal Suharto dictatorship, which he served as a lieutenant general. Other than promising continuity, Subianto has laid out few concrete plans, leaving observers uncertain about what his election will mean for the country’s economy and its still-maturing democracy. A former rival of Widodo who lost two presidential races to him, Subianto embraced the popular leader to run as his heir, even choosing Widodo’s son as his running mate, a decision that ran up against constitutional age limits and has activists worried about an emerging political dynasty in the 25-year-old democracy. But for now, he appears to enjoy widespread support. He secured a majority in the election on Feb. 14, winning 59%, or more than 96 million votes in a three-way race, more than enough for victory without a runoff. Subianto was born in 1951 to one of Indonesia’s most powerful families, the third of four children. His father, Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, was an influential politician, and a minister under Presidents Sukarno and Suharto. Subianto’s father first worked for Sukarno, the leader of Indonesia’s quest for independence from the Dutch, as well as the first president. But Djojohadikusumo later turned against the leader and was forced into exile. Subianto spent most of his childhood overseas and speaks French, German, English and Dutch. The family returned to Indonesia after General Suharto came to power in 1967 following a failed left-wing coup. Suharto dealt brutally with dissenters and was accused of stealing billions of dollars of state funds for himself, family and close associates. Suharto dismissed the allegations even after leaving office in 1998. Subianto enrolled in Indonesia’s Military Academy in 1970, graduating in 1974 and serving in the military for nearly three decades. In 1976, Subianto joined the Indonesian National Army Special Force, called Kopassus, and was commander of a group that operated in what is now East Timor. Human rights groups have claimed that Subianto was involved in a series of human rights violations in East Timor in the 1980s and 1990s, when Indonesia occupied the now-independent nation. Subianto has denied those allegations. Subianto and other members of Kopassus were banned from traveling to the U.S. over the alleged human rights abuses they committed against the people of East Timor. The ban remained in place until 2020, when it was effectively lifted, enabling him to visit the U.S. as Indonesia’s defense minister. In 1983, he married Suharto’s daughter, Siti Hediati Hariyadi. Following further allegations of human rights abuses, Subianto was forced out of the military. He was dishonorably discharged in 1998, after Kopassus soldiers kidnapped and tortured political opponents of Suharto. Of 22 activists kidnapped that year, 13 remain missing. Several of his men were tried and convicted, but Subianto never faced trial. He never commented on these accusations but went into self-imposed exile in Jordan in 1998. A number of former democracy activists have joined his campaign, including Agus Jabo and Budiman Sudjatmiko, who in 1998 were listed as survivors of the abductions of democracy activists. Sudjatmiko left the governing Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle to join Subianto's campaign team. During a campaign event in January, he apologized publicly to the two former activists. 'I'm sorry ... I was chasing you in the past,' Subianto said, adding that he did so 'on the orders' of his superiors. Sudjatmiko said that reconciliation is necessary to move forward, and that international focus on Subianto’s human rights record was overblown. 'Developed countries don’t like leaders from developing countries who are brave, firm and strategic,' he said. Subianto returned from Jordan in 2008, and helped to found the Gerinda Party. He ran for the presidency twice, losing to Widodo both times. He refused to acknowledge the results at first, but accepted Widodo’s offer of the defense minister position in 2019, in a bid for unity. Adhi Priamarizki, a researcher at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said that while many right activists have pointed out Subianto's checkered past, 'there are a lot of factors that actually can affect how he can or he will govern the country.' 'I would say that there’s going to be a good check and balance system, hopefully, fingers crossed,' Priamarizki said, 'But the most important thing is to ensure that civil society has space in order to provide or to be at the check and balance systems.' In the most recent election, Subianto respected the democratic process. He has vowed to continue Widodo’s economic development plans, which capitalized on Indonesia’s abundant nickel, coal, oil and gas reserves, leading Southeast Asia’s biggest economy through a decade of rapid growth and modernization that vastly expanded its networks of roads and railways. That includes includes the $30 billion project to build a new capitol city called Nusantara. A report by a coalition of NGOs claimed that Subianto’s family would profit from the Nusantara project, thanks to land and mining interests the family holds on East Kalimantan, the province where the new city is located. A member of the family denied the report’s allegations. Subianto and his family also have business ties to Indonesia’s palm oil, coal and gas, mining, agriculture and fishery industries. The former rivals became tacit allies: Indonesian presidents don’t typically endorse candidates, but Subianto chose Widodo’s son, 36-year-old Surakarta Mayor Gibran Rakabuming Raka, as his vice presidential running mate, and Widodo coyly favored Subianto over the candidate of his own former party. Subianto has also cultivated close ties with hard-line Islamists as a way of undermining Widodo in the 2014 and 2019 elections. But for the 2024 election, Subianto projected a softer image that has resonated with Indonesia’s large youth population, including videos of him dancing on stage and ads showing digital anime-like renderings of him roller-skating through Jakarta’s streets. 'We will be the president and vice president and government for all Indonesian people,' said Subianto during his victory speech. ___ Associated Press writer Edna Tarigan contributed to this report. ___ Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-prabowo-subianto-general-president-8cd195ef82df36049db75cbc9bf1ca1d	2024-10-17T17:27:46-07:00

King Charles III's visit rekindles Australia's debate on ending ties to the British monarchy	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — King Charles III and Queen Camilla will arrive in Sydney on Friday for the first Australian visit by a reigning monarch in more than a decade, a trip that has rekindled debate about the nation’s constitutional links to Britain. The Sydney Opera House's iconic sails will be illuminated with images of previous royal visits to welcome the couple, whose six-day trip will be brief by royal standards. Charles, 75, is being treated for cancer, which led to the scaled-down itinerary. He is only the second reigning British monarch to visit Australia. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, became the first 70 years ago. While the welcome will be warm, Australia's national and state leaders want the royals removed from their constitution. Monarchists expect the visit will strengthen Australians' connection to their sovereign. Opponents hope for a rejection of the concept that someone from the other side of the world is Australia's head of state. The Australian Republic Movement, which campaigns for an Australian citizen to replace the British monarch as head of state, likens the royal visit to a touring act in the entertainment industry. The ARM this week launched what it calls a campaign to 'Wave Goodbye to Royal Reign with Monarchy: The Farewell Oz Tour!' ARM co-chair Esther Anatolitis said royal visits to Australia were 'something of a show that comes to town.' 'Unfortunately, it is a reminder that Australia’s head of state isn’t full-time, isn’t Australian. It’s a part-time person based overseas who’s the head of state of numerous places,' Anatolitis told the AP. 'We say to Charles and Camilla: ‘Welcome, we hope you’re enjoying our country and good health and good spirits.’ But we also look forward to this being the final tour of a sitting Australian monarch and that when they come back to visit soon, we look forward to welcoming them as visiting dignitaries,' she added. Philip Benwell, national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, which campaigns for Australia’s constitutional links to Britain to be maintained, expects reaction to the royal couple will be overwhelmingly positive. 'Something like the royal visit brings the king closer in the minds of people, because we have an absent monarchy,' Benwell told the AP. 'The visit by the king brings it home that Australia is a constitutional monarchy and it has a king,' he added. Benwell is critical of the premiers of all six states, who have declined invitations to attend a reception for Charles in the national capital Canberra. The premiers each explained that they had more pressing engagements on the day such as cabinet meetings and overseas travel. 'It would be virtually incumbent upon the premiers to be in Canberra to meet him and pay their respects,' Benwell said. 'To not attend can be considered to be a snub, because this is not a normal visit. This is the first visit of a king ever to Australia.' Charles was drawn into Australia’s republic debate months before his visit. The Australian Republic Movement wrote to Charles in December last year requesting a meeting in Australia and for the king to advocate their cause. Buckingham Palace politely wrote back in March to say the king's meetings would be decided upon by the Australian government. A meeting with the ARM does not appear on the official itinerary. 'Whether Australia becomes a republic is ... a matter for the Australian public to decide,' said the letter from Buckingham Palace. The Associated Press has seen copies of both letters. Australians decided in a referendum in 1999 to retain Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. That result is widely regarded as a consequence of disagreement about how a president should be chosen rather than majority support for a monarch. After visiting Sydney and Canberra, which are 250 kilometers (155 miles apart), Charles will then travel to Samoa to open the annual Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. When his mother made the last of her 16 journeys to Australia in 2011 at the age of 85, she visited Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne on the east coast before opening the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the west coast city of Perth. Elizabeth's first grueling Australian tour at the age of 27 took in scores of far-flung Outback towns; an estimated 75% of the nation’s population turned out to see her. Australia then had a racially discriminatory policy that favored British immigrants. Immigration policy has been non-discriminatory since 1973 . Anatolitis noted that Australia is far more multicultural now, with most of the population either born overseas or with a overseas-born parent. 'In the ’50s, we didn’t have that global interconnectedness that we have now,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-king-charles-visit-sydney-dcb4baf655f28fc20068c5991f09f28f	2024-10-17T15:20:43-07:00

Kim stresses to North Korean troops they should treat South Korea as a hostile foreign enemy	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reminded his troops to treat South Korea as a hostile foreign enemy and insisted that the North wouldn’t hesitate to attack its rival if the South infringes upon its sovereignty, state media said Friday. Kim’s comments at an army headquarters came after North Korea this week confirmed that it revised its constitution to define South Korea as 'a hostile state' and blew up front-line road and rail links that were once connected to the South. The steps punctuated Kim’s calls for North Korea to abandon its longstanding goals of reconciling with the South and reflect his intent to escalate tensions and increase leverage amid a deepening stalemate in diplomacy. Analysts see increasing risks of possible clashes along the rivals’ tense border areas, although it would be highly unlikely for the North to contemplate full-scale attacks in the face of superior U.S. and South Korean forces. During a visit to the headquarters of the North Korean People’s Army’s 2nd Corps on Thursday, Kim stressed to troops the importance of understanding that any use of offensive force against the South would constitute a 'legitimate retaliatory action against the hostile country, not the fellow countrymen.' He said the North’s detonation of the border road and rail sections on Tuesday demonstrated the North’s resolve to cut off persistent 'evil' relations with the South, which 'lasted century after century and the complete removal of the useless awareness about fellow countrymen and unreasonable idea of reunification.' He said the event was also a declaration that his troops wouldn’t hesitate to use physical force against the South, an 'apparent hostile country,' if it violates North Korea’s sovereignty, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said. South Korea had no immediate comment on Kim’s remarks. North Korea has been making increasingly provocative threats against rival South Korea in recent weeks, including accusing the South of infiltrating drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang this month and threatening to attack if it happens again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea will face an overwhelming response that would 'end its regime' if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have spiked since 2022, as Kim used Russia’s war on Ukraine as a window to dial up his weapons testing activities and threats. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have strengthened their combined military exercises in response and took steps to sharpen their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told the Associated Press earlier this month that North Korea will likely attempt to ramp up pressure with major provocations around the U.S. presidential elections in November, possibly including a long-range missile test or a nuclear test detonation, to grab Washington's attention. ___ Find more of AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-jong-un-south-hostile-foreign-state-troops-a24512f263dbd63f5f6eab8b569ab000	2024-10-17T14:31:53-07:00	
Efforts to combat deforestation in Colombia lag because of armed groups, report finds	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Armed groups operating in Colombia's Amazon are tightening their grip on the region and that's stalling government efforts to tackle deforestation, according to a think tank report Thursday. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) dissidents, known as EMC, have the ability to slow or accelerate deforestation at will, said the report by The International Crisis Group. Some of the former FARC members never signed and disagree with the 2016 FARC-Colombia peace deal. Others signed it but took up arms again, while others are new to the dissident ranks either as volunteers or forced fighters, said Rodrigo Botero, director of The Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development (FCDS). EMC is currently Colombia’s third largest armed group, with around 3,500 members. 'This group is the most directly responsible for deforestation in the last five years,' Botero said. 'More than half a million hectares have been lost in their control zones.' 'Over the last year,' he said, 'the EMC has given orders to the population to suspend deforestation, but this year they have increased it again.' More than 40% of Colombia is in the Amazon — an area roughly the size of Spain. The country has the world’s largest bird biodiversity. Fifteen percent of the Colombian Amazon has already been deforested, according to FCDS. Colombia’s first leftist administration under Gustavo Petro stakes much of its legitimacy on its environmental and peace agenda, Crisis Group researcher and report coauthor Bram Ebus told The Associated Press. 'However, as Colombia’s natural environment continues to suffer from the severe impacts of conflict dynamics and economic activities that fuel violence, his political legacy is at risk,' Ebus said. Colombia’s environment ministry said in a statement Thursday that saving the Amazon rainforest has been one of Petro’s main priorities and it has achieved a historic reduction of deforestation by 61% in the last two years. While acknowledging 'the difficulties with the dynamics of peace in the territory and the armed actors,' the ministry said it wants to build a forest development model that benefits Amazon communities, recovers the forest and stops illegal deforestation. Previous administrations opted for punitive measures against Amazon communities complicit in deforestation, while Petro offers incentives, proposing financial aid to support forest conservation and promote sustainable livelihoods, Ebus said. 'Nevertheless, the lack of territorial control hampers the implementation of these projects, as armed groups dominate the region, often preventing communities from benefiting from state-funded initiatives,' he said. The EMC is able to impose control over the forests through armed coercion, said Elizabeth Dickenson, Crisis Group senior analyst and report coauthor. She added that in late 2022 and March 2023 local commanders gave strict orders to communities to cease deforesting. 'Anyone who did would be subject to fines, forced community labor and even expulsion from the community,' Dickenson said. But early this year, the EMC lifted restrictions, so it could accelerate its revenue streams from deforestation, she said, adding that the group would force those deforesting to pay an extortion fee to operate. 'One of the things that was very alarming in researching this piece was the extent to which state authorities are not allowed to access areas that are under their (EMC) jurisdiction,' she said. 'So this includes national parks, protected areas.' Dialogue with the EMC is an uphill battle, Ebus said, noting the group has repeatedly violated previously agreed rules during ceasefires and blocked state agencies from entering territories under its control. 'If the Petro administration truly wants to protect the Amazon, it must first regain access to these areas, as armed groups currently are calling the shots,' he said. ___ Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan __ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

What we know about Liam Payne's death, including some of the unanswered questions	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentine authorities continue to investigate the death of former One Direction singer Liam Payne, who died Wednesday at age 31 after falling three stories from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. Payne was a beloved member of the group, which formed in 2010 after its members — Payne, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik — auditioned for 'The X-Factor' singing competition series as solo acts and were brought together by judge Simon Cowell to form the band. They became one of the most successful boy bands of all time, with a loyal fan base of 'Directioners' and a meteoric rise to fame on par with Beatlemania. Here is what we know — and what remains unknown — about the star's untimely death. Police responded to hotel staff’s 911 call minutes before Payne’s fall Hotel staff at the Casa Sur Hotel in the chic Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital where Payne was staying called the police Wednesday evening with concerns about a guest who they say was 'overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol.' Police rushed to the hotel and responded to the call just after 5 p.m. local time and they later confirmed they arrived just minutes before the fall. The hotel manager can be heard on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press saying the guest was 'destroying the entire room' and added, 'We need you to send someone, please.' The manager’s voice became more anxious as the call went on, noting the room had a balcony. Prosecutors categorize Payne's death as 'suspicious' — here's why Officials said Payne's fall injuries alone were enough to cause his death, but prosecutors described Payne’s case as 'suspicious,' citing the likelihood that the star had been drinking alcohol and taking drugs. The office also confirmed all signs pointed to Payne being alone at the time of the incident and authorities have ordered a toxicology report. Whether the fall was intentional or accidental remains unknown, but the public prosecutor said the lack of defensive injuries on Payne’s hands indicated that 'he did not adopt a reflexive posture to protect himself and that he could have fallen into a state of semi- or total unconsciousness.' Police: Payne's hotel room was found in 'complete disarray' Buenos Aires police said they found Payne’s hotel room 'in complete disarray.' They saw 'various items broken' and recovered packs of clonazepam, a central nervous system depressant, energy supplements and other over-the-counter drugs strewn among his belongings. Forensics teams also reported that authorities recovered a whiskey bottle, lighter and cellphone from the internal courtyard where Payne’s body was found. Evidence collected from the scene, a statement from Argentine authorities added, suggested Payne 'was going through some kind of substance abuse episode.' In recent years, Payne had acknowledged struggling with alcoholism, saying in a YouTube video posted in July 2023 that he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Authorities continue to investigate Payne's death As police and prosecutors await the results of the toxicology report, they are continuing the investigation and trying to reconstruct Payne's final moments. Authorities said they took statements from three hotel employees and two women who had visited Payne in his hotel room hours before his fall. The two women had left the hotel by the time of the incident, the prosecution said. Payne's death spark media ethics questions as fake content swirls TMZ, a celebrity news site known for its scoops and tabloid sensibilities, initially included cropped photos of Payne's body after the fall that featured his identifying tattoos in their early reporting Wednesday. After receiving swift backlash, the site pulled the photos. In the updated version of the story, the outlet wrote, 'TMZ has seen a photo showing Liam’s body on the deck at the hotel with tables and chairs nearby' and proceeded to describe the tattoos and how the image helped to confirm early reports of Payne's death. Fans took to social media to express outrage at the outlet for its decision to share the photos. TMZ did not immediately return requests for comment. The photos are still circulating on social media, as well as a video of a man jumping from a building on fire that users are mistakenly taking as a video of Payne’s fall. Several other videos of falls or jumps from balconies have been circulating, as well. X’s 'community notes' feature, where readers can provide context and — in this case — debunk falsely represented content, are present on several, but not all posts. Here's how One Direction reacted to Payne's death The surviving members of One Direction — Horan, Tomlinson, Styles and Malik — put out a statement Thursday saying they are 'completely devastated' by Payne's death. 'In time, and when everyone is able to, there will be more to say. But for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother, who we loved dearly. The memories we shared with him will be treasured forever,' their statement concluded. Malik and Tomlinson also shared individual tributes on their Instagram pages Thursday, each writing again that Payne was a brother to them. ___ Huamani reported from Los Angeles.	https://apnews.com/article/liam-payne-death-what-to-know-83bd8655c4c70332d4a847b9d167f1fa	2024-10-17T13:38:18-07:00	
Indian government employee charged in foiled murder-for-hire plot in New York City	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department announced criminal charges Thursday against an Indian government employee in connection with a foiled plot to kill a Sikh separatist leader living in New York City. Vikash Yadav, 39, faces murder-for-hire charges in a planned killing that prosecutors first disclosed last year and have said was meant to precede a string of other politically motivated murders in the United States and Canada. Yadav remains at large, but in adding him to the indictment and releasing his name, the Biden administration sought to publicly call out the Indian government for criminal activity that has emerged as a significant point of tension between India and the West over the last year — culminating this week with a diplomatic flare-up with Canada and the expulsion of diplomats. 'The FBI will not tolerate acts of violence or other efforts to retaliate against those residing in the U.S. for exercising their constitutionally protected rights,' FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. The criminal case was announced the same week as two members of an Indian inquiry committee investigating the plot were in Washington to meet with U.S. officials about the investigation. 'They did inform us that the individual who was named in the Justice Department indictment is no longer an employee of the Indian government,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters before the case against Yadav was unsealed. 'We are satisfied with cooperation. It continues to be an ongoing process. On Monday, Canada said it had identified India’s top diplomat in the country as a person of interest in the assassination of a Sikh activist there and expelled him and five other diplomats. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and police officials went public this week with allegations that Indian diplomats were targeting Sikh separatists in Canada by sharing information about them with their government back home. They said top Indian officials were then passing that information along to Indian organized crime groups who were targeting the activists, who are Canadian citizens, with drive-by shootings, extortions and even murder. India, for its part, has rejected the accusations as absurd, and its foreign ministry said it was expelling Canada’s acting high commissioner and five other diplomats in response. The murder-for-hire plot was first disclosed by federal prosecutors last year when they announced charges against a man, Nikhil Gupta, who was recruited by a then-unidentified Indian government employee to orchestrate the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader in New York. Gupta was extradited to the United States in June from the Czech Republic after his arrest in Prague last year. The rewritten indictment said Yadav recruited Gupta in May 2023 to arrange the assassination. It said Gupta, an Indian citizen who lived in India, contacted an individual at Yadav’s direction, believing the individual to be a criminal associate. Instead, the indictment said, the individual was a confidential source working with the Drug Enforcement Administration. Authorities said Yadav, a citizen and resident of India, directed the plot from India while he was employed by the Government of India’s Cabinet Secretariat, which houses India’s foreign intelligence service. Yadav has described his position as a 'Senior Field Officer' with responsibilities in 'Security Management' and 'Intelligence,' the Justice Department said. As the assassination plot was created in June 2023, Yadav gave Gupta personal information about the Sikh separatist leader, including his home address in New York City, his phone numbers and details about his day-to-day movements, which Gupta then passed along to the undercover DEA operative, according to court papers. Yadav directed Gupta to keep him updated regularly on the progress of the assassination plot, leading Gupta to send him surveillance photographs of the intended victim, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who advocated for the creation of a sovereign Sikh state. In a statement, Pannun said the indictment means the U.S. government has 'reassured its commitment to fundamental constitutional duty to protect the life, liberty and freedom of expression of the U.S. Citizen at home and abroad.' He added, 'The attempt on my life on American Soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism which has become a challenge to America’s sovereignty and threat to freedom of speech and democracy, which unequivocally proves that India believes in using bullets while pro Khalistan Sikhs believe in ballots.' ____ Neumeister reported from New York.	https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-india-murderforhire-a7621636336da5d15cdbad0d7a8ae562	2024-10-17T12:23:43-07:00	
One Direction were the internet's first boy band, and Liam Payne its grounding force	Liam Payne's voice is the first one heard in the culture-shifting boy band One Direction's debut single: 'What Makes You Beautiful' launches into a bouncy guitar riff, a cheeky and borderline gratuitous cowbell and then, Payne. 'You’re insecure, don’t know what for / You’re turning heads when you walk through the door,' he sings, in a few words assuring a cross-section of generations that he's got your back, girl, and you should like yourself a little bit more. Payne, who died Wednesday after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at just 31, was also the last solo voice on the band's final single, 'History' — effectively opening and closing the monolithic run of one of the biggest boy bands of all time. While the exact circumstances of his death remain unclear — Buenos Aires police said in a statement that Payne 'had jumped from the balcony of his room,' although they didn't offer details on how they established that or whether it was intentional — in life, Payne was a critical part of the internet's first boy band, one that secured an indelible place in the hearts of millennial and Gen Z fans. How One Direction became the internet's first boy band Before One Direction became One Direction, its members auditioned for the U.K.'s 'The X Factor' separately. The judges decided to put five promising, but not yet excellent, boys into a group. They were Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik and Payne, who together finished third in the 2010 competition. As Rolling Stone contributing editor Rob Sheffield points out, it was an 'unprecedented' way for a boy band to get their start. 'They were sort of assigned to be together. And you don’t expect longevity out of that situation. Honestly, you don’t even expect one good pop record to come out of that situation,' he says. And yet, not only did it work, but One Direction essentially created 'a new template for pop stardom, really.' The show allowed Day 1 fans to follow their career before their official 2011 launch with 'What Makes You Beautiful.' Nascent fans could use rising social media platforms like Twitter and Tumblr to find community, draw attention to the group and, in the earliest days, speak directly to the members. 'I honestly made a Twitter so that I could keep up with One Direction, and that’s how I made so many different friends,' says Gabrielle Kopera, 28, a fan from California who remembers the band hosting livestreams and chats. 'Sometimes they would say something back and it was so much fun. I feel like that fan interaction doesn’t even happen anymore.' That feeling of accessibility reinforced the group's personality and relationship with fans, says Maura Johnston, a freelance music writer and Boston College adjunct instructor. 'The fact that they came up on this British TV show and they became this worldwide phenomenon, I don’t think that would have happened as acutely and as quickly and as immersive without social media, without Twitter or without people being able to mobilize around the globe,' she says. One Direction and their fans Millennial and Gen Z audiences practically grew up with One Direction, but the band was truly ubiquitous. That, Johnston says, is at least partially attributable to arriving in a very different media environment from today's. 'It was a lot more focused,' she says of the early 2010s. 'Algorithmic sorting of stuff hadn’t really taken hold. So, there was this broader, mass approach. ... They were one of the last gasps of that mass phenomenon, that anyone of any age, even if they weren't a fan, had to take notice to.' But it takes more than omnipresence to cultivate a loyal fanbase. And there were myriad reasons why listeners were attracted to One Direction. 'They were five very different musical personalities, along with five very different personalities,' says Sheffield. They broke the rules associated with traditional boy bands, too: 'They co-wrote many of their songs. They didn’t do, you know, corny, choreographed steps on stage,' he said. After the news of Payne's death, Kopera says she 'got so many messages from people I haven’t talked to in years reaching out because I think everyone kind of realized that it does feel like we just lost a family member.' That sentiment was mirrored in the masses of fans who gathered Wednesday outside Buenos Aires' Casa Sur Hotel, feeding a burgeoning makeshift memorial of flowers, candles and notes as police stood guard. 'I’ve always loved One Direction since I was little,' said Juana Relh, 18, outside Payne’s hotel. 'To see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable, it kills me.' Liam Payne's place in the band, and its legacy Payne was a 'brooding' older brother-type in One Direction, says Johnston. He also co-wrote many songs, especially in their later career — like the Fleetwood Mac-channeling 'What A Feeling' and 'Fireproof.' 'He was this grounding force in the band,' Johnston says. In an Instagram tribute, Tomlinson called Payne 'the most vital part of One Direction.' 'His experience from a young age, his perfect pitch, his stage presence, his gift for writing. The list goes on. Thank you for shaping us Liam,' he wrote. 'I always remember that he was the responsible and the sensible one of the group, and I feel like he wore his heart on his sleeve,' Kopera says. Payne had recently been vocal about struggling with alcoholism, posting a YouTube video in July 2023 where he said he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Buenos Aires police said they found clonazepam — a central nervous system depressant — and other over-the-counter drugs in Payne's hotel room, along with a whiskey bottle in the courtyard where he was found. 'Looking at what happened to Liam, it just makes you feel even more sad, that it just feels like he needed help,' Kopera says. 'And it’s so scary to think about how the entertainment industry can just, like, eat up artists.' After One Direction disbanded in 2016, Payne's solo career — a single R&amp;B-pop album in 2019, 'LP1,' and a number of singles here and there — never took off the same way as some of his bandmates. He was 'the least successful,' Sheffield says. 'It’s safe to say that on the terms that he was going for, he didn’t really find what he wanted to do.' 'It's hard, transitioning from being a boy bander to be a pop star,' Johnston says. At Payne's solo shows, Sheffield explains, 'He would show a little montage of One Direction performing, which is the kind of thing you don’t do when you’re starting out as a solo artist. But fans took that in the spirit it was offered, which is a very generous statement that he’s like, ‘Yep, you’re here because of this history that we share, and I’m here because of that same history.’' Despite Payne's struggles and the tragedy of his death, Kopera is confident 'his legacy is going to always point back to One Direction.' For fans, the same is true. 'When I look back on One Direction, I’m like, that was my girlhood. One Direction was the soundtrack to growing up, and I’m so thankful for it,' she says. 'They really were just a group of normal boys.' ____ AP journalist Brooke Lefferts contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/one-direction-liam-payne-400a27d1ad01a3b53058aef8cbd38da4	2024-10-17T12:12:00-07:00	
Sinwar's killing opens up opportunity and much uncertainty for the war in Gaza	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel’s killing of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ top leader and the mastermind of the group’s Oct. 7 attack, is a dramatic turning point in the brutal yearlong war that it touched off. Sinwar’s killing on Thursday decapitates the Palestinian militant group that has already been reeling from months of assassinations up and down its ranks. And it is a potent symbolic achievement for Israel in its battle to destroy Hamas. The killing, coming just 10 days after Israelis and Palestinians marked a year since the deadliest fighting in their decades-old conflict erupted, could set the stage for how the remainder of the war plays out, or even prompt its conclusion — depending on how Israel and Hamas choose to proceed. Sinwar's death could serve as an off-ramp for Israel toward ending the war Sinwar, who was appointed head of Hamas after its previous leader was killed in a blast in July blamed on Israel, spent years building up Hamas’ military strength and is believed to have devised the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. After that assault, when Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted about 250 others, Israel pledged to destroy Hamas and kill each one of its leaders. With Sinwar at the top of that wanted list, his death is a major achievement for Israel. Analysts say Sinwar’s killing has presented Israel, which has struggled to articulate an exit strategy from Gaza, with an off-ramp to end the war. 'This would really be the cherry on the icing of the cake for Israel,' said Nomi Bar-Yaacov, an associate fellow of the International Security Program at the Chatham House think tank in London. 'It should be easier to reach a deal.' With the architect of the Oct. 7 attacks eliminated, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could now tell Israelis that one of the war's aims has been reached. Politically, that might allow him to be more flexible on a cease-fire deal that ends the war in exchange for hostages — a condition he has so far refused to accept, at least in part, critics say, because it could threaten his rule. Sinwar's death could have broader implications, depending on Israel's next moves Analysts said the achievement was such a gamechanger that it was an opportunity for Israel to signal that it is ready to end the fighting further afield in the region, including in Lebanon where Israel is battling Hezbollah. 'The opportunity to end the war entirely, as well as in Lebanon, ... it is entirely in our hands,' Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel’s National Security Council, told Israeli Channel 12 News, saying Israel must use Sinwar's death to present its conditions for ending the wars on both fronts. The families of hostages in Gaza had a similar message for Netanyahu. A group representing the families welcomed Sinwar's killing but recognizing the potential opportunity, called on Israel to reconcentrate its efforts toward negotiating a deal. 'Netanyahu, don't bury the hostages. Go now to the negotiators and the Israeli public and present a new Israeli initiative,' Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is held in Gaza, said in a post on social media. Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute think tank, cautioned that Netanyahu has shown few indications that he is looking for an end to the conflict, with the army intensifying its operations in the north of Gaza in recent weeks. 'The war ... is not over yet,' Netanyahu said in a video statement after the killing. Netanyahu rules with the support of two far-right parties that have threatened to topple the government if the war ends under a cease-fire deal. They repeated their opposition to a deal after Sinwar's killing. They are also supporters of establishing Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip, something the Israeli leader has publicly ruled out. Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption, has also seen his political fortunes rise throughout the war, after they plummeted in response to Hamas' attack last year. Prolonging the war allows him to enjoy boosts of support after whatever successes he notches. Other top Hamas officials may be more pliable Sinwar was seen as a hard-liner with close ties to Hamas’ armed wing, and throughout repeated cease-fire negotiations with Israel was seen as having the final word on any agreement for Gaza and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages. Sinwar's positions were directly at odds with Israel's. He stuck to demands for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a lasting cease-fire — even as more than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the ongoing war, according to local officials, and much of the territory left in ruins. According to Elgindy, Sinwar’s death will likely give more flexibility and control to the group’s political leadership in Qatar. This includes Khalil al-Hayya and Khaled Mashaal, key Hamas delegates of the monthslong talks. Those leaders could be more responsive to pressure from Qatar, a key mediator that hosts some of Hamas' top leaders. Unlike Sinwar, these leaders are also not in hiding in Gaza, which could speed up progress on a deal. Hamas leaders have proved replaceable in the past For Hamas, Sinwar’s killing leaves a gaping hole in rhw militant group’s leadership, with its future in Gaza and beyond uncertain. It is a symbolic blow for a group already reeling from multiple assassinations of its leaders. An Israeli airstrike killed Marwan Issa, deputy leader of Hamas’ military wing in March. Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' former political leader, was assassinated in the blast in Tehran in July blamed on Israel. Then in August, Israel said it killed Mohammed Deif, Hamas’ military chief and co-mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack, in an airstrike. Hamas has not confirmed that death. Elgindy called Sinwar's killing a 'major blow' to Hamas. But, he added, it was 'not fatal since everyone is replaceable.' Still, with so many leaders and commanders killed, at this point, it’s not clear who could fill his shoes. ___ Jeffery reported from Ramallah, West Bank.

US presidential election looms over IMF and World Bank annual meetings	WASHINGTON (AP) — Global finance leaders face a major uncertainty as they meet in Washington next week: Who will win the U.S. presidential election and shape the policies of the world’s biggest economy? Republican nominee former President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris have spoken little about their plans for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But their differing views on trade, tariffs and other economic issues will be on the minds of the finance leaders as they attend the financial institutions' annual meetings. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva alluded to what’s at stake in a curtain-raiser speech Thursday ahead of the meetings. Without naming Trump, she warned that 'major players, driven by national security concerns, are increasingly resorting to industrial policy and protectionism, creating one trade restriction after another.' She said trade 'will not be the same engine of growth as before,' warning that trade restrictions are 'like pouring cold water on an already-lukewarm world economy.' Trump promises as president to impose a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods and a 'universal’’ tariff of 10% or 20% on everything else that enters the United States, insisting that the cost of taxing imported goods is absorbed by the foreign countries that produce those goods. However, mainstream economists say they actually amount to a tax on American consumers that would make the economy less efficient and send inflation surging in the United States. Trump has also embraced isolationism and heavily criticized multilateral institutions. During his first term, he signed an executive order to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. His administration blocked new appointments to the World Trade Organization appellate body as the terms of its judges expired, leaving the organization without a functional appellate body. World Bank President Ajay Banga, who also made a speech Thursday previewing the meetings, spoke directly about the election in a question-and-answer session with reporters. He credited Trump for increasing investment in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development during his presidency, which offers loans to middle-income developing countries. 'Then the question will be, how will the nuances of each administration be different,' Banga said. 'I don't know yet so I'm not going to speculate on how to deal with them.' Harris has not specified her views on the World Bank or IMF, though even as she has embraced some tariffs, is more likely to continue the Biden administration approach favoring international cooperation over threats, The Biden-Harris administration has not eliminated tariffs imposed on China during the Trump administration and in May also slapped major tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminum and medical equipment. Harris met Banga in June 2023 when he began his five-year term as World Bank president and released a statement then that 'praised the steps taken to evolve the World Bank—including expanding its mission to include building resilience to global challenges like climate change, pandemics, fragility and conflict.' Georgieva who did not speak about the election directly in her speech, said: 'We live in a mistrustful, fragmented world where national security has risen to the top of the list of concerns for many countries. This has happened before — but never in a time of such high economic co-dependence. My argument is that we must not allow this reality to become an excuse to do nothing to prevent a further fracturing of the global economy.' ___	https://apnews.com/article/imf-world-bank-international-finance-2584e0b0c8c68698b1d4a43851d2a3a9	2024-10-17T10:58:53-07:00	
Homeland Security grants temporary status to Lebanese already in the United States	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Thursday announced temporary legal status for Lebanese citizens already in the United States, likely pleasing some Arab voters, including in the battleground state of Michigan. The announcement, together with an earlier offer in July, brings the number of Lebanese who will be able to stay in the country and become eligible for work authorization to about 11,000, according to the Homeland Security Department. The offer is for people already in the US on Wednesday and it is for a period of 18 months. Temporary Protected Status will allow Lebanese citizens to stay 'while the United States is in discussions to achieve a diplomatic solution for lasting stability and security across the Israel-Lebanon border,' Homeland Security said in a statement. They must have been in the United States on Wednesday. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have been forced to deal with conflict in Lebanon and across the Mideast in the final weeks of their White House campaign. Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets over the border in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza. In recent weeks, Israel has conducted a major aerial bombardment of Lebanon and a ground invasion that it says aims to push Hezbollah back from the border and allow displaced residents of northern Israel to return. Assad I. Turfe, deputy executive of Wayne County, Michigan, said TPS 'will provide critical support to Lebanese nationals, helping to reunite families here in America and offering relief from the challenges caused by the conflict.' Nearly 900,000 people were covered by TPS at the end of March, according to the Congressional Research Service. The 1990 law provides legal status to people already in the United States from countries hit by natural disasters or civil strife. In addition, some Palestinians, Lebanese, Liberians, and residents of Hong Kong living in the United States are covered by a similar program, called Deferred Enforcement Departure, which is run under the authority of the president instead of the Homeland Security Department.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-immigration-temporary-protected-status-biden-f69bfbef8b43258ecf1860038d483e94	2024-10-17T09:36:59-07:00	
Harris says the killing of Sinwar is an opportunity 'to finally end the war in Gaza'	MILWAUKEE (AP) — Kamala Harris said Thursday that Israel's killing of Hamas' top leader offers 'an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza,' talking plainly about next steps even as the pro-Palestinian demonstrators who gathered outside her campaign event underscored the complicated politics at play. The Democratic presidential nominee said the war 'must end such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.' 'It is time for the day after to begin,' she said, speaking from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee just moments after the White House released President Joe Biden's statement on the death of Yahya Sinwar. The administration's response to the killing of a chief architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel was carefully choreographed, leaving room for the Harris to emphasize the push to end the war as she balances her loyalty to Biden. She's trying to shore up left flank voters who want to see an immediate end to the bloody conflict and have not said they will support her. With the presidential race at razor-thin margins and the election just a few weeks away, Harris is seeking to solidify support in battleground states. The Biden administration’s support for Israel has complicated her effort in metro Detroit, especially Dearborn, an area that is home to the nation’s largest Arab American community. The death earlier this month of a Dearborn resident killed in south Lebanon ignited anger in the traditionally Democratic area. Speaking Thursday in Flint, Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she was hopeful for an end to the violence. 'Have the hostages returned and have a solution for long-term peace in the region. That’s everything that I think is so important. And, you know, any chance that we can do that, I think would be welcomed by so many people,' she said. At Harris' next stop in Wisconsin, at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, students waiting for her said the end of the war was important. William Schauberger, a 24-year-old political science major, said he wasn't optimistic. 'Neither party will do really anything about it. I mean, especially when there were, you know, massive protests. And instead of doing anything about it, and trying to secure stuff, they just tended to, you know, ignore it and ... just denounce the protests,' he said. Harris has not proposed any policy shifts on Israel. But she has, of late, faced increasing pressure to articulate how she would govern differently from Biden. While Biden’s favorability ratings remain underwater, some of the biggest pieces of his legislative agenda, from infrastructure to lowering the costs of some prescription drugs, are popular, and signaling any daylight with the president on foreign policy at a time of global crises could be seen as reckless. Biden's written statement on Sinwar's death — released as he was traveling to Germany for a visit with Chancellor Olaf Scholz — focused on how U.S. intelligence helped the Israelis pursue Hamas leadership and noted that Israel had every right to 'eliminate the leadership and military structure of Hamas.' 'Today proves once again that no terrorists anywhere in the world can escape justice, no matter how long it takes,' Biden said. He said he would speak with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'congratulate them, to discuss the pathway for bringing the hostages home to their families and for ending this war once and for all, which has caused so much devastation to innocent people.' Israeli officials said Sinwar was killed in a battle with Israeli forces in Gaza. Foreign Minister Israel Katz called the killing a 'military and moral achievement for the Israeli army.' ___ Karnowski reported from La Crosse. Associated Press Writer Joey Cappelletti in Flint, Michigan, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-election-2024-israel-sinwar-gaza-5082986dda69887ca525b6a97d2452df	2024-10-17T09:33:50-07:00	
Biden says Sinwar's death is an 'opportunity' for a hostage deal and an end to war in Gaza	BERLIN (AP) — President Joe Biden said Thursday that the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops is a 'good day for the world,' calling it an opportunity to free hostages held by the militant group and end the yearlong war in Gaza. 'Now’s the time to move on. ... Move toward a cease-fire in Gaza, make sure that we move in a direction that we’re able to make things better for the whole world,' Biden told reporters as he arrived in Berlin for a short visit. 'It’s time for this war to end and bring these hostages home. That’s what we’re ready to do.' U.S. officials expressed such measured optimism that the killing of a militant characterized by national security adviser Jake Sullivan as a 'massive obstacle to peace' might breathe new life into cease-fire talks that have failed to produce a breakthrough for months despite periodic signs of progress. 'Over the past few weeks, there have been no negotiations for an end to the war because Sinwar has refused to negotiate,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters. 'We now see an opportunity with him having been removed from the battlefield, being removed from the leadership of Hamas, and we want to seize that opportunity.' Biden spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to congratulate him on the mission that killed Sinwar. They also discussed 'how to use this moment to bring the hostages home and to bring the war to a close with Israel’s security assured and Hamas never again able to control Gaza,' according to a White House summary of the call. However, Netanyahu said Thursday that 'our war has not yet ended.' Besides seeking the release of hostages, Netanyahu has said Israel must keep long-term control over Gaza to ensure Hamas does not rearm — opening the possibility of continued fighting. Biden said he would be sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel in the coming days. In an earlier statement, the president compared the reaction to Sinwar's death to the feeling in the U.S. after the killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He said the killing of the mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel 'proves once again that no terrorists anywhere in the world can escape justice, no matter how long it takes.' The inability to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and deliver the return of the hostages has bedeviled negotiators from the start. Hamas militants killed some 1,200 people in Israel in the attacks that launched the war and took about 250 hostage. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has destroyed much of the Gaza Strip and killed more than 42,000 Palestinians. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. The U.S. has been working with fellow mediators Egypt and Qatar on a cease-fire proposal since the war began a year ago, sending Blinken and other envoys to the Middle East multiple times to try to broker a deal without success. Last month, on Blinken’s 10th trip to the region since the war in Gaza began, he skipped Israel and withheld optimistic projections of a breakthrough. 'On multiple occasions over the past months, Sinwar rebuffed efforts by the United States and its partners to bring this war to a close through an agreement that would return the hostages to their families and alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people,' Blinken said in a statement Thursday. The halting progress and seemingly conflicting priorities have caused friction in the Biden-Netanyahu relationship as the Israeli leader's pledge to achieve 'total victory' against Hamas has clashed with U.S. officials' concerns about large-scale civilian casualties in Gaza. Israeli leaders presented the killing of Sinwar as a moment for Hamas to surrender. The Biden administration also had urgently called for an immediate cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah to avoid the possibility of all-out war in the Middle East before shifting its message after Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike and pressed ahead with a ground invasion in Lebanon. Biden said with Sinwar’s death 'there is now the opportunity for a ‘day after’ in Gaza without Hamas in power, and for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.' He praised U.S. special operations forces and intelligence operatives who helped advise Israeli allies on tracking and locating Sinwar and other Hamas leaders over the past year — though the U.S. said the operation that killed Sinwar was an Israeli one. Sullivan said Sinwar's removal from the battlefield does present an opportunity to find a way forward that gets the hostages home.' 'Now we will have to work to ensure that his death actually does deal the kind of long-term blow to Hamas that of all of us would like to see,' he said. ___ Miller reported from Washington.

Tech firms remove social media accounts of a Russian drone factory after an AP investigation	Google, Meta and TikTok have removed social media accounts belonging to an industrial plant in Russia's Tatarstan region aimed at recruiting young foreign women to make drones for Moscow's war in Ukraine. Posts on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok were taken down following an investigation by The Associated Press published Oct. 10 that detailed working conditions in the drone factory in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, which is under U.S. and British sanctions. Videos and other posts on the social media platforms promised the young women, who are largely from Africa, a free plane ticket to Russia and a salary of more than $500 a month following their recruitment via the program called 'Alabuga Start.' But instead of a work-study program in areas like hospitality and catering, some of them said they learned only arriving in the Tatarstan region that they would be toiling in a factory to make weapons of war, assembling thousands of Iranian-designed attack drones to be launched into Ukraine. In interviews with AP, some of the women who worked in the complex complained of long hours under constant surveillance, of broken promises about wages and areas of study, and of working with caustic chemicals that left their skin pockmarked and itching. AP did not identify them by name or nationality out of concern for their safety. The tech companies also removed accounts for Alabuga Polytechnic, a vocational boarding school for Russians aged 16-18 and Central Asians aged 18-22 that bills its graduates as experts in drone production. The accounts collectively had at least 158,344 followers while one page on TikTok had more than a million likes. In a statement, YouTube said its parent company Google is committed to sanctions and trade compliance and 'after review and consistent with our policies, we terminated channels associated with Alabuga Special Economic Zone.' Meta said it removed accounts on Facebook and Instagram that 'violate our policies.' The company said it was committed to complying with sanctions laws and said it recognized that human exploitation is a serious problem which required a multifaceted approach, including at Meta. It said it had teams dedicated to anti-trafficking efforts and aimed to remove those seeking to abuse its platforms. TikTok said it removed videos and accounts which violated its community guidelines, which state it does not allow content that is used for the recruitment of victims, coordination of their transport, and their exploitation using force, fraud, coercion, or deception. The women aged 18-22 were recruited to fill an urgent labor shortage in wartime Russia. They are from places like Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, as well as the South Asian country of Sri Lanka. The drive also is expanding to elsewhere in Asia as well as Latin America. Accounts affiliated to Alabuga with tens of thousands of followers are still accessible on Telegram, which did not reply to a request for comment. The plant's management also did not respond to AP. The Alabuga Start recruiting drive used a robust social media campaign of slickly edited videos with upbeat music that show African women smiling while cleaning floors, wearing hard hats while directing cranes, and donning protective equipment to apply paint or chemicals. Videos also showed them enjoying Tatarstan's cultural sites or playing sports. None of the videos made it clear the women would be working in a drone manufacturing complex. Online, Alabuga promoted visits to the industrial area by foreign dignitaries, including some from Brazil, Sri Lanka and Burkina Faso. In a since-deleted Instagram post, a Turkish diplomat who visited the plant had compared Alabuga Polytechnic to colleges in Turkey and pronounced it 'much more developed and high-tech.' According to Russian investigative outlets Protokol and Razvorot, some pupils at Alabuga Polytechnic are as young as 15 and have complained of poor working conditions. Videos previously on the platforms showed the vocational school students in team-building exercises such as 'military-patriotic' paintball matches and recreating historic Soviet battles while wearing camouflage. Last month, Alabuga Start said on Telegram its 'audience has grown significantly!' That could be due to its hiring of influencers, who promoted the site on TikTok and Instagram as an easy way for young women to make money after leaving school. TikTok removed two videos promoting Alabuga after publication of the AP investigation. Experts told AP that about 90% of the women recruited via the Alabuga Start program work in drone manufacturing.	https://apnews.com/article/alabuga-russia-africa-ukraine-war-shahed-drones-bc175c4c98d752dc298c23434637417e	2024-10-17T09:19:37-07:00	
Committee reviewing euthanasia in Canada finds some deaths driven by homelessness fears, isolation	LONDON (AP) — An expert committee reviewing euthanasia deaths in Canada’s most populous province has identified several cases where patients asked to be killed in part for social reasons such as isolation and fears of homelessness, raising concerns over approvals for vulnerable people in the country's assisted dying system. Ontario’s chief coroner issued several reports Wednesday — after an Associated Press investigation based in part on data provided in one of the documents — reviewing the euthanasia deaths of people who weren’t terminally ill. The expert committee's reports are based on an analysis of anonymized cases, chosen for their implications for future euthanasia requests. Canada’s legal criteria require a medical reason for euthanasia — a fatal diagnosis or unmanageable pain — but the committee's reports show cases where people were euthanized based on other factors including an 'unmet social need.' AP's investigation found doctors and nurses privately struggling with euthanasia requests from vulnerable people whose suffering might be addressed by money, social connections or adequate housing. Providers expressed deep discomfort with ending the lives of vulnerable people whose deaths were avoidable, even if they met the criteria in Canada's euthanasia system, known nationally as MAiD, for medical assistance in dying. 'To finally have a government report that recognizes these cases of concern is extremely important,' said Dr. Ramona Coelho, a doctor on the expert committee. 'We’ve been gaslit for so many years when we raised fears about people getting MAiD because they were poor, disabled or socially isolated.' In the case of a man identified as Mr. A, Ontario's expert committee questioned whether authorities tried hard enough to relieve his pain before he was euthanized. Mr. A was an unemployed man in his 40s with bowel disease and a history of substance abuse and mental illness. He was described as 'socially vulnerable and isolated.' Some committee members were alarmed that a psychiatrist suggested euthanasia during a mental health assessment. Mr. A was eventually picked up and driven to the location where he was killed by the health professional who euthanized him — a transgression of professional boundaries, according to some committee members. They said that might have 'created pressure and gave rise to a perception of hastening a person towards death.' Another case detailed Ms. B, a woman in her 50s suffering from multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome, with a history of mental illness including suicidality and post-traumatic stress disorder. She was socially isolated and asked to die largely because she could not get proper housing, according to the report. Committee members couldn’t agree whether her death was justified; some said that because her inadequate housing was the main reason for her suffering, she should have been disqualified from euthanasia. Others argued that 'social needs may be considered irremediable' if other options have been explored. Dr. Sonu Gaind, professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, said the coroner’s reports are alarming for numerous reasons, notably the handling of mental health conditions in those seeking euthanasia. 'What we’re doing in many cases is the opposite of suicide prevention,' he said, citing an example of a man in his 40s who had previously tried to kill himself and did not have a definitive diagnosis when his euthanasia was approved. Dr. Scott Kim, a physician and bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health in Washington, said the real issue is the permissive nature of Canada's law. Despite polls showing widespread support for expanding euthanasia access, he questioned whether most Canadians understand what is allowed and said it's 'baffling' that officials hadn't previously considered these issues. The expert committee made numerous recommendations, including assigning patient advocates to support people considering euthanasia and providing more guidance to doctors and nurses who assess requests from nonterminal patients. The committee noted that legally mandated safeguards likely were not met in nearly 2% of cases. Despite that, experts say, no doctors or nurses have ever been prosecuted. Trudo Lemmens, professor of health law and policy at the University of Toronto, said medical professional bodies and judicial authorities in Canada appeared 'unwilling to curtail practices that appear ethically problematic.' 'Either the law is too broad, or the professional guidance not precise enough,' Lemmens said. 'Or it is simply not seen as a priority to protect some of our most vulnerable citizens.' So far, Ontario is the only province or territory in Canada to release summaries of cases that could signal problems in euthanasia approvals. AP’s investigation also found data suggesting a significant number of people euthanized in Ontario when they weren't dying live in the province's poorest and most deprived areas. On Wednesday, the Ontario coroner released that as well, showing that people asking to be killed were more likely to require disability support and be socially isolated. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Blaze ravages a brand new fire station in Germany that lacked a fire alarm	BERLIN (AP) — A brand new fire station in Germany, which was destroyed in a fire, causing millions of euros in damage and destroyed equipment did not have a fire alarm system, local media reported Thursday. The fire broke out early Wednesday morning at the Stadtallendorf fire station in Hesse and destroyed, among other things, the equipment hall and almost a dozen emergency vehicles, German news agency dpa reported. Initial estimates put the damage at between 20 million and 24 million euros ($21 million to $26 million). No one was injured. Local officials told dpa that no fire alarm system was installed in the building because experts had considered it not necessary — much to the astonishment of many observers now that the station has burned down. The fire broke out on an emergency vehicle belonging to the fire department, which contained lithium-ion batteries and an external power connection. The station opened less than a year ago, local media reported. 'I believe that what has happened will make many people think and act,' about improving fire protection requirements at fire stations, Norbert Fischer, the head of the State Fire Brigade Association of the state of Hesse, told dpa. Precisely because there is a lot of technology in fire stations and batteries are being charged, it would make sense to equip them with fire alarm systems, Fischer said, noting it was unclear whether such a system could have prevented the worst in Stadtallendorf. 'This fire spread at breakneck speed,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-fire-station-fire-alarm-system-blaze-f5abcb52a75886705a77fca5bc6bfd9b	2024-10-17T08:00:41-07:00	
Liam Payne and his bandmates all sought solo success after One Direction fame	LONDON (AP) — One Direction was one of the last boy bands from the age of mass-audience linear television and one of the first of the social media era. That helped propel them to a level of fame comparable to Beatlemania, but with the constant scrutiny of a world of smartphones and streaming. The band members, still in their teens, had to cope with the fame, then navigate the aftermath of its split while trying to build solo careers — challenges that have received renewed attention in the wake of band member Liam Payne's death on Wednesday. One Direction was put together by music mogul Simon Cowell after the teens auditioned separately for TV talent show 'The X-Factor' in 2010. They didn’t win, instead coming third in a final watched by 17 million people in the U.K., a quarter of the population. But they were signed by Cowell and had the first of several No. 1 hits with the now-pop classic 'What Makes You Beautiful' in 2012. British radio host Kevin Hughes called them 'one of the biggest selling U.K. bands since The Beatles, a huge global export and one of the biggest selling pop acts of the 21st century.' One Direction’s appeal rested partly on the members’ cheerful, cheeky ordinariness. The late filmmaker Morgan Spurlock said when he directed a documentary about One Direction in 2013 that 'part of the reason they’ve been so incredibly successful with their fans is that they are so incredibly grounded and normal.' After five studio albums and 70 million records sold, One Direction announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016. All the members embarked on solo careers, with varying degrees of success. LIAM PAYNE Payne, who died at 31 after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina, became one of the main songwriters on One Direction’s albums. His first solo single, 'Strip that Down,' a power pop track featuring rapper Quavo, was a Top 10 hit in Britain in 2017. 'For You,' performed with Rita Ora, was a U.K. hit in 2018. Payne’s debut solo album, 'LP1,' was released in 2019, but didn’t make the U.S. Top 100. Payne had a son, now 7, with the former 'Girls Aloud' singer Cheryl — an 'X Factor' judge during One Direction's season. He was open about struggling with his mental health amid the pressures of fame. He spent time in rehab for alcoholism and in hospital with what he said were kidney problems. After a period of silence, Payne returned with a new single, 'Teardrops,' in March, saying in a statement that it 'marks the start of a new beginning.' The song failed to chart and a second album was reportedly put on hold before his death. ZAYN MALIK Malik precipitated One Direction’s demise when he left the group in 2015, saying he wanted 'to be a normal 22-year-old' for a while. His first solo single, 'Pillowtalk,' was released early in 2016 and topped the charts in both the U.S. and Britain. A duet with Taylor Swift, 'I Don’t Wanna Live Forever,' was a hit late the same year. Malik has released the solo albums 'Mind of Mine' in 2016, 'Icarus Falls' in 2018, 'Nobody is Listening' in 2021 and 'Room Under the Stairs' this year. The most recent adds a country sound to the R&amp;B-pop on which he’s built his career. Malik, who has spoken of struggles with anxiety and anorexia, has a daughter, born in 2020, with his on-off partner, model Gigi Hadid. In 2021, he was sentenced to 90 days’ probation after pleading no contest to harassing Hadid and her mother during an argument at the family home in Pennsylvania. NIALL HORAN The affable Irish member of One Direction released his first single, 'This Town,' in 2016, and debut album 'Flicker' the following year. Showcasing Horan’s talent for tuneful pop, it topped Billboard’s album chart. A second album, 'Heartbreak Weather,' came out in 2020 and a third, 'The Show,' was released in 2023, accompanied by a world tour this year — including a concert in Buenos Aires earlier this month attended by Payne. Horan has also served as a coach on TV talent series 'The Voice' in the U.S. LOUIS TOMLINSON Tomlinson made his solo debut with the single 'Just Hold On' in 2016. Several more singles followed before his debut album, 'Walls,' was released in 2020. It was a Top 10 hit in the U.S. and the U.K., as was his second album, 'Faith in the Future,' released in late 2022. Tomlinson released a live album, 'Live,' in 2024. In 2018, he appeared as a judge on 'The X Factor,' the show that made him famous. Tomlinson's other great love is soccer. He briefly played for his home town team, Doncaster Rovers, and he has been involved with the Soccer Aid charity fundraiser for UNICEF. He has a child with ex-girlfriend Briana Jungwirth. HARRY STYLES Musician, actor and style icon, Harry Styles is easily the biggest solo star spawned by One Direction. He released his first single, 'Sign of the Times,' later than the others, in 2017, but soon made up for lost time. His debut album, 'Harry Styles,' topped the album charts in the U.S., Britain and several other countries, while the second, 'Fine Line,' appeared in 2019 and included the Grammy-winning 'Watermelon Sugar.' His third album, 2022's 'Harry’s House,' topped British and U.S. charts, won album of the year at the Grammys and the Brit Awards, and was nominated for the cred-heavy Mercury Prize. The single 'As it Was' became his biggest hit yet, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for 15 weeks. Styles’ profile has been raised by a playful, adventurous fashion sense that includes a fondness for 1970s-inspired three-piece suits and bellbottomed jumpsuits. As an actor, Styles appeared as a World War II soldier in Christopher Nolan’s 'Dunkirk' before starring alongside Florence Pugh in Olivia Wilde’s dystopian thriller 'Don’t Worry Darling.' It premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival, where Styles’ red-carpet appearance drew throng of fans and the approving appraisal of fashionistas. He also starred in period romance 'My Policeman,' which premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival.	https://apnews.com/article/one-direction-members-solo-careers-liam-payne-188f5c6a452cad49abdbe492fae39b64	2024-10-17T06:38:44-07:00	
7 killed in suicide bomber attack at a cafe in Somalia's capital	MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Seven people died and six others were injured after a suicide bomber detonated an unidentified device at a café outside a police training school in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, police said Thursday. Police say the victims included officers and civilians who were having tea outside the General Kaahiye Police Academy on Thursday. The al-Qaeda linked militant group, al-Shabab, claimed responsibility for the attack through a statement published on its affiliate website. The group has in the past carried out attacks in Somalia. Resident Mohamed Ali said he heard a loud blast. 'The café was full of people enjoying their tea, and then everything was chaos,' he said. A paramedic at Madina Hospital told The Associated Press that several injured people were receiving treatment. 'We are working to rehabilitate the wounded, many of whom sustained severe injuries,' she said. Thursday's attack came two months after 37 people were killed in an attack on a public beach in Mogadishu.

US imposes sanctions on Chinese companies accused of helping make Russian attack drones	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Treasury on Thursday announced sanctions against two Chinese makers of drone engines and parts that the Biden administration said directly helped Russia build long-range attack drones used in the war in Ukraine. The U.S. has previously accused China of providing material support to Russia's military-industrial base to sustain the Kremlin's war against Ukraine, and the latest round of sanctions sought to target the 'direct activity' between Beijing and Moscow, according to senior Biden administration officials, who discussed the sanctions on the condition of anonymity before the measures were announced. Russia’s Garpiya series long-range attack drone, 'designed and produced in the People’s Republic of China in collaboration with Russian defense firms, has been used to destroy critical infrastructure and has resulted in mass casualties' during the war in Ukraine, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. Beijing has insisted that it does not provide weapons to either Ukraine or Russia, and it has defended its trade with Russia as normal and above the board. The U.S. is imposing sanctions on Xiamen Limbach Aircraft Engine Company, which produces drone engines, and Redlepus Vector Industry, which has worked with a Russian entity already facing sanctions to facilitate the shipment of the drones to Russia. The administration officials said China should have known that the Russian entity, TSK Vektor, was a 'problematic actor.' They indicated that the two Chinese firms had been developing long-range attack drones with the Russians since the beginning of the year. The administration also announced sanctions against Artem Mikhailovich Yamshchikov, a Russian national described as the beneficial owner of TSK Vektor, and the Russian entity TD Vector, which has been involved in facilitating the shipments, the officials say.	https://apnews.com/article/china-russia-sanctions-united-states-ukraine-drones-49e4e56bb37ee46faf028f649df140b0	2024-10-17T06:09:34-07:00	
India denies Canadian allegation that it uses mobsters to target Sikh separatists in Canada	NEW DELHI (AP) — India's government on Thursday denied it was working with mobsters to target Sikh separatists in Canada as alleged publicly this week by Canadian officials in an escalating diplomatic dispute. India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal denied that India was in cahoots with India-based mobsters in Canada and even suggested that Canadian authorities had been resisting India's attempts to extradite those people to India. 'It is strange that people who we asked to be deported' are being blamed by the Canadians for 'committing crimes in Canada,' Jaiswal said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and police officials went public this week with allegations that Indian diplomats were targeting Sikh separatists in Canada by sharing information about them with their government back home. They said top Indian officials were then passing that information along to Indian organized crime groups who were targeting the activists, who are Canadian citizens, with drive-by shootings, extortions and even murder. The two sides ordered the expulsion of top diplomats this week in the deepening crisis over the accusations, including Canada’s allegation that t he diplomats were linked to the June 2023 killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The Nijjar killing has soured ties for more than a year, and despite Canada's assertion that it has forwarded evidence of its allegations to Indian authorities, the Indian government continues to deny it has seen any. Jaiswal said again on Thursday that Canada has provided no evidence of its allegations surrounding attacks on Sikh activists, contradicting Trudeau's statements this week that his country’s investigators have privately shared information with Indian counterparts and found them to be uncooperative. At the same time, Jaiswal accused Canada of failing to take action against Sikhs living in Canada who face terrorism charges in India and who are accused of being part of a Sikh secessionist campaign in India’s northern Punjab state. Jaiswal said India’s 26 extradition requests have been pending in Canada for a decade or more. He also said that several criminals had provisional arrest requests pending with Canadian authorities. 'Some of them are charged with terror and terror-related crimes (in India). So far, no action has been taken by the Canadian side on our requests. This is very serious,' Jaiswal said. India has repeatedly criticized the Canadian government for being soft on supporters of what is known as the Khalistan movement, which is banned in India but has support among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada. The Royal Canadian Police said Monday it had identified India’s top diplomat in the country and five other diplomats as persons of interest in the Nijjar killing. The RCMP also said they uncovered evidence of an intensifying campaign against Canadians by agents of the Indian government. Nijjar, 45, was fatally shot last year in his pickup truck after he left the Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland. Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Nijjar’s murder and are awaiting trial.	https://apnews.com/article/india-canada-killing-diplomatic-row-6008c252542cb52af0e19fe41a70d55f	2024-10-17T06:04:55-07:00	
Africa's mpox deaths surpass 1,000 as health officials urge international support	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — The number of mpox -related deaths in Africa has surpassed 1,000, the head of the continent’s top public health agency said Thursday, warning of the continuing threat of cross-border contamination and a lack of rapid test kits. There were 50 mpox-related deaths in the past week, bringing the total to 1,100, indicating that authorities face a challenge in stemming outbreaks currently affecting 18 of the continent's 55 nations, said Jean Kaseya, director general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 'We are still fighting with this outbreak,' Kaseya said. 'We don’t want to see all African countries affected.' Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox but causes milder symptoms, including fever, chills and body aches. People with more serious cases can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals. Kaseya said the trend shows mpox in Africa 'is going out of control if we don’t act,' and urged international partners to honor their pledges to support Africa’s response. 'This is my clear message to our partners. We acknowledge their pledge, but we need quickly to translate pledge into concrete money to support the response,' he said. The estimated budget for a six-month plan put forward by Africa CDC and the World Health Organization is almost $600 million, with 55% allocated to the response to mpox in 14 affected nations and boosting readiness in 15 others. Zambia and Zimbabwe became the latest African countries to confirm mpox cases in the past week, Kenya recorded its first death from mpox, and a case was confirmed in a prison in central Uganda, according to Africa CDC. The case in Zambia was detected in a truck driver. Mpox, also known as monkeypox, had been spreading mostly undetected for years in Africa before a 2022 global outbreak in which wealthy countries quickly responded with vaccines from their stockpiles, while Africa received fewer doses despite pleas from its governments. WHO declared Africa’s outbreaks a global health emergency in August, with Congo as the epicenter. The total number of suspected cases in Africa since the beginning of the year now stands at 42,438, with 8,113 confirmed as mpox, according to Africa CDC. Mpox vaccinations have begun in Rwanda and Congo.	https://apnews.com/article/africa-mpox-deaths-international-help-6830e9c4000b2518ee12efb24cd6b07a	2024-10-17T06:04:00-07:00	
Who is Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar?	Israel says it is looking into the possibility that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza, has been killed in a military operation. His death, which has not yet been confirmed, would be a significant moment in Israel's yearlong offensive against the militant group and could complicate efforts to release dozens of hostages held in Gaza. Sinwar became the head of Hamas after the killing of the previous leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in an explosion in Iran in July that was widely blamed on Israel. Some things to know about Sinwar: From refugee camp to Hamas militant Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in the Gaza town of Khan Younis. He was an early member of Hamas, which was formed in 1987. He eventually led the group's security arm, which worked to purge it of informants for Israel. Israel arrested him in the late 1980s and he admitted to killing 12 suspected collaborators, a role that earned him the nickname 'The Butcher of Khan Younis.' He was sentenced to four life terms for offenses that included the killing of two Israeli soldiers. A prison leader Sinwar organized strikes in prison to improve working conditions. He also studied Hebrew and Israeli society. He survived brain cancer in 2008 after being treated by Israeli doctors. Sinwar was among more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners released in 2011 by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of an exchange for an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid. Rise to Gaza power When Sinwar returned to Gaza, he quickly rose through Hamas' leadership ranks with a reputation for ruthlessness. He is widely believed to be behind the 2016 killing of another top Hamas commander, Mahmoud Ishtewi, in an internal power struggle. Sinwar became head of Hamas in Gaza, effectively putting him in control of the territory, and worked with Haniyeh to align the group with Iran and its proxies around the region while also building the group's military capabilities. The October attack on Israel Sinwar, along with Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas' armed wing, is believed to have engineered the surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and sparked a war that has killed over 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health authorities there. Hamas said it launched the attack in retaliation for Israel's treatment of Palestinians and to push the Palestinian cause back onto the world agenda. The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor sought arrest warrants in May for Sinwar, Deif and Haniyeh for their alleged roles in the attack. Israel said it killed Deif in a strike in July, while Hamas says he is still alive. Where would this leave Hamas? Sinwar has been in hiding since the attack, and cease-fire negotiators have said it can take several days to send and receive messages from him. Even before becoming Hamas' top leader, Sinwar was believed to have the final word on any deal to release hostages held by the militant group. Some 100 hostages remain in Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. It's unclear who would replace Sinwar, and what that might mean for the cease-fire efforts, which sputtered to a halt in August after months of negotiations brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. Hamas has hundreds of thousands of supporters in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Palestinian refugee camps across the region. Several of its top leaders are based in Qatar, which has served as a mediator between Israel and the militant group. Israel has arrested and killed several top Hamas leaders and militant commanders over the years, and the militant group has quickly replaced them. But it has never fought a prolonged war against Israel, which says it has killed dozens of high-ranking militants and over 17,000 fighters, though it has not provided evidence for the latter figure. ___ This story has been updated to correct that not all of the approximately 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack were Israeli. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-sinwar-leader-2963dbc6e8ef040a00e588488cba33e7	2024-10-17T05:30:40-07:00	
Kenya's Parliament removes the deputy president from office in an impeachment trial	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenya’s Senate voted Thursday to remove Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua from office in an impeachment trial on corruption and other allegations, hours after the deputy president was taken to the hospital with chest pains. Senators approved five of 11 grounds for impeachment against Gachagua, making him the first sitting deputy president to be removed from office in impeachment proceedings. The vote on the first of the five counts was 54-13, well above the two-thirds majority required to convict and remove him from office. The lower house of Parliament, the National Assembly, voted 282-44 last week to impeach the deputy president. Gachagua had pleaded not guilty Wednesday to the 11 charges and had been expected to be cross-examined by lawyers from the Assembly in the afternoon. But the hearing was briefly adjourned after Gachagua was hospitalized and his lawyers asked for a pause to give him until Tuesday to appear before the chamber. However, Assembly lawyers said Gachagua's defense already had been presented and that the Senate was bound by the constitution to continue the proceedings. Gachagua faced allegations that included corruption, inciting ethnic divisions and support for anti-government protests that saw demonstrators storm the Parliament The case has highlights divisions within the ruling party of President William Ruto, and friction between Ruto and Gachagua over government policy. The deputy president had been accused of insubordination when he opposed the government's policy of forced evictions during heavy rains that caused flooding and deaths. During his defense before the Assembly last week, Gachagua said he believed the impeachment motion had the president’s nod, and he has asked legislators to make their decision 'without intimidation and coercion.' Ruto has not commented publicly on the impeachment. Gachagua's lawyer Paul Muite said Thursday that doctors told him the deputy president was suffering from 'intense chest pains' and needed 'complete rest.' Dan Gikonyo, a doctor at Karen Hospital, told journalists outside the facility that the deputy president would be observed for up to three days. 'Stress can cause heart problems and the DP is definitely in a lot of stress,' Dr. Gikonyo said. Earlier Thursday, lawyers had cross-examined witnesses presented by the Assembly the previous day, including the legislator who moved the impeachment motion and the anticorruption agency’s boss. At one point Gachagua’s legal team asked to expunge the affidavit of a key witness, the elected governor for the capital Nairobi, after the governor failed to turn up. The tensions over Gachagua's impeachment risk introducing more uncertainty for investors and others in East Africa’s commercial hub. Ruto, who came to office claiming to represent Kenya’s poorest citizens, has faced widespread criticism for his efforts to raise taxes in an effort to find ways to pay off foreign creditors. But the public opposition led him to shake up his cabinet and back off certain proposals.	https://apnews.com/article/kenya-deputy-president-impeachment-7d3348f0cf28a717a7b4bae7ad363a8a	2024-10-17T05:21:40-07:00	
Ukraine's former armed forces chief endorses 'victory plan' in first speech since his dismissal	LONDON (AP) — Ukraine's former commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, on Thursday expressed his support for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan,' despite the tensions between the two that led to his dismissal. 'Ukraine must clearly follow the plan,' Zaluzhnyi said in his first public appearance since his appointment as ambassador to the U.K. He told an audience at London’s Chatham House think-tank: 'But this list of steps primarily concerns those countries that should ultimately be interested in stopping the war.' The plan lays out Ukraine’s view on how to strengthen its positions before any potential negotiations with Russia to end the conflict. After briefing U.S. and other Western officials, Zelenskyy presented the key points publicly during a speech to the Ukrainian parliament on Wednesday. The plan includes a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. Zaluzhnyi asserted that NATO membership is the only viable security guarantee for his country, fully backing President Zelensky’s call for the alliance to extend an invitation to Kyiv. But the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO has left the alliance in a bind, with some members concerned it could escalate the conflict and risk direct confrontation with Russia. 'Declaring yet another freeze in the situation with Ukraine will not work,' said Ukraine’s former commander-in-chief. 'We want to have guarantees of security for ourselves and our children,' he said. Zaluzhnyi, who was in charge of armed forces during Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, said a shortfall in Western support during that period meant that Ukraine lost its chance to fend off Russia on its own. He said that missed opportunity turned the war into a protracted conflict where the way out 'seems rather doubtful and almost impossible,' and allowed Russia the chance to form an alliance with North Korea, Iran and China which Ukraine now cannot defeat without the help of Western partners. 'Against Ukraine now stands not only Russia, but also a quite powerful coalition of strong states,' he said. Such an 'alliance of authoritarian countries' may pose a security threat to the democratic world and the West 'should have made a plan to protect its democratic institutions,' he said. During the presentation of his plan in Brussels on Thursday, Zelenskyy said Kyiv has intelligence information that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being prepared to join Russian forces fighting against his country, warning that a third nation wading into the hostilities would turn the conflict into a 'world war.' Zelenskyy did not go into further details about the claim. As the war grinds through its third year, the mood in Ukraine is grim as its outmanned troops face difficulty holding back Russian advances, especially in the east. Although Moscow’s gains are incremental, the steady forward movement is making Kyiv feel it needs more large-scale Western help. The former armed forces chief stressed that Ukraine is battling Russia, which significantly outweighs it in resources, including in manpower. 'The only thing which works in the war is mathematics,' he said. Zaluzhnyi acknowledged the challenges his country faces with mobilization, emphasizing the need to reform recruitment practices inherited from the times Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union. Despite his popularity, he has faced widespread criticism for failing to meet the army’s need for more troops. Conscription has become a sensitive issue as infantry shortages grow, which became one of the factors that allowed Russia to gain the initiative on the battlefield. 'We had to change it (the system),' he said but adding that Ukraine doesn’t have enough time to do it while the war with Russia lasts. 'The material side does not depend entirely on us, but in working with human resources, everything completely depends on Ukraine,' he said. Tensions between Zaluzhnyi and President Zelenskyy escalated following Ukraine’s 2023 counter-offensive, which failed to achieve significant territorial gains. In February, Zelenskyy dismissed Zaluzhnyi as military commander-in-chief in a move to revitalize efforts in the stalled war. Zaluzhnyi is widely respected among Ukrainian troops and considered a national hero. He is credited with stalling Russia’s full-scale invasion in the early days of the war and expertly pushing back Moscow’s troops. ——— Arhirova contributed from Kyiv	https://apnews.com/article/victory-plan-ukraine-russia-war-zelenskyy-zaluzhnyi-5634fc4a1c17a04b09a64c17b98c6512	2024-10-17T05:18:03-07:00	
After hurricane, with no running water, residents organize to meet a basic need	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) — It takes water to flush a toilet and tens of thousands of North Carolinians have been without it since Hurricane Helene ripped through the state three weeks ago. When Lark Frazier went around asking her Asheville neighbors how they were doing as far as water to flush, several burst into tears over the stress of where to go to the bathroom and what to do with the waste. Some told her they were eating less to avoid going. Others said they were dumping poop in the yard and covering it with leaves. An elderly woman mentioned planning to scoop it out of the toilet with her hands. 'Not only is that horrifying and inhumane but it's dangerous for her to be handling her waste like that,' Frazier said. Since Helene swallowed mountain towns, damaged water infrastructure and killed nearly 250 people across the Southeast, local governments have been overwhelmed, and that's spurred community organizing and innovation. Frazier is one of the newly-minted leaders to have stepped up. She grew up in rural Colorado, using an outhouse for years before her family got a flush toilet. She drew on that experience, then came across the Emergency Toilet Guidebook online, published by the Regional Disaster Preparedness Organization in Oregon. She began fashioning rudimentary toilets and training others to do it, too. The concept is simple: line a sturdy bucket with a thick plastic bag, cover the top with a toilet seat or a water-resistant foam noodle for comfort, then drop in a handful of wood chips or other dry material after every use to absorb liquid and reduce odor. Pee should stay separate. 'Not having waste treated appropriately can absolutely lead to a major public health crisis,' said Sue Mohnkern, who developed the guidebook. Mishandling fecal matter can lead to cholera, dysentery and other serious, even fatal diseases. Mohnkern recommends everybody living in a disaster-prone area have an emergency toilet handy. Neither the city nor the county have released official guidelines on how to manage human waste without water to flush. Frazier called that lack of guidance 'astounding.' County spokesperson Lillian Govus said no county could give sufficient attention to every important issue in a disaster of this scale. City councilwoman Kim Roney has released a video explaining how to use an emergency toilet. The city set up the first water refill sites about a week after Helene, when some 136,000 people across the Southeast had nonoperational water providers, according to the EPA. Around 100,000 were in the Asheville area, although the city says that number has been reduced significantly in the past week. Still, thousands lack water, and it's unclear when it'll be back on. Those who can't get to these refill sites are getting missed, and here again, volunteers fil the gap. Molly Black and Elle DeBruhl, strangers before the storm, now coordinate an army of neighbors from dawn to dusk to get flush water to people. From Florida to Ohio to Texas, people have donated cube-shaped, 250-gallon, white plastic containers known as IBC totes that are often used on farms, in the chemical industry and disasters. A single tote can nearly fill a 6-foot pickup bed. Black and DeBruhl have organized people to haul the totes to ponds, fill them using pumps, then take them to where they're needed, like apartment buildings. Other neighbors and volunteers pick up the work from there, taking buckets of water to residents in need. 'I don’t even feel like I’m living my real life,' said DeBruhl, whose employer EY, a global accounting firm, gave her paid leave to serve her community following the storm. 'I went from a six-man tote operation to now I’m in charge of solving the nonpotable flushing water for the impacted area? Its crazy.' With cell service returned now, residents can text Black and DeBruhl’s grassroots group, Flush AVL — AVL is the shorthand for Asheville — to request a refill when their tote is empty. The group replenishes some 400 sites every other day. The city is helping with some of those, but this stopgap effort to preserve dignity and public health is mainly individuals donating their time and money. Govus applauded the volunteer efforts. 'It helps fill the gaps and meet peoples needs as we're working on systems and major processes to get people food, shelter and water,' she said. Yet another water solution is coming from people who still have water — because they have a well. Erik Iverson lives near a well owned by an urban farm that wanted to help after the hurricane. He laid two 200-foot lengths of plastic PEX pipe to route the well water to the road for public access. Then he added filtration and ultraviolet light in order to offer drinkable water in addition to the flush water (the city, however, recommends boiling all water sources). Now people driving by can access multiple spouts, operated by a foot pedal connected to a chain, touch-free to minimize germs spreading. 'With climate change this is probably not going to the be last time this happens,' Iverson said. 'No matter how resilient Asheville rebuilds their water system, it’s simply poor planning to not have this infrastructure in place to deal with something like this again.' Wine to Water, a global nonprofit focused on clean water, paid for the purification for this and nine other wells whose owners have agreed to community access. The private well owners 'benefit from having purified water on their property, and when this happens again, they can jump right into offering this purified water again. That is resilience,' Iverson said. Yet another grassroots group, Be Well AVL sprang up in the last two weeks and is pulling water from higher-capacity commercial wells offered up by local businesses, distributing it at apartments for low-income, elderly and disabled residents. They can't guarantee it's potable, given the official warning to boil water, but well water is typically cleaner than the pond water being distributed for flushing. Both sources are essential, said Grace Barron, an organizer with Be Well AVL. 'We absolutely need toilets to be flushed,' Barron said. And 'there's this other area of need for sanitation … washing dishes, clothing and bathing,' she said. There are infants in the community, she said, and they shouldn't be bathed in pond water. Barron, an Asheville resident of 18 years, said Hurricane Helene has reminded residents of the caring culture that was a foundation of the city before it ballooned into one of the most expensive places to live in the state. 'Mutual aid has been a part of our community prior to this,' she said. 'The community connections we had before have only grown.' __ Videojournalist Erik Verduzco contributed from Asheville. __ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Hunger experts say the risk of famine in Gaza remains high	The Gaza Strip is still at risk of famine more than a year into the Israel-Hamas war, even as the number of people facing the most extreme level of hunger has declined in recent months, the international authority on hunger crises said Thursday. The findings come after the United States warned Israel that it might cut off military aid if its ally does not do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people there are displaced from their homes and packed into squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters. In recent weeks Israel has once again ordered the evacuation of the northern third of Gaza, and it launched another major military operation there. It allowed no food to enter the north for roughly the first two weeks of October before resuming shipments on Monday. According to the military's own figures, a little over 5,800 tons of food have entered all of Gaza so far this month, compared to nearly 76,000 in September, and not all of those shipments have reached people inside. More than 500 trucks remain trapped on the Gaza side of the border, where the U.N. says it has difficulty retrieving the cargo because of Israeli military operations, lawlessness and other obstacles. In a statement announcing a second shipment on Wednesday, the military said it will continue to act in accordance with international law 'to facilitate and ease the entry of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.' 86% of Gaza's population faces crisis-level hunger or worse The latest findings on hunger in Gaza were released by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, an initiative set up in 2004 during the famine in Somalia that involves more than a dozen U.N. agencies, aid organizations, governments and other groups. It has repeatedly warned of famine over the course of the yearlong war, which was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel. Over 1.8 million people, or around 86% of Gaza's population, are experiencing crisis levels of hunger, defined as Phase 3 or higher on the IPC's five-point scale. Some 133,000 people, or around 6%, are at Phase 5, the highest level, known as catastrophic hunger. That is down from earlier periods of the war, when nearly a third of the population was at Phase 5. The IPC warned the situation could rapidly deteriorate, and that it expects catastrophic hunger levels to double in the coming months. It cited a slowdown in aid in recent weeks, the onset of what is typically a cold and rainy winter, and the harsh conditions people face in crowded tent camps with little in the way of food, clean water or toilets. 'One year into the conflict, the risk of famine persists throughout the whole Gaza Strip as conflict intensifies and winter approaches,' it said in the report. Israel has controlled Gaza's entire land border since May. The Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs, known as COGAT, says it places no limits on humanitarian aid entering the territory and accuses U.N. agencies and aid groups of failing to promptly deliver it. Those groups say their efforts are severely hampered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and displacement, and the breakdown of law and order in many areas. At a public kitchen in central Gaza on Thursday, crowds of women and children lined up with empty pots to receive a thin tomato soup with peas and noodles. 'It’s been two weeks since we had enough food for ourselves and our children. A lot of food items disappeared from the markets because the crossings are closed,' said Mohammed Abed, who was displaced from Gaza City, in the northern part of the territory. 'We used to live a decent life, but now as you can see, we stand at kitchens to get a plate of food and bread,' said Aisha Saliby, who was also displaced from Gaza City. 'End the war and let us go back home safely.' Israel cut aid to the north for 2 weeks as it launched another offensive Israel allowed no food to enter northern Gaza for the first two weeks of October, according to the U.N.'s World Food Program, as it waged a major military operation there that is still ongoing. U.N. humanitarian officials said last week that aid entering Gaza is at its lowest level in months. Most residents of northern Gaza fled after evacuation warnings at the start of the war, and Israel has not allowed them to return. An estimated 400,000 people have remained there despite the harsh conditions. Palestinians say nowhere in the besieged territory feels safe. Many fear Israel will implement a surrender-or-starve plan proposed by former generals calling for a cutoff in aid, and for anyone who ignores evacuation orders to be classified as a militant. The Israeli government has not said whether it has adopted the plan, which rights groups say would violate international law. The IPC report said the latest evacuation orders 'have significantly disrupted humanitarian operations, and repeated displacements have steadily worn down people’s ability to cope and access food, water and medicine, deepening the vulnerability of entire communities.' In a letter over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Israel that if it did not increase the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza within the next 30 days it could risk losing U.S. weapons supplies for the ongoing wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. A similar letter sent in April — after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers — led to an increase in humanitarian aid to the territory. But State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said this week that the supply dwindled again, falling by over 50% from its peak earlier this year. Israel has so far allowed two shipments into northern Gaza this week — a total of 80 trucks — and it says around 430 trucks have entered through the southern Kerem Shalom Crossing since the start of the month. That is far below the 350 trucks a day that the U.S. said were needed. The United States has spent nearly $18 billion on military aid to Israel since the war in Gaza began, according to a report for Brown University’s Costs of War project. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Israel is DNA-testing a body from Gaza to see if it's Hamas' top leader Sinwar, an official says	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Israeli military said Thursday it was looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a military operation in Gaza. Authorities were conducting DNA tests on a body to determine if it is him, an Israeli security official said. The military said in a statement that three militants were killed during operations in Gaza, without specifying where or elaborating further. It said the identities of the three were so far not confirmed, but it was 'checking the possibility' that one of them was Sinwar. The security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said the tests on the body had not yet confirmed if it was Sinwar's. There was no immediate comment by Hamas on the report. Sinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel has vowed to kill him since the beginning of its retaliatory campaign in Gaza. If confirmed, Sinwar's death could be a heavy blow to the militant group. He has been Hamas' top leader inside the Gaza Strip for years, closely connected to its military wing while dramatically building up its capabilities. Sinwar was chosen as Hamas's top leader after his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in July in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. Israel has also claimed to have killed the head of Hamas' military wing Mohammed Deif in an airstrike, but the group has said he survived. President Joe Biden has been briefed on Israel's investigation into whether it killed Sinwar, and U.S. officials have been in close contact with Israeli officials throughout Thursday morning, according to a senior administration official. The report came as Israeli forces continued a more than week-old major air and ground assault in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza. On Thursday, an Israeli strike hit a school sheltering displaced Palestinians, killing at least 15 people, including five children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Fares Abu Hamza, head of Gaza Health Ministry’s local emergency unit, said dozens of people were wounded. He said the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital was struggling to treat the casualties. 'Many women and children are in critical condition,' he said. The Israeli military said it targeted a command center run by Hamas and Islamic Jihad inside the school. It provided a list of around a dozen names of people it identified as militants who were present when the strike was called in. It was not immediately possible to verify the names. Israel has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The Israeli military says it carries out precise strikes on militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its strikes often kill women and children. In a separate development, a building in central Beirut that houses offices of the Al Jazeera news network and the Norwegian Embassy was evacuated after a warning. Mazen Ibrahim, Al Jazeera’s Lebanon bureau chief, said the building’s administration received three calls telling everyone to leave the building, which he said also houses the embassies of Norway and Azerbaijan, as well as dozens of offices. He said it was unclear who called in the warning. Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ragnhild Simenstad said the building was evacuated after a 'bomb threat,' without elaborating. Israel has ordered the evacuation of several buildings, as well as entire cities, towns and villages, as it strikes what it says are targets linked to the Hezbollah militant group. There have also been several instances of evacuation warning calls and text messages that turned out to be bogus, which Lebanese security agencies say they are investigating. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza to eliminate Hamas after the militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. Northern Gaza was the first target of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, with entire neighborhoods in Gaza City and other towns reduced to rubble. Most of the population fled after Israel issued evacuation orders in the opening days of the war, but about 400,000 are believed to have remained despite the harsh conditions. Earlier this month, Israel once again ordered the full-scale evacuation of the north, and allowed no food aid to enter the area for around two weeks. That led many Palestinians to fear that it had adopted a surrender-or-starve strategy suggested by former Israeli generals. Israel allowed two shipments of aid to enter the north earlier this week after the United States warned it might reduce its military aid if its ally did not do more to address the humanitarian crisis. Since the start of the conflict, Israeli forces have launched repeated operations into Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The military says militants have repeatedly regrouped there after major operations. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo, Jeffery from Jerusalem.

Bus carrying Japanese tourists crashes in Turkey, injuring 22	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A bus carrying Japanese tourists veered off a road and crashed into a ditch in Turkey on Thursday, injuring 22 people on board, the state-run news agency reported. The crash occurred on a highway in Afyonkarahisar province, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) southwest of Ankara, the Anadolu Agency reported. The cause of the crash was not immediately known. The injured passengers, including one who was in life-threatening condition, were taken to hospitals in Afyonkarahisar, the agency said.	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-japanese-tourists-bus-accident-441ea260b0328d635762e2f06d5956db	2024-10-17T02:37:36-07:00	
The youngest woman to climb all of the world's 14 tallest peaks calls for novices to be regulated	KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — A British mountaineer who set the record as the youngest female to climb all the 14 tallest mountains in the world said Thursday that inexperienced climbers should not be allowed to climb the highest peaks because they run the risk of endangering their lives and others. Adriana Brownlee, 23, climbed Mount Everest at 20 in 2021 and earlier this month climbed Mount Shishapangma in China, completing her endeavor to scale all 14 peaks over 8,000 meters (26,247 feet) high. She said she has seen numerous climbers who lack training in basic skills and in coping with the unpredictable slopes of the high peaks. 'I have seen many examples of people in the mountains that should not really be there, that should have more training beforehand,' Brownlee told The Associated Press on Thursday in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. 'We have had to support them and have had to help with like small things like how to put on crampons, how to put on harness.' She said mountaineering authorities should ensure that climbers attempting to scale the highest peaks have at least climbed smaller mountains to ensure they can handle the altitude and have the proper skills. Brownlee flew to Nepal this week alongside other climbers from Tibet including Nima Rinji Sherpa, who at age 18 is now the youngest person to climb the 14 peaks. There are generally no rules besides age restrictions on people who want to climb mountains as long as they are able to pay their permit fees. In Nepal, climbers need to be at least 16 years old. Brownlee said she was just 8 years old when she began dreaming of becoming a mountaineer like her father, who she said was her main inspiration. She said she now wants to scale unclimbed peaks in Nepal and explore mountains in other parts of the world. Brownlee and her partner have opened a mountaineering company in Nepal focusing on helping customers who are skilled and experienced enough to handle the harsh condition of the mountains. She said she hopes to inspire other young people to pursue their dreams. 'For me the message is that in life ... you can take any path you like to reach your goal,' she said. 'That goal might be totally unique to you and it's very important to keep at that and not to listen to rest of society what they have to say.'	https://apnews.com/article/nepal-c8acf5f744b838994adde62133f5c23e	2024-10-17T00:37:27-07:00	
Death of ex-One Direction member Liam Payne at 31 sends shockwaves around the world	BUENOS AIRES, Argentine (AP) — Shockwaves spread around the world Thursday at the death of Liam Payne, who shot to stardom as a member of British boy band One Direction and had to deal with intense global fame while still in his teens. Fans, music-industry figures and fellow musicians paid tribute to Payne, 31, who died after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. Buenos Aires police said Payne fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital on Wednesday, resulting in 'extremely serious injuries.' Medics confirmed his death on the spot, the police said in a statement. Pablo Policicchio, the communications director for the Buenos Aires Security Ministry, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Payne 'had jumped from the balcony of his room.' Police rushed to the hotel in response to an emergency call just after 5 p.m. local time, he said, warning of an 'aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.' The hotel manager can be heard on a 911 call obtained by the AP saying they had 'a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol ... He’s destroying the entire room and, well, we need you to send someone, please.' The manager’s voice became more anxious as the call went on, noting the room had a balcony. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, told Argentina’s Todo Noticias TV channel that authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death and conducting an autopsy. Payne was known as the tousle=headed, sensible one of the quintet that went from a TV talent show to a pop phenomenon with a huge international following of swooning fans. In recent years he had acknowledged struggling with alcoholism, posting a video in July 2023 to his YouTube channel where he said he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Representatives for Payne did not immediately return emails and calls. Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood, who performed with One Direction in 2014, said he was 'shocked and saddened.' 'God bless Liam, thinking of all his loved ones. He will be dearly missed,' Wood wrote on X. Paris Hilton also sent condolences on X, saying the news was 'so upsetting.' The Backstreet Boys said in a social media post that their hearts go out to 'Directioners around the world.' Dozens of One Direction fans flocked from across Buenos Aires to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the cordoned-off street outside the hotel where police stood sentinel. Forensic investigators were seen exiting the hotel, from where Payne’s body was removed around three hours after the fall. Young women filming with their cellphones expressed shock and heartbreak as a makeshift memorial with rows of candles and bouquets quickly grew outside the hotel. 'I didn’t think he was going to die so young,' 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told the AP. Payne was one of five members of One Direction, which formed when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series 'The X Factor' in 2010, two years after Payne’s first attempt to get on the show. At 16 the second time around, Payne sang Michael Bublé’s version of 'Cry Me a River,' appearing nervous at the start but warming up with the audience’s cheers and applause. After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands — even though they lost the competition. Each member had their own persona, with Payne — who hailed from Wolverhampton in England's West Midlands region — known as the responsible one. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits like 'What Makes You Beautiful,' 'Night Changes' and 'Story of My Life.' Payne had prominent solos on songs including 'Stole My Heart' and 'Change Your Ticket,' co-writing several of the band’s hits. They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016 and a highly loyal fan base, known as 'Directioners,' many of them teen girls. 'I’ve always loved One Direction since I was little,' said 18-year-old Juana Relh, another fan outside Payne’s hotel. 'To see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable, it kills me.' With his meteoric rise to fame, Payne had said that it took some time to adjust to the public eye. 'I don’t think you can ever deal with that, it’s all a bit crazy for us to see that people get in that sort of state of mind about us and what we do,' he said in a 2013 interview with the AP after recounting an experience where a fan was in a state of shock upon meeting him. One Direction announced an indefinite 'hiatus' in 2016, and Payne — like each of his erstwhile bandmates — pursued a solo career, shifting toward EDM and hip-hop. While Styles became a huge solo star, the others had more modest success. Payne's 2017 single 'Strip That Down,' featuring Quavo, reached the Billboard Top 10, and stayed on the charts for several months. He put out an album 'LP1' in 2019, and his last release — a single called 'Teardrops' — was released in March. In 2020, to mark the 10th anniversary of One Direction, Payne shared a screenshot of a text message he sent to his father on the day he joined the group, which read: 'I’m in a boyband.' 'What a journey… I had no idea what we were in for when I sent this text to my dad years ago at this exact time the band was formed,' he wrote. Payne had a 7-year-old son, Bear Grey Payne, with his former girlfriend, the musician Cheryl who was known as Cheryl Cole when she performed with Girls Aloud. She was an 'X Factor' judge during One Direction’s season, although their relationship began years later. Payne was previously engaged to Maya Henry, from August 2020 to early 2022. Henry released a novel earlier this year that she said was based on their relationship. In addition to his son, he is survived by his parents, Geoff and Karen Payne, and his two older sisters, Ruth and Nicola. ___ Huamani reported from Los Angeles.

Biden is making quick trip to Berlin before US election to discuss Ukraine and democracy with allies	BERLIN (AP) — President Joe Biden has long believed diplomacy is about personal relationships — and he'll spend Friday in Berlin with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz as his time in office is on the cusp of ending. There is also a meeting with other leaders in the 'European Quad,' a group that in addition to Biden and Scholz includes French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described Biden as having a 'close relationship' with Scholz, who early this year helped broker a multicountry prisoner swap that brought back to the United States the journalist Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan. The German leader told Biden before the deal in words to the effect, 'For you, I will do this.' 'He wanted to thank the chancellor for his partnership, for his leadership, as well as with Ukraine,' Jean-Pierre told reporters accompanying Biden on Thursday's Air Force One flight to Berlin. 'He wanted to thank him and so that's what you're seeing on this trip.' The whirlwind trip — Biden departed early Thursday and is due back in the U.S. on Friday night — is hardly a social visit. The U.S. and Germany have been the largest sources of aid to Ukraine as it fights to repel a Russian invasion. And with less than three weeks before the U.S. presidential election, Biden also feels obligated to ready allies for the possible return to the White House of Republican Donald Trump, who has antagonized U.S. friends while displaying an appreciation for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The administration said Biden has no plans while in Europe to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The two spoke on Wednesday about additional military aid, with the White House announcing $425 million in assistance, bringing the total support to more than $64 billion over two and a half years. In addition to Ukraine, Biden and Scholz plan to discuss European Union relations, democratic values, trade and technology issues, global supply chains, tensions in the Middle East and security issues in the Indo-Pacific region. While in Germany, Biden will also meet with its president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Earlier this month, the U.S. president had delayed a trip planned to Germany and Angola in order to oversee relief efforts ahead of Hurricane Milton making landfall in Florida. He now plans to visit Angola in December. The trip to Germany comes as Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has entered an aggressive sprint to persuade and turn out voters in an election that could ultimately determine the future of Biden's legacy of having strengthened NATO and built up relations in Asia to counter China's influence. Trump has questioned America's commitment to defending NATO allies who are attacked, something that Biden called 'un-American' in February. 'The whole world heard it and the worst thing is he means it,' the president said. Trump has talked about applying tariffs on imports from U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, which could potentially strain relations with countries that could counter Russia, China and other rivals. 'Our allies have taken advantage of us more so than our enemies,' Trump said Tuesday at the Economic Club of Chicago. Trump declined to say whether he’s continued to speak with Putin since leaving office in January 2021 but added that it would not be a negative if he and the Russian leader had been in touch. Bob Woodward reorted in his new book 'War' that Trump and Putin have spoken seven times. 'But I will tell you that if I did, it’s a smart thing,' Trump said. 'If I’m friendly with people, if I can have a relationship with people, that’s a good thing and not a bad thing in terms of a country.' Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser, said during Thursday's flight that he didn't know if the reporting was accurate, but 'obviously that would raise red flags if it were true.'	https://apnews.com/article/biden-election-germany-scholz-ukraine-democracy-bb4d92e39eec108ba526eb10f913f714	2024-10-17T00:07:34-07:00	
Bangladesh court issues arrest warrant for ex-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina over deaths of protesters	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — A special court in Bangladesh issued arrest warrants on Thursday for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and 45 others, including her close aides, on charges of crimes against humanity during a student-led uprising in July and August that forced her to flee the country, a prosecutor said. Prosecutor B.M. Sultan Mahmud said the Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the country's interim leader, issued the arrest warrants in response to two petitions submitted by the prosecution. He said the head of the tribunal, Golam Mortuza Majumdar, issued the orders in the presence of other judges. 'The tribunal first accepted our petition that involved Sheikh Hasina alone. Then we moved our second petition against 45 people that involved her close aides and others for the crimes against humanity. It was also accepted by the tribunal,' he said by phone. Hasina fled the country to India on Aug. 5 after weeks of violent protests over government job quotas in which hundreds of people died. Prosecutors said in the petitions that Hasina, her close aides and security agencies were responsible for killing the protesters and others. It is not clear if India will respond to any request from Bangladesh for Hasina's extradition under a mutual treaty. The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Muhammad Tajul Islam, earlier said they would seek help from Interpol, if necessary, to get Hasina back. The Yunus-led interim government has promised to try Hasina and others in her administration for alleged crimes involving the uprising against her and has invited the United Nations to help investigate the killings. Hasina also called for investigation as she questioned the killings, saying many deaths may have involved others beyond security agencies.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-arrest-warrant-isssued-f92d56b9c9930e9c6438c141c20f4b34	2024-10-16T23:51:02-07:00	
Vietnamese real estate tycoon found guilty of billions in fraud in government graft crackdown	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — A Vietnamese real estate tycoon was convicted Thursday of fraudulently obtaining property worth billions of dollars in a case that has been a centerpiece of the government's crackdown on corruption. Truong My Lan was already convicted in April by the same Ho Chi Minh City court of fraud amounting to $12.5 billion — nearly 3% of the country's gross domestic product — in a separate case and sentenced to death by lethal injection. The trials were broken into two parts due to the number of allegations against her, and Thursday's verdict, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, adds to Lan's legal troubles as she awaits the appeal of her death sentence to be heard. Vietnam has handed down more than 2,000 death sentences in the past decades and executed more than 400 prisoners. It is a possible sentence for 14 different crimes but is generally only applied in cases of murder and drug trafficking. 'Standing here today is a price too expensive for me to pay. I consider this my destiny and a career accident,' the VNexpress online newspaper quoted Lan, the chairwoman of property developer Van Thinh Phat, as telling the judges in her closing statement last week. 'For the rest of my life, I will never forget that my actions have affected tens of thousands of families.' Thirty three others were tried as co-defendants in the case but details on the other verdicts were not immediately available. Lan's sentence was expected to be announced later in the day. In addition to obtaining property by fraud, Lan was also convicted of money laundering and illegal cross-border money transfer charges, according to state-run media. She was accused of raising $1.2 billion from nearly 36,000 investors by issuing bonds illegally through four companies, according to state media reports. She was also found guilty of siphoning off $18 billion obtained through fraud and for using companies controlled by her to illegally transfer more than $4.5 billion in and out of Vietnam between 2012 and 2022. It was not immediately clear if Lan would appeal the verdict and no date has yet been set for her appeal of her death penalty conviction to be heard. In the April conviction, she was found to have orchestrated financial fraud amounting to $12.5 billion for illegally controlling a major bank allowing loans that resulted in losses of $27 billion, according to state media reports. Lan’s arrest in October 2022 was among the most high-profile in an ongoing anti-corruption drive in Vietnam that has intensified since 2022. The Communist Party's 'blazing furnace' campaign has also touched the highest echelons of Vietnamese politics. Former President Vo Van Thuong resigned in March after being implicated in the campaign. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined, including former President Nguyen Xuan Phuc and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue, both of whom resigned. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo have been ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016. The anti-corruption drive began in 2013, but it wasn’t until 2018 that authorities began scanning the private sector. Since then, several owners of Vietnam’s fast-growing businesses have been arrested. The campaign had been the hallmark of Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam’s top politician. who died earlier this year at age 80. The ideologue had called corruption a grave threat to the party and vowed that the campaign would be a 'blazing furnace' in which no one was untouchable. In another high-profile case, business tycoon Trinh Van Quyet was found guilty in August of defrauding stockholders of nearly $150 million by falsely inflating the value of his company. The Hanoi People's Court sentenced Quyet to 21 years in prison and convicted 49 co-defendants on a variety charges, with sentences ranging from probation to multiple years in prison. Lan and her family established the Van Thinh Phat company in 1992 after Vietnam shifted from a state-run economy to a more market-oriented approach that was open to foreign investors. She started out helping her mother, a Chinese entrepreneur, sell cosmetics in Ho Chi Minh City’s oldest market, according to the state media outlet Tien Phong. Van Thinh Phat became one of Vietnam’s richest real estate companies, with projects including luxury residential buildings, offices, hotels and shopping centers. This made her a key player in the country’s financial industry. Lan’s first trial shocked many Vietnamese. Analysts said the scale of the scam raised questions about whether other banks or businesses had similarly erred, dampening Vietnam’s economic outlook and making foreign investors jittery at a time when Vietnam is trying to position itself as the ideal home for businesses trying to diversify supply chains away from China. ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.	https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-tycoon-death-trial-corruption-lan-b63f5a33af8dcee3f4662b3360ce764c	2024-10-16T22:42:07-07:00	
Ukrainian president Zelenskyy heads to EU, NATO to seek backing for his 'victory plan'	BRUSSELS (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will seek support from European Union leaders on Thursday for what he is calling his ' victory plan ' to end the devastating war with Russia. Zelenskyy will address EU leaders at their summit in Brussels before shuttling across town to meet with NATO defense ministers. The EU is a key supporter of Ukraine — a candidate member of the 27-nation bloc — as it fights Russia's invasion that began more than 2 1/2 years ago. Zelenskyy outlined the five-point plan to Ukraine’s parliament on Wednesday without disclosing confidential elements that have been presented in private to key allies, including the United States. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was muted in his response to the plan on Wednesday. On Thursday he said that Kyiv can rest 'absolutely assured that 32 allies are united in making sure that collectively, we will do whatever is needed to make sure that Ukraine can prevail, that (asterisk)Russian President Vladimir) Putin will not get his way.' Rutte reiterated that Ukraine’s place is among NATO’s ranks, but he would not say when it might join. Zelenskyy insists that a membership invitation is central to his 'victory plan' and would provide his country with the ultimate security guarantee to protect it from Russia. 'Ukraine will be a member of NATO in the future,' Rutte said. 'The question is exactly about the ‘when.’ I cannot answer that now.' However, Rutte said, Putin must understand that 'we are in this, if necessary, for the long haul. And obviously we want to be in a place where Zelenskyy and Ukraine, from a position of strength, is able to start talks with Russia.' Major points of the plan include an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russia — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. A draft copy of EU summit conclusions — a text that will likely be tweaked before publication at the end of Thursday's meeting — reaffirms the bloc's 'unwavering commitment to providing continued political, financial, economic, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes and as intensely as needed. Russia must not prevail.' Thursday's talks in Brussels come as Ukrainian troops are struggling to hold off better-equipped Russian forces, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where they are gradually being pushed back. Kyiv is surviving with Western help, but Ukraine says it is coming too slowly. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda criticized slow Western decision-making over Ukraine and said it 'would be a great mistake to think that our hesitance is the best way to de-escalation.' If Western allies bolstered support to Kyiv, leading to gains on the ground for Ukrainian forces, 'then I think Putin would be pressed to go to negotiations table. Right now, he thinks he is prevailing,' he said when entering the EU summit. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said EU leaders 'have to give a strong signal and unified signal that we continue to support Ukraine as much and as long as needed.' At their summit in Washington in July, the 32 NATO members declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership. But for now, NATO is in a holding pattern. Its biggest and most powerful member, the United States, is facing a presidential election. European allies expect little movement on Ukraine until a new president takes office in January. Beyond that, the United States and European heavyweight Germany remain deeply concerned about being dragged into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia, and they lead a group of countries that oppose allowing Ukraine to join NATO until the conflict ends. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-zelenskyy-europe-victory-plan-summit-863bd5c70816449e3c92b7c1f767a2ff	2024-10-16T22:25:23-07:00	
Middle East latest: 28 killed in Israeli strike on shelter in Gaza, Palestinians say	Palestinian officials reported at least 28 dead, including four children, in an Israeli strike on a school being used as a shelter in Gaza on Thursday. Nearly 100 people were wounded in the strike in Jabaliya, according to the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency unit in the north. The Israeli military said it is looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a separate military operation in Gaza. Authorities were conducting DNA tests on a body to determine if it is him, an Israeli security official said. Syria’s military said an Israeli strike early Thursday wounded two civilians and damaged a military post. Israel regularly targets military sites in Syria linked to Iran and to Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group and has escalated its campaign against Hezbollah in recent weeks, after a year of near-daily exchanges of cross-border fire. Lebanon says more than 2,300 people have been killed in the past year and 77% of public schools are out of service, either due to their use as shelters or their location in areas directly affected by the war. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. Israel’s military says it has allowed 50 trucks of humanitarian aid into northern Gaza on Wednesday, after the United States warned it to boost aid efforts or risk losing weapons funding. The region has suffered heavy destruction and has been completely encircled by Israeli forces for nearly a year. ___ Here's the latest: Palestinian officials say death toll in Gaza school strike rises to 28 DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say the death toll from an Israeli strike on a school where displaced people were sheltering has risen to 28. The Israeli military said the strike on Thursday targeted dozens of militants who were meeting inside the school in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza. Fares Abu Hamza, head of the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency unit in the north, said the death toll had climbed to 28, with another 98 people wounded. Israel has been waging a large military operation in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war, for more than a week now. It has once again called on all residents of northern Gaza to flee south, and it allowed no food aid to enter the north for around two weeks at the start of the month. Its forces have repeatedly returned to Jabaliya and other areas of Gaza after saying that militants had regrouped there. Philippines evacuate dozens of workers from Lebanon MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine government has evacuated dozens of Filipino workers from Lebanon, including one who urged thousands of compatriots to leave the war-hit nation before it’s too late. The 45 Filipino workers and two children who arrived Thursday in the Philippine capital were a fraction of about 10,000 to 11,000 Filipinos, many of whom have refused to leave their jobs in Lebanon for their poverty-stricken homeland. 'I hope they would return home because it has become too dangerous there,' Felicilda Aboc, a 56-year-old who has worked for 18 years as a house helper in Lebanon, told reporters at Manila’s international airport. She recounted how a powerful blast two days ago shook the house where she worked. The Philippine government has offered free chartered flights, cash and new livelihood training to encourage Filipinos in Lebanon to return home but has yet to issue a mandatory evacuation order. 'I was told that even if the bombs are in front of them, they may not go home as long as they still have employers,' Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega said of the many Filipinos in Lebanon. Israel's military looking into whether Hamas leader Sinwar was killed in Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it is looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a military operation in Gaza. The military said in a statement Thursday that three militants were killed during operations in Gaza, without elaborating. It said the identities of the three were so far not confirmed, but it was 'checking the possibility' that one of the three was Sinwar. Sinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. He was chosen as the group’s top leader following the assassination of Ismael Haniyeh in July in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. German military says it intercepted drone off Lebanese coast BERLIN — The German military says a German navy ship deployed to the U.N. peacekeeping mission off the Lebanese coast has intercepted and brought down a drone. The military said a defense system on board the corvette, the Ludwigshafen am Rhein, brought the drone down in the water around 5 a.m. Thursday and that the drone’s explosive load detonated in the process. It said it did not know where the drone came from. The military didn’t specify the location of the ship at the time of the incident. The Ludwigshafen am Rhein is currently participating in the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon. Germany also has soldiers at the mission’s headquarters in Naqoura. Norwegian embassy in Beirut evacuated after receiving bomb threat OSLO, Norway — Norway's foreign ministry said the Norwegian embassy in Beirut was evacuated received a 'bomb threat' on Thursday. No one has been injured. A spokeswoman said the small number of Norwegian diplomats in Beirut were all safe. 'The acts of war in Lebanon make the security situation very unpredictable and tense. This threat is another example of that,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ragnhild Simenstad said. 'The Foreign Ministry is continuously assessing the situation, including the safety of our colleagues who work in Beirut. The embassy has already implemented measures, as we have routines for in situations like this.' Strike on Gaza school-turned-shelter kills at least 15 An Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people in northern Gaza on Thursday killed at least 15 people, including four children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The Israeli military said the strike targeted dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who had gathered at the school. The strike hit the Abu Hussein school in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp in northern Gaza where Israel has been waging a major air and ground operation for more than a week. ___ This item has been corrected to show four children were confirmed dead in the strike, not five.

Hezbollah official says the group will keep fighting ‘with all available means’ BEIRUT — A Hezbollah official says that the aim of the group’s military command is to keep fighting 'with all available means' to prevent Israel from achieving its goals and to eventually agree on a cease-fire. Legislator Hassan Fadlallah told reporters that since Israel’s invasion began on Oct. 1, Israeli troops have not been able to capture any village. Fadlallah said the aim of his group now is to stop the war but he refused to go into details saying that Lebanon’s parliament speaker and caretaker prime minister are leading the efforts. 'Our goal today is to end the aggression. We will not go into any detail related to the mechanism or solutions,' he said when asked whether Hezbollah still insists that it will only stop fighting once Israel’s offensive on Gaza stops. Fadlallah said that Israel has not been able to push deeper into Lebanon, stop Hezbollah rocket fire or create the conditions for its citizens to return to communities in the north near the border, which Israel says is its main war aim. Strike on Gaza tent camp kills 3 DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli strike on a tent camp in the Gaza Strip killed three men and wounded eight other people, including women and children. The bodies were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah after the strike on Thursday. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The military says it carries out precise strikes on militants who shelter among civilians, putting them in danger. Hamas-led militants triggered the war when they stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. Iranian foreign minister makes rare visit to Egypt to discuss tensions CAIRO -- Iran’s foreign minister has paid a rare visit to Egypt to discuss regional tensions linked to Israel’s war with Iran-allied groups in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Abbas Araghchi met with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sissi and other top officials on Thursday to discuss ways of de-escalating tensions, according to an Egyptian statement. Egypt was the first Arab country to make peace with Israel and is a close U.S. ally. Araghchi visited Jordan, another close U.S. ally, on Wednesday. Israel has vowed to respond to an Iranian ballistic missile attack earlier this month, raising fears of a regionwide war that could draw in the U.S. and its allies. Egypt and Jordan have repeatedly called for a cease-fire in Gaza, and Egypt has been a key mediator between Israel and Hamas. Israel says it has killed local Hezbollah commander JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it has killed a local Hezbollah commander in a southern Lebanese town near the border. The military said Thursday that an airstrike on Bint Jbeil killed Hussein Awada, who it said was in charge of firing projectiles into Israel from areas near the town. Israeli strikes in recent weeks have killed Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Also on Thursday, the Israeli military warned people to stay away from two buildings in the eastern villages of Saraaine and Tamnine, in the Bekaa Valley, where Israel has carried out scores of airstrikes over the past two weeks. Iranian commander repeats threats to Israel TEHRAN, Iran — The chief of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard threatened Israel on Thursday with more missile barrages if it strikes Iran. 'Do not repeat your mistake — if you misbehave, if you strike anything of ours either in the region or in Iran, we will again hit you painfully,' said Gen. Hossein Salami in a funeral ceremony for Iranian Guard commander Abbas Nilforoushan, who was killed alongside the head of the Hezbollah militant group in Beirut in September. Salami said a missile barrage by Iran on Israel earlier in October in retaliation of killing Nasrallah and Nilforoushan was the 'tiniest' action by Iran. He said an air defense battery deployed to Israel by the U.S. will not prevent Iranian retaliation. 'We do know about your weakness, and you know too,' said Salami. Earlier this month, Iran launched some 180 missiles at Israel in retaliation for the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, killed in Iran in July, as well as Nilforoushan and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who were killed in Israel strikes on Beirut in September. Iran is the main backer of Hezbollah and supports militant groups opposed to Israel across the region including Hamas. An Israeli strike wounds 2 in Syria, its military says DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s military says Israel carried out a strike early Thursday in the coastal city of Latakia, wounding two civilians and damaging a military post. The military statement that was carried by state media did not give further details. Israel regularly targets military sites in Syria linked to Iran and to Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group. Those strikes have become more frequent after exchanges of fire along the Lebanon-Israel border began in October 2023, with Hezbollah attacking Israeli posts in support of the Palestinians and its ally, Hamas. The exchanges intensified over the past three weeks, and on Oct. 1, Israel began a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. US B-2 stealth bombers strike bunkers of Yemen’s Houthi rebels DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Long-range American B-2 stealth bombers launched airstrikes early Thursday morning targeting underground bunkers used by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, officials said. It wasn’t immediately clear what damage was done in the strikes. However, there are no previous reports of the B-2 Spirit being used in the strikes targeting the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014. They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties. United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the B-2 bombers targeted 'five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' The strike also appeared to be an indirect warning to Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, which has targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks twice over the past year. The nuclear-capable B-2, which first saw action in 1999 in the Kosovo War, is rarely used by the U.S. military in combat as each aircraft is worth some $1 billion.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-17-october-2024-b250e3c9d313e617d96977e406dea947	2024-10-16T21:41:36-07:00	
European Central Bank, seeing no signs of recession, cuts interest rates again	LONDON (AP) — The European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 20 countries that use the euro currency, does not expect the bloc to slide into recession as it cut borrowing costs once again Thursday in the wake of recent data showing inflation across the bloc falling to its lowest level in more than three years, and economic growth waning. The bank’s rate-setting council lowered its benchmark rate from 3.5% to 3.25% — its third reduction since June — at a meeting in Llubljana, Slovenia, rather than its usual Frankfurt, Germany, headquarters, and said the 'disinflationary process is well on track.' According to revised figures on Thursday, inflation across the 20-country eurozone, sank to 1.7% in September, the first time in three years that it has been below the ECB’s target rate of 2%. In a statement accompanying the decision, the ECB predicted an inflation pick-up in the coming months, before a return to its target in the course of next year. In a press briefing following the decision, ECB President Christine Lagarde gave few signals that the bank would be cutting interest rates again at the next policy meeting in December, stressing that the governing council is 'not pre-committing to a particular rate path.' She insisted that decisions will 'follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach.' Lagarde did acknowledge that the recent data on economic activity had come in 'somewhat weaker than expected,' pointing to a contraction in manufacturing sector and weaker exports. Even though Germany, Europe's powerhouse economy, saw output shrink in the second quarter, albeit by 0.1%, Lagarde said that she she didn't expect the eurozone economy overall to fall into recession, though she did note the downside risks that could emanate from the conflict in the Middle East and any new tariffs that Donald Trump may impose on European goods should he become U.S. president again. 'On the basis of the information that we have, we certainly do not see a recession,' she said. Economists think mounting evidence of an economic slowdown in the eurozone, particularly in Germany, will pile pressure on rate-setters to consider another cut to help bolster growth by making it even cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow. In the second quarter of the year, the eurozone expanded by a modest quarterly rate of 0.2%. 'Although the ECB did not pre-commit to any specific rate path, we believe that downside risks to growth in a context of easing inflationary pressure will lead to more rate cuts starting in December and continuing in 2025,' said GianLuigi Mandruzzato, senior economist at EFG Asset Management. The ECB, which was created in 1999 when the euro currency was born, started raising interest rates in the summer of 2021, taking them up to a r ecord high of 4% in Sept. 2023 to get a grip on inflation by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow, but that has come at a cost by weighing on growth. One reason why inflation has fallen around the world — it's down at 2.4% in the U.S. and 1.7% in the U.K. — is that central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, which pushed up energy costs. Other central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, have also started to cut interest rates as inflation rates have fallen.	https://apnews.com/article/european-central-bank-interest-rates-inflation-4b2545966c179c893a8ff34421a2530f	2024-10-16T21:07:36-07:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street drifts around its records as the US economy keeps humming	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are drifting around their records Thursday following the latest signals that the U.S. economy continues to hum. The S&amp;P 500 was 0.1% higher in midday trading and flirting with its record set early this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was adding 99 points, or 0.2%, to its own all-time high set the day before, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time. Nvidia and other companies in the chip industry were helping to lead the way after global heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. TSMC credited strong demand related to smartphones and artificial intelligence, and its stock that trades in the United States jumped 13.1%. The 2.5% rise for Nvidia was the strongest force pushing upward on the S&amp;P 500, and it was a sharp turnaround from earlier in the week when a warning from a major Dutch supplier to the chip industry, ASML, sent stocks sinking across the industry. Because Nvidia and other tech stocks have grown so big, their movements pack extra weight on the S&amp;P 500 and other indexes. Treasury yields were also rising in the bond market following the latest encouraging reports on the U.S. economy. U.S. retailers made more in sales in September than in August, and underlying growth trends within the data were better than economists expected. The strength was 'all the more impressive in the face of stretched household finances, particularly among lower-income shoppers, and pre-election jitters,' according to Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. A separate report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, a signal that layoffs nationwide are relatively low and aren’t damaging the job market. Such data bolster the hope that has sent U.S. stocks to records: The economy could make a perfect escape from the worst inflation in generations, one that doesn’t end with a recession that many investors worried was nearly inevitable. And with the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to help the economy keep humming, the expectation among optimists is that stocks can rise even further. Critics, meanwhile, warn that stock prices look too expensive given how much faster they've climbed than profits for companies. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, boost prices for investments and make borrowing bills less costly for households and businesses. And rates are heading lower around the world, with only a couple exceptions. The European Central Bank on Thursday cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. That helped send stock indexes higher by 1.3% in France and 0.7% in Germany. They halted a run of losses that began the day in Asian stock markets, where Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1%. On Wall Street, insurer Travelers was another winner and rose 7.8% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Higher income made from its investments and elsewhere helped cover greater losses due to Hurricane Helene and severe wind and hail storms in multiple states. Blackstone also helped push indexes higher after the investor in real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments reported stronger profit than expected. It climbed 4.5% after CEO Stephen Schwarzman said it's seeing broad-based acceleration across its businesses. They helped offset a 12.7% drop for Elevance Health, which reported weaker profit for the latest quarter than expected. The Blue Cross-Blue Shield insurer also cut its forecast for profit for the full year, saying it was dealing with a 'timing mismatch' between Medicaid rates and higher claims from customers. CSX fell 4.8% after falling short of analysts’ profit expectations for the latest quarter. The railroad also expects only modest volume growth the rest of the year as the Southeast rebuilds after two major hurricanes. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.09% from 4.02%. The two-year yield, which moves more closely with expectations for action by the Fed, rose to 3.98% from 3.94%. All the strong recent reports on the U.S. economy have forced traders to abandon bets that the Federal Reserve could cut its main interest rate by another half a percentage point in November. Instead, they're largely betting the Fed will move forward with a traditional-sized cut of a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group. That shift in expectations has helped push Treasury yields higher. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-earnings-17ae24422a6dd5c641f94597b0d99b1f	2024-10-16T20:13:22-07:00	
How a broke Argentine province is countering Milei's deep austerity cuts	LA RIOJA, Argentina (AP) — They look like cash, fit into wallets like cash and the governor promises they’ll be treated like cash. But these brightly colored banknotes aren’t pesos, the depreciating national currency of Argentina, or U.S. dollars, everyone’s money of choice here. They are chachos, a new emergency tender invented by the left-wing populist governor of La Rioja, a province in the country's northwest that went broke when far-right President Javier Milei slashed federal budget transfers to provinces as part of an unprecedented austerity program. 'Who would have imagined that one day I’d find myself wishing I’d gotten pesos?' said Lucia Vera, a music teacher emerging from a gymnasium packed with state workers waiting to get their monthly bonus of chachos worth 50,000 pesos (about $40). Across La Rioja's capital, 'Chachos accepted here' decals now appear on the windows of everything from chain supermarkets and gas stations to upscale restaurants and hair salons. The local government guarantees a 1-to-1 exchange rate with pesos, and accepts chachos for tax payments and utilities bills. But there’s a catch. Chachos can’t be used outside La Rioja, and only registered businesses can swap chachos for pesos at a few government exchange points. 'I need real money,' said Adriana Parcas, a 22-year-old street vendor who pays her suppliers in pesos, after turning down two customers in a row who asked if they could buy her perfumes with chachos. The bills bear the face of Ángel Vicente 'Chacho' Peñaloza, the caudillo, or strongman, famed for defending La Rioja in a 19th-century battle against national authorities in Buenos Aires. A QR code on the banknote links to a website denouncing Milei for refusing to transfer La Rioja its fair share of federal funds. After entering office in December 2023, Milei swiftly imposed his shock therapy in a bid to reverse decades of budget-busting populism that ran up Argentina's monumental deficits. The cuts squeezed all of Argentina’s 23 provinces but boiled over into a full-blown crisis in La Rioja, where the public payroll accounts for two-thirds of registered workers and the federal government’s redistributed taxes cover some 90% of the provincial budget. With just 384,600 people and little industry beyond walnuts and olives, La Rioja received more discretionary federal funds than any other last year except Buenos Aires, home to 17.6 million people. Yet the province’s poverty rate tops 66% — the result, critics say, of a patronage system long used to placate interest groups at the expense of efficiency. While Milei's reforms forced other provinces to tighten their belts and lay off thousands of employees, Governor Ricardo Quintela — an ambitious power broker in Argentina’s long-dominant Peronist movement and one of Milei’s fiercest critics — refused to absorb the strife of austerity. 'I’m not going to take food from the people of La Rioja to pay the debt that the government owes us,' Quintela told The Associated Press, portraying his chacho-printing plan as a daring stand against 10 months of crumbling wages, rising unemployment and deepening misery under Milei. La Rioja defaulted on its debts in February and August. A New York federal judge ordered the province to pay American and British bondholders nearly $40 million in damages in September. Argentina’s Supreme Court is taking up the case of the province’s refusal to charge consumers sky-high prices for electricity after Milei’s removal of subsidies. 'There’s an alternative path to the cruelty of policies that the president is applying,' Quintela said. He appeared confident, speaking as Milei’s approval ratings dipped below 50% for the first time since the radical economist came to power. But as Milei and his allies tell it, Quintela’s alternative offers little more than a return to Argentina’s habitual Peronist preserve of reckless spending — and insolvency — that delivered the unmitigated crisis that his government inherited. 'You were used to having your tie fastened for you and your shoes polished, but now, you’ve got to tie the knot yourself,' Eduardo Serenellini, press secretary of Milei’s office, snapped at La Rioja business leaders on a recent visit to the province. 'When you run out of cash, you run out cash.' Serenellini picked up a chacho note, then flicked it away like lint. Gov. Quintela’s gambit in the remote province has had little effect on Argentina’s federal finances, but that could change if more cash-trapped provinces catch on, as happened during Argentina’s terrible financial crisis of 2001, when a similarly brutal austerity scheme sent over a dozen provinces scrambling to print their own parallel currencies. Unlike two decades ago, when former President Néstor Kirchner, a Peronist, put an end to the chaos by redeeming 'patacones,' 'cecacores' and 'boncanfores' for pesos, President Milei has ruled out a bailout for La Rioja. 'We will not be accomplices to irresponsible people,' Milei warned in a recent interview with Argentine TV channel Todo Noticias. But the libertarian purist added that he couldn’t stop La Rioja from doing what it pleased, considering that Argentina's constitution allows for such desperate financial work-arounds. The chacho hit the streets in August after La Rioja’s legislature approved plans to run off $22.5 billion pesos worth of the currency to help cover up to 30% of public sector salaries. With La Rioja’s average income sinking below $200 per month and stores shuttering for lack of business, authorities doled out 8.4 billion pesos worth of the scrip in monthly bonuses in August and September, an effort to help workers cope with Argentina’s 230% annual inflation and spur the stricken local economy. To encourage the chacho's use, authorities promise to pay interest of 17% on bills held to maturity on December 31. 'The closer we get to the expiration date, the more we’ll see public confidence in the chacho increase,' said provincial treasurer advisor Carlos Nardillo Giraud. Most state workers interviewed in the many chacho lines spilling onto La Rioja’s sidewalks last month said they wanted to get rid of the bills as quickly as possible. 'Now the chacho is an alternative, an option for people who can’t make it to the end of the month,' said 30-year-old physics teacher Daniela Parra, mounting her boyfriend’s motorcycle with arms full of chachos, ready to spend them all in one go at the supermarket. 'Who knows what will it be next month?' On the streets, merchants said they felt locked in a catch-22. Rejecting chachos meant turning away customers with new spending power in a deep recession. But accepting chachos meant filling cash registers with money that’s worthless to foreign suppliers and already changing hands at a discount to pesos on the street. 'They've formed a system where you're forced to depend on the state for everything,' said Juan Keulian, the director of La Rioja’s Center for Commerce and Industry. 'There’s no choice in a place like this.' ___ Follow AP's Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-fake-money-economic-crisis-milei-peronism-bankrupt-province-30d478ec8292ccce27cb450ea1bb1c1a	2024-10-16T19:06:14-07:00	
Japan records trade deficit on weak yen, slowing exports	TOKYO (AP) — Japan racked up a trade deficit of 294.3 billion yen ($2 billion) in September, according to Finance Ministry data released Thursday, as exports fell to key destinations like China. For the first half of the April to March fiscal year, Japan’s trade deficit, or its imports subtracted from exports, was 3.1 trillion ($21 billion), the preliminary report showed. Japan’s exports in September fell 1.7% from the same month a year earlier in the first such decline in 10 months. Imports grew 2.1% from the previous year, on the back of a weak yen, which inflates their value. It was unclear if the drop, which was unexpected, reflected weaker demand in other major economies, since exports to other Asian countries rose. It also could be partly due to temporary disruptions like a recent typhoon. But slowing global demand remains a long-term worry for export-dependent Japan. The U.S. dollar has been trading at 149 yen Japanese yen levels recently, not far from its level a year ago but up from about 120 yen two years ago. Inflation and rising energy prices have also pushed up import costs. Exports rose 6.6% for the months from April through September to 53.55 trillion yen ($358 billion) as demand remained strong for computer chips. Imports grew 7% during that period to 56.66 trillion yen ($379 billion), as Japanese businesses and shoppers bought more U.S. products, the report said. In the first half of fiscal 2024, Japan recorded a nearly 4.3 trillion yen ($29 billion) trade surplus with the United States and a 3 trillion yen ($20 billion) deficit with China. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/japan-trade-energy-deficit-currency-583416dd5f2ded1e1ca9667149342683	2024-10-16T18:50:29-07:00	
US long-range B-2 stealth bombers target underground bunkers of Yemen's Houthi rebels	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. long-range B-2 stealth bombers launched airstrikes early Thursday morning targeting underground bunkers used by Yemen's Houthi rebels, officials said. It wasn't immediately clear what damage was done in the strikes. However, there are no previous reports of the B-2 Spirit being used in the strikes targeting the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014. They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the B-2 bombers targeted 'five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' The strike also appeared to be an indirect warning to Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor, which has targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks twice over the past year. The B-2 would be used in any American attack on hardened Iranian nuclear facilities like Natanz or Fordo given it is the only aircraft in service that can drop the GBU-57, known as the 'Massive Ordnance Penetrator.' 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,' Austin said. Austin and the U.S. military's Central Command offered no immediate assessment on the damage done. However, Central Command said in a statement that initial assessments suggested no civilians had been killed. The Red Sea has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships traveling through the waterway, which once saw $1 trillion of cargo pass through it yearly. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel and have shot down a number of U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper drones. The rebels have threatened new attacks in response to Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon and its killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The description and locations named by the Houthis on Thursday correspond to known underground bases operated by the rebels, who have been locked into a stalemated war with a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 that’s decimated the Arab world’s poorest nation. The Houthis have refurbished tunnels that once held Scud missiles for Yemen when it was ruled by strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh during his 33-year reign, according to an analysis in April by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Those sites include the al-Hafa and Jabal Attan military bases, the former Presidential House and the Yemen state television compound in Sanaa, analyst Fabian Hinz wrote. The Houthis have built what appears to be their own large-scale tunnel network near Saada as well, Hinz added. 'The fact that the Houthis began constructing major new installations after the agreement of the cease-fire with the Saudi-led coalition suggests that the group is focused on entrenching themselves and bolstering their military capabilities,' he wrote. Iran similarly relies on a network of underground missile bases. The nuclear-capable B-2, which first saw action in 1999 in the Kosovo War, is rarely used by the U.S. military in combat as each aircraft is worth some $1 billion. It has dropped bombs in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya as well. The aircraft are based at Whiteman Air Base in Missouri and typically conduct long-range strikes from there, though some B-2s were in Australia in September.	https://apnews.com/article/us-airstrikes-yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-99721f7f952d66d6da27e24dc3c189c3	2024-10-16T18:18:47-07:00	
Aging farmers face extreme temperatures as they struggle to maintain Japan's rice crop	KAMIMOMI, Japan (AP) — In the remote village of Kamimomi in Japan’s western Okayama prefecture, a small group of rice farmers began their most recent harvest in sweltering heat, two weeks sooner than usual. The prefecture is called 'the Land of Sunshine' because of its pleasant climate, but farmers working among the paddy fields and ancient rice terraces say that climate change is hurting the harvest of rice, long a cornerstone of Japan’s diet. 'Last year, an exceptional heat wave took the water out of the rice, which became small and thin,' rice farmer Joji Terasaka said. 'So I am worried about that this year because it will be just as hot.' This year Japan experienced its hottest July on record, with temperatures reaching 2.16 C (3.9 F) higher than average, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The globe has seen a 1.2 C (2.2 F) rise in average temperature since preindustrial times, and scientists agree that warming needs to be capped at 1.5 C (2.7 F) to stave off the worst effects of climate change. That includes even more powerful heat, storms and irreversible ice melt. Last year, Japan recorded a poor rice harvest nationwide because of exceptionally hot weather. Ministry data showed the country’s private-sector rice inventory fell to 1.56 million tons in June, the lowest level since records began in 1999. Last year was the hottest on record globally, though it’s feared that this year may top it. The drop in harvest in Japan was partly to blame for this year’s widespread summer rice shortage, according to officials. There were empty shelves in supermarkets, and some retailers are still enforcing purchase limits of one rice bag per customer. 'Perhaps people think that an increase of one degree Celsius in average temperature isn’t much. But it’s quite a big change for plants and crops,' says Yuji Masutomi, a researcher at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, north of Tokyo. Masutomi said the rising temperatures not only influence the growth cycle and yield of rice, but also hurt the quality of the grain. When temperatures rise above 27 C, the buildup of starch inside rice grains is reduced. That causes the crop to take on a chalky appearance, and its value is reduced. At least a fifth of rice farms have reported a drop in quality from rising temperatures, according to a farming ministry report last year. 'Not only is the appearance not good; people say the taste drops too,' Masutomi said. For farmers in Kamimomi, there's another problem with working under exceptional heat. The average age of agricultural workers in Japan is nearly 69, among the oldest in the world, and older people are especially vulnerable to heatstroke. Toshimi Kaiami led a community project in Kamimomi that involved reviving some of the paddy fields abandoned because of the aging population. 'There are no longer any successors,' says Kaiami. 'We are heading toward extinction.' The community project divides labor among Kamimomi's farmers. But preparations for the harvest coincided with the hottest months of the year — April to September. 'It takes a half year to produce rice. The heat and the work that we have to endure during that time is really tough,' said rice farmer Mitsumasa Sugimoto, 77. To deal with climate change, the government is promoting the adoption of heat-resistant rice variants, including Sai no Kizuna, which was developed by a research center in Saitama prefecture, near Tokyo. Research organizations around the world have worked to produce more resilient strains of essential food like rice while introducing more heat and drought resistant grains like sorghum or millet. 'Last year and this year have been extremely hot, but even in those conditions, Sai no Kizuna maintained a certain level of quality,' said Naoto Ohoka, who manages rice breeding at Saitama’s Agricultural Technology Research Center. 'Its other characteristic is that it is very delicious.' The center cultivates more than a thousand types of rice strains, and through cross-pollination officials assess and select the best performers to develop new varieties. Sai no Kizuna was developed in 2012 to better withstand heat, a trait that has become more widely recognized recently as Japan sees hotter summers. The strain also stands up well against typhoon wind and certain pests and diseases. Researchers want to develop more resilient strains against heat as temperatures are projected to continue rising. Masutomi recommends that variants tolerant of temperatures up to 3 degrees Celsius higher should be introduced across Japan by the 2040s. But it’s a long process. It can take up to 10 years to develop a new variant. Once it’s approved for the market, farmers must then be convinced to switch to the new strain. The most widely grown variety is Koshihikari, which is less heat resistant. Even so, older farmers have shown a reluctance to switch to other varieties. Farming ministry data show that only around 15% of Japanese paddy fields have adopted heat resistance variants.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-climate-change-rice-farming-struggle-a569237462e65426587d48876145e825	2024-10-16T18:09:13-07:00

Liam Payne, former One Direction member, dies at 31 in Argentina hotel fall	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Former One Direction singer Liam Payne, 31, whose chart-topping British boy band generated a global following of swooning fans, was found dead Wednesday after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, local officials said. Buenos Aires police said in a statement that Payne fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina's capital, resulting in 'extremely serious injuries.' Medics confirmed his death on the spot, the statement said. Pablo Policicchio, the communications director for the Buenos Aires Security Ministry, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Payne 'had jumped from the balcony of his room.' Police rushed to the hotel in response to an emergency call just after 5 p.m. local time, he said, warning of an 'aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.' The hotel manager can be heard on a 911 call obtained by the AP saying they had 'a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol ... He’s destroying the entire room and, well, we need you to send someone, please.' The manager's voice became more anxious as the call went on, noting the room had a balcony. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, told Argentina’s Todo Noticias TV channel that authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death and conducting an autopsy. Payne had been vocal about struggling with alcoholism, posting a video in July 2023 to his YouTube channel where he said he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Representatives for Payne did not immediately return emails and calls. Dozens of One Direction fans flocked from across Buenos Aires to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the cordoned-off street outside the hotel where police stood sentinel. Forensic investigators were seen exiting the hotel, from where Payne’s body was removed around three hours after the fall. Young women filming with their cellphones expressed shock and heartbreak as a makeshift memorial with rows of candles and bouquets quickly grew outside the hotel. 'I didn’t think he was going to die so young,' 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told the AP. Payne was one of five members of One Direction, which formed when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series 'The X Factor' in 2010, two years after Payne's first attempt to get on the show. At 16 the second time around, Payne sang Michael Bublé’s version of 'Cry Me a River,' appearing nervous at the start but warming up with the audience’s cheers and applause. After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands — even though they lost the competition. Each member had their own persona, with Payne — who hailed from Wolverhampton, a city in the West Midlands region of England — being known as the responsible one. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits like 'What Makes You Beautiful,' 'Night Changes' and 'Story of My Life.' Payne had prominent solos on songs including 'Stole My Heart' and 'Change Your Ticket,' co-writing several of the band's hits. They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016 and a highly loyal fan base, known as 'Directioners,' many of whom were teen girls. 'I’ve always loved One Direction since I was little,' said 18-year-old Juana Relh, another fan outside Payne’s hotel. 'To see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable, it kills me.' With his meteoric rise to fame, Payne had said that it took some time to adjust to the public eye. 'I don’t think you can ever deal with that, it’s all a bit crazy for us to see that people get in that sort of state of mind about us and what we do,' he said in a 2013 interview with the AP after recounting an experience where a fan was in a state of shock upon meeting him. After the group's dissolution, Payne — like each of his erstwhile bandmates — pursued a solo career, shifting toward EDM and hip-hop. His 2017 single 'Strip That Down,' featuring Quavo, reached the Billboard Top 10, and stayed on the charts for several months. He put out an album 'LP1' in 2019, and his last release — a single called 'Teardrops' — was released in March. Payne had a 7-year-old son, Bear Grey Payne, with his former girlfriend, the musician Cheryl who was known as Cheryl Cole when she performed with Girls Aloud. She was an 'X Factor' judge during One Direction's season, although their relationship began years later. Payne was previously engaged to Maya Henry, from August 2020 to early 2022. Henry released a novel earlier this year that she said was based on their relationship. In addition to his son, he is survived by his parents, Geoff and Karen Payne, and his two older sisters, Ruth and Nicola. ___ Huamani reported from Los Angeles.

North Korea says its revised constitution defines South Korea as 'hostile state' for first time	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea confirmed Thursday that its recently revised constitution defines South Korea as 'a hostile state' for the first time, two days after it blew up front-line road and rail links that once connected the country with the South. The back-to-back developments indicate North Korea is intent on escalating animosities against South Korea, increasing the danger of possible clashes at their tense border areas, though it’s highly unlikely for the North to launch full-scale attacks in the face of more superior U.S. and South Korea forces. The official Korean Central News Agency said Thursday that its recent demolition of parts of the northern sections of the inter-Korean road and rail links was 'an inevitable and legitimate measure taken in keeping with the requirement of the DPRK constitution which clearly defines the ROK as a hostile state.' DPRK stands for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name, while ROK stands for Republic of Korea, the South's formal name. South Korea’s Unification Ministry condemned North Korea’s constitutional reference to South Korea as a hostile state, calling it 'an anti-unification, anti-national act.' It said the South Korean government will sternly respond to any provocations by North Korea and unwaveringly push for a peaceful Korean unification based on the basic principle of freedom and democracy. North Korea’s rubber-stamp parliament met for two days last week to rewrite the constitution but state media hadn't provided many details about the session. Leader Kim Jong Un had earlier called for the constitutional change at that parliamentary meeting to designate South Korea as the country’s main enemy, remove the goal of a peaceful Korean unification and define North Korea’s sovereign, territorial sphere. Thursday's KCNA dispatch gave no further details of the new constitution, except the description of South Korea. 'There may still be an internal propaganda review underway about the appropriate way to disclose the constitutional revisions, but this confirmation was expected,' said Ankit Panda, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Kim’s order in January to rewrite the constitution caught many foreign experts by surprise because it was seen as eliminating the idea of shared statehood between the war-divided Koreas and breaking away with his predecessors’ long-cherished dreams of peacefully achieving a unified Korea on the North’s terms. In the past months, North Korea has torn down monuments symbolizing rapprochement with South Korea and abolished state agencies handling inter-Korean relations. Some experts say Kim likely aims to guard against South Korean cultural influence and bolster his family's dynastic rule. Others say Kim wants legal room to use his nuclear weapons against South Korea by making it as a foreign enemy state, not a partner for potential unification which shares a sense of national homogeneity. They say Kim may also want to seek direct dealings with the U.S. in future diplomacy on its nuclear program, not via South Korea. 'North Korea has fallen so far behind the South that any social exchange or financial integration might look like paths to unification by absorption,' said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. 'Pyongyang’s rejection of peaceful Korean unification is thus a strategy for regime survival and maintaining domestic control. This not only bodes ill for diplomacy but could also become an ideology motivating military aggression against Seoul,' Easley said. KCNA, citing North Korea’s Defense Ministry, reported that North Korea on Tuesday blew up the 60-meter (197 feet)-long sections of two pairs of the roads and railway routes — one pair on the western portion of the inter-Korean border and the other on the eastern side of the border. Largely built with South Korean money, the road and rail links were once a major symbol of now-dormant inter-Korean reconciliation movements. In the 2000s, the two Koreas reconnected the road and rail routes for the first time since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but their operations were halted later as the rivals bickered over North Korea's nuclear ambitions and other issues. Last week, North Korea said it would permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures. South Korean officials said North Korea had been adding anti-tank barriers and laying mines along the border since earlier this year. Animosities between the Koreas increased in recent days, with North Korea accusing South Korea of flying drones over its capital Pyongyang three times this month and vowing strong military responses if similar incidents happen again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea will face a regime demise if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened. Many observers say North Korea won't likely launch a full-blown war because it knows its military is outgunned by the U.S. and South Korean forces, and that North Korea ultimately aims to use its advancing nuclear program as leverage to wrest sanctions relief from the U.S. But they say a miscalculation could still lead to border clashes. Intense outside attention has been on whether the North Korean constitutional change includes new legal, territorial claims around the Koreas' disputed western sea boundary, the site where several deadly skirmishes and bloodsheds happened in the past 25 years. 'South Korea and the United States need not overreact to North Korean moves. The recent drone incident raises the possibility of miscalculation and escalation,' Panda, the expert, said.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-constitution-change-enemy-12a1ec860d84b106265d35676cb1a0b3	2024-10-16T12:56:11-07:00	
Helene and Milton are both likely to be $50 billion disasters, joining ranks of most costly storms	Monstrous hurricanes Helene and Milton caused so much complex havoc that damages are still being added up, but government and private experts say they will likely join the infamous ranks of Katrina, Sandy and Harvey as super costly $50-billion-plus killers. Making that even more painful is that most of the damage — 95% or more in Helene's case — was not insured, putting victims in a deeper financial hole. Storm deaths have been dropping over time, although Helene was an exception. But even adjusted for inflation, damages from intense storms are skyrocketing because people are building in harm's way, rebuilding costs are rising faster than inflation, and human-caused climate change are making storms stronger and wetter, experts in different fields said. 'Today’s storms, today’s events are simply vastly different from yesterday’s events. One of the things that we’re seeing is the energy content that these systems can retain is significantly greater than it used to be,' said John Dickson, president of Aon Edge Insurance Agency, which specializes in flood coverage. 'The weather seems to be, in many cases, moving faster than we as a society are able to keep pace with it.' In the last 45 years, and adjusted for inflation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has counted 396 weather disasters that caused at least $1 billion in damage. Sixty-three of those were hurricanes or tropical storms. The $50 billion mark for direct losses is a threshold that differentiates 'truly historic events,' said Adam Smith, the economist and meteorologist who runs the list out of NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information in Helene-hit Asheville, North Carolina. Only eight hurricanes reached that threshold. Smith said he thought Milton and Helene have 'a very good shot' of joining that list. The first $50 billion hurricane was Andrew in 1992. The U.S. went 13 more years before Katrina topped the damages chart, then seven years until the third costly whopper, Sandy. Helene and Milton would make seven in the last seven years. Calculating damages is far from an exact science. The more complex and nastier storms are — like Milton and Helene — the longer it takes, Smith said. Damage is spread over different places and often a much larger area, with wind damage in some places and flood damage elsewhere. Helene, in particular, caused widespread flooding and in places not used to it. Estimates for those storms from private firms in recent days vary and are incomplete. There's three categories of damage: insured damage, uninsured damage and total economic cost. Many risk and insurance firms only estimate insured losses. Homeowner insurance usually covers wind damage, but not flood. Special insurance has to be bought for that. Flood insurance coverage rates vary by region and storms differ on whether they cause more wind or water damage. Helene was mostly water damage, which is less likely to be covered, while Milton had a good chunk of wind damage. Of the top 10 costliest hurricanes as compiled by insurance giant Swiss Re — not including Helene or Milton yet — insured damage is about 44% of total costs. But with Helene, Aon's Dickson estimated that only 5% of victims had insurance coverage for the type of damage they got. He estimated $10 billion in insured damage so doing the math would put total damage in the $100 billion to $200 billion range, which he called a bit high but in the ballpark. Insured losses for Milton are in the $50 billion to $60 billion range, he said. With Helene, Swiss Re said less than 2% of Georgia households have federal flood insurance, with North Carolina and South Carolina at 3% and 9%. In North Carolina's Buncombe County, where more than 57 people died from Helene's flooding, less than 1% of the homes are covered by federal flood insurance, the agency said. Risk modeling by Moody's, the financial services conglomerate, put a combined two-storm total damage estimate of $20 billion to $34 billion. Karen Clark and Company, a disaster modeling firm that uses computer simulations superimposed on storm and insurance data, wouldn't give total damage estimates for the storms. But the company figured insured losses alone were $36 billion for Milton and $6.4 billion for Helene. 'The economic losses are going up because we're putting more infrastructure and housing in harm's way,' said University of South Carolina's Susan Cutter, co-director of the Hazards Vulnerability and Resilience Institute, who added that climate change also plays a role. 'Human losses and deaths are going down because people are being a little bit more vigilant about paying attention to preparedness and getting out of harm's way.' Much of the damage is because of flooding. Studies show that hurricanes are getting wetter because of the buildup of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Basic physics dictates that clouds hold 4% more moisture for every degree Fahrenheit (7% for every degree Celsius), and that falls as rain. 'There is scientific agreement that floods and flooding from these hurricanes is becoming more frequent and more severe. So it is likely that we’re going to be seeing a higher frequency of storms like Helene in the future,' said Karen Clark, who founded her namesake firm. 'It’s not really an insurance issue because it’s not privately insured. This is really a societal issue and political question. How do we want to deal with this?' Clark and several of the experts said it's time for society to think about where it builds, where it lives and if it should just leave dangerous areas and not rebuild, a concept called 'managed retreat.' 'At what point do you as an individual continue to build, rebuild, rebuild and rebuild versus saying ‘OK, I’ve had enough',' Cutter said. And when it comes to flood insurance, many homeowners in risky areas find it's too expensive, so they don't buy it, Clark said. But when a storm hits them, she said 'all of us as taxpayers, we're going to pay it because we know there are going to be federal dollars coming into those areas to help people rebuild. So all taxpayers, we're actually paying for people to live in risky areas.' __ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ______ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Trudeau says police went public with Indian diplomat allegations to prevent further violence	TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday that Canada's national police force went public with its allegations against Indian diplomats this week because it had to disrupt violent acts in Canada including drive-by-shootings, extortions and even murder. The Royal Canadian Police said Monday it had identified India’s top diplomat in the country and five other diplomats as persons of interest in the June 2023 killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The RCMP also said they uncovered evidence of an intensifying campaign against Canadians by agents of the Indian government. 'We are not looking to provoke or create a fight with India,' Trudeau said. 'The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada. We need to respond in order to ensure Canadians safety.' Niijar's killing has strained bilateral relations between India and Canada for over a year and boiled over this week as the countries expelled each other’s top diplomats over those allegations and other alleged crimes in Canada. Trudeau said he has tried not to 'blow up' relations with India and that Canadian officials provided evidence privately with their Indian counterparts who, he said, have been uncooperative. 'The decision by the RCMP to go forward with that announcement was entirely anchored in public safety and a goal of disrupting the chain of activities that was resulting in drive by shootings, home invasions, violent extortion and even murder in and across Canada,' Trudeau said while testifying Wednesday before the Foreign Interference Commission in Ottawa. Trudeau said Indian diplomats have been passing information about Canadians to the highest levels of the Indian government which was then shared with organized crime, resulting in violence against Canadians. 'It was the RCMP's determination that that scheme needed to be disrupted,' he said. RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme said Monday police have evidence allegedly tying Indian government agents to other homicides and violent acts in Canada. He declined to provide specifics, citing ongoing investigations, but he said there have been well over a dozen credible and imminent threats that have resulted in police warning members of the South Asian community, notably the pro-Khalistan, or Sikh independence, movement. Trudeau said India has violated Canada’s sovereignty. India has rejected the accusations as absurd. India has repeatedly criticized Trudeau’s government for being soft on supporters of the Khalistan movement who live in Canada. The Khalistan movement is banned in India but has support among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada. Nijjar, 45, was fatally shot in his pickup truck after he left the Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland. Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Niijar’s murder and are awaiting trial. Trudeau noted his government could have gone public with the allegations when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted the G20 Summit in September 2023, but chose not to. He met with Modi and expressed concerns privately then. 'It was a big moment for India welcoming all the leaders of the world to New Delhi for a very important summit and we had the opportunity of making it a very uncomfortable summit for India if we went public with these allegations ahead of time,' said Trudeau. 'We chose to continue to work with India behind the scenes to try and get India to cooperate with us.' Trudeau said that when he returned home India's response, particularly through the media, was to attack Canada. Trudeau later went public in Parliament with the allegation that the Indian government might have been involved in Niijar’s killing. He said there were about to be media stories detailing the allegation of India's possible involvement in the killing of a Canadian Sikh on Canadian soil. He said he went public because of worries about public safety. Canada’s foreign minister on Monday said violence in Canada has worsened since then. The British government said India should cooperate with Canada’s investigation into accusations that its government has been involved in an escalating number of violent crimes in Canada. In a statement, the British Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office said India's cooperation with Canada’s legal process 'is the right next step.' A U.S. State Department spokesman told a news conference Tuesday that the U.S. had long been asking India to cooperate with Canadian authorities.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-india-diplomats-violence-80e9a0d43faa7db99781563434d0f1e0	2024-10-16T10:35:35-07:00	
Long-ruling party leads in Mozambique's election as opposition candidate calls for strikes	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Mozambique's ruling party candidate held a clear lead in early presidential election results Wednesday as his main challenger said he would not accept them and called them fraudulent. Daniel Chapo of the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, is on course to win the vote, according to the provincial results, and succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served a maximum two terms. Frelimo has been in power in the southern African nation since independence from Portugal in 1975. Opposition candidate Venancio Mondlane, who is running as an independent, was second behind Chapo in the early count but repeated his claims that last week's election was marred by fraud and manipulation by Frelimo. Mondlane has also called on Mozambicans to hold a national strike on Monday in protest at what he called the 'deceit of the most shameful level of the regime.' Frelimo has often been accused of election rigging, which it denies. Many analysts raised concerns ahead of this election, saying Frelimo manipulates voter lists and traditionally has officials loyal to it working at polling stations. Mondlane and his supporters held a march in the northern city of Nampula on Wednesday, which was broken up by police. Police said Mondlane did not keep to an agreed route for the march and also accused him of encouraging his supporters to confront officers. Four people were arrested, police said. Frelimo has won every national election in Mozambique since the country's first in 1994. Frelimo came to power at independence but then fought a bloody 15-year civil war against rebel group Renamo, which later became the main opposition party and also contested this election. Mondlane was a member of the Renamo party before breaking away months before the election and standing as an independent. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-frelimo-vote-6987692541d92a9c6a287be4af89a524	2024-10-16T10:30:58-07:00	
Italy expands its ban on surrogacy to overseas as critics say it targets same-sex couples	ROME (AP) — Italy on Wednesday criminalized citizens who go abroad to have children through surrogacy, a measure slammed by opponents as 'medieval' and discriminatory to same-sex couples. The measure extending a surrogacy ban in place since 2004 was promoted by Premier Giorgia Meloni's far-right Brothers of Italy party and its conservative coalition partner, the League, asserting that it protects women’s dignity. The Senate after a seven-hour debate passed the bill 84-58, the final step in the process after the Lower House's approval last year. Italians seeking surrogacy in countries such as the United States or Canada, where the practice is legal, can face up to two years in jail and up to 1 million euros ($1.1 million) in fines. The surrogacy ban applies equally to all couples. But same-sex parent advocates say it hits gay families particularly hard in a country struggling with record-low birthrates and where only heterosexual couples are allowed to adopt. Same-sex marriages are also banned in Italy, and LGBTQ+ couples have been fighting to obtain parental rights for the partner who is not the biological parent. Several lawmakers and LGBTQ+ activists protested in front of the Senate to oppose the law, some holding banners that read: 'Parents, not criminals.' 'When protectionism prevails, a social phenomenon is not erased,' opposition lawmaker Riccardo Magi said during the protest. 'It is simply relegated to a dark area, which the law doesn't reach. In that case, it’s easier for exploitation, abuse and rights violations to prevail.' 'We are very saddened because Italy has once again missed an opportunity to demonstrate that it is a country in line with what Europe and the world are,' said Cristiano Giraldi, the father of two 10-year-old children born from a surrogate mother in the U.S. The Catholic Church has strongly opposed surrogacy in Italy and abroad, with Pope Francis calling for a universal ban and criticizing what he called the 'commercialization' of pregnancy. At the same time, the Vatican’s doctrine office has made clear that same-sex parents who resort to surrogacy can have their children baptized. While commercial surrogacy contracts are common in the U.S. — including protections for mothers, guarantees of independent legal representation and medical coverage — they are banned in parts of Europe including Spain and Italy.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-surrogacy-pregnancy-overseas-ban-lgbtq-3f1181480a71a01166b38540e7c25103	2024-10-16T10:08:22-07:00	
A German in charge of England? Nationality matters less than it used to in international soccer	The question was inevitable. At his first news conference as England’s newly appointed head coach, Thomas Tuchel – a German – was asked on Wednesday what message he had for fans who would have preferred an Englishman in charge of their beloved national team. 'I’m sorry, I just have a German passport,' he said, laughing, and went on to profess his love for English football and the country itself. 'I will do everything to show respect to this role and to this country.' The soccer rivalry between England and Germany runs deep and it’s likely Tuchel’s passport will be used against him if he doesn’t deliver results for a nation that hasn’t lifted a men’s trophy since 1966. But his appointment as England’s third foreign coach shows that, increasingly, even the top countries in the sport are abandoning the long-held belief that the national team must be led by one of their own. Four of the top nine teams in the FIFA world rankings now have foreign coaches. Even in Germany, a four-time World Cup winner which has never had a foreign coach, candidates such as Dutchman Louis van Gaal and Austrian Oliver Glasner were considered serious contenders for the top job before the country’s soccer federation last year settled on Julian Nagelsmann, who is German. 'The coaching methods are universal and there for everyone to apply,' said German soccer researcher and author Christoph Wagner, whose recent book 'Crossing the Line?' historically addresses Anglo-German rivalry. 'It’s more the personality that counts and not the nationality. You could be a great coach, and work with a group of players who aren’t perceptive enough to get your methods.' Not everyone agrees. English soccer author and journalist Jonathan Wilson said it was 'an admission of failure' for a major soccer nation to have a coach from a different country. 'Personally, I think it should be the best of one country versus the best of another country, and that would probably extend to coaches as well as players,' said Wilson, whose books include 'Inverting The Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics.' 'To say we can’t find anyone in our country who is good enough to coach our players,' he said, 'I think there is something slightly embarrassing, slightly distasteful about that.' That sentiment was echoed by British tabloid The Daily Mail, which reported on Tuchel’s appointment with the provocative headline 'A Dark Day for England.' While foreign coaches are often found in smaller countries and those further down the world rankings, they are still a rarity among the traditional powers of the game. Italy, another four-time world champion, has only had Italians in charge. All of Spain’s coaches in its modern-day history have been Spanish nationals. Five-time World Cup winner Brazil has had only Brazilians in charge since 1965, and two-time world champion France only Frenchmen since 1975. And it remains the case that every World Cup-winning team, since the first tournament in 1930, has been coached by a native of that country. The situation is similar for the women’s World Cup, which has never been won by a team with a foreign coach, though Jill Ellis, who led the U.S. to two trophies, is a naturalized U.S. citizen born in England. Some coaches have made a career out of jumping from one national team to the next. Lars Lagerbäck, 76, coached his native Sweden between 2000-09 and went on to lead the national teams of Nigeria, Iceland and Norway. 'I couldn’t say I felt any big difference,' Lagerbäck told The Associated Press. 'I felt they were my teams and the people’s teams.' For Lagerbäck, the obvious disadvantages of coaching a foreign country were any language difficulties and having to adapt to a new culture, which he particularly felt during his brief time with Nigeria in 2010 when he led the African country at the World Cup. Otherwise, he said, 'it depends on the results' — and Lagerbäck is remembered with fondness in Iceland, especially, after leading the country to Euro 2016 for its first ever international tournament, where it knocked out England in the round of 16. Lagerbäck pointed to the strong education and sheer number of coaches available in soccer powers like Spain and Italy to explain why they haven’t needed to turn to an overseas coach. At this year’s European Championship, five of the coaches were from Italy and the winning coach was Luis de la Fuente, who was promoted to Spain’s senior team after being in charge of the youth teams. Portugal for the first time looked outside its own borders or Brazil, with which it has historical ties, when it appointed Spaniard Roberto Martinez as national team coach last year. Also last year, Brazil tried — and ultimately failed — to court Real Madrid’s Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti, with Brazilian soccer federation president Ednaldo Rodrigues saying: 'It doesn’t matter if it’s a foreigner or a Brazilian, there’s no prejudice about the nationality.' The United States has had a long list of foreign coaches before Mauricio Pochettino, the Argentine former Chelsea manager who took over as the men’s head coach this year. The English Football Association certainly had no qualms making Tuchel the national team’s third foreign-born coach, after Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson (2001-06) and Italian Fabio Capello (2008-12), simply believing he was the best available coach on the market. Unlike Eriksson and Capello, Tuchel at least had previous experience of working in English soccer — he won the Champions League in an 18-month spell with Chelsea — and he also speaks better English. That won’t satisfy all the nay-sayers, though. 'Hopefully I can convince them and show them and prove to them that I’m proud to be the English manager,' Tuchel said. ___ AP Sports Writer Jerome Pugmire in Paris contributed to this story. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/tuchel-foreign-coaches-445022a9a692846545bb3ccdae6a9b93	2024-10-16T10:04:30-07:00	
A Palestinian student was asleep in his tent at a hospital when an Israeli strike brought an inferno	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Shaban al-Dalu was sleeping in his tent in a central Gaza hospital's courtyard, still recuperating from wounds from an Israeli strike on a mosque a week earlier, when a new strike hit, setting off an inferno. The 19-year-old university student and his 38-year-old mother, Alaa al-Dalu, were among five people killed as the blaze ripped through a tent camp sheltering hundreds of Palestinian families in the courtyard of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah. Dozens of others, including children, were severely burned. Al-Dalu and his mother were sleeping in the tent along with his father and three siblings when the strike hit at around 1:30 a.m. on Monday. Mohammed al-Dalu, his fifth sibling, was sleeping nearby at his vendor's table when the explosion jolted him awake. He found his father and uncle, who lived in a neighboring tent, struggling to pull their families out of the fire The father, Ahmed al-Dalu, said he managed to rescue two of his sons and his daughter, but not his wife or eldest child, Shaban. 'My son was being burned in front of me,' he said, speaking at the hospital with burns on his face. 'I accepted the will of God in every sense of the word.' The Israeli military said it targeted militants hiding out among the displaced, without providing evidence to support its claim. It was the 7th Israeli attack on this hospital compound since March; three of them occurred in September, according to Doctors without Borders, which supports the hospital. The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 hostages. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. It has displaced more than 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.3 million people. Over the course of the war, the military has repeatedly raided hospitals and struck crowded shelters and tent camps, alleging that Hamas fighters were using them as staging grounds for attacks, without showing evidence. Monday's strike brought chaos at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, as firefighters and displaced people attempted for hours to put out the blaze, using small fire extinguishers and buckets of water. Several secondary explosions went off, but their cause was not known. The courtyard was left covered in burned-out wreckage of shed and tents, made of wood and plastic sheets, with people's belongings inside. 'It’s a scene of devastation. Tents caught on fire while people were sleeping,' said Eliza Sabatini, a nurse with Doctors Without Borders who was working at the hospital. More than 60 people, including 10 children and 8 women, were wounded, most suffering severe burns. One man sobbed as he carried a toddler with a bandaged head in his arms. Another small child with a bandaged leg was given a blood transfusion on the floor of the packed Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, where many wounded were rushed. Shaban al-Dalu, who would have turned 20 on Wednesday, memorized the Quran when he was young and cared for his siblings. A university student studying computer science, he would post videos on social media telling people his family’s displacement stories and his dream of leaving Gaza. In a video posted in March, filmed from their tent in the hospital's courtyard, he said his family fled their home in Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood just after the war began in October last year. Since then, he said, they had moved five times to escape fighting. 'We live in a very hard circumstance,' he said in the video. He launched an online fundraiser hoping to make enough money to get his family to Egypt. By Wednesday, it had raised more than $24,200 — though no one has been been able to leave Gaza since Israeli troops seized the crossing with Egypt in May. 'I used to have big dreams, but the war has ruined them,' he wrote on his GoFundMe page. 'Time feels like it’s stopped in Gaza, and we’re stuck in a never-ending nightmare.' On Oct. 6, he was reciting the Quran in a mosque near the hospital when an Israeli airstrike hit the place of worship, his brother Mohammed said. Shaban suffered a head wound that required 11 stitches and was still recuperating in the tent when Monday's strike hit. Shaban's father and the three siblings in the tent have all been left severely burned, some up to 70% of their body, Mohammed said. The body of his 11-year-old brother Adbel-Rahman is completely covered in bandages, and his sister's back and the left side of her face were badly burned, he said. Shaban's uncle, Abdel-Hayy al-Dalu, recalled how the families had thought they were safe when they arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. 'We built tents - me and my brother - and sheltered here,' he said. 'We ruled out that it will be bombed since it’s a hospital.' After rescuing his wife and two daughters, Abdel-Hayy rushed to his brother’s tent, hoping to save his nephew and sister-in-law. 'We couldn’t help them,' he said. 'We were helpless.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-gaza-860f97a1fdab484aaec3a2a66ad39b5e	2024-10-16T09:45:04-07:00	
NATO shows no sign of letting Ukraine join soon and wants more details about its 'victory plan'	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO showed no sign Wednesday it would invite Ukraine to join anytime soon as allies sought more information from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about his 'victory plan' for ending the war with Russia. The plan centers on a request for NATO to move forward on the 'accelerated' membership application that Zelenskyy made two years ago to seek protection under the military alliance's security umbrella after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. NATO’s credibility is based on its collective security guarantee, Article 5 of its founding treaty. It’s a commitment by all 32 member countries to come to the aid of any member whose sovereignty or territory might be under attack. However, it does not apply to a partner country like Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte declined to welcome the 'victory plan,' saying only that he and the allies 'take note' of it. He did not discuss when Ukraine might join the world’s biggest military alliance, beyond insisting that it would become a member. 'The plan has many aspects and many political and military issues we really need to hammer out with the Ukrainians to understand what is behind it, to see what we can do, what we cannot do,' Rutte said in his muted response at NATO headquarters in Brussels. 'We are in close contact with allies, with Ukraine, to see how we can take next steps,' he added. He declined to provide details about what more NATO wants to know, telling reporters only: 'I cannot give you all the insights about that.' For now, Rutte said, the focus must be on helping Ukraine to win back more territory and strengthen its hand for any future peace negotiations. Zelenskyy is due to explain elements of his plan on Thursday to leaders of the European Union, most of whom also stand among NATO's ranks. It all comes at a dark time for Ukraine. Its troops are struggling to hold off better manned and equipped Russian forces, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where they are gradually being pushed back. Kyiv is surviving with Western help, but Ukraine says it is coming too slowly. While outlining his plan on Wednesday, Zelenskyy told Ukrainian lawmakers that granting the country a NATO invitation would be a 'testament of (allies’) determination' to support its efforts. 'An invitation is a strong decision that requires nothing but determination,' he said. Ukraine’s future in NATO is something the alliance has weighed for 16 years. At their summit in Washington in July, the 32 members declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership. To the uninitiated, however, little seems to have progressed since NATO leaders promised Ukraine and Georgia in 2008 that 'these countries will become members of NATO' one day. For now, NATO is in a holding pattern. Its biggest and most powerful member, the United States, is facing a presidential election. European allies expect little movement on Ukraine until a new president takes office in January. Beyond that, the United States and European heavyweight Germany remain deeply concerned about being dragged into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia, and they lead a group of countries that oppose allowing Ukraine to join NATO until the conflict ends. In any case, NATO diplomats said, Ukraine’s borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the Article 5 guarantee would come into effect. Russian troops have seized about 20% of the country.	https://apnews.com/article/nato-ukraine-membership-russia-7a27716d4838edf2c0ff6d97df50478d	2024-10-16T08:41:05-07:00	
Europe's Airbus to lay off 2,500 as it tries to turn around its space and defense division	European aircraft maker and Boeing rival Airbus said Wednesday that it was laying off 2,500 workers as it tries to turnaround its struggling defense and space division. Airbus said it would implement other organizational changes as it faces ongoing challenges in the defense and space sector, including disrupted supply chains, the rapid evolution of warfare tactics and increasing costs. The announcement comes after the company had already begun making organizational changes in the division last year, which it said have begun 'bearing fruit.' 'We want to shape the division so it can act as a leading and competitive player in this ever-evolving market,' said Mike Schoellhorn, the CEO of Airbus's defense and space division. 'This requires us to become faster, leaner and more competitive.' The company's defense and space business struggled last year, notably taking a 477 million euro ($511 million) loss on the long-troubled A400M military transport plane, in part linked to unusually high inflation. The European space sector also was hit by the loss of access to Russia’s Soyuz rocket launchers and the failure of a new Vega-C rocket soon after takeoff from French Guiana in late 2022. Outside of that division, business has been booming for the aerospace giant. Airbus has outpaced Boeing for five straight years in plane orders and deliveries and its profits have soared. The bigger problem for Airbus has been keeping up with demand for commercial airplanes. As of June, the French manufacturer had an order backlog of 8,585 commercial aircraft. Meanwhile, Boeing can't seem to right its ship. At the beginning of the year, Boeing seemed finally to be recovering from two crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Then, on Jan. 5, a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9, and the Virginia company has been reeling ever since. Boeing has since slowed manufacturing at the order of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. It lost $355 million in the first quarter because of a decline in aircraft deliveries and compensation it paid to airlines for a temporary grounding of Max 9s. The Max was Boeing’s answer to Airbus’ A320 family of planes. Airbus employs more than 150,000 people worldwide, according to FactSet.	https://apnews.com/article/airbus-layoffs-defense-space-boeing-0f2090d5bdde75c4e85e7d48f55e5b31	2024-10-16T08:19:15-07:00	
Biden to travel to Germany this week, Angola in December for visits delayed by Hurricane Milton	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is heading to Germany Thursday and will visit Angola the first week in December, rescheduling visits that were postponed so he could remain in Washington to monitor the federal response to Hurricane Milton as it struck Florida. The White House confirmed Biden will depart for his quick trip to Berlin on Thursday. It will offer him the opportunity to huddle with his key ally, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, about their countries' support for Ukraine in its war with Russia as the conflict is at another critical moment. Biden's initial itinerary for the postponed trip included a meeting on the war in Ukraine with allied nations at an American military base in Germany before he was to continue on to Angola. The White House says that the gathering of representatives of the allied nations, partners in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, will instead take place virtually next month. Still, the war in Ukraine will loom large during Biden's time in Berlin this week. Biden spoke by phone Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but they will not meet while the president is in Germany. The two leaders discussed Zelenskyy's 'victory plan,' shortly after the Ukrainian leader presented it to his parliament . Zelenskyy is scheduled to present the five-point plan to the European Council on Thursday. Zelenskyy had previously spoken to Biden about the proposal. The plan includes an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. The White House on Wednesday declined to comment about the plan. 'We’re going to let the Ukrainians speak to their victory plan,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. 'What we’re going to continue to do is show our support for the Ukrainians on the battlefield as they continue to beat back Russia.' Zelenskyy said in a statement following the call he also spoke to Biden about the U.S. and Ukraine potentially exploring ways to produce weapons together. The Biden administration also announced a further $425 million in military assistance to Ukraine, bringing its total to more than $64 billion in the two and a half years since Russia’s invasion. Wednesday’s package includes surface-to-air missiles to protect Ukrainian infrastructure from Russian attacks and long range rockets and artillery to help its war effort. Biden and Scholz recently spoke by phone to discuss the need for the countries to 'continue our strong collaboration on geopolitical priorities, including supporting Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression,' according to the White House. Jean-Pierre said the trip was important to Biden, in part because of Germany's help with a complicated hostage swap with Russia. 'The president really wanted to make sure to go to Germany to thank Chancellor Scholz directly,' she said. Scholz in a speech before the German parliament on Wednesday said he was looking forward to Biden's visit. 'I would like to say that … President Biden stands for an incredible improvement in cooperation over recent years,' said Scholz, adding that he was grateful for the 'good collaboration' forged with the Democratic president. There's a significant measure of anxiety in Europe about what next month's U.S. presidential election could mean for Ukraine. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has been in lockstep with Biden about the need to maintain robust economic and military support for Ukraine. Republican Donald Trump has said he would move to quickly to end the war the war with Russia should he regain the White House. Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has said that the plan would include establishing a 'demilitarized zone' and that Ukraine would not reclaim territory that Russia occupies and would agree not to join NATO. Scholz has been one of Biden's closest global allies. In addition to his robust support for Ukraine, Scholz played a critical role in helping free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, corporate security executive Paul Whelan, and others from Russian prisons in a multinational prisoner swap. As part of the biggest prisoner exchange in post-Soviet history, Scholz agreed to release Vadim Krasikov, a Russian who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a 40-year-old Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany. Biden has not visited Africa since taking office in early 2021. Jean-Pierre said the coming visit to Luanda aims to 'recognize Angola’s role as a strategic partner and regional leader, and discuss increased collaboration on security, health, and economic partnerships.' ___ AP writers Geir Moulson in Berlin and Colleen Long in Washington contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-germany-scholz-ukraine-angola-hurricane-milton-122b839208dce251e530b4e3d5156396	2024-10-16T07:42:24-07:00	
Cate Blanchett wants you to laugh at politics in ‘Rumours’	NEW YORK (AP) — You’d be hard pressed to find an upcoming film weirder than 'Rumours.' The biting commentary on the emptiness of political statements and the performances politicians put on starts off as a straight political satire focusing on the G7 world leaders, but then slips into a world of slow-yet-terrifying zombies; a mysterious, giant brain found in the middle of a forest with unexplained origins; and an AI chatbot bent on sexual entrapment. It goes from provocative to absurd within a few short scenes, with the G7 leaders no longer the subject of criticism, but the butt of the joke. And that’s kind of the whole point, according to its star and executive producer, Cate Blanchett. 'We’re all in such a state of heightened anxiety and fear with what’s going on with climate, what’s going on with the global political situation. We feel like we’re on the precipice of a world war and there’s a lot of people in positions of power who seem to be relishing that moment,' Blanchett told The Associated Press. She plays a fictional chancellor of Germany named Hilda Orlmann, the host of the conference who's more focused on optics than action. 'I think the audience will come to it with a need for some kind of catharsis. And because the film is ridiculous and terrifying ... I think they’ll be able to laugh at the absurdity of the situation we found ourselves in. I think it’s a very generous film in that way,' she said. The three directors, Guy Maddin and brothers Evan and Galen Johnson, said they wanted the film to feel like it had a 'generic wash of political disrespect' and to include some resonant critiques, but they didn’t want viewers to feel like they were leaving a lecture hall as they walked out of the theater. 'I’m preachy enough when I talk to people. I don’t want to make a movie that’s preachy, you know? I just favor movies that aren’t that. That just hit me with a little mystery of ... ‘What are you doing or seeing? What am I experiencing?’' Evan Johnson, who wrote the script, as well as co-directed, said. As for the more absurd plotlines, Maddin said he and his collaborators share 'a compulsion to come up with an original recipe.' And original it certainly is. In its straightforward opening act, leaders from the Group of 7 meet for their annual summit and try to draft a provisional statement for an unnamed crisis. Then, as the evening goes on and they struggle to string together a couple, meaningful sentences, they find themselves abandoned and subject to attack from 'bog people,' or well-preserved mummified bodies from thousands of years ago. Hijinks — and hilarity — ensue from there. Nikki Amuka-Bird, who plays the fictionalized British Prime Minister Cardosa Dewindt, said that while reading the script, she kept asking herself, 'What’s happening?' But the ridiculous plotline — including the apocalyptic invasion of zombie-like 'bog people' — was only part of the reason why she took on the project. 'This kind of total courage to genre splice in this way takes away any kind of apprehension or fear you might have about it because their (the directors’) tongues are firmly in their cheeks the whole time,' Amuka-Bird said. 'It’s a really imaginative exercise and it’s just fantastic to work with directors who can be that bold and take chances like that.' The cast is rounded out by a starry ensemble: Roy Dupuis is a melodramatic Canadian prime minister, Charles Dance is an American president with an inexplicable British accent, Denis Ménochet is a paranoid French president and Alicia Vikander makes an appearance as a frenetic leader from the European Commission. The title of the movie, Blanchett said, is meant to invoke the revered Fleetwood Mac album of the same name, which was made at a time when the bandmembers were reportedly 'all sleeping together and bickering and breaking up,' she said. 'What was surprising about it is you think, ‘OK, this is a film about the G7,’ but it’s like a sort of a daytime soap opera with these sort of trysts and liaisons and petty squabbles,' Blanchett said. 'It was such an unusual way to look at the mess we’re all in and the leadership that’s led us here.'	https://apnews.com/article/cate-blanchett-rumours-movie-politics-satire-guy-b87817592defdf14a839ef0a4e9c7f81	2024-10-16T07:11:23-07:00	
Q&A: Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal's 'La Máquina' explores masculinity and aging in boxing story	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Separately, Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal are highly regarded actors. Together, they are a force to be reckoned with since starring in Alfonso Cuarón’s 2001 cult classic 'Y tu mamá también.' They have embarked on another on-screen project, co-starring in Hulu’s first Spanish-language production, 'La Máquina,' now streaming. That's 12 years after working together on the 2012 film 'Casa de Mi Padre.' 'Working with Gael is that. It’s returning to the familiar, to what has always been there,' Luna said at the series’ Los Angeles premiere. 'We’ve continued this connection and maintained it very easily.' 'La Máquina' tells the story of an aging boxer (García Bernal) whose manager and close friend (Luna) secures him one last chance at a comeback. Their final shot at victory is challenged when mysterious forces threaten the fight and life itself. The show is produced by Searchlight Television, along with Luna and García Bernal's production company El Corriente de Golfo. On set, showrunner Marco Ramirez says the synergy between Luna and García Bernal had him replacing scripted lines for the duo’s playful banter. 'They were kind of born to work together and born to riff with each other,' Ramirez said. 'I would be like, ‘This scene is fine. The writing is okay, but what they’re doing is so much better.'' Luna and García Bernal spoke with The Associated Press about how the series deals with aging and body image, as well as the role activism plays in their lives as actors and producers. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. AP: Your characters explore the themes of body image and aging from different points of view. Why was it important for you to share your character's perspective, and more broadly, a male perspective? LUNA: There is this monster we have to fight which is a pressure of like, ‘How do we look?’ We are on screens all the time and and we are televised 24/7. These two characters are struggling to let go and move into the next stage. It’s fascinating to create a parallel — and at the same time, make characters so different. This man, Andy, the guy that I portray, he's a guy who wishes to be seen, but he’s looking in the wrong places. It has to start from the inside, but he’s just looking at the outside — which is a metaphor for the world we’re living in, which stays on the surface so much. We’re so afraid of digging further or of going deeper. GARCÍA BERNAL: In regards to Esteban, the concept of aging comes for men in sports, particularly in boxing, in these contact sports. For women it's beauty and for men it's sports, where it kind of manifests in a very natural way. It’s incredible that at that point in your life — the athlete is finally enjoying what they're doing. You're finally starting to have fun — but that’s when the body is just not responding. It is a quite incredible process; you have your whole life in front of you but you have to step away from what you loved. You have to say goodbye — to success as well, which is really complicated. And sports is very, very cruel in that sense. AP: How do you combat that as an actor? In Hollywood, you’re in front of the camera all the time. How do you keep yourself from taking on the mindsets these characters have about aging? LUNA: We are in a very luxurious position, where what we do gets better and better with time. The characters that I can do now are the ones that I’ve been wanting to do for a long time. Just as life gets more complex, as maturity comes, your characters become more complex and interesting. There are some things I can do now that I'm a father. There's just some relations I understand much better now that I went through a long relation with my father. I lost him. Now, I have a lot to say there. The line between the professional and the personal is blurry in this journey we have — as actors or as storytellers. GARCÍA BERNAL: It is a privilege to be able to sublimate that as actors. Also, we had the fortune of growing up in very loving environments where we're not forced to think about (the negative aspects of aging). We're really far away from those concepts, but they might affect us in other ways. But there’s that moment that as friends, Diego and I have confessed to each other as friends like, ‘Man, I don’t play fútbol anymore. Why? Because I get hurt. And I cannot work if I'm—' It's a bit sad but it happens to everybody. LUNA: Now, I have to stretch in the mornings. AP: You chose to explore the dangers that journalists face in Mexico through Eiza González's character. What made you want to focus on this narrative approach? LUNA: To me, Eiza’s role is really important because it’s crucial — media plays a very important role in sports. It’s not a story about boxing, you know, but about what boxing generates in a community. Are we telling the story from the right angle? Are we really paying respect to those who dedicate their lives to sports? Inevitably, we talk about the country, and Mexico is an important subject of this TV series. What journalists are facing in Mexico is happening today and therefore it's a part of everything. AP: There's synergy to your working dynamic as producers. How do you use the platform you both have built to focus on injustices that are happening? GARCÍA BERNAL: It’s a natural part of our unspoken sort of deal with each other. It was in everything from the beginning. We were both interested in our environment, in what’s happening. And we found, in the cinema, a great way to express ourselves with complete and absolute freedom. And so we purposely always search for films that actually shed a light on all the gray areas that exist — to understand things a little bit more. LUNA: We’re part of the audience and as part of the audience, we are searching for that opportunity. The approach we have is to always be aware of that beautiful thing that happens in cinema when you find someone else’s story, when you give yourself the time, when you have the curiosity to listen and to get affected. AP: Diego, you go through a huge physical transformation with the prosthetics. What was an element for you, that last piece that helped you get fully into character as Andy? LUNA: It was the butt. Definitely. GARCÍA BERNAL: (laughs) LUNA: I was like, putting too many things (prosthetics) on the face, and suddenly the butt came in. I was like, ‘Oh, no, let’s get rid of this and this.’ We went too far and then pulled back a bit. If you see the real references we had, we basically stopped half way. It was an interesting process, an exciting one, a scary one also because, it took time to actually see it working. It wasn’t until I got a reaction from Gael and the rest that I was like, ‘Okay, I think we got it. This is working.’	https://apnews.com/article/la-maquina-gael-garcia-bernal-diego-luna-2eec1bcb2110bf20a7b76b326021079d	2024-10-16T06:44:55-07:00	
Amazon, Google make dueling nuclear investments to power data centers with clean energy	Amazon on Wednesday said that it was investing in small nuclear reactors, coming just two days after a similar announcement by Google, as both tech giants seek new sources of carbon-free electricity to meet surging demand from data centers and artificial intelligence. The plans come as the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant said last month it plans to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft can buy the power to supply its data centers. All three companies have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions. Now they say they need to go further in the search for clean electricity to meet both demand and their own commitments to cut emissions. Nuclear energy is a climate solution in that its reactors don’t emit the planet-warming greenhouse gases that come from power plants that burn fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and gas. The demand for power is surging globally as buildings and vehicles electrify. People used more electricity than ever last year, placing strain on electric grids around the world. Much of the demand also comes from data centers and artificial intelligence. The International Energy Agency forecasts that data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt hours in 2026, more than doubling from 2022. Estimates suggest one terawatt hour can power 70,000 homes for a year. 'AI is driving a significant increase in the amount of data centers and power that are required on the grid,' Kevin Miller, Amazon Web Services’ vice president of global data centers, told The Associated Press, adding: 'We view advanced new nuclear capacity as really key and essential.' The United States is pursuing small modular reactors, a type of nuclear reactor that can generate up to roughly one-third the amount of power of a traditional reactor. Developers say small reactors will be built faster and at a lower cost than large power reactors, scaling to fit needs of a particular location. They aim to start spinning up electricity in the early 2030s, if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gives permission to build and operate their designs and the technology succeeds. If new, clean power isn’t added as data centers are developed, the U.S. runs the risk of 'browning the grid,' or including more power that isn't made from clean sources, said Kathryn Huff, a former U.S. assistant secretary for nuclear energy who is now an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The reactors are currently under development, with none currently providing power to the electric grid in the U.S. Big investors can help change that, and these announcements could be the 'inflection point' that makes scaling up this technology truly possible, Huff said. Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, echoed that, saying the industry needs customers who value the reliability and carbon-free attributes of nuclear and are willing to pay a premium for it at first, until a number of the next-generation reactors are deployed and the cost comes down. On Monday, Google said it was signing a contract to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors that Kairos Power, a nuclear technology company, plans to develop. The news highlights 'the technologies that we’re going to need to achieve round the clock clean energy, not only for Google but for the world,' Michael Terrell, Google's senior director of energy and climate, told the AP. With Kairos, Google said it expects to bring the first small modular reactor online by 2030, with more to come through 2035. The deal is projected to bring 500 megawatts of power to the grid. For context, Google consumed more than 24 terawatt hours of electricity last year, according to the company's annual environmental report. One terawatt is equal to 1,000,000 megawatts. Meanwhile, Amazon's announcements Wednesday included working with utility Dominion Energy to explore putting a small modular reactor near its existing North Anna nuclear power station in Virginia. It's investing in reactor developer X-energy for its early development work, and collaborating with regional utility Energy Northwest in central Washington to put four of the X-energy reactors there. Combined, the three announcements could account for more than 5,000 megawatts of power by the late 2030s with the possibility of more. All of that is still likely only a small fraction of the company’s total energy consumption, a figure that Amazon does not report publicly. New reactor designs pair well with industrial applications because they can be built on a small footprint and generate reliable power, with some able to provide high-temperature heat too, at the site, said Doug True, chief nuclear officer at the industry trade association, Nuclear Energy Institute. 'It seems like a really good fit to support those facilities, and for a lot of different applications depending upon the amount of power that’s needed by the customer,' he said. Both Amazon and Google have committed to using renewable energy to address climate change. By 2030, Google has pledged to meet net-zero emissions, and run carbon-free energy every hour of every day on every grid where it operates. It says it has already matched 100% of its global electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases on an annual basis. However, the company has fallen short on decreasing its emissions. Amazon has said it would match all of its global electricity consumption with 100% renewable energy by 2030, and recently announced it met that goal early in 2023. Though the company has matched its consumption as far as purchases of an equivalent amount of renewable energy, that does not necessarily mean it is using that to power its operations. Amazon saw its electricity emissions drop 11%, but direct emissions — known as Scope 1 — increased 7%, according to its 2023 sustainability report. The company is also targeting net zero-carbon by 2040. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

US official warns of growing North Korean military support for Russia's war	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Wednesday that Washington and its allies are 'alarmed' by North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats as well as its increasing military support for Russia's war in Ukraine, but said he couldn’t confirm Ukrainian claims that Pyongyang was also sending soldiers to fight for Moscow. Campbell spoke with reporters following discussions with South Korean and Japanese counterparts on reinvigorating an international pressure campaign against North Korea, which faltered in recent years amid a deepening divide at the U.N. Security Council. Earlier on Wednesday, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo announced plans with eight Western governments to launch a new multinational team to monitor the enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. Russia in March vetoed a U.N. resolution in a move that effectively abolished monitoring by U.N. experts of Security Council sanctions against North Korea, which prompted Western accusations that Moscow was acting to shield its arms purchases from Pyongyang to fuel its war in Ukraine. Campbell said there are signs that North Korea was increasing its support of materials, including artillery and missiles, to support Russia’s war on Ukraine, which he said was 'creating further instability in Europe.' He said the U.S. was still evaluating reports that North Korea was also sending personnel. 'We are concerned by them and ... we agreed that we will continue to monitor the situation closely,' Campbell said about the claims. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has claimed that North Korea is sending military personnel to help Russia’s war effort without providing details. Ukrainian media reported earlier this month that six North Koreans were among those killed after a Ukrainian missile strike on Oct. 3. North Korea has also been making increasingly provocative threats against rival South Korea, including accusing the South of infiltrating drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang and threatening to attack the South if it happens again. North Korea also on Tuesday blew up the northern sections of unused road and rail routes that once linked it with South Korea, in a choreographed demolition aimed at demonstrating its growing anger with South Korea’s conservative government. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have spiked since 2022 as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used Russia’s war on Ukraine as a window to dial up his weapons testing activities and threats. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have strengthened their combined military exercises in response and took steps to sharpen their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets. Following his talks with Campbell and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Masataka Okano, South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun said that the countries condemn the North’s 'intentional moves to create tensions.' 'We have agreed to maintain a solid South Korea-U.S. combined posture to respond firmly to North Korean provocations and strengthen security cooperation through close coordination between South Korea, the U.S., and Japan,' Kim said.	https://apnews.com/article/us-south-korea-north-korea-russia-ukraine-campbell-103e27e415d8253c05d60514a0dec41a	2024-10-16T02:57:42-07:00	
China's leader makes rare visit to province facing Taiwan following major war exercises	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China’s President Xi Jinping made a rare visit to a province facing Taiwan following military exercises that mobilized China's navy, air force, missile force and land troops to simulate a blockade of the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its own territory and threatens to annex by force. Xi did not comment on the military exercises during his visit to Fujian province, according to the official Xinhua News Agency, but his visit came on the heels of China’s dispatch of a record 125 aircraft, as well as its Liaoning aircraft carrier and ships, in large-scale military exercises surrounding Taiwan and its outlying islands Monday. Xi has largely avoided public appearances and foreign travel over the past year, but bringing Taiwan under Beijing's control remains a priority for his administration as head of the ruling Communist Party and its military, the People's Liberation Army. Taiwan’s newly elected president Lai Ching-te has been vociferously criticized by Beijing for rejecting its position that Tawian is a part of China. The drills came four days after Taiwan celebrated the founding of its government on its National Day, when Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te said in a speech that China has no right to represent Taiwan and declared his commitment to 'resist annexation or encroachment.' Taiwan was a Japanese colony before being unified with China at the end of World War II. It split away in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists fled to the island as Mao Zedong’s Communists defeated them in a civil war and took power.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-xi-jinping-visit-fujian-8957861a959469918991eaca8b773616	2024-10-16T02:20:08-07:00	
Italy approves tight budget partly funded by a levy on banks and insurers	ROME (AP) — Italy’s far-right government has approved a budget for next year of about 30 billion euros ($33 billion), which officials say will be partly funded by a levy on Italian banks and insurers. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said late Tuesday that the government expected to raise some 3.5 billion euros from banks and insurance companies to ensure better public services, especially the country's struggling health service, and help the most vulnerable citizens. 'As we promised, there will be no new taxes for citizens,' Meloni wrote in a post on X. The 2025 budget law was agreed by ministers at a cabinet meeting late Tuesday, just in time to meet a deadline to submit the plan to the European Union. The measures still need to be approved by the Italian parliament, with a final vote expected by the end of the year. Economy and Finance minister Giancarlo Giorgetti had been under intense pressure for weeks to reconcile the need to speed up Italy’s deficit reduction — closely watched by the EU — with the government’s expensive electoral promises. 'Someone would call it an extra profit (tax), I call it a sacrifice,' Giorgetti said at a press conference on Wednesday, commenting on the new levy on banks and insurers. Government officials didn’t release details on the new financial levy. But some Italian media reported it would focus on temporarily removing deductions for lenders’ so-called deferred tax assets and increasing taxes on bankers’ stock options. The minister revisited a prior plan by the right-wing government, which has repeatedly criticized banks for gaining excessively from higher interest rates. A first attempt to tap lenders with a 40% windfall tax failed last year, after the move sparked a major selloff in Italian banking stocks, forcing the government to withdraw the plan. Vice-Premier Antonio Tajani said in a post on X that the new contribution from banks will 'not frighten the markets.' Giorgetti said on Wednesday that additional resources will also come from a 'spending review' imposed on Italian ministries, which have been asked to tighten their belts and propose spending cuts. The 2025 budget also includes permanent cuts to income tax and social contributions for middle- and low-income earners, one of Meloni's main electoral pledges. To fund the new package of measures, Italy will widen next year’s deficit to 3.3% of gross domestic product from an estimated 2.9%. Rome is under pressure to keep its accounts under control, after having being placed under special monitoring by Brussels for running deficits far in excess of the EU’s 3% limit and for not reducing its mammoth debt, now close to 3 trillion euros.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-budget-banks-insurers-levy-deficit-eu-taxes-f1535a88005a70dc9d30b25cbea9ba39	2024-10-16T02:17:02-07:00	
Students are injured in clashes with Pakistani police over reports of an on-campus rape	LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — More than two dozen college students were injured in clashes with Pakistani police over reports of an on-campus rape of a young woman, officials said Wednesday. The students were hurt on Monday and Tuesday in the eastern city of Lahore in Punjab province after reports about the alleged rape spread on social media. Students initially protested on the campus of the private college but later gathered outside the provincial assembly, where they clashed with police. The college administration denied there was an assault, as did the young woman's parents. Sexual violence against women is common in Pakistan but is underreported because of the stigma attached to it in the conservative country. Protests about sexual violence against women are uncommon. A special committee formed by the provincial government said the alleged victim said she slipped at her home on Oct. 2 and was taken to a hospital, where she was treated until Oct. 11. It said the student was absent from college from Oct. 3 to 15. The Federal Investigation Agency said it was looking into the case, including identifying people who spread the reports on social media. Punjab's chief minister, the province's most senior official, said no rape had taken place. Maryam Nawaz, who is the niece of the current prime minister and daughter of a former prime minister, asserted that a vile and dangerous plan was hatched to mislead students. 'An incident happened and a security guard was arrested and accused of being involved,' Nawaz told a press conference on Wednesday. The Sustainable Social Development Organization said last month that there were 7,010 rape cases reported in Pakistan in 2023, almost 95% of them in Punjab. 'However, due to social stigmas in Pakistan that discourage women from getting help, there is a high chance that due to underreporting the actual number of cases may be even higher,' it said. This week's protests came less than a month after a woman said she was gang-raped when on duty during a polio vaccination drive in southern Sindh province. Police arrested three men. Her husband threw her out of the house after the reported assault, saying she had tarnished the family name.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-students-protest-campus-rape-lahore-241177c92924df13174f7247b73ba79d	2024-10-16T01:17:09-07:00	
More than 100 killed and 50 injured after a gasoline tanker explodes in Nigeria	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — More than 100 people were killed and 50 others injured in northwestern Nigeria as they tried to scoop up fuel from an overturned petrol tanker, causing the vehicle to explode in flames, the emergency services said Wednesday. The accident occurred at midnight in Jigawa state's Majiya town after the tanker driver lost control of the vehicle while traveling on a highway, local police spokesperson Lawan Adam said. Ninety-seven people were 'burned to ashes' at the scene while eight others died at the hospital, Dr. Haruna Mairiga, head of the Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency, told The Associated Press. Deadly tanker accidents are common in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, where traffic regulations are not strictly enforced in many places and there is a lack of alternatives such as an efficient railway system to transport cargo. It is also common for people to salvage fuel with cups and buckets to take home after such accidents. The practice has become more common amid Nigeria's soaring fuel prices, which have tripled since the start of last year as Nigeria ended costly gas subsidies. The driver involved in the latest accident had traveled about 110 kilometers (68 miles) from the neighboring Kano state, police said. Residents who heard about the accident rushed to the scene and were scooping up fuel, 'sparking a massive inferno,' police spokesman Lawan Adam said. Videos that appeared to be from the scene showed a massive fire stretching across the entire area, with what appeared to be bodies littered at the scene. Residents in Majiya town were in mourning on Wednesday morning as locals held a mass burial for the victims. Most of the bodies were unrecognizable, the emergency services said. 'If they knew (about the danger), they wouldn’t have gone to fetch (the fuel),' said Mairiga, head of the emergency services. He said emergency services only arrived at the scene several hours after the accident. 'But the incident had already happened ... those caught up (in the fire) were burned to ashes,' Mairiga said. In one of the videos, the person who recorded the clip appeared to try to mobilize others to help the victims. 'It’s burning the body!' he shouted. 'He will die ... when the vehicle explodes there will be a problem.' Resident Sani Umar told the local Channels Television how the fire 'spread so quickly that many couldn’t escape.' 'People were running in all directions, screaming for help,' Umar said. 'This is a heartbreaking moment for us all,' said state police commissioner Ahmadu Abdullahi.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-gasoline-tanker-explosion-7af046fdb8016e79d14744666013fbf2	2024-10-16T00:21:36-07:00	
UK inflation falls to lowest level in over 3 years, cementing expectations for another rate cut	LONDON (AP) — Inflation in the U.K. has fallen to its lowest level for more than three years, official figures showed Wednesday, a drop that has cemented market expectations that the Bank of England will lower interest rates at its next policy meeting. The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices rose 1.7% in September, down from 2.2% the previous month, largely as a result of lower air fares and petrol prices. The decline was bigger than the 1.9% analysts had anticipated, and means that inflation is below the central bank's target rate of 2% for the first time since 2021. As a result, the bank's rate-setting panel is expected to further reduce its main interest rate when it meets again in early November to 4.75% from 5%. It previously cut borrowing costs in August, the first reduction since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020. 'A quarter-point rate cut in November is now effectively a done deal, and this report certainly makes the path to a consecutive cut in December much clearer,' said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at abrdn, formerly Aberdeen Asset Management. Central banks around the world dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have fallen from multi-decade highs recently, they have started cutting interest rates. The bank is widely expected to reduce borrowing costs again at its next meeting in November, especially as it will have details of the government’s budget on Oct. 30. The new Labour government has said that it needs to plug a 22 billion pound ($29 billion) hole in the public finances and has indicated that it may have to raise taxes and lower spending, which would likely weigh on the near-term outlook for the British economy and put downward pressure on inflation.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-economy-inflation-interest-rates-b1151fecc47f2ac4747dc07ba3504987	2024-10-15T21:42:16-07:00	
First Italian ship with 16 intercepted migrants docks at Albanian port to process asylum request	SHENGJIN, Albania (AP) — An Italian navy ship on Wednesday docked at the Albanian port of Shengjin to bring the first group of 16 migrants intercepted in international waters. The naval ship Libra left the port of Lampedusa on Monday with 16 men — 10 from Bangladesh and six from Egypt — who were rescued at sea after departing from Libya, a ministry spokesman said. Last week Italy formally opened two centers in Albania where it plans to process thousands of asylum-seekers outside its borders. The centers will only house adult men, while vulnerable people such as women, children, the elderly and those who are ill or victims of torture will be accommodated in Italy. Families will not be separated. Italian Ambassador to Albania Fabrizio Bucci said Friday the two centers were ready to process migrants after the opening was delayed for months to consolidate the crumbling soil at one center, in Gjader where they will be accommodated. Though the center in Gjader has capacity for 3,000 migrants, it will start with 400 and increase to 880 in a few weeks. The number of people reaching Italy along the central Mediterranean migration route from North Africa has fallen by 61% in 2024 from 2023. According to the Italian Interior Ministry, as of Oct. 15, 54,129 migrants have arrived in Italy by sea this year, compared to 138,947 by the same date last year. Under a five-year deal signed last November by Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama, up to 3,000 migrants picked up by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be sheltered in Albania. They will be screened initially on board the ships that rescue them before being sent to Albania for further screening. The two centers will cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years. The facilities are run by Italy and are under Italian jurisdiction, while Albanian guards provide external security. The first center, an area in Shengjin, 66 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the capital, Tirana, is used for screening newcomers. While the other center, about 22 kilometers (14 miles) to its east near the former military airport in Gjader, accommodates migrants during the processing of their asylum requests. Italian officials expect the Gjader center will never be at full occupancy but that depends on the flow of migrants brought to Albania. In Albania, the migrants retain their right under international and European Union law to apply for asylum in Italy and have their claims processed there, a move expected to take a maximum of 28 days, including any appeal case, to process. Italy has agreed to welcome those who are granted asylum. Those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania. The controversial agreement to outsource the housing of asylum-seekers to a non-EU member country has been hailed by some countries that, like Italy, are suffering a heavy burden of refugees. The agreement was endorsed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of 'out-of-box thinking' in tackling the issue of migration into the European Union. But it has been slammed by human rights groups as setting a dangerous precedent. Rama has made it clear that no other country will be able to have such centers in Albania. He said Albania felt an expression of gratitude for the tens of thousands of Albanians who were welcomed by Italy when communism fell in 1991, or support extended by Rome during the economic turmoil in 1997 and in the aftermath of the 2019 earthquake. Meloni and her right-wing allies have long demanded that European countries share more of the migration burden. She has held up the Albania agreement as an innovative solution to a problem that has vexed the EU for years. ___ Follow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini	https://apnews.com/article/italy-albania-migrants-asylum-request-centers-arrival-3dd82dfd6414f8cee84b74ca15fa0b31	2024-10-15T21:15:04-07:00	
Israel strikes southern suburbs of Beirut for the first time in nearly a week	BEIRUT (AP) — Israeli jets struck the southern suburbs of Beirut early Wednesday for the first time in six days, Lebanese state media reported. The casualty count was not yet clear. The attack comes just one day after caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the United States government gave him some assurances of Israel easing its strikes in the Lebanese capital. Israel says it is striking Hezbollah assets in the suburbs, where the militant group has a strong presence, but it is also a busy residential and commercial area. The Israeli military said the Wednesday strike hit a weapons warehouse under a residential building. The Israeli military posted an evacuation warning on the X platform saying it is targeting a building in the Haret Hreik neighborhood. An Associated Press photographer who witnessed the strikes said there were three in the area. The first strike was documented less than an hour after the notice. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8 in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, following their surprise attack on southern Israel. A year of low-level fighting escalated into all-out war last month, and has displaced some 1.2 million people in Lebanon. Elsewhere, Israeli strikes late Tuesday in the southern town of Qana killed 10 people and wounded 15 others, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said. Nuhad Bustanji, a spokesperson for the Lebanese Civil Defense, said one person was killed and 34 wounded, with the toll likely to rise as rescue efforts continue. It was not immediately possible to resolve the different tolls provided by authorities. Videos shared on social media showed the smoking ruins of what appears to be a building targeted in the strike with surrounding structures damaged as well. Local media said there were several strikes in the southern town Tuesday night. Qana was the site of an Israeli artillery strike on a United Nations compound that killed dozens of civilians in 1996.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-news-10-16-2024-f18b2e0f5e05eb11a3c2ee29c16ed867	2024-10-15T21:10:50-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares track Wall St decline, as selling hits tech companies	BANGKOK (AP) — Markets were mostly lower in Asia on Wednesday after U.S. stocks pulled back from their records, dented by selling of technology and energy sector shares. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index fell 1.8% to 39,210.61, leading the declines, as tech stocks fell after Dutch computer chip equipment supplier ASML warned of a slower recovery in demand for semiconductors outside of the AI boom. Chip maker Tokyo Electron sank 9.8% and Lasertec Corp., which makes equipment to inspect chips, lost 13.4%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2% to 8,301.80. In Seoul, the Kospi shed 0.4% to 2,622.27, while Taiwan's Taiex slipped 0.5%. India's Sensex lost 0.2%. Chinese shares mostly advanced, rebounding after recent losses. Hong Kong's Hang Seng surged 0.9% to 20,501.77, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.4% to 3,214.01. On Tuesday, Wall Street pulled back from its records, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 0.8% to 5,815.26, a day after setting an all-time high for the 46th time this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8% to 42,740.42, and the Nasdaq composite sank 1% to 18,315.59. Exxon Mobil dropped 3%, and energy stocks fell to some of Wall Street’s sharpest losses after oil prices tumbled more than 4%. A barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, has fallen back below $75 from more than $80 last week. Crude prices have been weakening as China’s flagging economic growth raises concerns about demand for oil. At the same time, worries have receded about Israel possibly attacking Iranian oil facilities as part of its retaliation against Iran’s missile attack early this month. Iran is a major producer of crude, and a strike could upend its exports to China and elsewhere. However, oil recovered in early Wednesday trading, with benchmark U.S. crude oil up 29 cents at $70.86 per barrel. Brent crude gained 26 cents to $74.51 per barrel. Nvidia was the heaviest weight on the S&amp;P 500 and fell 4.5%. The chip company's stock is still up 166.2% for the year so far on euphoria about the profits created by the boom around artificial-intelligence technology. In reporting ASML's latest quarterly results, its CEO Christophe Fouquet said AI continues to offer strong upside potential, but 'other market segments are taking longer to recover.' ASML’s stock traded in the United States fell 16.3%. 'Anxiety has also intensified with reports that the U.S. is considering new restrictions on chip exports to specific countries, particularly targeting Nvidia and AMD, citing national security concerns,' Anderson Alves of ActivTrades said in a commentary. Traders are watching for an earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., due Thursday. TMSC's shares fell 1.9% on Wednesday. U.S. chipmaker Wolfspeed jumped 21.3% on Tuesday, trimming its loss for the year to 68.3%, after the Biden-Harris administration announced plans to provide up to $750 million in direct funding to the company. The money will support its new silicon carbide factory in North Carolina that makes the wafers used in advanced computer chips. Charles Schwab jumped 6.1%. More customers opened brokerage accounts at the company, helping to bring its total client assets to a record $9.92 trillion. Bank of America added 0.5%, and CEO Brian Moynihan said his company benefited from higher average loans and fees for investment banking and asset management. Walgreens Boots Alliance was another winner, up 15.8%, after topping analysts’ forecasts. The drugstore chain also said it will close about 1,200 locations over the next three years as it tries to turn around its struggling U.S. business. In the bond market, trading of Treasurys resumed after a holiday on Monday, and yields sank following a weaker-than-expected report on manufacturing in New York state. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.03% from 4.10% late Friday. Early Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 149.19 Japanese yen, down from 149.22 yen.

Mexico’s ex-public security chief sentenced to 38-plus years in US for taking cartel bribes	NEW YORK (AP) — The man once heralded as the architect of Mexico’s war on drug cartels was sentenced to more than 38 years in a U.S. prison on Wednesday for taking massive bribes to aid drug traffickers. Genaro García Luna, Mexico’s former secretary of public security, was convicted by a New York jury in 2023 of taking millions of dollars in bribes to protect the violent Sinaloa cartel that he was supposedly combating. He is the highest-level Mexican government official to be convicted in the United States. At his sentencing hearing before a federal judge in Brooklyn on Wednesday, García Luna continued to maintain his innocence and said the case against him was based on false information from criminals and the Mexican government. 'I have a firm respect for the law,' he said in Spanish. 'I have not committed these crimes.' García Luna, 56, led Mexico’s federal police before he served in a cabinet-level position as the top security official from 2006 to 2012 under then-President Felipe Calderón. At the time, García Luna was hailed as an ally by the U.S. in its fight on drug trafficking. But U.S. prosecutors said that in return for millions of dollars, he provided intelligence about investigations against the cartel, information about rival gangs and the safe passage of massive quantities of drugs. After the sentencing, Calderón said via the social platform X that he respects the court's decision but he never had 'verifiable evidence' of García Luna's criminal activities. Calderón said taking on the cartels 'was one of the most difficult decisions of my life. But I would do it again, because it is the right thing to do.' Earlier outside the courthouse, a group of about 15 protesters celebrated the verdict. Some held a banner that said, in Spanish, 'Calderon did know,' while others brandished signs denouncing his political party. Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence. García Luna's lawyers had argued that he should get no more than 20 years. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan said he wasn't moved by past accolades that García Luna received for his work in the war on drugs. 'That was your cover,' Cogan said before imposing the sentence. 'You are guilty of these crimes, sir. You can’t parade these words and say, ‘I’m police officer of the year.’' Besides the sentence of 38 years and four months, the judge imposed a $2 million fine. During the trial, photos were shown of García Luna shaking hands with former President Barack Obama and speaking with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Sen. John McCain. But prosecutors said García Luna secretly advanced a drug trafficking conspiracy that resulted in the deaths of thousands of American and Mexican citizens. He ensured that drug traffickers were notified in advance of raids and sabotaged legitimate police operations aimed at apprehending cartel leaders, they said. Drug traffickers were able to ship over 1 million kilograms of cocaine through Mexico and into the United States using planes, trains, trucks and submarines while García Luna held his posts, prosecutors said. During former Sinaloa kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán’s trial in the same court in 2018, a former cartel member testified that he personally delivered at least $6 million in payoffs to García Luna and that cartel members agreed to pool up to $50 million to pay for his protection. 'He enabled the cartel. He protected the cartel. He was the cartel,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Saritha Komatireddy told the judge Wednesday. García Luna enabled a corrupt system that allowed violent cartels to thrive and distribute drugs that killed multitudes of people, she added. 'It may not have been the defendant pulling the trigger, but he has blood on his hands,' Komatireddy said. Prosecutors also said García Luna plotted to undo last year's verdict by seeking to bribe or corruptly convince multiple inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to support false allegations that two government witnesses communicated via contraband cellular phones in advance of the trial. García Luna’s lawyer, Cesar de Castro, said the defense intends to appeal the sentence. He said his client is someone who 'has served his country' and has now lost his money, his reputation as well as policies he championed in Mexico. 'He has lost close to everything. All that remains is his wonderful family,' de Castro said. In Mexico, newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum briefly commented on the case Tuesday, saying: 'The big issue here is how someone who was awarded by United States agencies, who ex-President Calderón said wonderful things about his security secretary, today is prisoner in the United States because it’s shown that he was tied to drug trafficking.' García Luna’s arrest and conviction became a political cudgel that the governing party of Sheinbaum and her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, used in this year’s Mexican presidential election against Calderón’s weakened National Action Party. They sought to paint García Luna as the poster child of corruption and Calderón as the man responsible for soaring violence from the drug war. López Obrador and now Sheinbaum turned away from direct confrontation with the cartels, instead focusing on what they consider root causes of violence, such as poverty. But the new strategy has failed to significantly lower the level of violence. López Obrador had a very different reaction in 2020 when U.S. authorities arrested former Mexican Defense Secretary Salvador Cienfuegos for allegedly colluding with a drug cartel.

A full-scale replica of Anne Frank's hidden annex is heading to New York for an exhibition	AMSTERDAM (AP) — The annex where the young Jewish diarist Anne Frank hid from Nazi occupiers during World War II is heading to New York. A full-scale replica of the rooms that form the heart of the Anne Frank House museum on one of Amsterdam's historic canals is being built in the Netherlands and will be shipped across the Atlantic for a show titled ' Anne Frank The Exhibition ' at the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan. 'For the first time in history, the Anne Frank House will present what I would call a pioneering experience outside of Amsterdam. To immerse visitors in a full-scale, meticulous recreation of the secret annex. Those rooms where Anne Frank, her parents, her sister, four other Jews, spent more than two years hiding to evade Nazi capture,' Anne Frank House director Ronald Leopold told The Associated Press in an interview detailing the upcoming exhibition. In July 1942, Anne Frank, then aged 13, her parents Otto and Edith, and her 16-year-old sister Margo went into hiding in the annex. They were joined a week later by the van Pels family — Hermann, Auguste and their 15-year-old son, Peter. Four months later, Fritz Pfeffer moved into the hiding place, also seeking to evade capture by the Netherlands' Nazi German occupiers. They stayed in the annex of rooms until they were discovered in 1944 and sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp. Anne and her sister Margot were then moved to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they both died of typhus in February 1945. Anne was 15. Her father, Otto, the only person from the annex to survive the Holocaust, published Anne's diary after the war and it became a publishing sensation around the world as a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of tyranny. Leopold said the New York exhibit promises to be 'an immersive, interactive, captivating experience' for visitors. It opens on Jan. 27, International Holocaust Remembrance Day, to mark the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. While the faithfully rebuilt annex of rooms will be the heart of the exhibit, it also will trace the history of Anne's family from their time in Germany, their move to the Netherlands and decision to go into hiding, to their discovery by Nazis, deportation, Anne's death and the postwar decision by her father to publish her diary. 'What we try to achieve with this exhibition is that people, our visitors will learn about Anne not just as a victim, but through the multifaceted lens of a life, as a teenage girl, as a writer, as a symbol of resilience and of strength. We hope that they will contemplate the context that shaped her life.' The exhibition comes at a time of rising antisemitism and anger at the devastating war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza that has now spread to the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon following the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. 'With ever fewer, fewer, survivors in our communities, with devastating antisemitism and other forms of group hatred on the rise in the U.S. but also across the world, we feel ... our responsibility as Anne Frank House has never been greater,' Leopold said. 'And this exhibition is also in part a response to that responsibility to educate people to stand against antisemitism, to stand against group hatred.' Anne's diary will not be making the transatlantic trip. 'We unfortunately will not be able to travel with the diary, writings, the notebooks and the loose sheets that Anne wrote. They are too fragile, too vulnerable to travel,' Leopold said. Among 125 exhibits that are traveling from Amsterdam for the New York exhibition are photos, albums, artefacts such as one of the yellow stars Jews were ordered to wear in the occupied Netherlands, as well as the Best Supporting Actress Oscar won by Shelley Winters for her role in George Stevens’ 1959 film 'The Diary of Anne Frank.'	https://apnews.com/article/anne-frank-new-york-annex-diary-holocaust-8d093b71a48dcb84983a4ecf9d497747	2024-10-15T19:18:11-07:00

Takeaways from AP's report on euthanasia, doctors and ethics in Canada	TORONTO (AP) — Canada has arguably the world's most permissive system of euthanasia — the practice of doctors and nurse practitioners killing patients with an injection of drugs at their request. Canada allows euthanasia for people who aren't terminally ill but are suffering unmanageable pain. As Canada pushes to expand euthanasia and more countries move to legalize it, health care workers here are grappling with requests from people whose pain might be alleviated by money, adequate housing or social connections. And internal data obtained exclusively by The Associated Press from Canada’s most populous province suggest a significant number of people euthanized when they are in unmanageable pain but not about to die live in Ontario’s poorest areas. Here’s a look at the main takeaways from an AP investigation into euthanasia in Canada, commonly known there as medical assistance in dying, or MAiD. Some doctors fear providing euthanasia, even in legal cases Canada allows euthanasia for people with 'irremediable suffering' from serious but nonfatal medical conditions and disabilities. After euthanasia was legalized in 2016, doctors and nurses set up email discussion groups as confidential forums to discuss potentially troubling cases, with limited patient details. They're now run by the Canadian Association of MAiD Assessors and Providers, an educational and research organization. Dozens of messages provided to the AP by a participant in the forums — on condition of anonymity, due to the confidential nature of the messages and cases — show a fraught process where medical professionals test the limits of what conditions warrant euthanasia. In one case, a middle-aged worker whose ankle and back injuries made him unable to resume his previous job told his doctor the government’s measly support was 'leaving (him) with no choice but to pursue MAiD.' His doctor told forum participants the patient met legal criteria, with severe pain, strained social relationships and inability to work. Others agreed, but the doctor hesitated because the man cited reduced government payments as a key factor — and the doctor noted fear of being portrayed in the media as having euthanized someone 'in a case where services were inadequate.' Case of homeless people spark debate Cases of homelessness appear regularly on the private forums. One doctor wrote that although his patient had a serious lung disease, his suffering was 'mostly because he is homeless, in debt and cannot tolerate the idea of (long-term care) of any kind.' A respondent questioned whether the fear of living in a nursing home was truly intolerable. Another said the prospect of 'looking at the wall or ceiling waiting to be fed … to have diapers changed' was sufficiently painful. One provider said any suggestion they should provide patients with better housing options before offering euthanasia 'seems simply unrealistic and hence, cruel,' amid a national housing crisis. Data suggest marginalized people are affected Government officials have largely refuted the idea that socially disadvantaged people are being euthanized. But in Ontario, more than three-quarters of people euthanized when their death wasn’t imminent required disability support before their death in 2023, according to data from a slideshow presentation by the province’s chief coroner, shared with AP by both a researcher and a doctor on condition of anonymity due to its sensitive nature. Of people killed when they weren’t terminally ill, nearly 29% lived in the poorest parts of Ontario, compared with 20% of the province’s general population living in the most deprived communities, the data show. The figures suggest poverty may be a factor in Canada’s nonterminal euthanasia cases. But Dr. Dirk Huyer, Ontario's chief coroner, told AP that the data was only an early analysis and 'it’s tough to know exactly what it means,' saying that his job was only to present the statistics. Poverty doesn’t appear to disproportionately affect patients with terminal diseases who are euthanized, according to the leaked data. Experts say no other country with legal euthanasia has seen a marked number of deaths in impoverished people. Overall for Ontario, the data show, nonterminal patients account for a small portion of all euthanasia cases: 116 of 4,528 deaths last year. But the presentation and discussion among Ontario officials and medical professionals show rising awareness of euthanasia deaths for social reasons. Privately, officials admit concern Canadian officials have examined worrisome cases that haven't been publicly disclosed. A document from the Ministry of the Solicitor General in Ontario sent to all euthanasia providers in the province in May noted two cases of 'lessons learned' in nonterminal cases. The document was shared with AP by a doctor on condition of anonymity because it wasn’t authorized for release. In one, a 74-year-old patient who'd suffered blood pressure, a stroke and blindness was increasingly dependent on their spouse. The patient told their doctor they were interested in euthanasia, citing deteriorating vision loss and quality of life. Among other issues identified, officials wrote the patient's euthanasia was scheduled 'based on the spouse’s preference of timing' and questioned whether 'the patient’s death was genuinely voluntary.' Canada pushes boundaries Theo Boer, professor of health care ethics at Groningen University in the Netherlands, said that unlike other countries with legal euthanasia, Canada appears to be providing it for social reasons in some cases. 'That may be what Canadians want, but they would still benefit from some honest self-reflection about what is going on,' he said. Some of that reflection is happening in the confidential providers’ forums. They’ve debated whether it’s valid to euthanize people for obesity in several cases. They've also beem divided over ending the lives of people in mourning. Canada's government said it legalized euthanasia to reduce suffering and support individual autonomy — and polls have consistently shown public approval. But its laws are now being challenged on all sides. The advocacy group Dying with Dignity filed an August lawsuit in Ontario, alleging it’s 'discriminatory' to exclude mentally ill people from euthanasia. Meanwhile, a coalition of disability-rights organizations in another lawsuit argued that euthanasia legislation has resulted in the premature deaths of people with disabilities. ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Years of war in Congo have created a dire mental health crisis. But little support is available	GOMA, Congo (AP) — For Nelly Shukuru, there was no way out. The fighting that forced her from her home, the squalid conditions in the displacement camp in eastern Congo, the hunger, all felt inescapable. The 51-year-old planned to hang herself. She said a neighbor stopped her just in time. 'In my mind, the suffering was permanent,' said the mother of six, seated in a health clinic. 'The people who have died are better off than I am.' Years of conflict in eastern Congo have created a dire mental health crisis. Aid groups say the number of people seeking care has spiked as fighting intensifies. Some of the worst affected struggle to survive in cramped, violent displacement sites that aren't conducive to recovery. The number of people who received psychosocial support in camps around the main city of Goma increased more than 200% between January and June compared to the same period last year — from 6,600 to more than 20,000 — according to aid group Action Against Hunger. The number of people reporting suicidal thoughts has jumped from about five a month at the beginning of the year to more than 120, it said. More than 100 armed groups have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda. The violence has escalated as the M23 rebel group, backed by Rwanda, has reemerged. The fighting has displaced millions. Over 600,000 shelter in camps near Goma. More people are experiencing anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as well as insomnia and excessive alcohol and drug consumption, psychologists say. 'All around us there is war, and the number of people facing difficulty is increasing daily,' said Innocent Ntamuheza, a psychologist with Action Against Hunger. But little mental health support is available. Less than 30% of the requested $180 million for protection — which includes mental health services — in the humanitarian response plan has been funded this year, said the United Nations, which calls Congo one of the world’s most neglected crises. Shukuru said she considered killing herself in August after her drunk 21-year-old son struck her head with a rock because of a fight over a radio. Her children’s drinking had worsened since arriving in the camp because they were idle, she said. The family used to farm and attend church in their hometown of Sake but fled in February when it was bombed. Her husband, a construction worker, struggles to find jobs. The aid they receive isn't enough. Some of the camps for displaced families are less than a day's walk from the front lines. The camp where Shukuru lives was struck by shells in May that killed some 40 people and injured others, locals and aid groups said. Some armed men live among the camps' population. During a visit in August, The Associated Press saw men carrying guns and a truck of people in military fatigues drive through, chanting war songs. It wasn't clear if the people were with the military or self-defense groups. In the government's attempt to push back M23, it's been supporting militia groups under a coalition called the Wazalendo. But the groups, who previously fought government forces and each other, are accused of committing human rights abuses, locals and aid groups said. Some fighters and members of Congo's army, often stationed nearby, are also accused of sexual assault. A 38-year-old said she was raped by three armed men in a field while she was looking for food in May. The AP does not name people who have been sexually assaulted. The mother of eight has been seeking help at a clinic run by Doctors Without Borders, also known by its acronym MSF, but said she often can’t sleep at night and sees the men in her dreams. The constant presence of armed men in the camp makes it worse. 'It reminds me of the men who raped me,' she said. People relive traumatic incidents especially when it comes to rape, said Clementine Sifa, the mental health supervisor for MSF. In September, MSF said it treated an unprecedented number of survivors of sexual violence in Congo last year — more than 25,000 — with the trend continuing this year. The majority of people were treated in displacement camps in Goma. Lt. Col. Guillaume Ndjike, spokesman for Congo's army in the east, said the army is trying to protect people in the camps by conducting night patrols and setting up mobile police stations. He said armed men aren't allowed in the sites, and people accused of sexual assault or murder are apprehended and held accountable. Locals and aid workers say there is little accountability. Some aid groups are training community leaders to spot signs of people who might need mental health support and refer them to a clinic. They watch for people who are isolated, look stressed or have lost their jobs. Stigma surrounding mental health sometimes keeps people from proactively seeking it, they said. Those who have sought treatment say it's been helpful to learn ways to cope with anxiety and negative thoughts, including breathing techniques. Wrapping her arms around her chest and tapping her shoulders, Josephine Mulonda said the technique called 'butterfly hug' has helped reduce heart palpitations triggered by her husband's killing in January. The 52-year-old had depressive thoughts and worried how she would support their eight children. War Child, an organization focused on helping children in conflict, uses movement, song and play to help troubled youth express themselves. Dancing in a circle at a displacement site, children chant 'Let me cry, I’m crying.' The group also gives parents advice on listening to their children, said Isaac Rwamakuba, War Child's coordinator in Goma for emergency responses. But he said some of the most affected children lost families through death or separation. Last November, a 14-year-old was separated from her family when her town was attacked. The AP is not using her name due to the sensitivity of her situation. She is cared for by another family but fears being attacked when she walks for hours into the bush to find firewood to sell. She's considered ending her life to stop the suffering, she said. The psychological support from War Child helps at least momentarily, she said. She has no idea if her mother is alive. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Canadian doctors who provide euthanasia struggle with the ethics of killing vulnerable patients	TORONTO (AP) — A homeless man refusing long-term care, a woman with severe obesity, an injured worker given meager government assistance, and grieving new widows. All of them requested to be killed under Canada’s euthanasia system, and each sparked private debate among doctors and nurses struggling with the ethics of one of the world’s most permissive laws on the practice, according to an Associated Press investigation. As Canada pushes to expand euthanasia and more countries move to legalize it, health care workers here are grappling with requests from people whose pain might be alleviated by money, adequate housing or social connections. And internal data obtained exclusively by AP from Canada’s most populous province suggest a significant number of people euthanized when they are in unmanageable pain but not about to die live in Ontario's poorest and most deprived areas. Some doctors fear moving forward even with cases that meet Canada’s legal requirements, which allow euthanasia for people with 'irremediable suffering' from serious but nonfatal medical conditions and disabilities. On private forums, doctors and nurses have expressed deep discomfort with ending the lives of vulnerable people whose deaths were avoidable, according to messages provided to AP by a participant on condition of anonymity due to their confidentiality. Some of the requests from the forums were approved and acted upon. Others were denied. But the discourse about patients who are poor, disabled or lonely shows a fraught process where medical professionals test the limits of what conditions warrant euthanasia. The controversial cases in the forums have never been disclosed through Canada’s oversight system, even in an anonymized manner. When Canada legalized assisted dying in 2016, officials said they wanted to reduce suffering and support individual autonomy and freedom of choice — and polls have consistently shown public approval. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised then that safeguards would prevent vulnerable people from being euthanized 'because you’re not getting the support and care you actually need.' But experts tasked with delivering euthanasia to people who aren't dying have called it 'morally distressing' and say the legal provisions are too vague to be protective, obliging doctors and nurses to at times end the lives of people they believe might otherwise be saved. 'I don’t want (euthanasia) to become the solution to every kind of suffering out there,' a physician wrote to colleagues on one of the private forums. Euthanasia programs are increasing Canada has the world’s fastest-growing program for euthanasia, the practice of doctors and nurse practitioners killing patients with an injection of drugs at their request. Medically assisted suicide — patients themselves taking prescribed, lethal medication — also is legal. But virtually all of Canada’s MAiD cases — as it’s widely known here, for medical assistance in dying – are euthanasia, with a doctor or nurse practitioner giving the fatal injection. Unlike many other countries, Canada doesn't require that patients exhaust all medical treatments before seeking death. After legalizing euthanasia in 2016, Canada broadened its law in 2021 to allow people with incurable, but not terminal, conditions – including disability alone – to seek a way to die. This vastly expanded the number of people eligible, and medical groups in some territories and provinces require doctors to inform, offer or help provide euthanasia to any patients who might qualify. Adults with serious, incurable conditions must have a written request approved by two independent doctors or nurse practitioners. Those with nonterminal cases must be informed of other ways to relieve their suffering, among other requirements, and there’s a minimum 90-day assessment period. As the eligibility pool has grown, so has criticism among academics, disability advocacy groups and religious communities. Doctors and nurses 'do not treat MAiD as an option of last resort,' said an August report published by the Christian think tank Cardus. The nonprofit organization Inclusion Canada regularly hears from people with disabilities who are offered euthanasia, including one disabled woman whose physiotherapist suggested it when she sought help for a bruised hip, said executive vice president Krista Carr. 'Our response to the intolerable suffering of people with disabilities is: 'Your life is not worth living,’' she said. 'We'll just offer them the lethal injection, and we'll offer it readily.' Doctors privately debate euthanasia cases When euthanasia was legalized, doctors and nurse practitioners set up email discussion groups as confidential forums to discuss potentially troubling cases, with limited patient details for privacy. They're now run by the Canadian Association of MAiD Assessors and Providers. Association President Dr. Konia Trouton told AP via email that providing euthanasia for vulnerability or financial reasons alone is 'completely forbidden.' Trouton said doctors and nurse practitioners consult with one another on the forums 'to gain insights and learn from the experiences of others.' The participant who shared some of the email discussions with AP provided dozens of messages raising questions about the medical and ethical complexities of euthanasia requests from people nationwide who weren't terminally ill. A middle-aged worker whose ankle and back injuries made him unable to resume his previous job told his doctor that the government’s measly support was 'leaving (him) with no choice but to pursue MAiD.' His doctor told forum participants the patient met legal criteria, with severe pain, strained social relationships and inability to work. Others agreed and assured the doctor the man was clearly in pain. But the doctor was hesitant because the man cited reduced government payments as a key factor. Cases of homelessness appear regularly and spark some of the most heated debate. One doctor wrote that although his patient had a serious lung disease, his suffering was 'mostly because he is homeless, in debt and cannot tolerate the idea of (long-term care) of any kind.' A respondent questioned whether the fear of living in the nursing home was truly intolerable. Another said the prospect of 'looking at the wall or ceiling waiting to be fed … to have diapers changed' was sufficiently painful. The man was eventually euthanized. One provider said any suggestion they should provide patients with better housing options before offering euthanasia 'seems simply unrealistic and hence, cruel,' amid a national housing crisis. Physicians said keeping their opinions out of assessments was difficult — and painful, given patients' emotions and desperation. Experts not linked to the forums said that while doctors and nurses need private space for discussion, the lack of transparency about controversial cases is alarming. 'The question about who gets euthanasia is a societal question,' said Kasper Raus, a researcher at Ghent University’s Bioethics Institute in Belgium. 'This is a procedure that ends people’s lives, so we need to be closely monitoring any changes in who is getting it. 'If not, the entire practice could change and veer away from the reasons that we legalized euthanasia.' Data suggest marginalized people are affected Critics have long warned that Canada’s policies have led to euthanasia among disadvantaged people whose deaths weren't imminent. Despite publicized cases of people asking to be killed because of insufficient support, government officials have largely refuted the idea that socially disadvantaged people are being euthanized. But in Ontario, more than three quarters of people euthanized when their death wasn't imminent required disability support before their death in 2023, according to data from a slideshow presentation by the province’s chief coroner, shared with AP by both a researcher and a doctor on condition of anonymity due to its sensitive nature. Of people killed when they weren’t terminally ill, nearly 29% lived in the poorest parts of Ontario, compared with 20% of the province's general population living in the most deprived communities, the data show. People euthanized with nonterminal conditions were 'more likely to live in neighborhoods where there’s higher levels of residential instability, higher material deprivation and greater dependency on government support,' Ontario Chief Coroner Dr. Dirk Huyer said during his May presentation. The figures suggest poverty may be a factor in Canada’s nonterminal euthanasia cases. But Huyer told AP that the data was only an early analysis and 'it’s tough to know exactly what it means,' saying that his job was only to present the statistics. Poverty doesn't appear to disproportionately affect patients with terminal diseases who are euthanized, according to the leaked data. And experts say no other country that has legalized euthanasia has seen a marked number of deaths in impoverished people. Overall for Ontario, the data show, nonterminal patients account for a small portion of all euthanasia cases: 116 of 4,528 deaths last year. But the presentation and discussion among Ontario officials and medical professionals show rising awareness of euthanasia deaths for social reasons. Privately, officials admit concern Health Canada, the government agency responsible for national health policy, publishes yearly reports of euthanasia trends but hasn’t released any review of cases that triggered ethical concerns. Marie-Pier Burelle, a spokeswoman for Health Canada, said in an email that 'lack of access to social supports or to health services is not and would never be part of eligibility criteria' for euthanasia. Burelle cited 'stringent safeguards to affirm and protect the inherent and equal value of every person’s life.' In private, though, Canadian officials have examined worrisome cases. A document from the Ministry of the Solicitor General in Ontario sent to all euthanasia providers in the province in May noted two cases of 'lessons learned' in nonterminal cases. The document was shared with AP by a doctor on condition of anonymity because it wasn’t authorized for release. In one, a 74-year-old patient who’d suffered high blood pressure, a stroke and blindness, among other difficulties, was increasingly dependent on their spouse and 'expressed their interest in MAiD to their family physician, due to their vision impairment and loss of hope for improvement of their vision and quality of life.' The report cited three instances where legally mandated safeguards were not met. Among them: No assessor or expert versed in the nonterminal condition was involved, and efforts to discuss alternatives to death were 'limited.' The report also said the procedure was scheduled 'based on the spouse’s preference of timing.' Officials questioned whether 'the patient’s death was genuinely voluntary and free of coercion.' Independent legal experts said those breaches could constitute violations of criminal law. Some push for more reflection Polls show that expanding access to euthanasia has long been supported across Canada. But the country appears to be pushing the boundaries of what’s socially acceptable, experts say, and that could have global implications, as countries including Britain and France move towards legalization. 'Canada seems to be providing euthanasia for social reasons, when people don't have the financial means, which would be a big taboo in Europe,' said Theo Boer, professor of health care ethics at Groningen University in the Netherlands. 'That may be what Canadians want, but they would still benefit from some honest self-reflection about what is going on.' Some of that reflection is happening in the confidential providers’ forums. They’ve debated whether it’s valid to euthanize people for obesity in several cases. One woman with severe obesity described herself as a 'useless body taking up space' — she'd lost interest in activities, became socially withdrawn and said she had 'no purpose,' according to the doctor who reviewed her case. Another physician reasoned that euthanasia was warranted because obesity is 'a medical condition which is indeed grievous and irremediable.' When a health worker inquired whether anyone had euthanized patients for blindness, one provider reported four such cases. In one, they said, an elderly man who saw 'only shadows' was his wife’s caregiver when he requested euthanasia; he wanted her to die with him. The couple had several appointments with an assessor before the wife 'finally agreed' to be killed, the provider said. She died unexpectedly just days before the scheduled euthanasia. Providers on the forum were divided over ending the lives of people in mourning. One case involved a woman in her 80s who required dialysis and lost her husband, sibling and cat in a six-week period. Her assessor said her suffering and request to die were tied to her husband’s death rather than any medical conditions. Some doctors said because she lost her husband — the protective factor that would make the other losses and suffering bearable — she qualified. Others recommended grief counseling instead. A provider referenced a similar case, in which a widow requested euthanasia within weeks of her husband’s death: 'Her whole life system crashed. I felt much ease in providing for her and had no pushback from the coroner.' Dr. Ellen Wiebe, who has euthanized more than 400 people in Canada, told AP that while poverty inevitably exacerbates suffering, improved housing and social situations have never changed a patient’s mind. 'The idea that because I’m disabled, I should lose my rights that undisabled people have is outrageous,' said Wiebe, who suffers from heart disease and uses a wheelchair. She predicted legal consequences if officials introduce more safeguards for euthanasia: 'We’ll just be back in court with somebody saying, ‘You interfered with my basic human rights.’' The government already faces challenges to its euthanasia laws on all sides. The advocacy group Dying with Dignity filed an August lawsuit in Ontario, alleging it's 'discriminatory' to exclude mentally ill people from euthanasia. A coalition of disability-rights organizations in a lawsuit last month argued that euthanasia legislation has resulted in premature deaths of people with disabilities. On euthanasia forums, doctors and nurses continue to struggle with cases of patients who aren’t fatally ill, lamenting that Canada’s health and social services can seem woefully inadequate. 'I have great discomfort with the idea of MAiD being driven by social circumstances,' one provider said. 'I don’t have a good solution to social deprivation either, so I feel pretty useless when I receive requests like this.' ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

In the heartland of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, the old ways have changed and violence rages	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Cellphone chats have become death sentences in the continuing, bloody factional war inside Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel. Cartel gunmen stop youths on the street or in their cars and demand their phones. If they find a contact who’s a member of a rival faction, a chat with a wrong word or a photo with the wrong person, the phone owner is dead. Then, they’ll go after everyone on that person's contact list, forming a potential chain of kidnapping, torture and death. That has left residents of Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, afraid to even leave home at night, much less visit towns a few miles away where many have weekend retreats. 'You can’t go five minutes out of the city, ... not even in daylight,' said Ismael Bojórquez, a veteran journalist in Culiacan. 'Why? Because the narcos have set up roadblocks and they stop you and search through your cellphone.' And it’s not just your own chats: If a person is traveling in a car with others, one bad contact or chat can get the whole group kidnapped. That’s what happened to the son of a local news photographer. The 20-year-old was stopped with two other youths and something was found on one of their phones; all three disappeared. Calls were made and the photographer’s son was finally released, but the other two were never seen again. Residents of Culiacan had long been accustomed to a day or two of violence once in a while. The presence of the Sinaloa cartel is woven into everyday life there, and people knew to stay indoors when they saw the convoys of double-cab pickups racing through the streets. But never have they seen the solid month of fighting that broke out Sept. 9 between factions of the Sinaloa cartel after drug lords Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after flying there in a small plane on July 25. Zambada later claimed he was kidnapped and forced aboard the plane by Guzmán López, causing a violent battle between Zambada’s faction and the 'Chapitos' group led by the sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán. Residents of Culiacan are mourning their old lives, when the wheels of the local economy were greased by cartel wealth but civilians seldom suffered — unless they cut off the wrong pickup truck in traffic. Juan Carlos Ayala, an academic who studies the anthropology of the drug trade at the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, said that following the arrests of Guzmán López and Zambada in July, a new generation of younger, more flashy and cosmopolitan drug lords have taken over. They fight with extreme violence, kidnapping and cellphone tracking — not the old kind of handshake deals their elders used alongside shootouts to settle matters. 'There is a new generation of leaders of drugs and organized crime here, that has other strategies,' Ayala said. 'They see that the tactic of shootouts hasn’t worked for them, so they go for kidnapping.' 'They catch one person, and he has messages from the rival group,' said Ayala. 'So they go after him to squeeze more information, and that starts a chain of hunting, to catch the enemy.' The new tactics are reflected in the huge wave of armed carjackings in and around Culiacan. Cartel gunmen used to steal the SUVs and pickups they favor for use in cartel convoys; but now they focus on stealing smaller sedans. They use these to go undetected in their silent, deadly kidnappings. Often, the first a driver knows is when a passing car tosses out a spray of bent nails to puncture his tires. Vehicles pull up front and rear to cut him off. The driver is bundled into another car. All that is left for neighbors to find is a car with burst tires, the doors open, the engine running, in the middle of the street. The State Council on Public Safety, a civic group, estimates that in the past month there have been an average of six killings and seven disappearances or kidnappings in and around the city every day. The group said about 200 families have fled their homes in outlying communities because of the violence. Culiacan is no stranger to violence — shooting broke out across the city in October 2019 when soldiers mounted a failed attempt to arrest another of Chapo Guzmán’s sons, Ovidio. Fourteen people were killed that day. A few days later, civic activist Estefanía López arranged a peace march and 4,000 residents turned out for it. When she tried to do something similar this year, she could get only about 1,500 people to attend a similar demonstration. 'We got a lot of messages beforehand from a lot of people who said they wanted to join and march, to support the cause, but who were afraid to come,' López said. There’s reason to be afraid: Last week, gunmen burst into a Culiacan hospital to kill a patient previously wounded by gunshots. In a town north of Culiacan, drivers were astonished to see a military helicopter seeking to corral four gunmen in helmets and tactical vests just yards from a highway; the gunmen were shooting back at the chopper. The government’s response to all this has been to blame the United States for stirring up trouble by allowing the drug lords to turn themselves in, and to send in hundreds of army troops. But irregular urban combat in the heart of a city of 1 million inhabitants — against a cartel that has lots of .50-caliber sniper rifles and machine guns — is not the army’s specialty. Squads of soldiers went into a luxury apartment complex in the city’s center to detain a suspect and they wound up shooting to death a young lawyer who was merely a bystander. López, the peace activist, has been asking for soldiers and police to be posted outside schools, so children can return to classes — most are currently taking classes online because their parents judge it too dangerous to take them to school. But police can’t solve the problem: Culiacan’s entire municipal force has been temporarily disarmed by soldiers to check their guns, something that’s been done in the past when the army suspects policemen are working for drug cartels. The local army commander recently acknowledged that it's up to the cartel factions — not authorities — when the violence will stop. 'In Culiacan, there is not even faith anymore that we will be safe, with police or soldiers,' López said, noting that that has had a clear effect on daily life and the economy. 'A lot of businesses, restaurants and nightclubs have been closed for the past month.' Laura Guzmán, the leader of the local restaurant chamber, said about 180 businesses in Culiacan have closed, permanently or temporarily, since Sept. 9 and almost 2,000 jobs have been lost. Local businesses tried to organize evening 'tardeadas' — long afternoons — for residents who were afraid to go out after dark, but they didn’t draw enough customers. 'Young people are not interested in going out right now,' Guzmán said. For those looking to get away from the violence temporarily, the seaside resort of Mazatlan used to be only 2½ hours away by car. But that’s not an option since last month when cartel gunmen hijacked passenger buses, forced the tourists off and burned the vehicles to block the road to Mazatlan. That leaves just one option, and one only open to some. 'Those who have the economic resources get out of the city by airplane to take a break,' Guzmán said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-sinaloa-cartel-battles-culiacan-b18bbd3abb4ba528444fef3598bdf05a	2024-10-15T19:03:59-07:00	
Zelenskyy to unveil 'victory plan' to Ukrainian lawmakers after presenting it to Western allies	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was set to at least partially unveil a plan to win the war against Russia to his country's Parliament on Wednesday after weeks of dropping hints about the blueprint to lukewarm Western allies, including U.S. President Joe Biden. The plan — comprising military, political, diplomatic and economic elements — is considered by many as Ukraine’s last resort to strengthen its hand in any future cease-fire negotiations with Russia. Thus far, however, no country has publicly endorsed it or commented on its feasibility. Zelenskyy is keen to get the 'victory plan' in place before a new U.S. president is sworn in next year, though Ukrainian officials say neither presidential candidate will necessarily improve Kyiv’s standing in the war. Zelenskyy’s presentation to Parliament, announced on Monday by presidential adviser Serhii Leshchenko, comes during a bleak moment in Ukraine. The country’s military is suffering losses along the eastern front as Russian forces inch closer to a strategically significant victory near the crucial logistics hub of Pokrovsk. At every turn, Kyiv is outnumbered by Moscow: The country is struggling to replenish ranks with an unpopular mobilization drive; its ammunition stocks are limited; and Russia’s superiority in the skies is wreaking havoc for Ukrainian defensive lines. It’s not clear how much of his victory plan Zelenskyy will reveal on Wednesday; Leshchenko indicated that it would be fully unveiled, while other officials suggested that the president would not divulge its most sensitive elements to all lawmakers. Either way, the plan essentially puts Kyiv’s future in the hands of its allies. Without it, any deal with Russia would almost certainly be unfavorable for Ukraine, which has lost a fifth of its territory and tens of thousands of lives in the conflict. Kyiv would be unlikely to ever recover occupied territory, or receive reparations for widespread destruction across the country. Several elements of the plan have already come to light: making Ukraine a member of NATO; allowing the country to use Western long-range weapons to strike deep inside Russia; providing resources to strengthen Ukraine's air and other defenses, and intensifying sanctions against Russia. Ukraine's surprise military incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in August was also part of the plan, Zelenskyy told reporters. He said the 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of territory captured by Ukraine — along with other provisions of the plan — will likely serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Russia. NATO’s Article 5 states that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all. Ukraine's inclusion in the alliance would deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading again, Ukrainian officials argue. Western leaders have so far been reluctant to guarantee an invitation, fearing escalation from Putin. Ukrainian officials were expecting feedback from Western allies at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, during which defense leaders from 50-plus partner nations gather to coordinate weapons aid for the war. Scheduled for this past weekend, the summit was postponed after Biden canceled his attendance in response to Hurricane Milton in the U.S. Zelenskyy has since toured Western capitals to present other key allies an outline of his vision. But none so far have given any indication they will support the plan. Some expressed concerns over the tight deadline set by Zelenskyy, who gave allies just three months to adopt the blueprint’s main tenets in late September. Thus far, the U.S. has been Kyiv’s main backer during the two-and-a-half-year war. But Biden has balked at the request to use long-range weapons to strike specific targets inside Russia, fearing a possible escalation in the war. Meanwhile, an intensifying conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hezbollah that risks embroiling Iran has diverted Washington’s attention. Many expect Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris to continue Biden’s policy and maintain the status quo. Under Biden, U.S. assistance to Kyiv, though substantial, has consistently arrived too late to make a significant difference for Ukrainian forces. Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump has only said that he’d end the war quickly, without saying how. Meanwhile, Brazil and China have proposed alternate peace plans that Zelenskyy has rejected, saying they would merely pause the war and give Moscow time to consolidate its battered army and defense industry. ___ Follow AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-victory-plan-unveiled-zelenskyy-parliament-f3525550f6986f590777193a7385c0c5	2024-10-15T19:03:35-07:00

An inmate convicted of the 1994 killing of a Japanese psychic was found dead in a Hawaii prison cell	HONOLULU (AP) — A Hawaii inmate convicted of the 1994 murder of a Japanese psychic and her son was killed in prison, authorities said. Staff at the Halawa Correctional Facility in Honolulu found Raita Fukusaku, 59, bleeding on the floor of his cell with head and neck trauma early Monday, according to the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. 'It was determined that the victim had been assaulted and stabbed by his cellmate, a 38-year-old male,' Honolulu police said in a public information bulletin. The cellmate was immediately removed and placed in a holding unit, the corrections department said. Authorities were still investigating Tuesday. The Honolulu medical examiner's office had not yet released a cause of death. Fukusaku was the first Japanese national to be extradited to the United States and convicted of murder, Hawaii News Now reported. He was serving a prison sentence for two counts of second-degree murder. He was found guilty in 1995 of killing Kototome Fujita and her son Goro Fujita, according to KITV, which reported that Kototome Fujita was found shot in her penthouse and that her son was found dead in his car in a parking structure of a Waikiki hotel. The condo unit and Goro Fujita's car were set on fire. Myles Breiner, Fukusaku's former attorney, told KHON-TV he never had any problems in the 30 years he's been in prison. 'He wasn’t gang-related, he seemed to rise above all that. He got along with all the staff,' Breiner said. 'I’m not satisfied with the fact that this occurred. This should not have occurred.'	https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-inmate-murder-japan-psychic-2d58d6c2fbb8b2053138f4e79b04a235	2024-10-15T14:04:29-07:00	
Japan’s Toho acquires North American animation company GKIDS, Studio Ghibli's US steward	The Japanese entertainment giant Toho has reached an agreement to acquire the Oscar-winning animation outfit GKIDS, the companies said Tuesday. The deal gives Toho an established North American distributor and sales operation in GKIDS, which has become a force in animation since its founding in 2008. As producer and distributor of artist-driven animation, GKIDS has brought acclaimed films like 'Song of the Sea,' 'The Breadwinner' and 'Wolfwalkers' to North American audiences and operated as the domestic stewards of the Studio Ghibli catalog. After 13 best animated feature Oscar nominations, GKIDS won the award earlier this year for Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli’s 'The Boy and the Heron.' Toho, meanwhile, is home to internationally recognized brands, from Godzilla to popular anime franchises like 'My Hero Academia' and 'Jujutsu Kaisen.' The company is hoping to grow and expand outside of Japan and had already worked with GKIDS for years, on releases like 'Weathering With You' and 'Spirited Away: Live on Stage.' Toho president and CEO Hiro Matsuoka said in a statement that GKIDS’ unique position in the U.S. market, 'dovetails perfectly with Toho’s own strengths and strategic mission. This partnership accelerates Toho’s goals to prioritize animation, develop international markets, and support IP creation, while bringing exceptional Japanese and animated content to global audiences.' GKIDS founder Eric Beckman will remain CEO, and Dave Jesteadt will stay president. Both said that the company will continue to operate as they have, 'but now with the backing of a highly complementary and legendary parent company.' The financial terms were not disclosed.	https://apnews.com/article/toho-acquires-gkids-f9fdd050059e585560aaf647d78fac86	2024-10-15T12:14:04-07:00
