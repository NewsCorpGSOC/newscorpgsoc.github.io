Violent scenes in Glasgow city center ahead of Scottish League Cup final between Celtic and Rangers	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — Police said missiles were thrown at officers during violent scenes in Glasgow on Sunday ahead of the Scottish League Cup final between rivals Celtic and Rangers. Police said there were also reports of broken windows and that officers would use stop and search powers to 'prevent disorder and serious violence.' Videos shared on social media appeared to show flares let off in Glasgow city center and gangs of masked people running through the streets. Some shoppers could be seen taking cover in a store entrance as people charged past. 'We have dealt with a number of incidents in Glasgow city center today involving individuals engaging in disorder and violence across the city,' chief superintendent Stevie Dolan said in a statement. 'The use of weapons or violence will not be tolerated and officers will take action where necessary to ensure safety. 'It impacts other members of the public and the vast majority of football supporters who want to enjoy the cup final event safely.' Celtic and Rangers are both based in Glasgow and have one of the fiercest rivalries in British soccer. They were playing in the Scottish League Cup final at the country's national stadium, Hampden Park. It was 3-3 after 90 minutes with the game going into extra time. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/celtic-rangers-fans-glasgow-violence-3789da19e6573016d32da702dad967de	2024-12-15T08:51:37-08:00	
French police detain man and seize firearms after 5 people shot dead near Dunkirk	DUNKIRK, France (AP) — French police are investigating the deaths of five people who were fatally shot in the Dunkirk area, in northern France, on Saturday. A 22-year-old man later turned himself in to police, according to authorities and local media. An unnamed company owner in Wormhout, located south of Dunkirk, was killed first, followed by two private security agents and two migrants in Loon-Plage, located just west of Dunkirk, according to the Interior Ministry. Dunkirk's prosecutor said the suspect gave himself up to the gendarmerie brigade in Ghyvelde, east of Dunkirk, at about 5:20 p.m. and said he had killed five people. The man, who was unknown to authorities, was taken into police custody, according to the prosecutor, who said several firearms were found in the man's car. Officials are trying to determine the suspect’s motive. Such shootings are particularly rare in France.	https://apnews.com/article/france-shootings-five-killed-migrants-3b49999be4c5b8abcf08ed63fdb39d66	2024-12-15T07:44:23-08:00	
Israel will close its Ireland embassy over Gaza tensions as Palestinian death toll nears 45,000	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel said Sunday it will close its embassy in Ireland as relations deteriorated over the war in Gaza, where Palestinian medical officials said new Israeli airstrikes killed over 30 people including several children. The decision to close the embassy came in response to what Israel’s foreign minister has described as Ireland’s 'extreme anti-Israel policies.' In May, Israel recalled its ambassador to Dublin after Ireland announced, along with Norway, Spain and Slovenia, it would recognize a Palestinian state. The Irish cabinet last week decided to formally intervene in South Africa’s case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, which accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Israel denies it. 'We are concerned that a very narrow interpretation of what constitutes genocide leads to a culture of impunity in which the protection of civilians is minimized,' Ireland’s deputy premier and foreign affairs minister, Micheal Martin, said in a statement. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar's statement on the embassy closure said that 'Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel.' Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris called the decision to close the embassy 'deeply regrettable.' He added on X: 'I utterly reject the assertion that Ireland is anti-Israel. Ireland is pro-peace, pro-human rights and pro-international law.' Israeli strikes in Gaza kill a journalist and children Israeli forces continued Sunday to pound largely isolated northern Gaza, as the Palestinian death toll in the war approached 45,000. One airstrike hit the Khalil Aweida school in the town of Beit Hanoun and killed at least 15 people, according to nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital where casualties were taken. The dead included two parents and their daughter and a father and his son, the hospital said. In Gaza City, at least 17 people including six women and five children were killed in three airstrikes that hit houses sheltering displaced people, according to Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital. 'We woke up to the strike. I woke up with the rubble on top of me,' said a bandaged Yahia al-Yazji, who grieved for his wife and daughter. 'I found my wife with her head and skull visible, and my daughter’s intestines were gone. My wife was three months pregnant.' His hand rested on a body wrapped in a blanket on the floor. Israel's military in a statement said it struck a 'terrorist cell' in Gaza City and a 'terrorist meeting point' in the Beit Hanoun area. Another Israeli airstrike killed a Palestinian journalist working for Al Jazeera, Ahmed al-Lawh, in central Gaza, a hospital and the Qatari-based TV station said. The strike hit a point for Gaza’s civil defense agency in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp, Al-Awda Hospital said. Also killed were three civil defense workers including the head of the agency in Nuseirat, according to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital. The civil defense is Gaza's main rescue agency and operates under the Hamas-run government. The war in Gaza began after Hamas and other militants from Gaza stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking well over 200 hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed almost 45,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry’s count does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but it says over half of the dead have been women and children. ___ Melzer reported from Nahariya, Israel.

Brazilian President Lula discharged from hospital after surgery to stop brain bleed	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was discharged from the hospital Sunday after undergoing surgery to stop a brain bleed. The 79-year-old president spoke alongside doctors in a press conference on Sunday morning in a show that he was doing well following the head surgery. 'I’m here alive, well, with the urge to work. And I’ll tell you something I used to say during the campaign. I’m 79 years old, I have the energy of 30 and the enthusiasm of 20 to build this country,' Lula said. Lula's medical team said the surgery went well and that Lula would be able to walk and hold meetings as he rests in his home in the city of Sao Paulo until Thursday. The leader's doctors said international travel would be out of the question until further notice, but that he'd be able to travel to the country's capital, Brasilia, if all goes well in a medical exam. The president also offered his first comments on Saturday's arrest of Gen. Walter Braga Netto, a former member of President Jair Bolsonaro’s government and his 2022 running mate, in connection with investigations into an alleged coup plot. Lula has largely avoided commenting on the case because of ongoing investigations. 'It is not possible for us to accept disrespect for democracy, disrespect for the constitution. And it is not possible for us to accept that in a generous country like Brazil we have people of high military rank plotting the death of a president, his vice president and a presiding judge of the supreme electoral court,' said Lula. Braga Netto was indicted in November, along with Bolsonaro and 35 others, on charges of plotting a coup to keep Bolsonaro in office after his failed 2022 reelection bid. Prosecutors have not yet filed formal charges against Braga Netto. His arrest was related to allegations of obstructing the collection of evidence, the Federal Police said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-surgery-628cff2dc0c07ccaf003093c4c5e7218	2024-12-15T06:17:33-08:00	
Ukrainian drone hits Russia's Chechnya as Kyiv continues pushback after Moscow bombardment	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone struck a campus belonging to Russia’s National Guard Sunday in the Russian region of Chechnya, as Kyiv continues to strike back after a mass air attack from Moscow. Footage on social media showed a drone swooping low over the Chechen capital, Grozny, some 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of the front line in Ukraine, before exploding. No casualties were reported. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov confirmed that the drone had hit a site belonging to the Akhmat Grozny riot police battalion, and said that two other drones had been shot down by air defenses. Kadyrov pledged revenge on Ukrainian forces and said he had ordered a missile strike against military facilities in Kharkiv in retaliation for the attack. The claim could not be independently verified. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that it had shot down 15 Ukrainian drones overnight in the country’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, as well as over the Black Sea. It did not mention the Grozny attack. An official in Ukraine’s security service also told the AP on Sunday that Ukrainian intelligence services had conducted a special operation to sever Russia’s logistic fuel supply routes from Ukraine’s annexed Crimea to occupied Zaporizhzhia. The operation, which took place Saturday, destroyed a locomotive and 40 tanker cars, the security official said. A sabotage operation reportedly blew up railway tracks while the train was moving, before HIMARS rocket launch systems joined the attack. 'As a result, a key railway branch used to supply Russian troops was put out of service for an extended period,' said the official, who asked to remain anonymous in order to share sensitive information. Kyiv’s strikes on Russia over the weekend, which also set fire to a major oil terminal on Saturday, follow a mass bombardment across Ukraine by Moscow Friday. Russia fired 93 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 drones at its neighbor, battering Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Russia’s troops also continue to slowly advance in eastern Ukraine. Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War reported Sunday that geolocated footage placed Russian forces inside the settlement of Kurakhove, which Moscow’s troops had besieged for weeks after surrounding it on three sides. The push compounds further uncertainty as to how the war might unfold next year, with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, sparking doubt as to whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue. In an interview published in TIME magazine Thursday, Trump said that he was against allowing Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil using U.S.-provided weapons. Meanwhile, Russia launched 108 drones across Ukraine overnight into Sunday, the Ukrainian air force said. It said that 56 were shot down by air defenses, while another 49 disappeared from radar after failing to reach their targets. Three more drones returned to Russia, officials said. Gov. Vitalii Kim said that two people were injured in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv as a result of the attack, which also damaged local infrastructure. —— Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-grozny-drone-attack-7655bcd300e3e11e28f571a613d59ef0	2024-12-15T05:44:10-08:00	
Tis the season for roasting chestnuts. But in the US, native ones are almost gone	It's been a very long time since vendors sold the American chestnut on city sidewalks. It's no longer the variety whose smell some people associate with Christmastime as it wafts from street carts. Because it's virtually extinct. But memories of the American chestnut's legacy keep resurfacing for the researchers who want to bring it back. They describe its wood that paneled the homes and schoolrooms of their grandparents, or the photographs of men on the street corners of old Baltimore, with hot bags of nuts cooked on charcoal. 'You can feel that connection to a place, and that connection to utility, and the connection to the importance that this tree played in virtually every aspect of the lives of people,' said Sara Fern Fitzsimmons, chief conservation officer with The American Chestnut Foundation, which is working to restore the tree to flourish as it once did. Fitzsimmons said that will likely take a lot longer than many chestnut enthusiasts had hoped. Researchers have hit roadblocks with attempts to breed or genetically modify a version that can withstand the invasive blight that has hammered the species since the early 1900s. If and when they do find the right variety, they'll need to figure out how to plant it and help it thrive in forests that are under pressure from climate change, globalization and development. Once a hallmark of forests from Georgia to New England, American chestnuts now exist mostly as a vast network of root systems underground, sending up shoots. They grow for a time, but the fungal blight takes hold when the trees start maturing. East Asian varieties, like those that introduced the blight in the first place, are immune to the blight, and produce most of the edible chestnuts for fall and winter snacking. Still, American chestnut trees are better suited for timber, they're culturally loved by people all over North America and they used to be an important species for the ecological health of forests, providing a reliable source of nutritious food and shelter for wildlife and humans alike. 'It was really a pretty significant species to lose,' said Amy Brunner, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who works on the tree's genetics. 'The more diversity you lose, the less resilient that forest ecosystem is.' The American Chestnut Foundation, among others, has been trying for decades to breed a hybrid that is mostly American in genetics but with the fungus-fighting traits of the Chinese type. Fitzsimmons said breeders have learned just how difficult that is — blight resistance involves several different genes and it has proven hard to separate them from the traits that distinguish Chinese chestnuts. To speed the process, some scientists have been working on genetically modifying American chestnuts to see if they can boost their immunity that way instead. But progress was delayed by a recent mix-up involving two versions of a genetically modified American chestnut that scientists at State University of New York had hoped could get through the regulatory process as soon as this year. 'It kind of stinks that it happened because now it’s taking a little bit longer than we had hoped,' said Linda McGuigan, a research support specialist at the university. But scientists there and elsewhere are continuing to pursue many avenues. 'I don’t think you will get there, to all you desire, without both,' Brunner said, referring to the two main methods of breeding and genetic modification. Breeding is vital for achieving enough genetic diversity for trees to adapt to a changing world, she said, but added that she thinks some genetic manipulation will be needed to get to enough blight resistance for American chestnuts to stand a chance. Meanwhile, other scientists are working on projects to tackle another big challenge ahead for chestnuts: where to plant them. If a successful tree is cobbled together with genes taken from trees from Tennessee to New York, where would it have the best chance at surviving, given how a warming planet is changing habitat around the world? A team at Virginia Tech published a paper this summer to try to answer that question. They looked at 32 climate variables and compared them to projected future climates, then calculated the shortest distance that regionally specific American chestnuts would have to move to offset warming. The idea was to one day help them survive a new climate while keeping them as close as possible to where they once thrived. 'I don’t think it’s hyperbolic to say it’s revolutionary' for teams at The American Chestnut Foundation, said Fitzsimmons, who contributed data to the project. She said the project will help them better figure out where to collect genes from the immature trees that remain across the country. Tom Kimmerer, a forest scientist who taught at the University of Kentucky, is working on a book about trees including the American chestnut. Kimmerer, who was not involved in the research, called it 'robust and well supported' and 'critically important to the success of the chestnut.' Stacy Clark, a research forester at the U.S. Forest Service, said the findings are useful, but added that they need to be backed up with real-world experiments. 'I think with advancements in genetics, they can probably get pretty fast data off of those field trials. But still, all of that takes time and effort, right?' For now, forest scientists know their work might not pay off in their lifetimes. It's a lesson that became clear for the community when pioneering chestnut restoration experts Bill Powell and Chuck Maynard both died in the past 13 months. McGuigan supported both of their research for years as lab manager at SUNY's college of environmental science and forestry. 'The project moves on, lives on. And we honor their memory,' McGuigan said. 'I want to do something good for the future, for my children.' ___ Follow Melina Walling on X @MelinaWalling and Bluesky @melinawalling.bsky.social. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Russia launches a rescue operation after a storm damages 2 oil tankers in the Kerch Strait	MOSCOW (AP) — Two Russian oil tankers have taken heavy damage amid a storm in the Kerch Strait, spilling oil and sparking an emergency rescue operation, Russian officials told state news outlets Sunday. The Volgoneft-212 tanker, which was carrying a crew of 13 and a cargo of fuel oil, ran aground and had its bow torn away, said Russian state news agency TASS, citing the country’s Emergency Situations Ministry. The damage was caused by severe weather conditions, officials said. A second tanker, the Volgoneft 239, was also damaged in the storm and left drifting in the same area with 14 crewmembers on board, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. The Kerch Strait separates the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula from Russia and is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to illegally seize control of the area. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-kerch-strait-oil-shipping-transport-storm-4eed65f6d8d999b5451d36d414af2e8e	2024-12-15T03:00:48-08:00	
Christians in Syria mark country's transformation with tears as UN envoy urges an end to sanctions	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — In churches across long-stifled Syria, Christians marked the first Sunday services since Bashar Assad's ouster in an air of transformation. Some worshippers were in tears. Others clasped their hands in prayer. 'They are promising us that government will be formed soon and, God willing, things will become better because we got rid of the tyrant,' said one worshipper, Jihad Raffoul. 'Today, our prayers are for a new page in Syria’s future,' said another, Suzan Barakat. To help those efforts, the U.N. envoy for Syria called for a quick end to Western sanctions as the country’s new leaders and regional and global powers discuss the way forward. Syria has been under sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others for years as a result of Assad’s brutal response to what began as peaceful anti-government protests in 2011 and spiraled into civil war. The rebel alliance that ousted Assad and sent him into exile in Russia a week ago faces a nation deeply isolated by the sanctions, which compounded Syria’s economic troubles. But other challenges also complicate rebuilding. The new transitional leadership has not laid out a clear vision of how the country will be governed, and the main group behind the offensive remains designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., which nevertheless has begun making direct contact with it. The U.N. envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, told reporters in Damascus that the rebels' stunningly fast offensive should be followed by a rapid international response. 'We can hopefully see a quick end to the sanctions so that we can see really a rallying around building of Syria,' he said. Parts of Syria’s biggest cities are damaged or destroyed by years of fighting. Reconstruction has been stymied largely by the sanctions that aimed to prevent rebuilding of infrastructure and property in government-held areas in the absence of a political solution. The U.N. envoy was meeting with officials from the new interim government set up by the former opposition forces who toppled Assad, led by the Islamic militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Officials in Washington have indicated that the Biden administration is considering removing the group's terror designation. Over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended an emergency meeting in Jordan with 12 foreign ministers from the Arab League, Turkey and top officials from the European Union and United Nations on how Syria should be run after a half-century of Assad family rule. They agreed that the new government should respect the rights of minorities and women, prevent terror groups from taking hold, ensure humanitarian aid reaches those in need and secure and destroy any remaining Assad-era chemical weapons. Syria's interim government is set to rule until March, but it has not made clear the process under which a new permanent administration would replace it. Arab foreign ministers have called for U.N.-supervised elections based on a new constitution approved by Syrians. 'We need to get the political process underway that is inclusive of all Syrians,' Pedersen said. 'That process obviously needs to be led by the Syrians themselves.' He also called for ' justice and accountability for crimes' committed during the war, as some families continued to search for the tens of thousands of people that Assad's government had placed in prisons and detention facilities. Many Syrian Christians, who made up 10% of the population before Syria’s civil war, had either fled the country or supported Assad out of fear of Islamist insurgents. Last Sunday's church services were canceled. 'We were scared of the events taking place,' said Ibrahim Shahin, a Catholic church supervisor. But this Sunday, doors reopened and bells rang out. In another sign of Syrians’ yearning for normalcy after the whirlwind of events, schools in Damascus reopened Sunday for the first time since the insurgents marched in the capital. At Nahla Zaidan school in the Mezzah neighborhood, teachers hoisted the three-starred revolutionary flag in place of the former government’s two-starred one. 'Although I think some of them are afraid, they came to build Syria and to live the victories of this country,' said Maysoun Al-Ali, the school director. 'God willing, there will be more development, more security and more construction in this beloved country.' ___ Associated Press writers Abdulrahman Shaheen and Sally Abou AlJoud contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-sanctions-un-3f0031108d7e58c2343bd6a8fd42254c	2024-12-15T01:30:14-08:00	
At least 11 dead in the French territory of Mayotte as Cyclone Chido causes devastating damage	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — At least 11 people have died after Cyclone Chido caused devastating damage in the French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, France's Interior Ministry said Sunday. The intense tropical cyclone has now made landfall on the east coast of Africa, where aid agencies are warning of more loss of life and severe damage in northern Mozambique. The ministry said it was proving difficult to get a precise tally of the dead and injured in Mayotte amid fears the death toll will increase. A local hospital reported that nine people were in critical condition there and 246 others were injured. The tropical cyclone blew through the southeastern Indian Ocean, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in its path and suffered extensive damage on Saturday, officials said. The local prefect said it was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Saturday night after an emergency meeting in Paris that there were fears that the death toll in Mayotte 'will be high' and the island had been largely devastated. Prime Minister François Bayrou, who took office on Friday, said public infrastructure on Mayotte had been severely damaged or destroyed, including the main hospital and the airport. He said many people living in precarious shacks in slum areas have faced very serious risks. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale. Mayotte has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands about 800 kilometers (500 miles) off Africa’s east coast. It is France's poorest island and the European Union's poorest territory. In some parts, entire neighborhoods were flattened, while local residents reported many trees had been uprooted and boats had been flipped or sunk. The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to 'help the population and prevent potential looting.' More than 100 rescuers and firefighters have been deployed in Mayotte from France and the nearby territory of Reunion, and an additional reinforcement of 140 people was due to be sent on Sunday. Supplies were being rushed in on military aircraft and ships. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was closely monitoring the situation, while Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims of the cyclone while on a visit Sunday to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica. Chido continued its eastern trajectory and made landfall early Sunday in Mozambique on the African mainland, where emergency officials had warned that 2.5 million people could be impacted in two northern provinces, Cabo Delgado and Nampula. Landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe are also preparing to be affected, with both countries warning they might have to evacuate people from low-lying areas because of flooding. In Mozambique, the United Nations Children's Fund said Cabo Delgado province, home to around 2 million people, had been hit hard. 'Many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed and we are working closely with government to ensure continuity of essential basic services,' UNICEF said. 'While we are doing everything we can, additional support is urgently needed.' UNICEF Mozambique spokesman Guy Taylor said in a video posted by the group from Cabo Delgado's regional capital that alongside the immediate impact of the cyclone, communities now face the prospect of being cut off from schools and health facilities for weeks. December through to March is cyclone season in the southeastern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries last year. The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne disease cholera as well as dengue fever and malaria. Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in southern Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global warming, having to deal with large humanitarian crises, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impact of climate change. —— Corbet reported from Paris. —— AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/cyclone-chido-mayotte-deaths-weather-climate-2b49b97217a47e2013dc9021d9324eb5	2024-12-15T01:24:09-08:00	
Bolivia holds a divisive popular vote for its top judges, offering lessons for the region	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Campaigning for Sunday's judicial election may be strictly forbidden, but look closer on the streets of Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, and you’ll find that some candidates have sneakily plastered their faces on packs of corn puffs and others have slipped subtle slogans into official voting manuals. After all, it’s a popular vote, and even a bit of PR can work wonders when voters know nothing about the dozens of names on their sprawling ballot papers. Bolivia is the only country in the world that holds elections for top judicial posts. Soon Mexico will, too, after former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador pushed through a highly contentious overhaul of the justice system in the face of mass protests. As Bolivia's ex-President Evo Morales did when remaking the judiciary in 2009, López Obrador has championed the overhaul as a way to purge the corrupt elite and boost democracy. But apathetic Bolivian voters say the elections have had the opposite effect, turning their courts from neutral arbiters into political prizes. 'I’ll flip a coin,' said 25-year-old architecture student Marisol Nogales when asked how she would vote on Sunday. It’s never easy to find supporters of Bolivia’s system of electing judges, which, over a decade ago, replaced a nomination system rooted in qualifications and training. Across the world, academics, investors and judges have warned that judicial elections can cement the dominance of the ruling party and gut checks and balances. And across Latin America, from El Salvador to Honduras, experts have characterized politicized judiciaries as profound threats to democracy. In Bolivia, even senior judicial officials struggle to sound positive when asked to defend the election. 'It should be a calm, easy and simple process, but it has become very litigious, very controversial,' Francisco Vargas, the vice president of Bolivia’s electoral tribunal, told The Associated Press from the court in central La Paz. This year in Bolivia, experts find it even harder than usual to praise the system. With the posts up for grabs every six years, Sunday’s vote was supposed to take place in late 2023. But as the deadline approached last year, the Constitutional Court — packed with allies of President Luis Arce — suddenly intervened to push the vote back a year, escalating his power struggle with his former mentor and current rival, Morales, over who will lead their long-dominant leftist party into Bolivia’s 2025 presidential election. Both understand that whoever wins over the Constitutional Court ensures their own political survival. Arce cited the paralysis of their divided party in justifying the vote's delay. Morales' loyalists, who hold a majority in Congress and would have determined the shortlist of judicial candidates, accused Arce of illegally extending the mandates of friendly judges for fear of losing influence over the courts. 'What happened was disorder, the kind that can lead us to a greater conflict,' said Iván Lima, the former Minister of Justice. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights criticized the postponement of elections, raising alarm about its 'potential to undermine the effective functioning of the Bolivian justice system.' Now, after many attempts to derail and further delay the vote, it is finally moving ahead Sunday. But there’s a wrinkle: It's a partial election. Only four out of nine seats on the powerful Constitutional Court are up for grabs. The other five — the majority of sitting judges, as it happens — will stay in their posts. 'The judges have turned the Constitutional Court into a sort of super power,' said Bolivian political analyst Paul Coca. Sunday marks the third time that Bolivia has held judicial elections. If the past two rounds under then-President Morales, in 2011 and 2017, are any indication, turnout will be low. Both times, the majority of Bolivians, outraged or simply baffled by the notion of endorsing unknown judges pre-selected by Morales’ allies with little transparency, voted null or blank. Critics questioned the legitimacy of the elected judges. But they nonetheless shaped the evolution of Bolivian democracy. In 2016, Morales asked Bolivians in a legally binding referendum to decide whether to let him run for a fourth term, in defiance of a two-term limit established in the 2009 Constitution he had backed. When he didn’t get the answer he wanted — a slim majority voted 'no' — his party found a workaround through the pliant Constitutional Court, where judges ruled that to deny Morales another term as president would be to violate his human rights. 'This was his major mistake,' said Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a former chief justice of the Supreme Court. It was Morales’ decision to run again in 2019 that brought a precipitous end to his remarkable 14-year tenure and ushered in a surreal parade of crises. As allegations of electoral fraud sent angry crowds into the streets, Morales resigned under pressure from the military and went into exile. Five years after coming under fire for allegedly manipulating the courts, Morales now finds himself on the receiving end of the judiciary he overhauled. 'First Evo’s party used the court to challenge the referendum’s results to promote another candidacy. Then Arce’s administration colluded with the same Constitutional Court to delay and reduce judicial elections to favor the self-prorogated judges, who run politics through judicial review,' Veltzé said. Last year, the Constitutional Court endorsed a controversial resolution from the northeastern province of Beni that the government insists blocks Morales from running for president in 2025. Last October, a prosecutor in Bolivia’s southern province of Tarija issued an arrest warrant for Morales after reviving a 2016 statutory rape case against him. And earlier this week, the country’s top criminal court swiftly extradited Morales’ former anti-drug chief to stand trial in the United Staes on charges of cocaine trafficking, despite criticism from legal experts unsatisfied by the court's review of evidence. 'They've been trying to destroy me morally, legally and politically,' Morales told the AP about the legal cases against him. Vargas, the tribunal’s vice president, is quick to insist that Bolivia is not some kind of strange outlier for electing judges by popular vote. The U.S., Switzerland and Japan also hold judicial elections. But, he conceded, not in such a sweeping way as Bolivia does, or as Mexico will. Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, bracing for fallout from the overhaul she inherited, is keen to see how Bolivia’s vote plays out. The National Electoral Institute, the Mexican voting authority, sent a delegation to observe the process in La Paz this weekend, Vargas said. When asked whether he would recommend that Mexico follow Bolivia’s example, Vargas let out a sharp laugh. 'If you want me to tell you my personal opinion,' he said, 'it might cause me some problems.'	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-judicial-elections-morales-mexico-overhaul-constitution-beba1908c766b982dd90532723062e38	2024-12-14T21:00:51-08:00	
One week into a new Syria, rebels aim for normalcy and Syrians vow not to be silent again	DAMASCUS (AP) — At Damascus’ international airport, the new head of security — one of the rebels who marched across Syria to the capital — arrived with his team. The few maintenance workers who showed up for work huddled around Maj Hamza al-Ahmed, eager to learn what will happen next. They quickly unloaded all the complaints they had been too afraid to express during the rule of President Bashar Assad, which now, inconceivably, is over. They told the bearded fighter they were denied promotions and perks in favor of pro-Assad favorites, and that bosses threatened them with prison for working too slowly. They warned of hardcore Assad supporters among airport staff, ready to return whenever the facility reopens. As Al-Ahmed tried to reassure them, Osama Najm, an engineer, announced: 'This is the first time we talk.' This was the first week of Syria’s transformation after Assad’s unexpected fall. Rebels, suddenly in charge, met a population bursting with emotions: excitement at new freedoms; grief over years of repression; and hopes, expectations and worries about the future. Some were overwhelmed to the point of tears. The transition has been surprisingly smooth. Reports of reprisals, revenge killings and sectarian violence have been minimal. Looting and destruction have been quickly contained, insurgent fighters disciplined. On Saturday, people went about their lives as usual in the capital, Damascus. Only a single van of fighters was seen. There are a million ways it could go wrong. The country is broken and isolated after five decades of Assad family rule. Families have been torn apart by war, former prisoners are traumatized by the brutalities they suffered, tens of thousands of detainees remain missing. The economy is wrecked, poverty is widespread, inflation and unemployment are high. Corruption seeps through daily life. But in this moment of flux, many are ready to feel out the way ahead. At the airport, al-Ahmed told the staffers: 'The new path will have challenges, but that is why we have said Syria is for all and we all have to cooperate.' The rebels have so far said all the right things, Najm said. 'But we will not be silent about anything wrong again.' Idlib comes to Damascus At a torched police station, pictures of Assad were torn down and files destroyed after insurgents entered the city Dec. 8. All Assad-era police and security personnel have vanished. On Saturday, the building was staffed by 10 men serving in the police force of the rebels’ de facto 'salvation government,' which for years governed the rebel enclave of Idlib in Syria's northwest. The rebel policemen watch over the station, dealing with reports of petty thefts and street scuffles. One woman complains that her neighbors sabotaged her power supply. A policeman tells her to wait for courts to start operating again. 'It will take a year to solve problems' he mumbled. The rebels sought to bring order in Damascus by replicating the structure of its governance in Idlib. But there is a problem of scale. One of the policemen estimates the number of rebel police at only around 4,000; half are based in Idlib and the rest are tasked with maintaining security in Damascus and elsewhere. Some experts estimate the insurgents' total fighting force at around 20,000. Right now, the fighters and the public are learning about each other. The fighters drive large SUVs and newer models of vehicles that are out of reach for most residents in Damascus, where they cost 10 times as much because of custom duties and bribes. The fighters carry Turkish lira, long forbidden in government-held areas, rather than the plunging Syrian pound. Most of the bearded fighters hail from conservative, provincial areas. Many are hardline Islamists. The main insurgent force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has renounced its al-Qaida past, and its leaders are working to reassure Syria’s religious and ethnic communities that the future will be pluralist and tolerant. But many Syrians remain suspicious. Some fighters sport ribbons with Islamist slogans on their uniforms and not all of them belong to HTS, the most organized group. 'The people we see on the streets, they don’t represent us,' said Hani Zia, a Damascus resident from the southern city of Daraa, where the 2011 anti-Assad uprising began. He was concerned by reports of attacks on minorities and revenge killings. 'We should be fearful,' he said, adding that he worries some insurgents feel superior to other Syrians because of their years of fighting. 'With all due respect to those who sacrificed, we all sacrificed.' Still, fear is not prevalent in Damascus, where many insist they will no longer let themselves be oppressed. Some restaurants have resumed openly serving alcohol, others more discretely to test the mood. At a sidewalk café in the historic Old City's Christian quarter, men were drinking beer when a fighter patrol passed by. The men turned to each other, uncertain, but the fighters did nothing. When a man waving a gun harassed a liquor store elsewhere in the Old City, the rebel police arrested him, one policeman said. Salem Hajjo, a theater teacher who participated in the 2011 protests, said he doesn't agree with the rebels' Islamist views, but is impressed at their experience in running their own affairs. And he expects to have a voice in the new Syria. 'We have never been this at ease,' he said. 'The fear is gone. The rest is up to us.' The fighters make a concerted effort to reassure On the night after Assad’s fall, gunmen roamed the streets, celebrating victory with deafening gunfire. Some security agency buildings were torched. People ransacked the airport's duty free, smashing all the bottles of liquor. The rebels blamed some of this on fleeing government loyalists. The public stayed indoors, peeking out at the newcomers. Shops shut down. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham moved to impose order, ordering a nighttime curfew for three days. It banned celebratory gunfire and moved fighters to protect properties. After a day, people began to emerge. For tens of thousands, their first destination was Assad’s prisons, particularly Saydnaya on the capital’s outskirts, to search for loved ones who disappeared years ago. Few have found any traces. It was wrenching but also unifying. Rebels, some of them also searching, mingled with relatives of the missing in the dark halls of prisons that all had feared for years. During celebrations in the street, gunmen invited children to hop up on their armored vehicles. Insurgents posed for photos with women, some with their hair uncovered. Pro-revolution songs blared from cars. Suddenly shops and walls everywhere are plastered with revolutionary flags and posters of activists killed by Assad’s state. TV stations didn’t miss a beat, flipping from praising Assad to playing revolutionary songs. State media aired the flurry of declarations issued by the new insurgent-led transitional government. The new administration called on people to go back to work and urged Syrian refugees around the world to return to help rebuild. It announced plans to rehabilitate and vet the security forces to prevent the return of 'those with blood on their hands.' Fighters reassured airport staffers — many of them government loyalists — that their homes won’t be attacked, one employee said. But Syria's woes are far from being resolved. While produce prices plunged after Assad’s fall, because merchants no longer needed to pay hefty customs fees and bribes, fuel distribution was badly disrupted, jacking up transportation costs and causing widespread and lengthy blackouts. Officials say they want to reopen the airport as soon as possible and this week maintenance crews inspected a handful of planes on the tarmac. Cleaners removed trash, wrecked furniture and merchandise. One cleaner, who identified himself only as Murad, said he earns the equivalent of $15 a month and has six children to feed, including one with a disability. He dreams of getting a mobile phone. 'We need a long time to clean this up,' he said. ___ Associated Press writer Ghaith Alsayed contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-week-one-transitional-government-c06673aa3317a194619710948264cdf1	2024-12-14T20:04:09-08:00	
Activists release images of foxes at Finnish fur farms to push EU to ban the trade	GENEVA (AP) — A red fox frantically scratches the wires of its small cage. An Arctic fox meanders lazily with a bloody tail. Other furry creatures, some with teary eyes, stare blankly into a light on an activist's video camera. Finnish advocacy group Oikeutta Elaimille, or Justice for Animals, and Humane Society International have released images taken from an 'undercover investigation' at three fur farms in western Finland in late October to highlight the behind-the-scenes realities of the trade. The activists’ incursion came as the European Union, which counts Finland as a member, is awaiting advice in March from the EU agency that oversees animal welfare before deciding in March 2026 whether it should propose a ban on fur farming altogether. FIFUR, a Finnish fur-breeders group, blasted the 'covert filming' of the farms, accusing the intruders of 'breaching strict biosecurity requirements' on farms where operations are 'strictly controlled by national laws and regulations' and where veterinarians monitor animal welfare. Some viewers might ache over the conditions of the cuddly-looking creatures; others might wonder what the big deal is: The industry is — at least for now — legal and regulated. Aside from the animals’ captivity in small cages — with sometimes more than one in a single cage — none of the images shows abuse in progress. No explanation was given for the bright red blood on what looked like an open gash and exposed bone in a single Arctic fox’s tail area. 'These pictures and these intrusions ... it creates a false image of normal lab animal welfare and animal keeping in the farms,' said FIFUR spokesman Olli-Pekka Nissinen, adding that his group believed the initiative to ban fur farming will be rejected. The breeders' group said the fur sector has among the highest welfare standards of any form of animal husbandry, and Nissinen suggested that farmers have little incentive to mistreat them. 'Animal welfare first shows in the animals’ fur and it’s very important for farmers to take care of the animals so that they can have decent incomes.' FIFUR says most of its 442 member farms — as of December last year — are run by family businesses, and nearly all the farms are in the Ostrobothnia region along the Baltic Sea. Finland is the world's largest producer of certified fox pelts, the industry group said. Oikeutta Eläimille spokesman Kristo Muurimaa says the operation involved entering the farms to observe and document the conditions in which the animals are kept and that the photos were taken in compliance with Finnish law. Neither side has announced plans for any legal action. 'Fur has been used by people for a long time, since the Stone Ages basically,' Muurimaa said. 'However, a practice where animals are kept in very small barren cages is not that old. It is a product of modern times where animals are seen just as products.' 'This kind of treatment of animals doesn’t belong to this day. Times have moved on and now it’s time to leave this kind of cruelty behind,' he added. 'Nobody needs fur in modern times. Fur is mostly used as a status symbol by the rich elite in countries like China and Russia.' The 27-country EU, according to its most recent figures, estimates about 1,000 fur farms with roughly 7.7 million animals — including mink, fox and raccoon dogs — are active in the bloc. In neighboring Switzerland, which is not an EU member, a three-month public consultation ended last month on a government proposal to ban the import and sale of furs drawn from the 'mistreatment' of animals. The measure would allow authorities to seize such furs. Activists want the Swiss government to go further, seeking a broader definition of 'mistreatment' and wider range of fur farms affected. The issue, currently low on Switzerland's full referendum calendar, could be put to a public vote in late 2026 at the earliest. Humane Society International, in a statement last month, said tens of millions of animals suffer and die each year in the global fur trade and the 'vast majority of animals killed for their fur are kept in barren battery cages on fur farms.' Finland, the advocacy group said, is one of the last European countries where farming such animals for their fur remains legal — and finger-pointed a number of retail brands that use fox fur from Finland. China is the world's most important export market for furs, followed by South Korea and the Western Europe-North American market, said FIFUR, which counts hundreds of farms in Finland as members. In Europe, as of 2023, Poland and Greece were the biggest producers — almost entirely from mink — while Finland is third, according to a report by the industry association this year. Bird flu and coronavirus outbreaks hit the fur industry hard, notably in Denmark, since 2020, but the trend line in supply has been declining for many years. FIFUR's report showed supply volumes of mink pelts plunged by roughly three-quarters since 2010 — to 12,285 last year — a similar percentage decline to that for mink pelts, which totaled 2,440 in 2023.	https://apnews.com/article/finland-switzerland-fox-fur-trade-european-union-fefd7700d8e416111f6d7e6d49917943	2024-12-14T19:01:12-08:00	
South Korean leaders seek calm after Yoon is impeached	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s opposition leader offered Sunday to work with the government to ease the political tumult as officials sought to reassure allies and markets, a day after the opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol over a short-lived attempt to impose martial law. Liberal Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, whose party holds a majority in the National Assembly, urged the Constitutional Court to rule swiftly on Yoon's impeachment and proposed a special council for policy cooperation between the government and parliament. Yoon's powers have been suspended until the court decides whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. If Yoon is dismissed, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days. Lee, who has led a fierce political offensive against Yoon's embattled government, is seen as the frontrunner to replace him. He lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon by a razor-thin margin. He told a televised news conference that a swift court ruling would be the only way to 'minimize national confusion and the suffering of people.' The court will meet to discuss the case Monday, and has up to 180 days to rule. But observers say that a court ruling could come faster. In the case of parliamentary impeachments of past presidents — Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 and Park Geun-hye in 2016 — the court spent 63 days and 91 days respectively before determining to reinstate Roh and dismiss Park. Lee also proposed a national council where the government and the National Assembly would work together to stabilize state affairs, and said his party won't seek to impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, a Yoon appointee who's now serving as acting president. 'The Democratic Party will actively cooperate with all parties to stabilize state affairs and restore international trust,' Lee said. 'The National Assembly and government will work together to quickly resolve the crisis that has swept across the Republic of Korea.' It's unclear if Lee's proposed council will be realized. In a meeting with the parliament speaker, who touched upon Lee's idea, Han said he will closely cooperate and communicate with the National Assembly but didn't specifically say whether the government intends to join the council. Kweon Seong-dong, floor leader of the ruling People Power Party, separately criticized Lee's proposal, saying that it’s 'not right' for the opposition party acting like the ruling party. Kweon, a Yoon loyalist, said that his party will use existing PPP-government dialogue channels 'to continue to assume responsibility as the governing party until the end of President Yoon’s term.' The Democratic Party has already used its parliamentary majority to impeach the justice minister and the chief of the national police over the martial law decree, and had previously said it was also considering impeaching the prime minister. Upon assuming his role as acting leader, Han ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations. He also asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea’s major external policies will remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy from the political turmoil. On Sunday, Han had a phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden, discussing the political situation in South Korea and regional security challenges including North Korea’s nuclear program. Biden expressed his appreciation for the resiliency of democracy in South Korea and reaffirmed 'the ironclad commitment' of the United States, according to both governments. Yoon’s Dec. 3 imposition of martial law, the first of its kind in more than four decades, lasted only six hours, but has caused massive political tumult, halted diplomatic activities and rattled financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it. Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament in an effort to stop the vote, but they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon’s decree. No major violence occurred. Opposition parties have accused Yoon of rebellion, saying a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and would have no right to suspend parliament’s operations even in those cases. Yoon has rejected the charges and vowed to 'fight to the end.' He said the deployment of troops to parliament was aimed at issuing a warning to the Democratic Party, which he called an 'anti-state force' that abused its control of parliament by holding up the government’s budget bill for next year and repeatedly pushing to impeach top officials. Law enforcement institutions are investigating Yoon and others involved in the martial law case over possible rebellion and other allegations. They've arrested Yoon's defense minister and police chief and two other high-level figures. Yoon has immunity from most criminal prosecution as president, but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. He's been banned from leaving South Korea, but observers doubt that authorities will detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. South Korean media reported that prosecutors asked Yoon to appear at a prosecution office for questioning on Sunday but he refused to do so. The reports said prosecutors plan to ask him to appear again. Repeated calls to a prosecutors’ office in Seoul were unanswered. Lee called for authorities to speed up their probes and said that an independent investigation by a special prosecutor should be launched as soon as possible. Last week, the National Assembly passed a law calling for such an investigation.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-lee-impeachment-ca583315453be30766372702120f94e7	2024-12-14T17:35:44-08:00	
Trump appoints longtime foreign policy adviser Richard Grenell to serve as special missions envoy	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he's picked longtime foreign policy adviser Richard Grenell to serve as an envoy for special missions, tasking him with helping the incoming administration deal with some of the toughest foreign policy challenges. Grenell served as ambassador to Germany during Trump’s first administration, special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and did a stint as acting director of national intelligence. He was also a contender to serve as secretary of state, but Trump opted to nominate Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. 'Ric will work in some of the hottest spots around the World, including Venezuela and North Korea,' Trump said in a posting on his social media platform, Truth Social, announcing the appointment. Grenell during Trump's first term developed a reputation for employing a sometimes contentious approach to diplomacy that rankled allies and the foreign policy establishment in Washington. But his style was appreciated by the president-elect who sees value in blunt talk with allies. Grenell remained close to Trump after he left office in 2021, serving at times as a key adviser on foreign policy. He was in the room when Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in September. Grenell has advocated for a peace deal that would preserve Ukraine’s territory while still allowing for 'autonomous regions' where Russia could remain in control. He’s also advised against expanding NATO to include Ukraine, saying — as Trump has — that the alliance shouldn’t grow until current members meet the alliance's defense spending targets. Members of the transatlantic alliance have committed for years to spending 2% of their GDP on defense, but several countries still fall short of the target. He was an early supporter of Trump’s 2024 campaign and held multiple events for the Republican nominee focused on economics and national security. Speaking at the Republican National Convention, Grenell echoed Trump’s mantra that 'it’s time to put America first' on the global stage and argued that China and Russia saw President Joe Biden's administration as weak. Trump raised concerns among some allies during the 2024 campaign when he said he would not defend NATO members that failed to meet defense spending targets, and warned he would 'encourage' Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' to alliance countries that he considered 'delinquent.' Grenell has downplayed Trump's criticisms of NATO and said the only talk of leaving the alliance altogether 'was really from the media.' 'What we’re saying is, don’t come to the wedding without a gift,' Grenell said. Grenell was part of the Trump campaign's outreach to Arab American voters in Michigan, where the president-elect made gains with a traditionally Democratic constituency despite his history of banning immigration from several majority-Muslim countries. Grenell orchestrated pro-Trump events with Arab American voters, including a May meeting held in Troy, Michigan. A U.S. spokesman at the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration, Grenell, like many other Republicans, has his own history of criticizing Trump before embracing him. Once an adviser to GOP moderates like 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney and a supporter of gay marriage, Grenell, who is openly gay, deleted social media posts blasting Trump as 'reckless' and 'dangerous' once the former reality TV star became the Republican nominee in 2016. Trump also announced Saturday that he’s appointing Devin Nunes, the chief executive officer of the president-elect's Truth Social platform, to head a presidential advisory board that will keep tabs on the U.S. intelligence community. Nunes will continue leading Trump Media &amp; Technology Group. Trump is the company’s largest shareholder. The former California lawmaker chaired the House Intelligence Committee and was one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress during the president-elect's first term. ___ Kinnard reported from Columbia, South Carolina.	https://apnews.com/article/richard-grenell-secretary-of-state-trump-5e7410edd659870307a5eba762f8136c	2024-12-14T16:57:03-08:00	
Fighting in eastern Congo between army and rebels intensifies ahead of peace talks Sunday	GOMA, Congo (AP) — Fighting between the Congolese army and the M23 rebel group intensified in eastern Congo in recent days ahead of much anticipated peace talks on Sunday, the army said. Congo's army accused the M23 of killing 12 civilians earlier this week in villages of the Lubero territory in the eastern province of North-Kivu in a statement on Friday. An M23 spokesperson told The Associated Press it denied the accusation, discrediting it as 'propaganda' from Congo's government. M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced. Congo and the United Nations accuse Rwanda of backing M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. Last month, Congo and Rwanda’s foreign ministers agreed on the terms and conditions of the disengagement of Rwandan forces in eastern Congo. In July, Congo signed a ceasefire with M23 that came into effect in August, but fighting has resumed since. Earlier this month, the United States said it was 'gravely concerned' by ceasefire violations by M23 rebels. The intensification of fighting comes as Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame are set to meet Sunday in Angola, which has been mediating the conflict. It will be their first official meeting since last year. Aline Kasereka, a mother of six living in Lubero, a town 50 kilometers (30 miles) away from the villages where the fighting took place earlier this week, said the peace talks are urgently needed. 'We are tired of the war, every day we move, we do not know in which country we are anymore,' Kasereka told the AP. 'Our authorities have to sit on the negotiation table and find a solution because we want to return to our normal life,' she added. Henry Pacifique, analyst for the Kivu Security Barometer research project, says he remains pessimistic about the outcome of the summit. 'It seems like Angola is trying to force Congo and Rwanda to participate, while both parties continue to make the other the scapegoat to justify future violations of the agreement,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-rwanda-m23-ceasefire-angola-d97ae3918051df70d2dd85fd36f729c0	2024-12-14T10:28:54-08:00	
Isak Andic, founder of Spanish fashion brand Mango, dies in accident, aged 71	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Isak Andic, the founder of Spanish fashion brand Mango, has died after suffering an accident, the company said on Saturday. He was 71. 'It is with deep regret that we announce the unexpected death of Isak Andic, our non-executive chairman and founder of Mango, in an accident that occurred this Saturday,' Mango CEO Toni Ruiz said in a statement, without providing details. Spanish news agency EFE and other media outlets, including La Vanguardia newspaper, said Andic died following a fall while hiking near Barcelona. Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez paid tribute to Andic on social media, lauding his 'hard work and business vision that transformed a Spanish brand into a global fashion leader.' Andic’s family moved from Turkey to Spain when he was young. He opened Mango’s first store in Barcelona in 1984 and over the following decades helped Mango grow into one of Europe’s leading fast fashion makers. Mango has 2,700 stores in 120 markets around the world. It set a company record of 3.1 billion euros ($3.2 billion) in sales in 2023. It is currently expanding in the U.S. and plans to have 65 stores there by the end of 2025.	https://apnews.com/article/mango-founder-isak-andic-dies-bcf47f71f136d574527b7c4e09e30a9f	2024-12-14T10:16:14-08:00	
YouTube singer arrested in Iran after performing an online concert while not wearing a hijab	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian authorities have arrested a female singer who performed a virtual concert on YouTube, a lawyer said. Milad Panahipour, an Iranian lawyer, said Parastoo Ahmady, 27, was arrested in Sari City, capital of the northern province of Mazandaran, on Saturday. On Thursday, the judiciary had filed a case regarding Ahmady’s concert performance, in which she performed wearing a long black sleeveless and collarless dress, but no hijab. She was accompanied by four male musicians. Ahmady had posted her concert on YouTube the day before, saying: 'I am Parastoo, a girl who wants to sing for the people I love. This is a right I could not ignore; singing for the land I love passionately.' The online concert has been viewed more than 1.4 million times. Panahipour told The Associated Press: 'Unfortunately, we do not know the charges against Ms. Ahmady, who arrested her, or her place of detention, but we will follow up on the matter through legal authorities.' He also said two musicians in Ahmady's band — Soheil Faghih Nasiri and Ehsan Beiraghdar — were arrested in Tehran on Saturday. Following the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, women were banned at first from singing altogether, then from singing or dancing solo before mixed-gender audiences. Female vocalists could perform for male audiences only as a part of a chorus. But they are allowed to sing in a hall for female-only audiences. Also based on Iranian and Islamic law, women are not allowed to appear without a hijab in front of men who are not related. In Iran, the hijab — and the all-encompassing black chador worn by some — has long been a political symbol as well, particularly after becoming mandatory in the years following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. For observant Muslim women, the head covering is a sign of piety before God and modesty in front of men outside their families. There were protests across Iran in 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, after her arrest by the country’s morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab. While police became hesitant to strictly enforce the Islamic dress code — possibly to avoid even wider demonstrations and displays of defiance — in recent weeks the authorities' tone has changed.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-female-singer-youtube-arrest-f862c9ef4fc37cd574ec8c71fd4c74f9	2024-12-14T10:13:34-08:00	
Pelosi has hip replacement surgery at a US military hospital in Germany after a fall	WASHINGTON (AP) — Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had hip replacement surgery Saturday at a U.S. military hospital in Germany after falling while at an event in Luxembourg with other members of Congress. Pelosi, 84, 'is well on the mend,' said Ian Krager, a spokesman for the California Democrat, in a statement. Pelosi thanked the staff at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center and the hospital in Luxembourg, where she was also treated, for 'their excellent care and kindness.' She was in Europe with a bipartisan congressional delegation to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. Pelosi tripped and fell while at an event and fractured her hip, according to people familiar with her injury who were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. Among those on the trip was Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who posted on social media Friday that he was 'praying for a speedy recovery,' for Pelosi. The two lawmakers were captured holding hands in a group photo that day at the U.S. Embassy in Luxembourg. Pelosi was first elected in 1987. She served as speaker twice, stepped down from her leadership post two years ago but remained in Congress and was reelected to represent her San Francisco district in November. ___ Associated Press writer Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/pelosi-hip-replacement-surgery-fall-germany-b01379d1f1124dcd3cf41c789dae4a58	2024-12-14T09:00:47-08:00	
Women's right activists rally in France ahead of Gisèle Pelicot's rape trial verdict	AVIGNON, France (AP) — Hundreds of people gathered Saturday in the southern French town of Avignon ahead of the verdict in a trial in which dozens of men are accused of raping Gisèle Pelicot while she was drugged and rendered unconscious by her husband. The court is expected to deliver its verdicts by Dec. 20 in the trial of 51 defendants. Last month, prosecutors asked the panel of judges for the maximum possible penalty for aggravated rape — 20 years — against the victim’s now ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, 72. Gisèle Pelicot, 71, has become an icon for those fighting against sexual violence. She testified during the proceedings about the harrowing events, which have sparked widespread public attention. Outside the courth, demonstrators held placards with messages such as, 'Victims, we believe you, rapists we see you,' and, 'Shame changes sides.' One large banner displayed on a wall read: 'Rape has no nationality.' Elsewhere, activists posted notes with 'Gentle words for Gisèle' on a fence. Activist Marine Thebaud, who is a member of the Family Planning association, said: 'We hope that justice will be up to the acts committed against Gisèle, that impunity will end and that people will be punished. We’re here to show support for all victims of patriarchal violence.' Alain Souberan said he joined the gathering because his partner 'is a convinced feminist who sings in the Avignon feminist choir.' 'Personally, I really support this movement. I think men have their place as supporters too,' he said. The trial, which started in September, has drawn attention beyond France, with Pelicot’s courage in facing her accusers transforming her into a symbol for victims of sexual violence.	https://apnews.com/article/gisele-pelicot-france-rape-trial-protest-646e49f2349f6a82ffc7d93b16858432	2024-12-14T08:46:10-08:00	
Filipino woman on Indonesia death row recalls a stunning last minute reprieve and 'miracle' transfer	YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Filipino death row inmate Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso knelt to pray when officers came to take her to an execution site in May 2015, just a few feet away from her isolation cell on an Indonesian prison island, where a 13-member firing squad was waiting. While she prayed, the Philippines government was wrapping up a lengthy legal battle over her fate. Veloso’s life was ultimately spared — temporarily — by Indonesia’s Attorney General's Office, which issued a stay of execution shortly before Veloso was to be executed with eight other death row inmates. 'Lord, many people there believe that I am guilty, but many people out there believe that I am innocent. Lord, You are the One who knows everything, You knew that I am innocent, so I beg You, please prove that by saving me,' Veloso recalled praying in a tearful interview with The Associated Press at a female prison in Yogyakarta on Tuesday. Duped into becoming a drug courier The reprieve aimed to provide an opportunity for Veloso's testimony to expose how a criminal syndicate duped her into being an unwitting accomplice and courier in drug trafficking. Shock washed over Veloso as a group of officials from the attorney general's office informed her of the stay just as she was being led out to the execution site on Nusakambangan prison island. In tears, she remembered a cocoon she saw the previous night hanging from a tree branch near her cell. 'In the Philippines we believe that if there is a cocoon, there will be a new life,' Veloso said. 'That means I will not be executed because God will give me a new life.' Veloso, now 39, was arrested in 2010 at the airport in the Indonesian ancient city of Yogyakarta, where officials discovered about 2.6 kilograms (5.7 pounds) of heroin hidden in her luggage. The single mother of two sons was convicted and sentenced to death. Veloso has maintained her innocence throughout her 14 years of incarceration. She has spent her time in prison designing Indonesian batik clothing, painting, tailoring and learning interior design and other skills. Veloso was granted a stay of execution because her alleged boss was arrested in the Philippines, and the authorities there requested Indonesian assistance in pursuing a case against her. The woman, who allegedly recruited Veloso to work in Kuala Lumpur, Maria Kristina Sergio, surrendered to police in the Philippines just two days ahead of her scheduled execution. The dramatic turn of events began last month, when in an unusual last-ditch effort to delay Veloso’s death, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced that a deal had been reached for Indonesia to send Veloso home after a decade of pleading from Manila. 'Mary Jane Veloso is coming home,' Marcos said in a statement. 'Arrested in 2010 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to death, Mary Jane’s case has been a long and difficult journey.' A practical arrangement A 'practical arrangement' between Indonesia and the Philippines was signed on Dec. 6, to send Veloso home, which is expected before Christmas. Although there is no treaty between the countries, Indonesia and the Philippines are both members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the transfer of convicts in the ASEAN region is in accordance with the bloc’s Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, said Raul Vasquez, the undersecretary at the Department of Justice of the Philippines, after the signing ceremony. Indonesia’s Yusril Ihza Mahendra, Indonesia’s coordinating minister for law, human rights, immigration and corrections, lauded the transfer agreement as a 'historic milestone' between Indonesia and the Philippines, and part of the new administration of President Prabowo Subianto’s 'good neighbor' policy. Once repatriated, Mahendra said, if the Philippines want to pardon Veloso or grant clemency, 'that is entirely their authority in which we must also respect,' the minister added. The Philippines, Asia’s largest Roman Catholic nation, has abolished the death penalty. ‘Like a miracle’ Veloso described the decision as being 'like a miracle when I have lost all hope.' 'For almost 15 years I was separated from my children and parents, and I could not see my children grow up,' she said, her eyes filled with tears. 'I wish to be given an opportunity to take care of my children and to be close to my parents.' Born in Cabanatuan, a city in Nueva Ecija province, Veloso was the youngest of five siblings of a family who lived in extreme poverty. Her father worked as a seasonal agricultural worker on a sugar cane plantation and her mother collected discarded bottles and plastic to sell to junk shops. Veloso dropped out of school in her first year of high school and married her husband when she was just 16 years old. The couple later separated and she became a single mother to two young sons, forcing her to emigrate to Dubai in 2009 to work as maid. She returned to the Philippines before the end of her two-year contract after an attempted rape by her employer. A year later, Veloso was recruited by Sergio to be employed as a domestic servant in Malaysia but later was shifted to Indonesia. Major drug smuggling hub The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population. Indonesia's last executions were carried out in July 2016, when an Indonesian and three foreigners were shot by firing squad. There are about 530 people on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including 96 foreigners, the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections' data showed as of last month. The Indonesian government recently agreed in principle to return five Australian nationals and a French national to their home countries. 'I was not a good Catholic before, and prison has changed my life into a skilled person who has become closer to God,' Veloso said. 'I am ready to build a new life, like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon.' ___ Associated Press writer Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-philippines-veloso-interview-prisoner-transfer-0a18931e2d0ef52c1ff8953a07cd5f64	2024-12-14T08:36:48-08:00	
Charles Dickens' characters come alive in a Dutch town enamored with the English author	DEVENTER, Netherlands (AP) — The Dutch city of Deventer transformed Saturday into a pocket of 19th-century England, with 950 people in costumes bringing characters from Charles Dickens’ books to life. Oliver Twist, Ebenezer Scrooge and Miss Havisham were among the characters at hand, mingling with chimney sweepers, livestock and Christmas carol singers in Deventer’s historic center. Onlookers bowed when Queen Victoria passed through. Merchants peddle antiques and gingerbread, while people portraying pickpockets try to avoid being tossed in a mock Marshalsea Prison. The town's link to Dickens is Emmy Strik, who started the weekend-long festival to protest rules against keeping her antique shop open on Sunday. Strik and other shopowners dressed up in the 19th-century England costumes and walked out on the streets. The protest evolved into an annual festival and Strik, now 84, has collected more than 1,000 Dickensian costumes for the event. Organizers enforce the dress code strictly — no clothes or accessories from after the 1800s. Sandra Nieland, playing the queen, described her costume to The Associated Press: 'In her younger years, she was, of course, a beautiful queen. And in her older years, she was mourning her husband, Albert and, well, she was always in black and not (wearing) too much stuff. Just her rings. ... She always wore a lot of rings.' It’s the 32nd edition of the festival, which attracts some 100,000 visitors each year from around the Netherlands and abroad, according to the town organizers. That means big crowds, who line up to enter the narrow streets. Amateur street actor Stef Jongbloed reveled in the festive energy. In addition to specific characters, he said, 'you also have so many people that just dress up just for fun and just walk around here the entire day. Also doing it together is what makes it so amazing.'	https://apnews.com/article/charles-dickens-festival-netherlands-cf900102dffb73f722ae70e99b209360	2024-12-14T08:20:55-08:00	
US officials have been in direct contact with the Syrian rebel group that ousted Assad, Blinken says	AQABA, Jordan (AP) — American officials have been in direct contact with the terrorist-designated rebel group that led the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday. Blinken, speaking at a news conference in Jordan, was the first U.S. official to publicly confirm contacts between the Biden administration and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led a coalition of armed opposition groups that drove Assad from power and into asylum in Russia last weekend. Along with counterparts from eight Arab nations and Turkey and senior officials from the European Union and United Nations, Blinken signed off on a set of principles meant to guide Syria’s transition to a peaceful, nonsectarian and inclusive country. Blinken would not discuss details of the direct contacts with HTS but said it was important for the U.S. to convey messages to the group about its conduct and how it intends to govern in a transition period. 'Yes, we have been in contact with HTS and with other parties,' Blinken said in the port city of Aqaba. He added that 'our message to the Syrian people is this: We want them to succeed and we’re prepared to help them do so.' HTS, once an affiliate of al-Qaida, has been designed as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department since 2018. That designation carries severe sanctions, including a ban on the provision of any 'material support' to the group or its members. The sanctions do not, however, legally bar U.S. officials from communicating with designated groups. In an interview Saturday on Syrian television, the group’s leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, did not address any direct contact with the United States, but said the new authorities in Damascus are in touch with Western embassies. He also said that 'we don’t intend to enter any conflict because there is general exhaustion in Syria.' HTS has worked to establish security and start a political transition after seizing Damascus and has tried to reassure a public both stunned by Assad’s fall and concerned about extremist jihadis among the rebels. Insurgent leaders say the group has broken with its extremist past. Blinken also stressed that 'the success that we’ve had in ending the territorial caliphate' of the Islamic State group remains 'a critical mission.' And citing the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish fighters who in recent years drove IS out of large areas of Syria, he called it 'very important at this moment that they continue that role because this is a moment of instability' in which IS 'will seek to regroup and take advantage of.' A joint statement after the meeting of foreign ministers urged all parties to cease hostilities in Syria and expressed support for a locally led transitional political process. It called for preventing the reemergence of extremist groups and ensuring the security and safe destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles. 'We don’t want Syria to fall into chaos,' Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, told journalists. A separate statement by Arab foreign ministers called for U.N.-supervised elections based on a new constitution approved by Syrians. Their statement condemned Israel’s incursion into the buffer zone with Syria and adjacent sites over the past week as a 'heinous occupation' and demanded the withdrawal of Israeli forces. U.S. officials say al-Sharaa has been making welcomed comments about protecting minority and women’s rights but they remain skeptical that he will follow through on them in the long run. On Friday, the rebels and Syria’s unarmed opposition worked to safely turn over to U.S. officials an American man who had been imprisoned by Assad. U.S. officials are continuing their search for Austin Tice, an American journalist who disappeared 12 years ago near Damascus. 'We have impressed upon everyone we’ve been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home,' Blinken said. In other developments: —Turkey reopened its embassy in Damascus, becoming the first country to do so since the end of Assad’s rule. The embassy suspended operations 12 years ago due to insecurity during Syria's civil war. —Al-Sharaa said in the TV interview that 'the pretexts that Israel uses have ended' for its airstrikes that have destroyed much of the Syrian army's assets in recent days. He said 'the Israelis have crossed the rules of engagement' but that the insurgent group is not about to enter a conflict with Israel. —The leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants said the group has lost its military supply line through Syria but that the new authority there might reinstate the route. —A Syrian war monitor and a citizen journalist said gunmen attacked members of a Syrian insurgent group, Failaq al-Sham, in the country’s coastal region, killing or wounding 15 of them on Saturday. That region is home to many members of Assad’s minority Alawite sect. ___ Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/blinken-syria-assad-hts-transition-mideast-5fcff887a74dc9ec36e483c0b601a8c2	2024-12-14T06:44:36-08:00	
Ukrainian drones strike Russia as Kyiv reels from consecutive massive air attacks	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drone strikes on southern Russia killed a 9-year-old boy and set fire to a major oil terminal, officials said Saturday, the day after Moscow launched a massive aerial attack on its neighbor that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was one of the heaviest bombardments of the country’s energy sector in the nearly three-year war. The boy died when a drone struck his family’s home outside Belgorod, a Russian city near the border with Ukraine, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported on Saturday morning on the Telegram messaging app. His mother and 7-month-old sister were hospitalized with injuries, Gladkov said. He posted photos of what he said was the aftermath of the attack, showing a low-rise house with gaping holes in its roof and front wall flanked by mounds of rubble. Elsewhere in southern Russia, Ukrainian drones overnight hit a major oil terminal in the Oryol region, sparking a blaze, Ukraine’s General Staff reported. Photos published by the General Staff and on Russian Telegram news channels showed huge plumes of smoke engulfing the facility, backlit by an orange glow. Oryol Gov. Andrey Klychkov confirmed that a Ukrainian drone strike set fire to a fuel depot. He said later the blaze had been contained and that there were no casualties. Russia’s Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces shot down 37 Ukrainian drones over the country’s south and west the previous night. Russia pummels Ukrainian energy targets The Ukrainian strikes came a day after Russia fired 93 cruise and ballistic missiles and almost 200 drones at its neighbor, further battering Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, around half of which has been destroyed during the war. Rolling electricity blackouts are common and widespread, and Zelenskyy charged Friday that Moscow is 'terrorizing millions of people' with such assaults. According to Ukraine’s air force, Russia kept up its drone attacks on Saturday, launching 132 across Ukrainian territory. Fifty-eight drones were shot down and a further 72 veered off course, likely due to electronic jamming, it said. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces used long-range precision missiles and drones on 'critically important fuel and energy facilities in Ukraine that ensure the functioning of the military industrial complex.' The strike was in retaliation for Wednesday’s Ukrainian attack using U.S.-supplied the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, on a Russian air base, it said. Kyiv’s Western allies have provided Ukraine with air defense systems to help it protect critical infrastructure, but Russia has sought to overwhelm the air defenses with combined strikes involving large numbers of missiles and drones called 'swarms.' Russia has held the initiative this year as its military has steadily rammed through Ukrainian defenses in the east in a series of slow but steady offensives. But uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue. North Koreans reportedly in combat in Kursk Zelenskyy said Saturday that a 'significant number' of North Korean troops were being deployed by Moscow in assaults in Russia’s southern Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have held on following a stunning cross-border incursion this summer. In a televised address, Zelenskyy said that North Korean soldiers have so far not entered the fight on Ukrainian soil, but claimed they are already taking 'noticeable' losses. Elsewhere, Ukrainian officials reported that Russian shelling on Friday and overnight killed at least two civilians and wounded 14 others in front-line areas Ukraine’s south and northeast. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-strike-attack-b4968f78072239d0d114423337cefd88	2024-12-14T05:09:05-08:00	
Middle East latest: Top diplomats from US, Arab League and Turkey discuss Syria's transition	Top diplomats from the United States, the Arab League and Turkey met in Jordan on Saturday to discuss how to assist Syria ’s transition after the fall of Bashar Assad's government a week ago. No Syrian representatives attended. The collapse of the Assad family’s more than half-century of rule has sparked new fears of instability in a region already shaken by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and hostilities between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah despite a tenuous ceasefire. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said American officials have been in direct contact with the Syrian insurgent group that led the overthrow of Assad’s government, but the group continues to be designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and others. The insurgent leader in an interview with Syrian TV didn't mention contact with the U.S., but he warned Israel about the hundreds of airstrikes it has carried out in Syria in the past week. The U.S. is also making a renewed push for a ceasefire in Gaza, where the war has plunged more than 2 million Palestinians into a severe humanitarian crisis. Here's the latest: Gunmen loyal to Assad attack members of a Syrian insurgent group BEIRUT — A Syrian war monitor and a citizen journalist say gunmen attacked members of a Syrian insurgent group in the country’s coastal region, killing or wounding 15 of them Saturday. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said loyalists to former President Bashar Assad killed and wounded members of the Failaq al-Sham group, which took part in the attacks that led to the overthrow of Assad a week ago. The coastal region is home to many members of Assad’s minority Alawite sect. Citizen journalist Taher al-Omar said Failaq al-Sham members were ambushed near the town of Jableh by 'sectarian gunmen.' He said several were killed, without giving details. More Israeli airstrikes in Gaza kill at least 11 DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Witnesses and medical officials are reporting more Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Four people were killed late Saturday in an airstrike on a tent in the central city of Deir al-Balah, according to an Associated Press journalist who counted the bodies at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Elsewhere, Palestinian medical officials said an airstrike killed at least seven people, including a woman and her baby, in Gaza City. The strike hit the Majda Wasilla school, which shelters many displaced families, according to Al-Ahli Hospital, which received the bodies. Ataf Saadat, a woman sheltering in the school, said the baby killed was two days old. 'There were those who were burned, and those who were cut up, and the rubble was on top of them,' Saadat said. Israel’s military said it struck Hamas fighters at a command center in a compound previously used as a school. Syria meeting's statement calls for peace, supports political transition A joint statement after a ministerial meeting on Syria's future is calling for all parties to cease hostilities there and expresses support for a locally led transitional political process. The statement was issued Saturday after a meeting in Jordan by several Arab nations, the United States, Turkey, the European Union and others. It called for preventing the reemergence of extremist groups in Syria and ensuring the security and safe destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles. It also expressed full support for Syria’s territorial integrity. A separate statement issued by Arab foreign ministers called for U.N.-supervised elections based on a new constitution approved by Syrians. That statement also condemned Israel’s incursion into the buffer zone with Syria and adjacent sites over the past week as a 'heinous occupation' and demands the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Hezbollah leader says main supply line via Syria has been cut BEIRUT — The leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants says the fall of Bashar Assad in Syria has cut a main supply line for the group but it can find other ways to bring in weapons. Hezbollah was a main backer of Assad and sent thousands of fighters to Syria over the past decade. And for decades, Hezbollah relied on Syria as a channel for weapons from the militant group's main backer, Iran. In his first public comments in the week since Assad’s fall, Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem in a televised speech Saturday said Hezbollah has lost the military supply line through Syria but the new authority there might reinstate the route. Otherwise, he said, 'we might find other ways.' Kassem also said Hezbollah hopes the new authority in Syria will consider Israel an enemy. Head of Syrian insurgents warns Israel about airstrikes but doesn't seek conflict DAMASCUS, Syria — The head of the Syrian insurgent group that led the overthrow of Bashar Assad's government says they are not about to enter a conflict with Israel. But Ahmad al-Sharaa in his first public comments on Israel in the week since Assad's fall said 'the pretexts that Israel uses have ended' for its airstrikes inside Syria in recent days. Al-Sharaa said 'the Israelis have crossed the rules of engagement' in his interview with Syrian TV on Saturday. About 400 Israeli airstrikes in the past days have destroyed much of the Syrian army's assets. Al-Sharaa leads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. The excerpts released from his interview did not address contact with the United States, which on Saturday said had been in direct communication with HTS, which it designated a foreign terrorist organization years ago. The HTS leader did say the new authorities in Damascus are in contact with Western embassies, and that authorities have a plan to start reconstruction and development in Syria. He did not give details. He added that the authorities have given Russia — a key backer of Assad — an opportunity to reconsider relations with the Syrian people, and that authorities are not hostile to the people of Iran, another Assad backer. Blinken says U.S. has had direct contact with Syrian rebel group AQABA, Jordan — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says American officials have been in direct contact with the Syrian rebel group that led the overthrow of President Bashar Assad’s government a week ago, but the group continues to be designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and others. Blinken is the first U.S. official to publicly confirm contacts between the Biden administration and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which ousted Assad. Speaking at a news conference in Jordan, Blinken would not discuss details of the contacts but said it was important for the U.S. to convey messages to the group about its conduct and how it intends to govern in a transition period. Medical officials say Israeli airstrike kills 10 in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say at least 10 people were killed Saturday in an Israeli airstrike that apparently targeted a municipal meeting in central Gaza. The officials said the strike hit the municipality complex for Deir al-Balah city as officials from central and southern Gaza met to coordinate how to receive vehicles provided by the United Arab Emirates. The complex includes a building used by the Hamas-run interior ministry and is surrounded by a public market, which was crowded when the strike occurred. Among the dead were a mother and her 5-year-old daughter, according to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital and an AP journalist at the morgue. The dead also include Diab al-Garu, head of the Deir al-Balah municipality, the hospital said. The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas fighter in a compound it said was used to plan attacks. Turkey reopens its embassy in Syria ISTANBUL — Turkey reopened its embassy in Syria on Saturday, becoming the first country to do so since the end of Bashar Assad’s rule last weekend. The Syrian insurgents who overthrew Assad had received vital help from Turkey. The Turkish flag was raised above the compound in Damascus for the first time since diplomatic ties were cut in 2012. The embassy suspended operations 12 years ago due to insecurity during the Syrian civil war. Several countries maintained diplomatic ties with Assad's government during the 13-year conflict, while others reopened their diplomatic missions in recent years as they sought to normalize relations. US Secretary of State Blinken wrapping up regional tour in Jordan AQABA, Jordan — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says broad consensus exists among regional partners that Syria’s new government must be inclusive, must respect women and minority rights, reject terrorism and secure and destroy suspected Assad-era chemical weapons stockpiles. Blinken is wrapping up a three-country regional tour in Aqaba after visiting Iraq, Turkey and Jordan once already this week. Earlier Saturday in a meeting with U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pederson, Blinken said he expected to talk about the challenges ahead for Syria and 'our determination to work together to support a Syrian-led transition where the United Nations plays a critical role, particularly when it comes to the provision of assistance, to the protection of minorities.' Pederson agreed, saying: 'What is so critical in Syria is that we see a credible and inclusive political process that brings together all communities in Syria. And the second point is that we need to make sure that state institutions do not collapse, and that we get in humanitarian assistance as quickly as possible. And if we can achieve that, perhaps there is a new opportunity for the Syrian people.' In announcing Saturday’s meetings, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said the ministers would 'discuss ways to support a comprehensive political process led by Syrians to achieve a transitional process,' which 'ensures the reconstruction of Syrian state institutions, and preserves Syria’s unity, territorial integrity, sovereignty, security, stability, and the rights of all its citizens.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-14-december-2024-9679866cce4bde8077accd753b0130cd	2024-12-14T03:29:07-08:00	
AP Photos: K-pop light sticks take over protests that fueled impeachment of South Korea's president	Seoul (AP) — K-pop light sticks, Christmas lights and even Santa Claus outfits have taken over daily protests demanding the ouster of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol following his shocking martial law declaration this month. On Saturday, the country’s parliament voted to impeach Yoon to suspend his powers. The Constitutional Court will determine whether to remove him from office or restore his presidential powers. Yoon's short-lived Dec. 3 order has sparked massive protests, drawing attention to their unique protest culture. Young demonstrators have taken over the streets with their K-pop light sticks, traditionally reserved for music concerts, to voice their dissent and in turn start a new trend in political protesting. The sea of light could be seen outside Seoul’s National Assembly, transforming the usually banker-filled financial district of Yeouido into a sea of lights. Many, seemingly in their 20s and 30s, adorned their clothing with Christmas decorations, Santa Outfit, colorful light sticks, and LED candles. Labor unions and political parties, with politicians and representatives at the front of the rally giving speeches and leading the group, have led the demonstrations. But unlike previous protests, the forefront was left to the young with their light sticks and K-pop songs.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-protesters-photo-gallery-yoon-b17f96063a2635ebc87f35ed9ab5ac5b	2024-12-14T00:58:54-08:00	
PEN America condemns the arrest of Iranian activist Reza Khandan	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — PEN America condemned the arrest of Reza Khandan, Iranian activist and husband of leading human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, and demanded his immediate release. Karin Deutsch Karlekar, Director of Writers at Risk at the literary and human rights organization said in a statement Friday: 'We are appalled at the arrest of Reza Khandan and urge Iranian authorities to release him immediately. The pro-reform Shagh Daily cited Mahmoud Behzadi Rad, an Iranian lawyer, as saying Khandan was sentenced in 2019 over spreading 'propaganda against the system' and 'collusion against national security' and that authorities arrested him Friday to carry out the sentencing. PEN American said Khandan was sentenced to six years in prison 'for making and distributing buttons protesting Iran’s compulsory hijab laws in January 2019.' Khandan, also a lawyer, was summoned to prison in Feb. 2023, but the order was not enforced at the time, the organization. His wife, Sotoudeh, is renowned for defending activists, opposition politicians and women prosecuted for removing their headscarves. In March 2019, she was sentenced to a total of 38 years and 148 lashes on a range of charges. Since 2023, she has been out on bail. According to PEN America’s 2023 Freedom To Write Index, at least 49 Iranian writers were arrested for their work last year, making Iran the second-highest jailer of writers in the world after China. Iran is also the world’s top jailer of female writers.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-activist-sotoudeh-khandan-pen-america-883f854be8c760e8784e7781f4ab1014	2024-12-13T23:50:59-08:00	
Popular actor in southern India is freed on bail after spending a night in jail in a stampede case	NEW DELHI (AP) — A popular actor in southern India was released from jail on bail on Saturday, a day after he was arrested by police in connection with a stampede that led to the death of a woman at the premiere of his movie earlier this month. A 35-year-old woman died and her 8-year-old son was critically injured in the stampede, which occurred during the screening of Allu Arjun’s release for 'Pushpa 2: The Rule' in southern Telangana state's Hyderabad city on Dec. 4. Arjun was arrested after the woman’s husband filed a case against him, his security team and the theater's management for not informing police of the actor’s plan to attend the screening, which resulted in a larger-than-expected crowd. Police charged the actor, his security team and the theater’s management staff with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Police have already arrested the theater’s owner and two of his employees in connection with the case. A local court on Friday ordered the actor to spend 14 days in jail, but within hours the Telangana High Court granted him bail. However, the actor had to spend the night in jail because prison authorities did not receive a copy of the bail until late Friday, the Press Trust of India reported. The accident happened after the 41-year-old actor made a surprise appearance at a local theater where the movie was being screened. As his fans surged toward the venue, the theater’s main gate collapsed, resulting in the stampede. The actor did not comment on the police charges or his arrest. But shortly after the accident, Arjun wrote on the social platform X that he was 'heartbroken by the tragic incident.' He later announced financial assistance of $29,000 for the woman’s family and promised to take care of the medical expenses for her injured son. Deadly stampedes are relatively common in India, where large crowds gather in small areas with shoddy infrastructure and few crowd safety measures.	https://apnews.com/article/india-actor-jail-bail-stampede-accident-47aca28ba5b9d123e42547d78553c8da	2024-12-13T21:45:17-08:00	
UN talks fail to reach agreement on dealing with rising risk of global drought	BENGALURU, India (AP) — Despite two weeks of U.N.-sponsored talks in Saudi Arabia’s Riyadh, the participating 197 nations failed to agree early Saturday on a plan to deal with global droughts, made longer and more severe by a warming climate. The biennial talks, known as COP 16 and organized by a UN body that deals with combating desertification and droughts, attempted to create strong global mandates to legally bind and require nations to fund early warning systems and build resilient infrastructure in poorer countries, particularly Africa, which is worst affected by the changes. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification released a report earlier this week warning that if global warming trends continue, nearly five billion people — including in most of Europe, parts of the western U.S., Brazil, eastern Asia and central Africa — will be affected by the drying of Earth’s lands by the end of the century, up from a quarter of the world’s population today. The report also said farming was particularly at risk, which can lead to food insecurity for communities worldwide. This is the fourth time UN talks aimed at getting countries to agree to make more headway on tackling biodiversity loss, climate change and plastic pollution have either failed to reach a consensus or delivered disappointing results this year, worrying many nations, particularly the most vulnerable. Nations participating in the Riyadh discussions decided to push the can down the road to the 2026 talks, hosted by Mongolia. 'Parties need more time to agree on what’s the best way forward to address the critical issue of drought,' said Ibrahim Thiaw, the UNCCD chief, speaking at the end of the Riyadh talks. Thiaw said the conference was 'like no other' in the talks' 30-year history. 'We have elevated the land and drought agenda beyond sector-specific discussions, establishing it as a cornerstone of global efforts to address inter-connected challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, migration and global security.' Longer-lasting solutions to drought — such as the curbing of climate change — were not a talking point. Host Saudi Arabia has been criticized in the past for stalling progress on curbing emissions from fossil fuels at other negotiations. The Gulf nation is one of the world’s largest oil producers and exporters with the second-largest global oil reserves. Earlier in the conference, hosts Saudi Arabia, a few other countries and international banks pledged $2.15 billion for drought resilience. And the Arab Coordination Group, made up of 10 development banks based in the Middle East, committed $10 billion by 2030 to address degrading land, desertification and drought. The funds are expected to support 80 of the most vulnerable countries prepare for worsening drought conditions. But the U.N. estimates that between 2007 and 2017, droughts will cost $125 billion worldwide. Erika Gomez, lead negotiator from Panama said while a decision on dealing with drought was not reached, significant progress was made in other key issues. 'We have achieved several key milestones, particularly in the growing traction of civil society engagement and the gender decision,' Gomez said. 'Until the very end, parties could not agree on whether or not the new instrument to respond to drought should be legally binding or not,' said Jes Weigelt of European climate think-tank TMG Research who has been tracking the talks. 'I fear, the UNCCD COP 16 has suffered the same fate as the biodiversity and climate COPs this year. It failed to deliver,' he said. ___ Follow Sibi Arasu on X at @sibi123 ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Thai police detain 2 suspects after a bomb in a border province killed 3 and injured scores	BANGKOK (AP) — Thai police on Saturday said two suspects were in custody as authorities investigated a bombing in the north that killed at least three people and injured dozens of others. An explosive device was thrown into a crowd during an outdoor performance at an annual festival in Umphang town in Tak province, which borders Myanmar, on Friday just before midnight, according to the Association of the Umphang Rescue Groups. Local police said at least 48 people were injured and that police have not yet pressed charges against the suspects as the investigation is ongoing. Thanathip Sawangsang, a spokesperson for the Defense Ministry, told The Associated Press that local police said there was a fight between rival groups of men before the explosion and that there was no wider security threat. He said the forensic evidence showed that the explosive device was a homemade bomb. Tak province has a heavy military presence in its border areas, including in Umphang. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed her condolences to the victims and their families, and ordered security personnel and relevant agencies in the area to investigate and help those who have been affected, said government spokesperson Jirayu Houngsap.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-bomb-tak-suspects-detained-02cdc92a955d9dfe3c425593182738cf	2024-12-13T20:23:54-08:00	
Ex-soccer player Kavelashvili becomes Georgia's president in a blow to country's EU aspirations	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili became president of Georgia on Saturday, as the ruling party tightened its grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia. Kavelashvili, 53, who was the only candidate on the ballot, easily won the vote given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures. Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. The party has vowed to continue pushing toward EU accession but also wants to 'reset' ties with Russia. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have boycotted the post-election parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot. In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. Pro-Western Salome Zourabichvili has been president since 2018 and has vowed to stay on after her six-year term ends Monday, describing herself as the only legitimate leader until a new election is held. Georgian Dream's decision last month to suspend talks on their country's bid to join the European Union added to the opposition's outrage and galvanized protests. Who is the outgoing president? Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia's top diplomat in 2004. Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream's support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her. 'I remain your president — there is no legitimate parliament and thus no legitimate election or inauguration,' she has declared on the social network X. 'My mandate continues.' Zourabichvili rejects government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence. 'We are not demanding a revolution,' she told The Associated Press. 'We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again. 'Georgia has been always resisting Russian influence and will not accept having its vote stolen and its destiny stolen.' Zourabichvili said Saturday’s vote was a 'provocation' and 'a parody' while a leader of one of Georgia’s main opposition parties said it was unconstitutional. Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement Coalition said Zourabichvili is 'the only legitimate source of power.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said Kavelashvili’s win 'will make a significant contribution to strengthening Georgia’s statehood and our sovereignty, as well as reducing radicalism and so-called polarization.' 'The main mission of the presidential institution is to care for the unity of the nation and society,' said Kobakhidze, a former university professor and later chairman of Georgian Dream. Who's the ruling party presidential candidate? Georgian Dream nominated Kavelashvili — mocked for lacking higher education by Georgia's opposition. Some protesters outside Tbilisi's Parliament building on Saturday morning brought their own university diplomas while others kicked soccer balls. Kavelashvili was a striker in the English Premier League for Manchester City and played for several soccer clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric. Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the 'foreign influence' law. How did opposition protests unfold? Thousands of demonstrators converged on the Parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28. Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard. Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries. Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies. The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials. French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, in a video statement in support of the protests, said Georgia’s 'European dream must not be extinguished.' 'Europe does not seek to sow chaos, Europe does not seek to destabilize or subjugate its neighbors,' he said. 'The voice of Georgians must be listened to and respected.' ″(Kavelashvili) is not elected by us. He is controlled by a puppet government, by Bidzina Ivanishvili, by Putin,' protester Sandro Samkharadze said outside Tbilisi’s Parliament building. Another protester waved a sign saying 'We are children of Europe.' Demonstrators vowed the rallies would continue. 'If (the government) wants to go to Russia, they can go to Russia, because we are not going anywhere. We are staying here,' said protester Kato Kalatozishvili. —- Associated Press writer Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-president-zourabichvili-russia-kavelashvili-protests-3a7f5018879c77b6c596d312a163b79c	2024-12-13T20:23:30-08:00	
A diminished Hezbollah is made even weaker by the toppling of Assad in Syria	BEIRUT (AP) — A severely hobbled Hezbollah was in no position to help defend former Syrian President Bashar Assad, a longtime ally, from the lightning-fast insurgency that toppled him. With Assad gone, the militant group based in Lebanon is even weaker. Hezbollah was dealt a major blow during 14 months of war with Israel. The toppling of Assad, who had strong ties to Iran, has now crippled its ability to bounce back by cutting off a vital weapons-smuggling route through Syria. Hezbollah officials are deeply concerned but defiant. 'What is happening in Syria is a major, dangerous and new change, and to know why this happened needs evaluation,' Hassan Fadlallah, a Lebanese lawmaker who represents Hezbollah's political wing, said during a speech at a funeral for militants killed by Israel. 'Whatever is happening in Syria, despite its dangers, will not weaken us.' Analysts say the diminishment of Hezbollah will have big consequences for Lebanon, where for decades it has been a major political player — and for Iran, which has relied on the group as one of several proxy forces projecting power across the Middle East. It is also a game-changer for Israel, whose nemesis on its northern border is now at its most vulnerable point in decades. Ties to Syria influenced the rise and fall of Hezbollah's power The Assad dynasty, which ruled Syria for half a century with an iron fist, played a crucial role in empowering Hezbollah, which was founded in the early 1980s by Iranian advisers who came through Syria. In addition to being a conduit for Iranian weapons, Syria also was a place where Hezbollah trained fighters and manufactured its own weapons. As Hezbollah grew more powerful, it became a force Assad could rely on for protection in times of crisis. Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters to bolster Assad's forces when a civil war broke out in 2011. As insurgents swept across Syria in early December and took the city of Homs — a stone’s throw from a Syrian border town where Hezbollah had a presence — many expected the militants to put up a fierce fight. After all, they did just that in 2013, preventing Assad's opponents from advancing into Damascus. This time, Hezbollah was in disarray. Many of its top officials, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, were killed in Israeli airstrikes. And months of Israeli bombardment destroyed much of its military infrastructure. With Syria's key international allies, Russia and Iran, on the sidelines, Hezbollah withdrew, and Assad was ousted quickly. 'The fall of the regime marks the end of Iran’s arms in Syria and Lebanon,' said Lt. Col. Fares al-Bayoush, a Syrian army defector who fought in the civil war against Assad's forces and Hezbollah until 2017, when he moved to Turkey. Lebanon begins to grapple with Hezbollah's ‘new reality’ In Lebanon, the sapping of Hezbollah's strength has given the army the opportunity to reassert control it had ceded, especially along its southern border. A U.S.-brokered ceasefire between the militant group and Israel states that Hezbollah should have no armed presence along that border and it has led to growing calls within Lebanon for the group's disarmament. 'To Hezbollah, it’s game over,' Samir Geagea, who leads the Christian Lebanese Forces Party, said in a statement on Sunday, hours after insurgents took Damascus. 'Sit with the Lebanese military to end your status as an armed group, and transform yourselves into a political party.' But Hezbollah’s longtime sway in the political arena in Lebanon also faces a major challenge. Many in Lebanon are angry with the group. Critics say Hezbollah violated its promise to use its weapons only to defend Lebanon when it began firing rockets into Israel last year, the day after Hamas — another Iranian-backed group — attacked Israel. Nearly than 4,000 people were killed in Lebanon during the war with Israel, according to the country's health ministry. Entire towns and villages where Hezbollah militants and their supporters lived have been flattened. More than 1 million people have been displaced, and the country's economy — which was in bad shape before the war — is in a deep hole. 'With the (Syrian) regime gone, Hezbollah in Lebanon faces an entirely new reality,' said Firas Maksad, of the Middle East Institute. Maksad said many Lebanese leaders have yet to grasp the magnitude of the change that has taken place. Even some onetime allies of Hezbollah in parliament have begun distancing themselves from the group. Gebran Bassil, a lawmaker who represents the Free Patriotic Movement, Lebanon’s other major Christian party, said Hezbollah's loss of a weapons pipeline from Iran could help Lebanon extract itself from regional conflict. 'Hezbollah should focus on internal affairs and not the wider region,' Bassil, a former ally of Hezbollah, said. It may have no choice but to narrow its ambitions. With the fall of Assad, Iran has lost control of a corridor of land that stretched through Iraq and Syria all the way to the Mediterranean, and which gave it an unimpeded route to supply Hezbollah. 'They can maybe fly in some things and smuggle some things, but that’s not gonna be on the same scale, not even close,' said Aron Lund, a Syria expert with Century International, a New York-based think tank. For Israel, breaking Iran’s regional network has been a major goal, though it is wary over Islamic militants among the insurgents who toppled Assad. Israel on Sunday moved troops into a demilitarized buffer zone with Syria by the Israel-held Golan Heights in what it called a temporary security measure. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Assad’s fall a 'historic day,' saying it was 'the direct result of our forceful action against Hezbollah and Iran, Assad’s main supporters.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-iran-hezbollah-assad-hts-israel-fadc4fa97f2036a24f821f51e4eb6634	2024-12-13T20:05:49-08:00	
The Detroit area's many Syrians are celebrating Assad's overthrow and planning long-delayed visits	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Nizam Abazid is gleefully planning his first trip in decades to Syria, where he grew up. Rama Alhoussaini was only 6 years old when her family moved to the U.S., but she's excited about the prospect of introducing her three kids to relatives they've never met in person. They are among thousands of Detroit-area Syrian Americans who are celebrating the unexpected overthrow of the Syrian government, which crushed dissent and imprisoned political enemies with impunity during the more than 50-year reign of ousted President Bashar Assad and his father before him. 'As of Saturday night, the Assad regime is no longer in power,' Alhoussaini, 31, said through tears Tuesday at one of the Detroit-area school and day care facilities her family operates. 'And it’s such a surreal moment to even say that out loud, because I never thought that I would see this day.' It may be some time before either visits Syria. Though happy to see Assad go, many Western countries are waiting for the dust to settle before committing to a Syria strategy, including whether it’s safe for the millions who fled the country’s civil war to return. Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the insurgency that toppled Assad after an astonishing advance that took less than two weeks, has disavowed his group's former ties to al-Qaida and cast himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. But the U.S. still labels him a terrorist and warns against any travel to Syria, where the U.S. hasn't had an embassy since 2012, the year after the war started. But for Syrians in the U.S. who have been unable to visit, the overthrow of the Assad government has given them hope that they can safely return, either for good or to visit. 'The end of the regime is the hope for all the Syrian people,' Abazid said this week, days after Assad and his family fled to Russia. Abazid said he could go to Syria whenever, since he holds dual U.S. and Syrian citizenship, but that he'll wait a few months for things there to settle down. Although European leaders have said it's not safe enough yet to allow war-displaced refugees to return to Syria, Abazid said he and his brother aren't concerned. 'When Assad’s forces were in power, my fate would’ve been in jail or beheaded,' Abazid said. 'But now, I will not be worried about that anymore.' Many Syrians who immigrated to the U.S. settled in the Detroit area. Michigan has the largest concentration of Arab Americans of any state and is home to the country's largest Arab-majority city, Dearborn. It also has more than 310,000 residents who are of Middle Eastern or North African descent. As rebel forces seized control of Syria, capping a lightning-quick advance that few thought possible even a month ago, Syrians in and around Detroit — like their counterparts all over the world — followed along in disbelief as reports poured in about one city after another slipping from Assad's grip. When news broke that Assad's government had fallen, celebrations erupted. Abazid, who owns a cellphone business in Dearborn, was born in Daraa, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) south of the Syrian capital, Damascus. He moved to the U.S. in 1984 at age 18, and although he's gone back a few times, he hasn't visited since 1998 because of what he described as 'harassment' by Syrian intelligence. That trip had to be heavily coordinated with U.S. authorities, as he said Syrian authorities took him into custody and detained him for more than six months during a 1990 visit. 'When I was kidnapped from the airport, my family didn’t even know ... what it was about,' he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'I still don’t know the reason. I have no idea why I was kidnapped.' Abazid, 59, said his parents have died since that 1998 trip, but his five sisters still live in Syria. Each of his four brothers left Syria during the 1970s and 1980s, including one who hasn't been back since emigrating 53 years ago, shortly after Bashar Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad, rose to power. Alhoussaini, who lives in West Bloomfield Township, said she was born in Damascus and moved to the Detroit area as a young girl, 'mainly because there was nothing left for us in Syria.' She said under the Assad family's rule, her grandfather's land was taken. Authorities detained him for almost a month. Her father was also detained before the family left. 'There never needed to be a reason,' Alhoussaini said. 'My dad was able to return one time, in 2010. And he has not been able to go back to his home country since, mainly because we spoke up against the Assad regime when the revolution started in 2011. And we attended many protests here. We were vocal on social media about it, did many interviews.' But with Bashar Assad gone and Syria in the hands of the rebels, 'We don’t have to be afraid anymore to visit our country,' she said. Her father, 61, is considering making a trip to Syria to see his siblings and visit his parents' graves. Alhoussaini said she and her husband, who is from the northern city of Aleppo, want to take their kids over to visit with family and friends. Alhoussaini’s three sisters, ages 40, 34 and 29, were also born in Syria. But none of them have been back. Now, there is hope and amazement that people in Syria can celebrate in the streets, she said. Alhoussaini said she thinks people who were born and raised in the U.S. won't be able to fully relate, because Americans enjoy a freedom of expression that people in Syria have never had. 'You can say what you want. You can go out into the street and protest whoever you want,' she said. 'You will not be detained for it. You will not be killed for it.'	https://apnews.com/article/detroit-syria-dearborn-assad-6c3777579a708024e703fca3458623e9	2024-12-13T20:05:04-08:00	
Once taboo, more Japanese women are brewing sake	OKAYA, Japan (AP) — Not long after dawn, Japanese sake brewer Mie Takahashi checks the temperature of the mixture fermenting at her family’s 150-year-old sake brewery, Koten, nestled in the foothills of the Japanese Alps. She stands on an uneven narrow wooden platform over a massive tank containing more than 3,000 liters (800 gallons) of a bubbling soup of steamed rice, water and a rice mold known as koji, and gives it a good mix with a long paddle. 'The morning hours are crucial in sake making,' said Takahashi, 43. Her brewery is in Nagano prefecture, a region known for its sake making. Takahashi is one of a small group of female toji, or master sake brewers. Only 33 female toji are registered in Japan’s Toji Guild Association out of more than a thousand breweries nationwide. That’s more than several decades ago. Women were largely excluded from sake production until after World War II. Sake making has a history of more than a thousand years, with strong roots in Japan's traditional Shinto religion. But when the liquor began to be mass produced during the Edo period, from 1603 until 1868, an unspoken rule barred women from breweries. The reasons behind the ban remain obscure. One theory is that women were considered impure because of menstruation and were therefore excluded from sacred spaces, said Yasuyuki Kishi, vice director of the Sakeology Center at Niigata University. 'Another theory is that as sake became mass produced, a lot of heavy labor and dangerous tasks were involved,' he said. 'So the job was seen as inappropriate for women.' But the gradual breakdown of gender barriers, coupled with a shrinking workforce caused by Japan's fast-aging population, has created space for more women to work in sake production. 'It’s still mostly a male-dominated industry. But I think now people focus on whether someone has the passion to do it, regardless of gender,' Takahashi said. She believes mechanization in the brewery is also helping to narrow the gender gap. At Koten, a crane lifts hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of steamed rice in batches and places it onto a cooling conveyor, after which the rice is sucked through a hose and transported to a separate room dedicated to cultivating koji. 'In the past, all of this would have been done by hand,' Takahashi said. 'With the help of machines, more tasks are accessible for women.' Sake, or nihonshu, is made by fermenting steamed rice with koji mold, which converts starch into sugar. The ancient brewing technique was recognized under UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage earlier this month. As a child, Takahashi was not allowed to enter her family-owned brewery. But when she turned 15, she was given a tour of the brewery for the first time and was captivated by the fermentation process. 'I saw it bubbling up. It was fascinating to learn that those bubbles were the work of microorganisms that you can’t even see,' said Takahashi, who couldn't drink alcohol at the time because she was underage. 'It smelled really good. I thought it was amazing that this wonderful fragrant sake could be made from just rice and water. So I thought I’d like to try making it myself.' She pursued a degree in fermentation science at the Tokyo University of Agriculture. After graduation, she decided to return home to become a master brewer. She trained for 10 years under the guidance of her predecessor, and at the age of 34 became a toji at her family brewery. As the brewery enters the winter peak season, Takahashi oversees a team of seasonal workers and production ramps up. It’s labor-intensive work, hauling and turning large amounts of heavy steamed rice, and mixing thousands of liters (hundreds of gallons) of brew. The master brewer must have the knowledge and skill to carefully control optimal koji mold growth, which needs round-the-clock monitoring. Despite the intensity, Takahashi manages to encourage camaraderie in the brewery, catching up with the team as they hand-mix koji rice side by side in a hot humid room. 'I was taught that the most important thing is to get along with your team,' Takahashi said. 'A common saying is that if the atmosphere in the brewery is tense, the sake will turn out harsh, but if things are going well in the brewery, the sake will turn out smooth.' The inclusion of women plays an important role in the survival of the Japanese sake industry, which has seen a steady decline since its peak in the 1970s. Domestic alcoholic consumption has dropped, while many smaller breweries struggle to find new master brewers. According to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association, today’s total production volume is about a quarter of what it was 50 years ago. To remain competitive, Koten is among many Japanese breweries trying to find a wider market both domestically and abroad. 'Our main product has always been dry sake, which local people continue to drink regularly,' said Takahashi's older brother, Isao Takahashi, who is in charge of the business side of the family operation. 'We’re now exploring making higher value sake as well.' He supports his sister's experiments –- every year she creates a limited-edition series, Mie Special, that's meant to branch out from their signature dry product. 'My sister would say she wants to try to make low alcohol content, or she wants to try new yeasts -– all kinds of new techniques are coming in through her,' he said. 'I want my sister to make the sake she wants, and I want to do my best to sell it.'	https://apnews.com/article/japan-sake-women-brewers-84906e38b2be31eac5365ac343c05a0b	2024-12-13T17:20:52-08:00	
South Korean parliament will vote on impeachment motion against President Yoon over martial law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean lawmakers are set to vote on an opposition-led impeachment motion against President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday, two days after Yoon defended his controversial martial law decree and vowed to resist mounting calls for his ouster. It’ll be the second time for the National Assembly to hold a vote on Yoon’s impeachment motion over his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law introduction. Last Saturday, Yoon survived an impeachment vote after most ruling party lawmakers boycotted a floor vote. It’s not clear if those People Power Party lawmakers would do the same again. Public protests against Yoon have since intensified and his approval rating has plummeted. The country’s six opposition parties control the 300-member unicameral parliament with a combined 192 seats, but they are eight seats shy of the two-thirds majority needed to pass Yoon’s impeachment motion. Tens of thousands of people poured onto the streets of capital Seoul in the past two weeks, calling for Yoon to be removed from office and arrested. Smaller groups of Yoon's conservative supporters — still in the thousands — gathered in Seoul's Gwanghwamun boulevard, claiming the opposition's impeachment push was 'unconstitutional' and 'false propaganda.' Yoon’s martial law imposition, the first of kind in more than four decades in South Korea, lasted only six hours, but has caused political tumult, halted diplomatic activities and rattled financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it. After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree before they withdrew after the parliament rejected it. No major violence occurred. Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law clause that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that by law a president in South Korea is allowed to declare marital law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no rights to suspend parliament’s operations even under martial law. Law enforcement authorities are investigating whether Yoon and others involved in the martial law declaration committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes. If convicted, the leader of a rebellion plot can face the death penalty or life imprisonment. On the night of Dec. 3, Yoon also sent soldiers and police officers to the National Election Commission, in what he called a bid to check vulnerabilities in its computer systems that could raise questions on the results of elections. This has spawned speculation that he acted on unfounded rumors or conspiracy theories that the outcome of April’s parliamentary elections, in which the ruling party suffered a massive defeat, was rigged. The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon 'committed rebellion that hurts peace on the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.' It said Yoon’s mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the Constitution. In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon defended his martial law order as an act of governance and denied rebellion charges. He claimed the troops’ deployment to the National Assembly was designed to maintain order, not dissolve or paralyze it. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it 'a monster' and 'anti-state forces' that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials, undermined the government’s budget bill for next year and sympathized with North Korea. 'I will fight to the end to prevent the forces and criminal groups that have been responsible for paralyzing the country’s government and disrupting the nation’s constitutional order from threatening the future of the Republic of Korea,' Yoon said. Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoon’s speech a 'mad declaration of war' against his own people. If the National Assembly passes Yoon’s impeachment motion, his presidential powers and duties will be suspended until the Constitutional Court determines whether to dismiss him as president or restore his powers. If he’s thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days. Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and the head of Seoul’s metropolitan police agency have been arrested or detained over their roles in the martial law case. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations. Ex-Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who resigned on Dec. 5, is considered a central figure in Yoon’s martial law enforcement. The opposition parties alleged he proposed martial law to Yoon, and the president said Thursday he discussed imposing marital law only with Kim before informing other top officials just before declaring it. Kim attempted to kill himself while in detention before correctional officers stopped him and he was in stable condition, according to the Justice Ministry. Yoon has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-impeach-6432768aafc8b55be26215667e3c19d0	2024-12-13T16:44:38-08:00	
A magnitude 6.4 earthquake shakes Chile but there are no reports of damage	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — A 6.4 magnitude earthquake shook central Chile on Friday but there were no immediate reports of damage and a tsunami was ruled out. The United States Geological Survey said the quake occurred at 7:38 p.m. local time (23:38 GMT) at a depth of 110 kilometers. Its epicenter was 41 kilometers (25 miles) east-southeast of the town of Molina. The quake was felt in the central and northern regions of Chile, including in the capital Santiago.

Saudi Arabia banned film for 35 years. The Red Sea festival is just one sign of the industry's rise	JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — 'My Driver and I' was supposed to be made in 2016, but was scuttled amid Saudi Arabia's decades-long cinema ban. Eight years later, the landscape for film in the kingdom looks much different — and the star of 'My Driver and I' now has an award. Roula Dakheelallah was named the winner of the Chopard Emerging Saudi Talent award at the Red Sea International Film Festival on Thursday. The award — and the glitzy festival itself — is a sign of Saudi Arabia's commitment to shaping a new film industry. 'My heart is attached to cinema and art; I have always dreamed of a moment like this,' Dakheelallah, who still works a 9-5 job, told The Associated Press before the awards ceremony. 'I used to work in voluntary films and help my friends in the field, but this is my first big role in a film.' The reopening of cinemas in 2018 marked a cultural turning point for Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy that had instituted the ban 35 years before, under the influence of ultraconservative religious authorities. It has since invested heavily in a native film industry by building theaters and launching programs to support local filmmakers through grants and training. The Red Sea International Film Festival was launched just a year later, part of an attempt to expand Saudi influence into films, gaming, sports and other cultural fields. Activists have decried the investments as whitewashing the kingdom’s human rights record as it tightly controls speech and remains one of the world’s top executioners. With FIFA awarding the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia this week, Lina al-Hathloul, a Saudi activist with the London-based rights group ALQST, said Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman 'has really managed to create this bubble where people only see entertainment and they don’t see the reality on the ground.' These efforts are part of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan unveiled in 2016 to ease the economy's dependence on oil. As part of it, Saudi Arabia plans to construct 350 cinemas with over 2,500 movie screens — by this past April, across 22 cities, it already had 66 cinemas showing movies from the local film industry, as well as Hollywood and Bollywood. (The Red Sea International Film Festival attracts a host of talent from the latter industries, with Viola Davis and Priyanka Chopra Jonas also picking up awards Thursday.) The country's General Entertainment Authority last month opened Al Hisn Studios on the outskirts of Riyadh. As one of the largest such production hubs in the Middle East, it not only includes several film studios but also a production village with workshops for carpentry, blacksmithing and fashion tailoring. 'These facilities, when they exist, will stimulate filmmakers,' said Saudi actor Mohammed Elshehri. 'Today, no writer or director has an excuse to imagine and say, ‘I cannot implement my imagination.’' The facilities are one part of the equation — the content itself is another. One of the major players in transforming Saudi filmmaking has been Telfaz11, a media company founded in 2011 that began as a YouTube channel and quickly became a trailblazer. Producing high-quality digital content such as short films, comedy sketches and series, Telfaz11 offered fresh perspectives on Saudi and regional issues. In 2020, Telfaz11 signed a partnership with Netflix to produce original content for the streaming giant. The result has been movies that demonstrate an evolution on the storytelling level, tackling topics that were once off-limits and sensitive to the public like secret nightlife in 'Mandoob' ('Night Courier') and changing social norms in 'Naga.' 'I think we tell our stories in a very simple way, and that’s what reaches the world,' Elshehri says of the changing shift. 'When you tell your story in a natural way without any affectation, it will reach every person.' But the films were not without their critics, drawing mixed reaction. Social media discoursed ranged from pleasure that Saudi film were tackling such topics to anger over how the films reflected conservative society. As Hana Al-Omair, a Saudi writer and director, points out, there are still many stories left untold. 'We certainly have a long time ahead of us before we can tell the Saudi narrative as it should be,' she said, acknowledging that there are still barriers and rampant censorship. 'The Goat Life,' a Malayalam-language movie about an Indian man forced to work without pay in Saudi Arabia, is not available on Netflix's platform in the country. Movies that explore political topics or LGBTQ+ stories are essentially out of the question. Even 'My Driver and I,' featured at the Red Sea festival alongside 11 other Saudi feature-length films, was initially too controversial. It centers on a Sudanese man in Jeddah, living away from his own daughter, who feels responsible for the girl he drives as her parents are absent. It was initially blocked from being made because of the relationship between the girl and the driver, filmmaker Ahd Kamel has said, even though it's not a romantic relationship. Now in 2024, the film is a success story — a symbol of the Saudi film industry's evolution as well as the growing role of women like Kamel behind the camera and Dakheelallah in front of it. 'I see the change in Saudi cinema, a very beautiful change and it is moving at a wonderful speed. In my opinion, we do not need to rush,' Dakheelallah said. 'We need to guide the truth of the artistic movement that is happening in Saudi Arabia.'	https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-film-festival-saudi-cinema-13c9762d8b72066987437179fa87bb2a	2024-12-13T13:39:34-08:00	
Capitol rioter who tried to join Russian army is sentenced to prison for probation violation	WASHINGTON (AP) — A Dallas man who tried to fly overseas to join the Russian military and fight against Ukraine was sentenced on Friday to six months in prison for violating the terms of his probation for storming the U.S. Capitol four years ago. Kevin Loftus, a 56-year-old veteran of the U.S. Army, was stopped from boarding an Oct. 28 flight from Dallas to Tbilisi, Georgia, by way of Istanbul, Turkey, when Turkish Airlines identified a 'security flag' associated with him, according to federal prosecutors. Loftus didn't have the court's permission to travel internationally or to drive from Texas to Iowa, where the FBI arrested him three days after his flight plans fell apart, prosecutors said. Loftus told the FBI that he had hoped to secure a 90-day visa to travel to Russia, where he intended to apply for temporary residency. Loftus said he had used the Telegram messaging platform to communicate with a man who would connect him with the Russian Territorial Defense Unit, a volunteer military corps. 'Loftus said he had already sent the man approximately $1200 to purchase equipment for Russian soldiers,' prosecutors wrote. 'Loftus said his intent was to fight for Russia and against Ukraine.' Loftus declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich sentenced him for the probation violation. The judge said Loftus has repeatedly violated court orders. 'He doesn't think these rules should apply to him,' Friedrich said. 'He wants to be above the law.' Defense attorney Benjamin Schiffelbein said Loftus wanted to enlist in the Russian military because he 'felt bad' for Russian soldiers and wanted to help them. 'He had no idea whether they could make use of him,' the lawyer said. Loftus, a six-year Army veteran, intended to permanently relocate to another country, according to prosecutors. 'And his planned travel was for the express purpose of joining a foreign army to take up arms against one of this country’s allies and in opposition to this country’s foreign policy,' they wrote. In January 2021, Loftus traveled from Wisconsin to Washington, D.C., to attend then-President Donald Trump's 'Stop the Steal' rally near the White House. After joining the mob of Trump supporters at the Capitol, he entered the building and took photographs. He spent approximately five minutes inside the Capitol. Loftus was arrested at his Wisconsin home several days after the riot. He pleaded guilty in October 2021 to a misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. After his arrest, Loftus posted comments about his case on social media, referring to himself as 'famous' and a 'hero' for taking part in the Jan. 6 attack. 'Loftus also stated that he gained that fame by ‘standing up for all Americans’ because he ‘broke the law,’ and he would file lawsuits against unidentified persons after the criminal case was over,' prosecutors wrote. Prosecutors recommended 30 days of imprisonment for Loftus, but Friedrich initially sentenced him to three years of probation. For his probation violation, prosecutors requested a six-month prison sentence. They noted that Loftus, while on probation, also was arrested in December 2023 and charged with driving while intoxicated in Richardson, Texas. Loftus was required to attend a substance abuse program, but he avoided jail time for that violation. Over 1,500 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related crimes. More than 1,000 of them have been convicted and sentenced, with roughly two-thirds receiving a term of imprisonment ranging from a few days to 22 years. Trump has repeatedly vowed to pardon Capitol rioters, but the district court judges in Washington, D.C., typically have refused to postpone sentencings, plea hearings and trials until after the president-elect returns to the White House.	https://apnews.com/article/kevin-loftus-russia-capitol-riot-jan-6-trump-c5fbf7f0febdf789464ca438c74485c1	2024-12-13T12:58:59-08:00	
African Union chairperson candidates advocate for permanent UN Security Council seats	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Three African politicians seeking to head the African Union detailed their plans on Friday for regional security amid conflicts and political coups while strongly advocating for inter-Africa trade among other issues. Raila Odinga of Kenya, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf of Djibouti and Richard Randriamandrato of Madagascar are seeking to be elected as chairperson for the 55-member state African Union. They participated in a two-hour debate Friday in Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa in which they all advocated for two permanent seats for African countries in the U.N. Security Council to effectively represent the continent with the youngest population. Odinga said that two permanent seats with veto power were 'a must for Africa' and that this was 'only fair' since the continent has more than 50 countries. Randriamandrato urged member states to cease the opportunity and 'speak with one voice on the choice of who will represent Africa in the UNSC.' The three are seeking to convince most African countries before the February election to succeed African Union Chairperson Moussa Faki, who has served for two terms. The African Union has faced several challenges that include conflict in member countries and political coups that have seen five member states expelled from the union, making regional security a major theme in Friday’s debate. Youssouf said that regional security could be enhanced if the resources for a regional standby force were increased to reduce the overreliance on foreign partnerships for resources. 'When there is no unity of purpose among neighboring countries peace will be compromised,' Youseff said. Randriamandrato encouraged countries to take charge of their internal security while cautioning that foreign military bases should be 'a thing of the past' because they 'could be a source of conflict.' Despite the continent’s young population of 1.3 billion that is set to double by 2050, regional trade has faced challenges that were addressed in the Friday debate. Odinga said that Africa had a 'huge domestic market' that it could leverage on for economic transformation by opening up opportunities for trade between African countries. Youssouf proposed a payment compensation system that would ensure countries don't lose out while trading in different currencies adding, 'are we going to have a single currency, why not?' Randriamandrato said that regional economic blocs like the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa had a huge role to play in easing inter-Africa trade. The African Union has several proposed reforms on its structure and leadership aimed at achieving its purpose, and all candidates promised to implement the reforms if elected. Youssouf said that key reforms in the union were facing a funding bottleneck and that 'it has to change,' adding that he wouldn't impose it on member states but would 'advocate for it.'	https://apnews.com/article/african-union-chairperson-election-e938b6056e216db643338022b7d2469c	2024-12-13T10:03:29-08:00	
American released from Syrian prison is flown out of the country, a US official says	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military has transported out of Syria an American who disappeared seven months ago into former President Bashar Assad’s notorious prison system and was among the thousands released this week by rebels, a U.S. official said Friday. Travis Timmerman was flown out of Syria on a U.S. military helicopter, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing operation. Timmerman, 29, told The Associated Press he had gone to Syria on a Christian pilgrimage and was not ill-treated while in Palestine Branch, a notorious detention facility operated by Syrian intelligence. He said he was freed by 'the liberators who came into the prison and knocked the door down (of his cell) with a hammer.' Timmerman said he was released Monday morning alongside a young Syrian man and 70 female prisoners, some of whom had their children with them. He had been held separately from Syrian and other Arab prisoners and said he didn’t know of any other Americans held in the facility.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-timmerman-assad-timmerman-443d1c3b2b9cf551cdcfdff22bdcedc9	2024-12-13T09:57:44-08:00	
Hearings are done: Now the wait begins for verdict on closely-watched climate case at UN’s top court	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A lawyer for a small South Pacific island nation told the world’s highest court to heed her warning. 'Tuvalu will not go quietly into the rising sea,' Phillipa Webb said, hoping her ominous words this week would make a mark as two weeks of historic and closely-watched hearings on the threat of climate change wrapped up Friday. The International Court of Justice took up the largest case in its history after the United Nations General Assembly asked the institution to clarify what countries worldwide are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact. Tuvalu was one of several small island nations which, fearing they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, lobbied the U.N. to ask the court for an advisory opinion. In all 96 countries and 11 international organizations spoke in the Peace Palace, including many who had never before participated in proceedings before The Hague-based court. Even if the proceedings don’t lead to a defining opinion, Nikki Reisch, the director of climate policy at the Center for International Environmental Law, says they were a giant step forward. 'The hearings have really been a watershed moment for human rights, climate justice and accountability, even before a decision is out,' she said. The court has been asked to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? Countries including Tuvalu, Chile and the Philippines want countries such as the United States, China and Russia to reduce their emissions and provide financial help to alleviate the devastating impact of climate change that they feel endangers their very existence. 'We want a clear and unambiguous decision that the conduct — that has caused climate change over time — is unlawful under international law,' Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, who is leading the legal team for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Associated Press. Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. 'It is too often repeated that the decision will be non-binding,' Reisch said. Instead, she insisted, 'it will be an authoritative interpretation of international law.' Activists could bring lawsuits against their own countries for failing to comply with the decision and states could return to the ICJ to hold each other to account. And whatever the judges say will be used as the basis for other legal instruments, like investment agreements, which could be rendered 'null and void' by an aggressive opinion, according to Wewerinke-Singh. However, major greenhouse gas emitters like the United States want the court to defer to the landmark Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit human-caused warming to a 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). 'States designed this international legal framework to address the uniquely complex collective action problem posed by anthropogenic global warming, and it embodies the clearest, most specific and the most current expression of states’ consent to be bound by international law in respect of climate change,' Margaret Taylor said on behalf of the U.S., referring to the Paris Agreement. The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Between 1990 and 2020, sea levels rose by a global average of 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) and parts of the South Pacific have seen significantly more. The vast majority of participating countries said Paris does not go far enough to protect them. Fifteen judges from around the world will now consider the oral and written submissions. At the end of the hearing on Friday, the court posed a series of questions to the participants who have until the end of the year to reply. On average, the court takes six months to issue an opinion but given the extent of the proceedings, a decision isn’t expected until late in 2025. ____ Follow AP’s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment	https://apnews.com/article/world-court-climate-change-733baa2cfa306ac63db8eeed6cdf3783	2024-12-13T09:24:50-08:00	
Europe's anti-torture watchdog slams Italy over migrant detention abuses	ROME (AP) — The Council of Europe's anti-torture committee on Friday released a report criticizing Italy’s treatment of migrants in local detention centers, citing cases of physical ill-treatment, excessive force and the use of psychotropic drugs on detainees. The report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) follows an April visit to four migrant detention and repatriation centers in Milan, Gradisca, Potenza and Rome. Under Italian law, these centers are aimed at hosting migrants who try to enter the country without a visa, are not entitled to apply for asylum and are deemed 'socially dangerous' by law enforcement. The report details instances of 'interventions' in the detention facilities, known as CPRs, and identifies shortcomings including 'the absence of any rigorous and independent monitoring of such interventions and the lack of an accurate recording of injuries' sustained by detainees. Italy has in the past defended the role of these centers as a deterrent to surging illegal migration, noting that some 'prison elements' are necessary to prevent escapes from these facilities. The far-right government led by Giorgia Meloni has also tried to export the Italian model abroad, sealing a contentious agreement with Albania to build and run two migrant holding centers in the eastern country. The deal, however, has faced legal hurdles and has been suspended by Italian magistrates in its early stages. In its report Friday, the CPT was also critical of the 'widespread practice' of administering unprescribed psychotropic drugs to detainees in Potenza, one of the four centers visited. The report also highlights 'the prolonged handcuffing of persons apprehended on the territory during their transfer to a (holding facility).' In its report, the anti-torture watchdog recommended Italy to remove the 'carceral elements' from the centers and to ensure their proper maintenance, notably the sanitary facilities. It also showed the critical lack of activities offered to migrants held in the centers, with minimal efforts to offer them 'a few activities of a recreational nature.' The report concludes that the committee's findings, 'notably in relation to the very poor material conditions, the absence of a regime of activities, the disproportionate security approach, the variable quality of health care provision and the lack of transparency of the management of CPRs by private contractors,' call into question the application of such a model by Italy in an extra-territorial setting, such as in Albania. The February death of a young detainee at Rome’s Ponte Galeria center brought renewed attention to the harsh conditions inside these de facto jails for migrants, which have been condemned by lawyers and activists as 'black holes' of human rights violations. From 2019 to 2024, at least 13 people had died — five by suicide — inside Italy’s detention centers, according to activists and aid groups. Hundreds of suicide attempts and self-harm incidents have also been reported. The Italian government believes the detention centers, which were established in 1999, are essential to reduce the number of migrants risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean and reach Europe. In 2023, the government extended the maximum detention period from 90 days to 18 months. In response to Friday's report, Italian authorities indicated that the described cases of physical ill-treatment 'have not been the subject of criminal investigations and that several inspections have been carried out by the health authorities at the Potenza CPR in relation to the practice of allegedly widespread over-medication of detained persons.'	https://apnews.com/article/italy-council-of-europe-migration-centers-albania-detainees-violence-0dba82e1f333c60b3bc49a0894970e9d	2024-12-13T07:57:30-08:00	
Who was in ousted Syrian President Assad's inner circle and where are they now?	BEIRUT (AP) — After insurgents toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad this month, many senior officials and members of his dreaded intelligence and security services appear to have melted away. Activists say some of them have managed to flee the country while others went to hide in their hometowns. For more than five decades, the Assad family has ruled Syria with an iron grip, locking up those who dared question their power in the country's notorious prisons, where rights groups say inmates were regularly tortured or killed. The leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham insurgent group — which led anti-government fighters who forced Assad from power — has vowed to bring those who carried out such abuses to justice. 'We will go after them in our country,' said HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was previously known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani. He added that the group will also ask foreign countries to hand over any suspects. But finding those responsible for abuses could prove difficult. Some 8,000 Syrian citizens have entered Lebanon through the Masnaa border crossing in recent days, according to two Lebanese security officials and a judicial official, and about 5,000 have left the neighboring country through Beirut’s international airport. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. Most of those are presumed to be regular people, and Lebanon’s Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi said earlier this week that no Syrian official entered Lebanon through a legal border crossing. In an apparent effort to prevent members of Assad's government from escaping, the security officials said a Lebanese officer who was in charge of Masnaa was ordered to go on vacation because of his links to Assad's brother. But Rami Abdurrhaman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, says several senior officers have nonetheless made it to neighboring Lebanon using travel documents with fake names. Here's a look at Assad and some of the officials in his inner circle. Bashar Assad The Western-educated ophthalmologist initially raised hopes that he would be unlike his strongman father, Hafez, when he took power in 2000, including freeing political prisoners and allowing for a more open discourse. But when protests of his rule erupted in March 2011, Assad turned to brutal tactics to crush dissent. As the uprising became an outright civil war, he unleashed his military to blast opposition-held cities, with support from allies Iran and Russia. He has fled to Moscow, according to Russian state media. Maher Assad The younger brother of the ousted president was the commander of the 4th Armored Division, which Syrian opposition activists have accused of killings, torture, extortion and drug trafficking, in addition to running its own detention centers. He is under U.S. and European sanctions. He disappeared over the weekend, and Abdurrhaman said he made it to Russia. Last year, French authorities issued an international arrest warrant for Maher Assad, along with his brother and two army generals, for alleged complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity, including in a 2013 chemical attack on rebel-held Damascus suburbs. Maj. Gen. Ali Mamlouk Mamlouk was a security adviser to Assad and former head of the intelligence services. He is wanted in Lebanon for two explosions in the northern city of Tripoli in 2012 that killed and wounded dozens. Mamlouk is also wanted in France after a court convicted him and others in absentia of complicity in war crimes and sentenced them to life in prison. The trial focused on the officials’ role in the 2013 arrest in Damascus of a Franco-Syrian man and his son and their subsequent torture and killing. Abdurrahman said Mamlouk fled to Lebanon, and it is not clear if he is still in the country under the protection of Hezbollah. Brig. Gen. Suheil al-Hassan Al-Hassan was the commander of the 25th Special Missions Forces Division and later became the head of the Syrian Special Forces, which were key to many of the government's battlefield victories in the long-running civil war, including in Aleppo and the eastern suburbs of Damascus that long held off Assad's troops. Al-Hassan is known to have close ties to Russia and was praised by Russian President Vladimir Putin during one of his visits to Syria. Al-Hassan's whereabouts are not known. Maj. Gen. Hussam Luka Luka, head of the General Security Directorate intelligence service, is not well known among the wider public but has played a major role in the crackdown against the opposition, mainly in the central city of Homs that was dubbed the 'capital of the Syrian revolt.' Luka has been sanctioned by the U.S. and Britain for his role in the crackdown. It's not clear where he is. Maj. Gen. Qahtan Khalil Khalil, whose whereabouts are also unknown, was head of the Air Force Intelligence service and is widely known as the 'Butcher of Daraya' for allegedly leading a 2012 attack on a Damascus suburb of the same name that killed hundreds of people. Other officials — Retired Maj. Gen. Jamil Hassan, former head of the Air Force Intelligence service, is also suspected of bearing responsibility for the attack in Daraya. Hassan was among those convicted in France this year along with Mamlouk. — Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Ali Abbas and Maj. Gen. Bassam Merhej al-Hassan, head of Bashar Assad’s office and the man in charge of his security, are accused of human rights violations.	https://apnews.com/article/bashar-assad-maher-inner-circle-syria-3d6a78b643e6515a1b89ef5f1b9057f7	2024-12-13T07:57:01-08:00	
Nancy Pelosi hospitalized after she 'sustained an injury' from fall on official trip to Luxembourg	WASHINGTON (AP) — Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been hospitalized after she 'sustained an injury' during an official engagement in Luxembourg, according to a spokesman. Pelosi, 84, was in Europe with a bipartisan congressional delegation to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. Her spokesman, Ian Krager, said in a statement that she is 'currently receiving excellent treatment from doctors and medical professionals' and is unable to attend the remainder of events on her trip. He did not describe the nature of her injury or give any additional details, but a person familiar with the incident said that Pelosi tripped and fell while at an event with the other members of Congress. The person requested anonymity to discuss the fall because they were not authorized to speak about it publicly. Krager said that Pelosi 'looks forward to returning home to the U.S. soon.' Among the members on the trip was Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who posted on social media that he was 'praying for a speedy recovery,' for Pelosi. The two lawmakers were captured holding hands in a group photo Friday at the U.S. Embassy in Luxembourg. 'I’m disappointed Speaker Emerita Pelosi won’t be able to join the rest of our delegation’s events this weekend as I know how much she looked forward to honoring our veterans,' McCaul wrote on X. 'But she is strong, and I am confident she will be back on her feet in no time.' The former leader's fall comes two years after her husband Paul was attacked by a man with a hammer at their San Francisco home. The man, who was sentenced in October to 30 years in federal prison, broke into their home looking for Pelosi. Pelosi, who was first elected in 1987 and served as speaker twice, stepped down from her leadership post two years ago but remained in Congress and was re-elected to represent her San Francisco district in November. She has remained active in the two years since she left the top job, working with Democrats in private and in public and attending official events. Last summer, she was instrumental in her party's behind the scenes push to urge President Joe Biden to leave the presidential ticket. She attended the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington last weekend and was on the Senate floor Monday to attend the swearing in of her former Democratic House colleagues, Adam Schiff of California and Andy Kim of New Jersey. Earlier this week, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, 82, tripped and fell in the Senate, spraining his wrist and cutting his face. McConnell, who is stepping down from his leadership post at the end of the year, missed Senate votes on Thursday after experiencing some stiffness in his leg from the fall, his office said.	https://apnews.com/article/nancy-pelosi-injury-hospital-luxembourg-d55392b1dd9ebc2af77795bb46e364ed	2024-12-13T07:45:57-08:00	
Canadian government asks labor board to intervene in Canada Post strike as Christmas nears	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Mail could begin moving again in Canada as early as next week after the federal government moved Friday to end a nearly monthlong work stoppage at Canada Post. Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon announced he’s referred the dispute to the Canada Industrial Relations Board, with the aim of ordering the nearly 55,000 workers back to their posts and extending the current collective agreement until May 22, 2025 — if the board determines a deal isn’t within immediate reach. 'Canadians are rightly fed up,' MacKinnon said. With Christmas fast approaching, there was no apparent movement at the bargaining table. MacKinnon had previously rebuffed calls for Ottawa to intervene, saying it’s up to the two sides to work out a deal. But he said Canadians — especially small businesses, people in remote communities and Indigenous people — have suffered greatly as a result of the strike. The key issues include wages, job security and how to staff a proposed expansion into weekend delivery. MacKinnon said Canada Post is built to deliver letters but letter volumes have dropped dramatically and there is a highly competitive parcel delivery market. 'There are major structural changes in that industry that have to be accounted for. There are workers aspirations that have to be accounted for,' MacKinnon said. 'Those are interests that are tough to reconcile.' Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government previously forced the country’s two major railroads into arbitration, ending that work stoppage. 'The Union denounces in the strongest terms this assault on our constitutionally protected right to collectively bargain and to strike,' the Canadian Union of Postal Workers said in a statement. 'This order continues a deeply troubling pattern in which the government uses its arbitrary powers to let employers off the hook.' The Canadian Federation of Independent Business welcomed the move. It estimates small businesses have been losing a combined $100 million Canadian (US$70 million) every day. 'This will be too late to salvage any of the Christmas holiday season for small businesses,' CFIB president Dan Kelly said in a statement. 'With a massive backlog, it will be nearly impossible for any new shipments to make it to Canadians before Christmas through Canada Post,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-post-strike-mail-service-dfaad46e8a9dcfcb32127924a6caaabf	2024-12-13T06:48:42-08:00	
Lindsey Vonn to enter World Cup ski races next weekend in Switzerland in her comeback at age 40	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) — Lindsey Vonn will return to World Cup ski racing next weekend for a pair of super-G events in St. Moritz, Switzerland, as she continues her comeback at 40 years old. Vonn teased her return in an Instagram post through her sponsor, Red Bull, on Friday morning. She said, 'My body is finally put back together. I hear St. Moritz is pretty nice this time of year.' The U.S. Ski Team then confirmed she will race in St. Moritz. She's won five of her 82 World Cup races on the course at St. Moritz. There will be super-G competitions next Saturday and Sunday. 'It’s the coolest thing ever,' said Picabo Street, a two-time Olympic medalist and Vonn's former teammate. 'I’m not surprised at all. I’ve seen her intermittently and she’s stayed in great shape. She is the hardest working person I’ve met in my life — period.' It will be Vonn's first major race since February 2019, when she took third in the downhill during the world championships in Sweden. An assortment of injuries, including to her knee, sent her into retirement. But a partial knee replacement last April has her feeling good enough again to give racing another chance. Vonn earned enough points to be eligible to compete on the World Cup circuit through a series of lower-level competitions last weekend in Copper Mountain, Colorado. She’s been testing out the Birds of Prey course at Beaver Creek as a forerunner in training runs this week. She didn't take the hill Friday, but will again in a forerunning capacity ahead of the downhill on Saturday and the super-G on Sunday. 'She’s living her best life,' said Street, who's doing commentary work at the Birds of Prey races this weekend for NBC. 'She’s earned every second of it.' When Vonn left the tour, she had 82 World Cup wins — the record for a woman at the time and within reach of the all-time Alpine mark of 86 held by Swedish standout Ingemar Stenmark. The women’s record held by Vonn was eclipsed in January 2023 by Mikaela Shiffrin, whose 99 wins are more than any Alpine ski racer in the history of the sport. 'It’s awesome' to have Vonn back, said Czech Republic ski racer/snowboarder Ester Ledecka, who won the 2018 Olympic super-G in South Korea as Vonn finished tied for sixth. 'It was for me a little bit sad to see her finishing her career. I thought, ‘Hey, you should finish it when you want to, not because your body is not capable to let you do your runs.' I’m very happy that she’s back and she’s feeling good and she’s happy. 'I think she’ll be also very fast. So, I’m very happy to have her around.' ___ AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/alpine-skiing	https://apnews.com/article/lindsey-vonn-ski-racing-acdc37bed64444ee601b56f8cf5f965c	2024-12-13T06:34:13-08:00	
Saudi Arabia's plans to host the men's World Cup 2034 will be harmful for the climate, experts say	As the newly-named host of the 2034 World Cup in men's soccer, Saudi Arabia says it will construct or renovate 15 stadiums, create a futuristic city and expand airports in a massive buildout to accommodate millions of athletes, coaches and spectators. That will emit tons of planet-warming greenhouse gases as concrete and steel are manufactured and transported, diesel-powered excavators and trucks move material and new buildings are powered and cooled. When all the emissions associated with the world's buildings are grouped together, they are the largest contributor to climate change. Constructing so many new venues is 'environmentally wasteful in the extreme' because so much carbon will be emitted and scarce resources used, said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in Massachusetts who has written several books about the economics of mega sporting events. Zimbalist said the World Cup should be held in countries with a developed soccer culture and industry. Seth Warren Rose, founding director of the research organization Eneref Institute, said the world will be even hotter a decade from now, and can’t afford this added warming. 'I’m sorry, but we’re living in a different planet. We have to prepare for that,' Rose said. 'By 2034, we’ll be living in a different climate and that’s not a metaphor.' Rose said his message to organizers is: Make a genuine effort to reduce emissions or don't host at all. Saudi Arabia’s plans will rely heavily on concrete, which is responsible for about 8% of worldwide emissions that warm the planet, with iron and steel accounting for another 7%. Human rights groups are concerned that giving the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia will endanger migrant workers. In a bid book detailing its plans for development across five cities ahead of the World Cup, Saudi Arabia said three new stadiums are currently under construction and eight more are planned, to accommodate 2034's first-ever 48-team games. Buildings constructed for international sporting events often end up becoming 'white elephant' venues that sit idle once games are over. The Saudi Arabian Football Federation did not respond to request for comment. Saudi Arabia has proposed 134 accommodations for teams and referees, new hotels, several fan festival locations, transportation expansions, including high-speed rail and further investment in its futuristic city of Neom. Much of what the nation included in its bid book relates to its Vision 2030 strategic plan, which the government calls a plan to diversify its economy and unlock new business opportunities. The bid does include sustainability initiatives, said Karim Elgendy, a fellow at London’s Chatham House think tank. Among them are running stadiums on clean electricity such as solar, using energy-efficient natural ventilation and shading and mandating green building standards. But Elgendy said the sheer scale of Saudi Arabia's apparent plans for the event, plus the distances between host cities suggest this could become the most carbon-intensive World Cup in history. Elgendy said how they mitigate this undertaking will determine the environmental impact and without measures, the event could have a carbon footprint that is almost twice the record set in 2022. In contrast, organizers of this summer’s Paris Olympics said this week they met their goal of cutting the games’ carbon footprint by half compared to 2012 and 2016. They did this using renewable energy, recycled materials, plant-based food options that are less carbon-intensive than meat and even powering the famous Olympic cauldron with electricity and lights rather than burning gas. To critics who suggest FIFA ought to have chosen a different host country, like the United Kingdom which has dozens of stadiums, Walker Ross, a researcher of sport ecology and sustainability at the University of Edinburgh points out the Saudi bid was the only one in a fast-tracked process. The next World Cup, in 2026, will span 16 cities across North America. Ross said that could have a significant carbon footprint, too, as teams and fans travel across an entire continent. The same could be said for the 2030 World Cup to be played across six countries. If anyone is at fault, it's FIFA, he said, because it's their bid process. 'People kind of throw their hands up in the air and act like there are certain countries that should and shouldn’t host when it comes to these events,' he said. 'But if this sport is truly for the world, then we have to be open to everyone hosting.' Qatar went on a $200 billion construction spree, building seven stadiums, a new metro system, highways, high-rise buildings and a new city ahead of the 2022 event there. Organizers and FIFA projected it would produce some 3.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over the decade spent preparing for the tournament, or about 3% of Qatar’s total emissions in 2019, according to World Bank data. Experts say the Qatar event had the highest carbon emissions to date. Skeptics and outside experts said Qatar’s accounting that it hosted a ‘carbon neutral’ World Cup didn't encompass the event’s full carbon footprint. FIFA accepted Saudi Arabia’s sustainability and climate promises in an evaluation released in November, noting that 'whilst the extent of construction would have a material environmental impact, the bid provides a good foundation for delivering mitigation measures to address some of the environment-related challenges.' FIFA directed The Associated Press to the evaluation Thursday when asked for additional comment. Saudi Arabia's emissions have been growing; it emitted 533 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2022, or 1.6% of global emissions, according to the International Energy Agency, and its fossil fuel production is skyrocketing. Renewable energy remains nearly nonexistent. The country has a goal to source at least half of its power from renewables by 2030. 'It appears that FIFA has learnt very little from the debacle with the World Cup in Qatar,' said Khaled Diab, a spokeperson at Carbon Market Watch. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Bringing hope and joy: superheroes for children with cancer in Kosovo	PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Superheroes like Superman, Spiderman, Batman, Super Mario, Superwoman, Captain America, Bumble Bees and the Flash became a powerful symbol of renewal to children on Friday who are battling grave cancer illnesses in Kosovo. As the year draws to a close, many families eagerly anticipate the joy and togetherness of New Year’s festivities. Yet, for seven children, part of the 49 cancer patients admitted this year, battling leukemia and other types of cancer in a hospital ward in the capital Pristina, this season comes with uncertainty, fear, and hardship. However, a remarkable initiative involving 'superheroes' clad in unique costumes brought unexpected joy — not only to the children but also, perhaps even more deeply, to their parents. 'That is a very nice initiative which enjoys us so much,' said mother Blerta Sahiti. The hospital setting, often associated with clinical sterility and emotional struggles, transformed into a place of wonder and laughter when volunteers dressed as beloved superheroes climbed down in ropes to take gifts to the children. Their mission was simple: to bring joy, hope, and a moment of respite to the children and their families. 'The children love such personalities. They dream of them every day,' said Rufadie Macastena Maxhuni, a doctor at the ward. 'That is such a great joy.' Each superhero wore distinct costumes, adding a personalized touch to their appearances. They were not just characters from comic books but symbols of courage, strength, and resilience — the very traits these young fighters exhibit every day. 'You can hardly describe with words these special special feeling (we receive),' said Berat Kajtazi, who has played Captain America in the last four years. For the children, the arrival of these heroes meant stepping into a world beyond IV drips, chemotherapy sessions, and endless tests. Their faces lit up with delight as they received thoughtfully chosen gifts and shared hugs with their favorite characters. —- Semini reported from Tirana, Albania	https://apnews.com/article/children-cancer-superheroes-kosovo-hospital-4c2f946cfea2d89e18f66a6e4bdecbb6	2024-12-13T04:46:20-08:00	
Companies from UK, Italy and Japan to form joint venture for new fighter jet	LONDON (AP) — The three companies building a next generation fighter jet for the U.K., Italy and Japan revealed Friday that they are forming a joint venture to deliver the aircraft. Under the agreement, Britain's BAE Systems, Italy's Leonardo and Japan Aircraft Industrial Enhancement will each own a third of the new joint venture, which will be subject to regulatory approvals. 'This agreement is the result of an intensive journey made possible by pooling our mutual and shared experiences,' said Roberto Cingolani, Leonardo's chief executive. The headquarters for the Global Combat Air Programme, or GCAP, will be the U.K., but operations will take place in each of the partner nations. Under the terms of the agreement, the first chief executive will come from Italy. 'The new business will bring together the significant strengths and expertise of the companies involved to create an innovative organization that will lead the way in developing a next generation combat air system, creating long-term, high value and skilled jobs across the partner nations for decades to come,' said Charles Woodburn, BAE Systems' chief executive. The triangular-shaped jets will have supersonic capability and cutting-edge technology. Pilots will be able to use virtual reality in the aircraft’s digital cockpit, with vital information displayed directly in front of them. The aim is that they will take to the skies by 2035. Kimito Nakae, president of JAIEC, acknowledged that the way ahead 'might not always be simple and straightforward,' but that 'through continuing the strong spirit of trilateral cooperation and collaboration that we have fostered up to this point, we will not only deliver the GCAP on time but also at a level that exceeds all of our expectations.'	https://apnews.com/article/britain-italy-japan-fighter-jet-1b4f5c4bbf761406ae1b2b60352a483c	2024-12-13T04:34:45-08:00	
Thousands of Syrians celebrate in central Damascus during first Friday prayers since Assad's fall	DAMASCUS (AP) — Thousands of Syrians gathered Friday at Umayyad Square, the largest in Damascus, to celebrate after the first Muslim Friday prayers following the downfall of former President Bashar Assad. Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of insurgency that toppled Assad in a lightning 10-day march across the country to Damascus, appeared in a video message in which he congratulated 'the great Syrian people for the victory of the blessed revolution.' 'I invite them to head to the squares to show their happiness without shooting bullets and scaring people,' he said. 'And then after we will work to build this country and as I said in the beginning, we will be victorious by the help of God.' Al-Sharaa's force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, and its allied insurgents have been working to establish security and start a political transition after seizing the capital early Sunday. At the same time, they have tried to reassure a public that is both stunned by the fall of the state that had long ruled with an iron hand and concerned over extremist jihadis among the insurgents. The Friday prayers have a particular symbolism because in the early days of the anti-government uprising-turned-civil-war in Syria in 2011, protesters would turn out en masse after going to the mosque. 'Unified Syria to build Syria,' the crowd gathered in Damascus' Umayyad Square chanted. Some shouted slurs about the former president and his late father, calling them pigs, an insult that would have previously led to offenders being hauled off to one of the feared detention centers of Assad’s security forces. The crowd included many families with children, and some of the demonstrators had come from far-flung areas of the country, including from Idlib — the longtime rebel enclave in the northwest of Syia, for years isolated on the other side of the civil war's battle lines. Wardan Aoun, who identified himself as a fighter from Idlib, said, 'There is a good government now and God willing corruption will be gone.' 'We lived in Idlib under this government and there is no corruption there,' he said, referring to the rebel-led administration in the enclave. Khaled Abu Chahine, 51, from Kafr Shams in the southern province of Daraa, where the 2011 uprising first erupted, said he hoped for 'freedom and coexistence between all Syrians, Alawites, Sunnis, Shiites and Druze. No to racism.' 'The former government was a government of crime and executions,' he said, calling on foreign nations 'hosting these gangs to bring them to justice and those who are in Syria and committed crimes should face justice.' As the gathering took place, the top U.S. diplomat was in the region discussing the U.S. view on the developments in Syria with regional powers. In the Turkish capital, Ankara, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday there was 'broad agreement' between Turkey and the United States on what they would like to see in Syria. That starts with an 'interim government in Syria, one that is inclusive and non-sectarian and one that protects the rights of minorities and women' and does not 'pose any kind of threat to any of Syria’s neighbors,' Blinken said during joint statements with Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. The insurgent groups that toppled Assad in Syria have not made clear their policy or stance on Israel, whose military in recent days has bombed sites all over the country. Israel says it is trying to prevent weapons from falling into extremist hands, and has seized a swath of southern Syria along the border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, calling it a buffer zone. Blinken said it was imperative to continue with efforts to the keep the Islamic State group under control. The Turkish foreign minister said the two had discussed ways of establishing prosperity in Syria and ending terrorism in the country. 'Our priority is establishing stability in Syria as soon as possible, preventing terrorism from gaining ground, and ensuring that IS and the PKK aren’t dominant,' Fidan said, in reference to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party. The U.S. and Turkey have different stances on the allied Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led group in Syria that has been a key part of the fight against IS but that Turkey regards as a terrorist group. Blinken said Washington is 'very focused on Syria, very focused on the opportunity that now is before us and before the Syrian people to move from out from under the shackles of Bashar al-Assad to a different and better future for the Syrian people, one that the Syrian people decide for themselves.' ———— Lee reported from Ankara.

US and allies mark the 80th anniversary of World War II Battle of the Bulge	BASTOGNE, Belgium (AP) — Eighty years later, World War II veteran David Marshall, has a picture in his wallet of him fighting in the snow and bitter cold in one of the defining moments of the four-year conflict — the Battle of the Bulge. The 100-year-old vet was part of commemorations on Friday as the United States, its European allies and a dwindling number of veterans remembered the month of dramatic fighting that stopped Adolf Hitler’s last-ditch offensive and opened the way for the full Nazi defeat. Still, beyond the ceremonies and this weekend's events in Belgium and Luxembourg to commemorate one of the most important and deadly battles that helped decide the war, Marshall wants people to go one step beyond just remembering it. The young should 'study about the war,' Marshall said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'Learn all you can about it in order to prevent any future war.' 'If you forget the past, you are not going to have a future,' said Marshal, who was in the battle working a mortar. At dawn on Dec. 16, 1944, over 200,000 German soldiers threw Hitler’s last hopes in a unexpected attack through the dense woods of Belgium and Luxembourg’s hilly Ardennes. Making the most of the surprise move, the cold, freezing weather and wearied U.S. troops, the Germans pierced the front line so deeply it came to be known as the Battle of the Bulge. It ultimately made sure the Allied advance, started on the D-Day beaches of Normandy in June 1944, could continue right on to Berlin. Initially outnumbered, U.S. troops delayed the attack enough in fierce fighting to allow reinforcements to stream in and turn the tide of the battle by Christmas. Beyond the overwhelming German forces, the conditions were just as tough, said Marshall. 'It was cold, wind with snow — and there were a few Germans around, you know. And it was a matter of subsisting, you know, the weather rather than the Germans. Fighting them was not the problem. Fighting the weather was the problem,' said Marshall. Hitler had hoped the advance would change the course of the war by forcing U.S. and British troops to sue for peace, thus freeing Germany to focus on the rapidly advancing Soviet armies in the east. After the fighting in the Battle of the Bulge ended on Jan. 28, 1945, Allied forces invaded Germany, eventually leading to the Nazi surrender and the end of the war in Europe. Germany is now an ally of the United States and its wartime partners in NATO and the symbolism was not wasted on such day. 'There's no reason we cannot get along,' said veteran Gilbert Charleston, 101, a Choctow Nation Elder of the 739th Tank Battalion, after he shared memories over the picture with Marshall. 'If they would just take the time to be kind to each other and not try to be so possessive — help when help is needed,' he said. 'I think the world would be a lot better place.' ___ Associated Press writer Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/europe-us-wwii-battle-of-bulge-6b4d87e4f7b79614e4f8ccb343c81c47	2024-12-13T02:13:54-08:00	
Suspected Chinese spy with business ties to Prince Andrew barred from UK	LONDON (AP) — A suspected Chinese spy with business ties to Prince Andrew has been barred from the U.K. because of concerns he poses a threat to national security. A British immigration tribunal upheld the decision on Thursday in a ruling that revealed the Chinese national had developed such a close relationship with Andrew that he was invited to the prince’s birthday party. Government officials were concerned the man could have misused his influence because the prince was under 'considerable pressure' at the time, according to the ruling. British authorities believe the Chinese national, whose name wasn’t released, was working on behalf of the United Front Work Department, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party that is used to influence foreign entities. The government determined that the businessman 'was in a position to generate relationships between senior Chinese officials and prominent U.K. figures which could be leveraged for political interference purposes by the Chinese State,' according to the tribunal's decision. Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, has been repeatedly criticized for his links to wealthy foreigners, raising concerns that those individuals are trying to buy access to the royal family. Andrew’s finances have been squeezed in recent years after he was forced to step away from royal duties and give up public funding amid concerns about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the American financier and convicted pedophile who committed suicide in prison in 2019. British intelligence chiefs have become increasingly concerned about China’s efforts to influence U.K. government policy. In 2022, Britain’s domestic intelligence service, known as MI5, warned politicians that a British-Chinese lawyer had been seeking to improperly influence members of Parliament for years. A parliamentary researcher was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of providing sensitive information to China. The 50-year-old Chinese national covered by this week’s ruling was described as a man who worked as a junior civil servant in China before he came to the U.K. as a student in 2002. He earned a master’s degree in public administration and public policy at the University of York before starting a business that advises U.K.-based companies on their operations in China. He was granted the right to live and work in the U.K. for an indefinite period in 2013. Although he didn’t make Britain his permanent home, the man told authorities that he spent one to two weeks a month in the country and considered it his 'second home.' He was stopped while entering the U.K. on Nov. 6, 2021, and ordered to surrender his mobile phone and other digital devices on which authorities found a letter from a senior adviser to Andrew confirming that he was authorized to act on behalf of the prince in relation to potential partners and investors in China. The letter and other documents highlighted the strength of the relationship between Andrew, his adviser and the Chinese national. 'I also hope that it is clear to you where you sit with my principal and indeed his family,' the adviser wrote. 'You should never underestimate the strength of that relationship. Outside of his closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on.' The letter went on to describe how they had found a way to work around former private secretaries to the prince and other people who weren’t completely trusted. 'Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor,' the adviser wrote. Andrew lives at the Royal Lodge, a historic country estate near Windsor Castle, west of London.	https://apnews.com/article/prince-andrew-chinese-spy-2908cb7c032e52b706364d86c51b60b9	2024-12-13T01:27:00-08:00	
Japan's ban on recognizing same-sex unions is unconstitutional, a court finds. Here's what to know	TOKYO (AP) — Japan's refusal to recognize same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, a high court ruled Friday, the latest victory for the LGBGQ+ community to add pressure on the reluctant government. Friday’s decision by the Fukuoka High Court in southern Japan marks the eighth victory out of nine rulings since the first group of plaintiffs filed lawsuits in 2019. Here is what to know about the lawsuits, what’s next and what it means to the LGBTQ+ community. Q. What did the court say in the latest ruling? A. In Friday’s ruling, presiding Judge Takeshi Okada noted that the current civil law provisions barring the marriage of same-sex couples violates their fundamental right to the pursuit of happiness guaranteed under Article 13 of the Japanese Constitution. The court also said the ongoing ban violates sections in the Constitution that guarantee equality, individual dignity and the essential equality of both sexes. The judge said there is no longer any reason to not legally recognize same-sex marriage. The government has argued that marriage under civil law does not cover same-sex couples and places importance on natural reproduction. After the ruling, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that the government will monitor pending lawsuits and public opinion. Q. Why is the ruling significant? A. Friday’s ruling is the eighth overall that found the ongoing ban to be unconstitutional or nearly so, against only one district court decision that found it constitutional. It was the third straight high court decision, following rulings this year in Sapporo and Tokyo, that clearly called the current ban unconstitutional. The rulings can still be appealed to the Supreme Court, but lawyers and plaintiffs say the overwhelming 8-1 wins are already enough and the government should quickly take action. Friday’s verdict comes at a time the main obstacle to recognition, Japan’s conservative Liberal Democratic Party, was forced into leading a minority government after its major election loss in October. The LDP is likely to have to compromise more on liberal policies pushed by the opposition parties such as marriage equality, which is largely supported by the general public. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, considered a centrist who has indicated support for same-sex marriage, told a parliamentary session last week he is aware of the sufferings of the same-sex couples and that he will not just 'sit back and do nothing.' His comment raised hope among the LGBTQ+ community and their supporters. It is unclear whether he will act, or how much he could do against resistance within the party. Q. Why are plaintiffs suing? A. More than 30 plaintiffs have joined the lawsuits on marriage equality filed in five regions across Japan since 2019. They argue that civil law provisions barring same-sex marriage violate the Constitutional right to equality and freedom of marriage. Three same-sex couples from Fukuoka and Kumamoto in southwestern Japan are the plaintiffs in Friday’s case. Under Japan’s civil and family laws that recognize marriage only between a man and woman, the privileges and protection that result from matrimony such as inheritance rights, tax and other benefits are limited to heterosexual couples. Same-sex couples seek the same rights to pursue happiness and social recognition as a family. Q. What’s next? Two more high court rulings are pending in Osaka and Nagoya, and are expected in March. Takako Uesugi, a lawyer representing plaintiffs in Tokyo, said Friday that with all three high court rulings in favor of their campaign she has high expectations for the two upcoming decisions. 'We’ll continue fighting until we achieve legalization of same-sex marriage,' she said and urged the government to legalize marriage equality as soon as possible. Q. What is the situation of the LGBTQ+ community in Japan? Though discrimination still exists at school, work and elsewhere, public backing for legalizing same-sex marriage and support among the business community have rapidly increased in recent years. Japan is the only member of the Group of Seven industrialized countries that does not recognize same-sex marriage or provide any other form of legally binding protection for LGBTQ+ couples. The governing LDP, known for its conservative family values and reluctance to promote gender equality and sexual diversity, has stonewalled the campaign. The government enacted a non-binding LGBTQ+ awareness promotion law last year that critics said was watered down. Hundreds of municipalities have introduced non-binding recognition system such as partnership certificates in recent years, which are considered an improvement, but activists say that’s not enough.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-lgbtq-samesex-marriage-ruling-constitution-ldp-a1528f5daf4d642dfa74d61f59953252	2024-12-13T00:32:59-08:00	
China jails former national football coach for 20 years for bribery	BEIJING (AP) — The former coach of the Chinese men's national soccer team has received a 20-year-prison sentence for bribery, Chinese state media reported Friday. Li Tie, who once played in the English Premier League as a midfielder for Everton, was found guilty of 'leveraging his positions' as head coach of the national football and national selection team to receive bribes of more than 50 million yuan (about $7 million), by a court in the city of Xianning in the central Hubei province. Li coached the Chinese men’s team between January 2020 and December 2021. He was also charged with taking bribes between 2015 to 2019, when he worked for local football clubs. The investigation into Li’s conduct began in November 2022. He pleaded guilty to bribery and corruption in March of this year. Li played in England for Everton from 2002 to 2006 and with Sheffield United from 2006-2008. His sentencing is the latest in a series of high-profile corruption cases involving Chinese football. In March, the former president of the Chinese Football Association (CFA), Chen Xuyuan, was sentenced to life in prison for bribery. Earlier this week, three other CFA officials received prison sentences for bribery, according to state media. — EDs: note that this update corrects the former coach's name to Li Tie. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/liu-tie-corruption-20-years-china-football-19bde6b1f7d41466a7bbd9dc3e59f50d	2024-12-12T23:44:48-08:00	
UEFA punishes Serbia for fan misconduct including trying to burn Albania flag	NYON, Switzerland (AP) — UEFA punished Serbia’s soccer federation on Friday for racist acts by fans at two Nations League games, including trying to burn an Albania flag in Switzerland. On Monday, UEFA's executive committee is set to confirm Serbia and Albania as co-hosts of the Under-21 European Championship in 2027. At a Switzerland-Serbia game last month, visiting fans were filmed trying to set light to an Albania flag. The Swiss team, including captain Granit Xhaka, typically fields players with family ties to Albania or Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. UEFA said its disciplinary committee charged the Serbian federation for 'racist and/or discriminatory behavior' in Switzerland on Nov. 15 and at home to Denmark three days later, plus other incidents including fans showing an 'illicit banner.' Serbia’s federation was banned from selling tickets for the team’s next two away games in UEFA competitions, and must close parts of the stadium at two home games. The first parts of the sanctions will apply in March when Serbia faces Austria in a two-leg Nations League promotion playoff. UEFA also imposed fines totaling 173,000 euros ($181,000) with 90,000 euros ($94,000) of that for the discrimination. Serbia’s soccer body has been charged by UEFA and FIFA for repeated fan misconduct including at Euro 2024 in Germany and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/uefa-serbia-albania-fans-discrimination-1e16f2665c873f34ac3763317cb1786d	2024-12-12T23:16:33-08:00	
AP photos capture British royal family's year of illness and recovery	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s royal family is always in the public eye, their every move documented by reporters and captured for posterity by photographers. But even for a group of people who live their lives under a microscope, 2024 was something unique. In a year marked by illness and recovery that sidelined both King Charles III and the Princess of Wales for extended periods, the eyes of the public and the telephoto lenses of the press corps probed every appearance for clues about what was to come. The year began peacefully enough as Charles seemingly got on with the business of being king after celebrating his coronation in 2023 and mourning the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, the previous year. But things became complicated very quickly. In early January, Kensington Palace revealed that the Princess of Wales, usually known as Kate, had undergone planned abdominal surgery, without specifying why the operation was needed. Just 10 days later, Charles was admitted to the same London hospital for treatment of an enlarged prostate. Social media went crazy over Kate’s condition, filling a vacuum of information on specifics with a tsunami of uninformed speculation. Soon both revealed they were suffering from cancer, putting enormous strain on the royal family. With two of the most visible royals out sick — and Prince William taking time off to support his wife — it was challenging for the rest of the family to keep up with the never-ending whirl of public appearances that the British public demands. But both slowly returned to duty after receiving treatment. The public studied the pictures to judge for themselves how the royals were responding. Charles, 76, came back first, marking his return with a visit to a cancer center, where he shared his experiences with patients undergoing chemotherapy. Sometimes seen as stuffy and out of touch, Charles left the clinic as a king who could understand and empathize with those facing illness and the uncertain path to recovery. As the monarch walked out the doors, his face broke into a broad grin and he held a bouquet of pink spring flowers aloft in triumph, celebrating with the crowd that had turned out to wish him well. Underscoring his improvement, Charles took a stamina-sapping trip in October, traveling across 12 time zones to visit Australia and Samoa. Kate’s return took longer. The public got their first post-diagnosis glimpse of the 42-year-old princess through a carriage window as she attended the king’s birthday parade, known as Trooping the Color, in June. Kate also appeared at the national Remembrance Day ceremony honoring fallen servicemen and women in November as well as her annual Christmas carol service in December as she slowly took on more duties. But there’s one picture that captures the princess’ year. It’s from the day in July when Kate attended the Wimbledon men’s singles final, stepping in front of the public for the first time without a hat brim or a window between her and the cameras. The crowd is blurred, and she’s looking over her shoulder. Her smile is huge.	https://apnews.com/article/british-royals-king-charles-kate-2024-photos-43e51383f158c3c4907096cc5de79771	2024-12-12T23:04:51-08:00	
14-year-old stabs a Thai-Australian schoolmate to death in a fight, Thai police say	BANGKOK (AP) — A 14-year-old has been arrested on charges alleging that he stabbed a Thai-Australian schoolmate to death in a fight after having an ongoing feud, police in Thailand said Friday. The suspect told investigators he and the victim harbored a mutual dislike from school and they agreed via the Line messaging app to meet outside a grocery store near their homes on Tuesday in Sattahip in Chonburi province, said police Col. Tanapol Klinkesorn, director of the Sattahip police station. The suspect appeared to have lost the fight because the other boy was bigger, but the suspect rushed to his car to grab a cooking knife and stabbed the victim in the back, Tanapol said. The victim was also 14, but the suspect was an eighth-grader while the victim was a year behind him, police said. They did not release their names because of their age but said the Australian Embassy confirmed the victim had dual nationality. The boy was found lying at the entrance to the store with the knife in his back and its broken handle on the ground, according to Sawang Rojanatham Rescue Foundation, a charity organization whose EMS workers rushed to the scene. Tanapol said the suspect, accompanied by his parents, surrendered to Sattahip police about an hour after the stabbing. Police charged him with causing fatal physical harm to another person and a weapons offense. He was release on 10,000 baht ($295 ) bail Wednesday by the Chonburi Juvenile and Family Court. Police said the maximum sentence under the charges is 15 years’ imprisonment, and that they are investigating the case further. Adolescent violence is not rare in Thailand but fatal cases usually involve rival gangs of older students. Sattahip is about 114 kilometers (71 miles) southeast of the capital Bangkok.	https://apnews.com/article/student-feud-thailland-australia-b31a6bb8cfc9a7a25f4126f226d1f60e	2024-12-12T23:04:02-08:00	
Middle East latest: Blinken urges Mideast nations to support a peaceful Syrian political transition	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is pressing ahead with efforts to unify Middle East nations in support of a peaceful political transition in Syria. He is meeting on Friday with Turkey's foreign minister after talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to try to bring Turkey into a consensus to prevent Syria from collapsing into wider turmoil. It's Blinken's 12th trip to the Mideast since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in Gaza last year but first since the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The outgoing Biden administration is particularly concerned that a power vacuum in Syria could exacerbate already heightened tensions in the region and create conditions for the Islamic State group to regain territory and influence. The fighting between Israel and Hamas has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,800 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war in Gaza was sparked by an Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas in southern Israel in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and around 250 others were taken hostage. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here's the latest: Blinken says there's ‘broad agreement’ between US and Turkey on Syria's future ANKARA, Turkey -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday there was 'broad agreement' between Turkey and the United States on what they would like to see in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar Assad. 'There’s broad agreement on what we would like to see going forward, starting with the interim government in Syria, one that is inclusive and non-sectarian and one that protects the rights of minorities and women' and does not 'pose any kind of threat to any of Syria’s neighbors,' Blinken said in joint statements with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. The insurgent groups that toppled Assad in Syria have not made clear their policy or stance on Israel, whose military in recent days has bombed sites all over the country, saying it is trying to prevent weapons from falling into extremist hands. Blinken also said it was crucial to keep the Islamic State group under control. 'We also discussed the imperative of continuing the efforts to keep ISIS down. Our countries worked very hard and gave a lot over many years to ensure the elimination of the territorial caliphate of ISIS to ensure that that threat doesn’t rear its head again,' Blinken said. The Turkish foreign minister said the two discussed ways of establishing prosperity in Syria and ending terrorism in the country. 'Our priority is establishing stability in Syria as soon as possible, preventing terrorism from gaining ground, and ensuring that IS and the PKK aren’t dominant,' Fidan said, in a reference to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party. Blinken said: 'We’re very focused on Syria, very focused on the opportunity that now is before us and before the Syrian people to move from out from under the shackles of Bashar al-Assad to a different and better future for the Syrian people, one that the Syrian people decide for themselves.' Blinken and Fidan said they had also discussed a ceasefire for Gaza. 'We’ve seen in the last couple of weeks more encouraging signs that (a ceasefire) is possible,' Blinken said. Blinken, who is making his 12th trip to the Mideast since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last year but first since the weekend ouster of Assad, met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan late Thursday. The outgoing Biden administration is particularly concerned that a power vacuum in Syria could exacerbate already heightened tensions in the region, which is already wracked by multiple conflicts, and create conditions for the Islamic State group to regain territory and influence. Later Friday, Blinken is to return to Jordan for meetings on Saturday with Arab foreign ministers and senior officials from the European Union, the Arab League and the United Nations. Turkey to reopen its embassy in Syria ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey has appointed a temporary charge d’affaires to reopen its embassy in Syria, Turkey’s state-run news agency reported. The Turkish Embassy in Damascus had suspended operations in 2012 due to the escalating security problems during the Syrian civil war and embassy staff and their families were recalled to Turkey. The Anadolu Agency said late Thursday that Turkey appointed Burhan Koroglu, its ambassador in Mauritania, to the post. 2 UN aid convoys violently attacked in Gaza, US food agency says UNITED NATIONS- – Two U.N. aid convoys were violently attacked in Gaza, making it virtually impossible for humanitarian agencies to operate without putting staff and civilians at risk, the U.N. food agency says. On Wednesday, a 70-truck convoy from Kerem Shalom was waiting for personnel to safeguard the food and other aid destined for central Gaza when there were reported attacks by Israeli forces in the nearby humanitarian zone, the U.N. World Food Program said Thursday. More than 50 people are now estimated to have died in the attacks, including civilians and local security personnel who had been expected to ensure the convoy’s safety, WFP said. The Rome-based agency said the convoy was forced to proceed from Kerem Shalom to central Gaza without any security arrangements, using the Philadelphi corridor, an Israeli-controlled route that had been recently approved and successfully utilized twice. On the way, WFP said, conflict and insecurity led to a loss of communications with the convoy for more than 12 hours. 'Eventually, the trucks were found but all food and aid supplies were looted,' the U.N. agency said. In a second incident, Israeli soldiers approached a WFP convoy moving out of the Kissufim crossing into central Gaza, fired warning shots, conducted extensive security checks, and temporarily detained drivers and staff, the agency said. 'As the trucks were delayed, four out of the five trucks were lost to violent armed looting,' WFP said. UN chief urges Israel to stop attacks on Syria UNITED NATIONS – The United Nations chief has a message for Israel: Stop the attacks on Syria. Secretary-General António Guterres is particularly concerned about several hundred Israeli airstrikes on several Syrian locations and stresses 'the urgent need to de-escalate violence on all fronts throughout the country,' U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Thursday. The Israeli military said Tuesday it carried out more than 350 strikes in Syria over the previous 48 hours, hitting 'most of the strategic weapons stockpiles' in the country to stop them from falling into the hands of extremists. Israel also acknowledged pushing into a buffer zone inside Syria following last week’s overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The buffer zone was established after Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1973 war. Dujarric said Guterres condemns all actions violating the 1974 ceasefire agreement between the two countries that remains in force. And the U.N. chief calls on the parties to uphold the agreement and end 'all unauthorized presence in the area of separation' and refrain from any action undermining the ceasefire and stability in the Golan Heights, the spokesman said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-13-december-2024-7791d1df688602e790639ed6c2bb0eba	2024-12-12T22:20:52-08:00	
Russia targets Ukrainian infrastructure with a massive attack of cruise missiles and drones	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a massive aerial attack against Ukraine on Friday, firing 93 missiles and almost 200 drones, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, describing it as one of the heaviest bombardments of the country's energy sector since Russia's full-scale invasion almost three years ago. Ukrainian defenses shot down 81 missiles, including 11 cruise missiles that were intercepted by F-16 warplanes provided by Western allies earlier this year, Zelenskyy said. Russia is 'terrorizing millions of people' with such assaults, he said on his Telegram channel, renewing his plea for international unity against Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'A strong reaction from the world is needed: a massive strike – a massive reaction. This is the only way to stop terror,' Zelenskyy said. But uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether vital U.S. military support for Kyiv will continue. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry said the Russian military used long-range precision missiles and drones on 'critically important fuel and energy facilities in Ukraine that ensure the functioning of the military industrial complex.' The strike was in retaliation for Wednesday’s Ukrainian attack using U.S.-supplied the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, on a Russian air base, it said. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Friday’s attack also targeted transport networks and other key facilities. Ukraine’s biggest private energy company, DTEK, said the attack 'seriously damaged' its thermal power plants. Russia has repeatedly attempted to cripple Ukraine's electricity system in an effort to break the will of civilians left in the dark with no running water or heating and to disrupt Ukrainian defense manufacturing. Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said energy workers were doing everything necessary to 'minimize negative consequences for the energy system,' promising to release more details on damages once the security situation allowed it. Ukraine’s air force reported multiple strike drones launched at Ukraine overnight followed by swarms of cruise missiles in the country’s air space. It said Russia also used air-launched ballistic Kinzhal missiles against Ukraine’s western regions. A similar massive attack on Nov. 28 involved about 200 missiles and drones and left more than a million households without power until emergency teams restored supplies. Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia is stockpiling cruise and ballistic missiles for more attacks. On Nov. 21, Russia for the first time used an intermediate range hypersonic ballistic missile to strike an industrial plant in the city of Dnipro, in eastern Ukraine. Putin described the attack with the Oreshnik missile as retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with longer-range Western weapons. He declared that more attacks with the new weapon could follow, and U.S. officials warned Wednesday that the Oreshnik could be used again in coming days. There was no immediate sign one was launched in Friday's attack. Around half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been destroyed during the war, and rolling electricity blackouts are common and widespread. Kyiv’s Western allies have provided Ukraine with air defense systems to help it protect critical infrastructure, but Russia has sought to overwhelm the air defenses with combined strikes involving large numbers of missiles and drones called 'swarms.' Russia has held the initiative this year as its military has steadily rammed through Ukrainian defenses in the east in a series of slow but steady offensives. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-aerial-attack-december-13-2024-801d7ba2438ea021d8568502f803bb3e	2024-12-12T22:19:59-08:00	
China's military is staying silent on its recent activity around Taiwan	BEIJING (AP) — China's military kept silent Friday on its large deployment of naval and coast guard ships off Taiwan this week, with its top spokesperson quoting an ancient strategist instead. Taiwanese officials have said that China was simulating a blockade with one string of ships off the island and a second one farther out at sea, in waters between Japan's Okinawa islands and the northern Philippines. The Chinese Defense Ministry's first public comment on the activity was essentially a no comment. Wu Qian, the ministry's top spokesperson, included a famous quote from 'The Art of War,' an ancient Chinese text on warfare strategy, in his remarks. The quote says military tactics adapt to changing conditions, just as flowing water does. He then said that the military will decide whether to hold an exercise based on its needs and the situation, and that, either way, the country's People's Liberation Army remains committed to opposing Taiwan's independence and to promoting its 'reunification' with China. Taiwan is a self-governing island of 23 million people off China's east coast. The Chinese government claims Taiwan as its territory and says it must come under its control. The United States is embroiled in the dispute because it supports Taiwan's democratic government and is the main supplier of weapons for its defense. China's silence on its military activity this week contrasted with previous drills around Taiwan, which were reported by state media with dramatic graphics and images and seen as a public show of force directed at the island's government. Taiwanese officials described this week's activity as training, since there was no confirmation from China that it was holding drills. They said they were monitoring the training and viewed it as threatening. Taiwan's government was expecting China to conduct drills in response to a recent visit by Taiwan’s president to Hawaii and Guam, an American territory in the Pacific.	https://apnews.com/article/china-taiwan-military-drills-cbff9900138fcd0262464687745c3cf4	2024-12-12T21:10:23-08:00	
Rolling blackouts plague Iran and some suspect bitcoin mining may have a role in the outages	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran’s capital and outlying provinces have faced rolling power blackouts for weeks in October and November, with electricity cuts disrupting people’s lives and businesses. And while several factors are likely involved, some suspect cryptocurrency mining has played a role in the outages. Iran economy has been hobbled for years by international sanctions over its advancing nuclear program. The country's fuel reserves have plummeted, with the government selling off more to cover budget shortfalls as wars rage in the Middle East and Tehran grapples with mismanagement. The demand on the grid has not let up, however — even as Iranians stopped using air conditioners as the weather cooled in the fall and before winter months set in, when people fire up their gas heaters. Meanwhile, bitcoin's value has rocketed to all-time highs after the U.S. election was clinched by Donald Trump. It hit the $100,000 mark for the first time last week, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The surge has led some to suspect that organized cryptocurrency mining — sucking away huge amounts of power — has played a part in the outages in Iran. 'Unfortunately, some opportunistic and exploitative individuals use subsidized electricity, public networks and other resources for cryptocurrency mining without authorization,' Mostafa Rajabi, the CEO of Iran's government-owned power company, said back in August. Iran’s state energy company did not respond to a request for comment. Power outages have come and gone in the past in Iran, which struggles with aging equipment at many of its plants. Over the summer, sustained blackouts struck industrial parks near Tehran and other cities. Then in October and November, rolling power cuts across Tehran's neighborhoods became the norm in daylight hours. Climate change has been blamed in part, with persisting droughts and less water running through Iranian hydroelectric dams. Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered several power plants to stop burning mazut, a high-polluting heavy fuel common in the former Soviet Union countries. Tehran has used it in the past to make up the difference in electricity generation. Fuel reserves, both in diesel and natural gas, also remain low even though Iran is an OPEC member and home to one of the world's second-largest reserves of natural gas, behind only Russia. There's been no explanation for the decision to keep those reserves low, though critics have suggested Iran likely sold the fuel to cover budget shortfalls. For his part, Pezeshkian has said that he must 'honestly tell the public about the energy situation.' 'We have no choice but to consume energy economically, especially gas, in the current conditions and the cold weather,' he said in mid-November. 'I myself use warm clothes at home; others can do the same.' Still, winter heating isn't in full swing quite yet on Tehran — raising questions where the power is going. In many poor and densely populated neighborhoods across the country, people have access to free, unmetered electricity. Mosques, schools, hospitals and other sites also receive free power. And with electricity in general sold at subsidized rates, bitcoin processing centers have boomed. They require immense amounts of electricity to power specialized computers and to keep them cool. Determining how much power is used up by mining is difficult, particularly as miners now use virtual private networks that mask their location, said Masih Alavi, the CEO of an Iranian-government-licensed mining company called Viraminer. Also, miners have been renting apartments to hide their rigs inside of empty homes. 'They distribute their machines across several apartments to avoid being detected,' Alavi said. In 2021, one estimate suggested Iran processed as much as $1 billion in bitcoin transactions. That value likely has spiked, given bitcoin's rise. Meanwhile, Iran's blackouts began in earnest as bitcoin spiked from around $67,000 to over $100,000 in its historic rally. Rajabi, the state electricity company CEO, said his firm would offer rewards of $725 for people to report unlicensed bitcoin farms. The farms have caused 'an abnormal increase in consumption, disruptions, and problems in power networks,' Rajabi said. The amount of power used by some 230,000 unlicensed devices is equivalent, he said, to the entire power needs of Iran's Markazi province — one of the country's chief manufacturing sites. Iranian officials and media have not linked bitcoin's surge and the ongoing blackouts but the public has, with social media users resharing a video showing a massive bitcoin farm earlier this year uncovered in Iran. A voice off camera asks how it was possible the electrical company did not discover the farm sooner. The U.S. Treasury and Israel have targeted bitcoin wallets that they’ve alleged are affiliated with operations run by Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard to finance allied militant groups in Mideast war zones. That suggests the Guard itself — one of the most-powerful forces within Iran — may be involved in the mining. In contrast, Iranian media nearly every day report on individual mining operations being raided by police. Iran may see bitcoin as a hedge against increased pressure from the incoming Trump administration and as regional allies are engulfed in turmoil, said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'The question for the economists inside Iran is do we trust this enough to fund the government,' said Nephew, who has long worked on Iran issues and sanction strategies in the U.S. government. However, he cautioned against thinking of bitcoin as a magic bullet for Iran, particularly as bitcoin wallets can be targeted in sanctions. 'A pattern of behavior screams out to intelligence services,' Nephew said. 'It screams out to bank compliance departments.' ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Ukraine's reformed military procurement agency drives the country's NATO ambitions	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s Defense Ministry unveiled a new state agency for its armed forces last year. It was the government's answer to the rampant corruption within the ministry's procurement companies, and meant to be a driver of reform on the elusive path toward NATO membership. The enterprise, in charge of purchasing nonlethal military goods such as food, clothes and fuel, has already contracted 95% of the products requested for supply, and saved 25% in the process, says Arsen Zhumadilov, the CEO of the State Logistics Operator, known by the local abbreviation DOT. Soon, he says, DOT also will begin procuring drones. It's an example of the type of reform that Ukraine hopes will help clear the path toward NATO, a key deterrent against Russia, officials have argued. Membership in the alliance remains largely a political question, with key states reluctant to grant it, fearing escalation from Moscow. Western officials are also keenly awaiting the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump before making declarations. But NATO officials have also demanded widespread anti-graft reforms before Kyiv can join. Change has been a difficult pill for many within Ukraine’s post-Soviet institutions to swallow. DOT's promising results so far stand in contrast to the deeply-rooted challenges that continue to plague the tenure of Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, including slow progress with restructuring the institution and ongoing allegations of corruption within lethal military procurement. Western officials are closely monitoring DOT, three Western diplomats told The Associated Press. So far, they have been pleased with the results one year since it was formed. They spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak freely about their assessments. DOT embodies the uneasy coexistence of a digital-savvy youthful ethos and paper-heavy post-Soviet bureaucracy. Its office exudes a fresh startup culture vibe, while catering to one of the most stubbornly rigid ministries in the country. The contrast underscores the spirit of how Russia's war in Ukraine is being fought, in which innovative drone wars coincide with World War II-style trenches. 'We understand that we have been on the radars of NATO, of G7 (Group of Seven) countries, of all NATO member countries in terms of whether we manage or not to put in place a procurement system that is resilient, that is effective, efficient, and that is not prone to corruption,' Zhumadilov said. Nonlethal military purchases became the focus of two corruption scandals under the leadership of Oleksii Reznikov, the previous defense minister. The first involved inflated prices for food supplies and the other was connected to low-quality winter jackets. Umerov, Reznikov’s successor, has described DOT as not just a new agency, but as the beginning of a new public procurement architecture in Ukraine’s defense sector. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy specifically tasked Umerov to increase transparency in defense procurement where corruption has always been rife. Zhumadilov, an influential public figure with Crimean Tatar origins known for spearheading reforms in public procurement, was selected because of his previous track record of success. He previously headed Ukraine's procurement of medical supplies. Plastered on the wall of the agency is a mood board devised by the company's marketing department. A photo of a military vehicle is placed next to a snaking jungle dirt road, a drone in flight next to a fluffy puppy in midair, a Rubik's Cube and a designer candle. Staff wear oversized hoodies and T-shirts, a contrast to the military fatigues adorned by ministry officials. DOT’s answer to increasing transparency is DOT-Chain, an IT system that manages the army’s supply demands by digitizing the entire process, from the submission of applications to issuing invoices. Developed by a team of DOT IT specialists, it could reduce delivery time fourfold and is the largest digital project in the institution. For now it will cover foodstuff, but Zhumadilov envisions scaling it up. There were blips on the road. A planned merger with the Defense Procurement Agency, the state company in charge of purchasing lethal military supplies, was aborted after NATO officials recommended against it, casting Umerov’s decision-making in negative light. Acknowledging that corrupt practices in defense purchases has plagued Ukraine for years, Umerov has said the state needed to eliminate the 'Soviet, oligarchic' approach to public funds. But, like most things in the war, that is easier said than done. Zhumadilov said their company still faces resistance from ministry officials set in their old ways. 'We are trying to be open to our colleagues at Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but at the same time, and this is also good news, we are an autonomous agency within a larger ecosystem, we can preserve our own culture here.' DOT-Chain, which was designed to lower the burden of army paperwork, for instance, still faces pushback from bureaucrats who prefer signing thousands of papers per week to clicking a smartphone. 'They say that we don’t need that. We just want to keep on signing papers,' he said. 'We are saying, ‘Look, the sheer amount of papers that you are signing on a weekly basis … it is just unsustainable.’' ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-nato-reforms-military-procurement-f0483561c9d402697d7a67dd43ae844d	2024-12-12T20:06:37-08:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mixed, follow Wall St decline as price data disappoint	HONG KONG (AP) — World shares were mixed on Friday following Wall Street's decline in response to potentially discouraging data on the economy. The future for the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.3% and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%. European markets opened mixed as investors assessed the European Central Bank’s Thursday rate cut decision. Germany’s DAX added 0.2% to 20,465.58, while the CAC 40 in Paris edged 0.1% lower to 7,416.55. Britain's economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% month-on-month in October, following a 0.1% decline in September, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. The drop was driven by declines in construction and production, while the dominant services sector remained stagnant. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.2% to 8,326.93. In Asia, Chinese leaders wrapped up a two-day economic policy meeting in Beijing on Thursday. Investors were hoping for major moves to support the economy, but the readouts from the closed-door meetings of top leaders lacked details. State media reported that leaders agreed to increase government borrowing to finance more spending and to ease credit to encourage more investment and spending. 'Chinese authorities have been stuck in a more reactionary policy mode, as the uncertainty of U.S. tariff plans makes it difficult for policymakers to make any commitments just yet,' Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a commentary. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong sank 2.1% to 19,971.24, and the Hang Seng Properties index lost 2.7%. The Shanghai Composite index skidded 2% to 3,391.88. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 1% to 39,470.44. A survey by the Bank of Japan showed that business sentiment among large Japanese manufacturers was stronger than expected in the fourth quarter of this year, though overall the results were lackluster. Elsewhere, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed 0.4% to 8,296.00. South Korea’s Kospi added 0.5% to 2,494.46. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.5% to 6,051.25, marking its fourth loss in the last six days. The index had been rallying toward one of its best years of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5% to 43,914.12, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.7% to 19,902.84. A report said more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected. A separate update, meanwhile, showed that inflation at the wholesale level, before it reaches U.S. consumers, was hotter last month than economists expected. Neither report rings warning bells, but they did dilute hopes that the Federal Reserve will keep cutting interest rates. That expectation has driven the S&amp;P 500 to 57 all-time highs so far this year, driven by the fact that inflation has been slowing while the economy is solid enough to stay out of a recession. Traders are widely expecting the Fed will ease its main interest rate at its meeting next week. That would be a third straight cut by the Fed after it began lowering rates in September from a two-decade high. It’s hoping to support a slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower rates would give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, but they could also provide more fuel for inflation. A cut next week would have the Fed following other central banks. The European Central Bank cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday, as many investors expected, and the Swiss National Bank cut its policy rate by a steeper half of a percentage point. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 14 cents to $70.16 per barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gained 12 cent to $73.53 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 153.25 Japanese yen from 152.55 yen. The euro fell to $1.0472 from $1.0468.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-inflation-rates-44ade1d46d9dc7ed714934238e810f65	2024-12-12T19:51:12-08:00	
Environmental groups condemn new laws threatening soybean restrictions in Brazil's Amazon	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Dozens of environmental nonprofits issued a manifesto Thursday condemning new laws in Brazilian states that threaten to dismantle the Amazon soy moratorium — a landmark voluntary agreement banning trade in soybeans from recently deforested areas. The 18-year-old moratorium stipulates that traders and oil producers refrain from buying soybeans grown on land cleared after 2008. The deal gathered strange bedfellows, ranging from environmental groups Greenpeace and WWF to U.S. commodity giants Cargill, Bunge and ADM. However, new laws recently enacted in the Amazon states of Mato Grosso, Brazil’s largest soybean producer, and neighboring Rondonia have cut tax incentives for processing and trade companies that adhere to the agreement. Two other states and Brazil´s Congress are weighing similar legislation. 'This means penalizing companies committed to ending deforestation, promoting the continued expansion of agribusiness in Amazon forest areas, creating subsidies for deforestation and discriminating against the granting of tax incentives based on companies’ environmental commitment,' Thursday's declaration stated. 'Therefore, those who are more ambitious in environmental protection lose the incentive,' said the manifesto whose 67 signers include Greenpeace, WWF and Climate Observatory, a network of 119 organizations watching federal climate policy in Brazil. The document argues soybean production grew exponentially in the Amazon under the moratorium as it expanded into pasture land. Its area jumped from 1.6 million hectares (4 million acres) in 2007 to 7.28 million hectares (18 million acres) in 2022, according to a moratorium report. The manifesto also calls for the companies that operate in Mato Grosso and Rondonia to maintain their commitment to the agreement even though it means losing millions of dollars in tax incentives — a tough decision for small and middle-sized companies. Researchers have found the moratorium is helping to preserve the Amazon forest. A 2020 study in the journal Nature Food found that the agreement, in combination with public policies, contributed to the steepest reduction of deforestation recorded in Brazil, between 2003 and 2016 In a written response, the government of Mato Grosso said it enacted the law because the moratorium is harsher than Brazil´s legislation, which already has 'the world’s strictest environmental regulations.' It also stated that most of the state is covered by original rainforest trees and plants. 'We challenge these nonprofits to name any state, in any country, that is a major food producer and preserves 60% of its territory,' the statement said. —- The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The last Titanic salvage expedition was in 2010. Will there be any more?	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — The company that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic said Thursday that it hasn't settled on plans to retrieve more artifacts from the shipwreck, potentially cooling down a legal battle with the U.S. government. The Georgia-based company, RMS Titanic Inc., wrote in a court filing that it won't visit the wreck in 2025 and is still considering the legal and financial implications of future salvage operations. The court-recognized steward of Titanic artifacts since 1994, RMST has recovered thousands of items from silverware to a piece of the ship’s hull, which millions of people have seen through exhibits. The U.S. has been warning RMST for years that entering the Titanic’s severed hull — or disturbing the wreck — would violate a 2017 federal law and a corresponding agreement with Great Britain. Both regard the site as a memorial to the more than 1,500 people who died when the ocean liner struck a North Atlantic iceberg in 1912. The firm's last salvage expedition was in 2010, before the law and agreement took effect. But in recent years, RMST has submitted plans before a federal admiralty court in Virginia to recover more artifacts, drawing the ire of the U.S. government. RMST has previously challenged the constitutionality of U.S. efforts to 'infringe' on its salvage rights to a shipwreck in international waters. And it has argued that only the admiralty court has jurisdiction over the matter. The recent legal disputes between RMST and the U.S. government have played out as the world's most famous shipwreck rapidly deteriorates on the ocean floor — and as tragedy unfolded. Last year's implosion of the Titan submersible claimed five lives, including RMST’s director of underwater research, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, RMST's stated its position regarding future expeditions on Thursday at the admiralty court's direction. A federal judge has been considering a legal challenge by the U.S. to restrict RMST's activities at the site. The U.S. filed its challenge last year when RMST initially planned to take images inside the sunken ship's hull and pluck items from the surrounding debris field. RMST also said it would possibly recover freestanding objects from the room where the Titanic broadcast its distress calls. The company ultimately scaled back its dive plans, stating that it would only take external images. That was because of Nargeolet's death in the Titan implosion. The experimental craft was operated by a separate company, OceanGate, to which Nargeolet was lending his expertise. Nargeolet was supposed to lead the RMST expedition. After RMST revised its dive plans, the U.S. stopped trying to block that particular expedition, which occurred over the summer. But the U.S. told the court it wanted to leave the door open to challenging subsequent expeditions. Specifically, the government said it may still pursue its motion to intervene as a party in RMST’s salvage case. The U.S. asked the court to delay ruling on the motion until the company announced future salvage plans. The firm said Thursday that it needs more time to make a decision on any upcoming operations. RMST also said it opposes the U.S.'s motion to intervene. U. S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith presides over Titanic salvage matters at the federal court in Norfolk, Virginia. She said during a March hearing that the U.S.’s case against RMST would raise serious legal questions. Congress is allowed to modify maritime law, Smith said in reference to regulating entry into the Titanic. But the judge questioned whether Congress can strip courts of their own admiralty jurisdiction over a shipwreck, something that has centuries of legal precedent. In 2020, Smithgave RMST permission to retrieve and exhibit the radio that had broadcast the Titanic’s distress calls. The U.S. government challenged the expedition in court. The legal battle never played out. RMST indefinitely delayed those plans because of the coronavirus pandemic.	https://apnews.com/article/titanic-salvage-expedition-rms-legal-battle-ea56ab68995738d82184f4be41ac2a95	2024-12-12T13:25:38-08:00	
Syria faces crisis and Gaza heads toward famine, World Food Program official says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The deputy executive director of the U.N. World Food Program has been on whirlwind visits to hotspots in the Middle East and Sudan to assess dire humanitarian situations and escalating demands for food from millions of people trapped or fleeing conflicts. But Carl Skau said in an interview with The Associated Press this week that the Rome-based agency has been forced to make major cuts to the numbers of people it can help because of a lack of funding. WFP is working to diversify its funding, including targeting the private sector, but Skau said, 'it’s going to be a tough time ahead, no doubt, with increasing gaps.' 'Needs continue to rise, and the funding does not even remain stable at the levels we have currently,' he said. ‘A triple crisis’ in Syria Syria is facing the fallout from a 13-year civil war, the surge in arrivals from the recent Israel-Hezbollah war in neighboring Lebanon, and rebels unexpectedly ousting longtime leader Bashar Assad, Skau said. Even before Lebanon and the end of the Assad family’s more than 50-year rule, he said 3 million people were acutely food insecure and very hungry. But the agency was only providing food aid to 2 million because of funding cuts. Now, Skau said, 'it’s a triple crisis, and the needs are going to be massive.' While the situation in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, is 'quite calm and orderly,' he said there is still uncertainty in the capital, Damascus, where markets are disrupted, currency values have dropped, food prices are going up and transport isn’t working. This means a bigger humanitarian response in the short term. In the next phase, the U.N. will be focusing on Syria’s recovery and ultimately its reconstruction, Skau said. Gaza is heading toward famine Skau says the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza is dire but he’s equally worried about southern Gaza, 'if not even more,' because of the million or so people on the beach north of Khan Younis as winter approaches. In northern areas, where the U.N. estimates there are still 65,000 Palestinians and no aid has arrived for more than two months, Skau said Israeli military operations, lawlessness and taking of food aid have prevented access to the needy. He said some humanitarian convoys have gotten through to the broader northern area including Gaza City, where the U.N. estimates some 300,000 people are located. In the south, Skau said, WFP assisted around 1.2 million people in June, July, August and into September. In October and November, only one-third of that number — 400,000 Palestinians — got aid. At the same time, the entry of essential commercial goods was very little compared with the summer months, Skau said. He blamed the limited number of entry points and the inability to move food to WFP warehouses as well as the 'total breakdown of civil and public order.' Skau said international famine experts reported three weeks ago that if nothing changed there would be famine in Gaza, 'and I think that’s where we’re heading.' Sudan is the world’s largest humanitarian crisis The needs are overwhelming: 25 million people in war-torn Sudan are acutely food insecure, with famine declared in the huge Zam Zam camp for the displaced in western Darfur. Skau cited progress over the past month in getting clearances to deliver aid across conflict lines and the border from Chad. And with roads drying up at the end of the rainy season, WFP is able to deliver 'much more food.' One convoy reached Zam Zam camp and two others were on the way but have been held up because of fighting in the past 10 days in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, Skau said. It is the only capital in Darfur still held by Sudanese forces. The others are held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including western Darfur. WFP reached some 2.6 million people this month, Skau said, stressing that the international community should have done more to address the Sudan crisis 'and needs to do more going forward.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-gaza-world-food-program-06f429a71dee5f11779d8cce94e810fb	2024-12-12T13:14:37-08:00	
China's Xi is likely to decline Trump's inauguration invitation, seeing it as too risky to attend	WASHINGTON (AP) — Chinese leader Xi Jinping would likely see President-elect Donald Trump’s invitation to attend his inauguration as too risky to accept, and the gesture from Trump may have little bearing on the increasingly competitive ties between the two nations as the White House changes hands, experts say. Trump’s incoming press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed on Thursday that Trump extended an invitation to the Jan. 20 ceremony. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said it had no information to provide. But experts don't see Xi coming to Washington next month. Why wouldn't Xi attend? 'Can you imagine Xi Jinping sitting outdoors in Washington, D.C., in January at the feet of the podium, surrounded by hawkish members of Congress, gazing up at Donald Trump as he delivers his inaugural address?' said Danny Russel, who previously served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Russel, now vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Xi would not allow himself to 'be reduced to the status of a mere guest celebrating the triumph of a foreign leader — the U.S. president, no less.' Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank, said Beijing will play it safe when there's no protocol or precedent for a Chinese leader to attend the inauguration of a U.S. president. 'I don't think the Chinese will take the risk,' Sun said. There could be risks in the guest list, for example, Sun said, noting that Taiwan's top diplomat in the U.S. attended the swearing-in of President Joe Biden in 2021. Beijing considers Taiwan to be Chinese territory and has repeatedly warned the U.S. that it is a red line not to be crossed. Should Trump slap tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods upon taking office as he's threatened, Xi would look like a fool if he had chosen to attend, and that's unacceptable to Beijing, Sun said. Rather, Chinese officials are known for their obsession with the dignity and security of their leader when traveling abroad, said Russel, who has negotiated high-level summits with the Chinese. 'They have always demanded that any leader trip to Washington be treated as a full ‘state visit’ with all the bells and whistles,' Russel said. What's ahead for U.S.-China relations? But it should be expected that planning is underway for Trump and Xi to meet in person soon, Russel said. Trump prefers in-person meetings with foreign leaders, especially key adversaries, and Beijing might believe it can get a better deal by dealing directly with Trump, Russel said. Trump's return to the White House is expected to further intensify the U.S.-China rivalry. He has picked several China hawks for his Cabinet, including Sen. Marco Rubio as the secretary of state and Rep. Mike Waltz as the national security adviser. Beijing has adopted a 'wait-and-see' approach but says it is prepared to hit back should Washington raise tariffs on Chinese goods or make other unfriendly moves. Sun of the Stimson Center cautions that Trump's invitation does not exclude hostile policies toward China. Trump visited China in 2017 and 'played nice,' but the following year he launched the trade war, she said. 'We've seen this before,' Sun said. 'For Trump, there's no contradiction between carrot and stick. For China, that's a contradiction. It will add to China's desire to play safe, not to be played by Trump, whether it is a friendly or a hostile message.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-xi-china-inauguration-invitation-a0fbde24ca2ccafa9a953813955d532f	2024-12-12T12:27:12-08:00	
An Argentine tourist is shot in head in Rio after mistakenly driving into low-income community	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — An Argentine tourist was shot in the head and chest Thursday in Rio de Janeiro after he mistakenly drove his car into a low-income community, police said. He was reportedly using a GPS device to make his way to the Christ the Redeemer statue. Gastón Fernando Burlon, 51, was taken to Hospital Souza Aguiar, where he is in serious condition, according to Rio's health secretariat. Burlon is a former tourism secretary for the Argentine city of Bariloche and is the president of the Argentine Chamber of Student Tourism. Burlon was driving with his wife and daughter through the Morro dos Prazeres, a hillside favela dominated by criminal gang Red Command, when he was attacked, police said in a statement. 'Preliminary information given by officers in the case suggest that the wounded man was surprised by gunshots made by armed criminals as he mistakenly entered,' police said. In 2016, Italian tourist Roberto Bardella was killed in the same region after he got lost. He and his friend Rino Polato, who was found unharmed, were touring South America on motorcycle. An Argentine tourism ministry official told the Associated Press the country's government is following the case and has sent a staffer to provide assistance to Burlon and his family. The source said the medical team is trying to stabilize Burlon so he can undergo surgery. The source spoke under condition of anonymity due to a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly. ____ AP journalist Nayara Batschke contributed to this report from Buenos Aires. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentinian-tourist-shot-rio-de-janeiro-6b4a2ecd869d36444a2901b152674881	2024-12-12T12:24:35-08:00	
Protesters hold a noisy demonstration against Serbia's populist leadership	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Hundreds of protesters led by university students on Thursday held a noisy rally outside Serbia's state television headquarters despite the country's president pledging to fulfil all their demands as he faced one of the most challenging threats to his populist rule. The demonstration is part of wider protests that erupted after the fall of a concrete canopy in the northern city of Novi Sad last month, killing 15 people. Blowing whistles, booing and jeering, the protesters said they are angry the state RTS television is carrying President Aleksandar Vucic's accusations that the students were paid from the West and elsewhere to hold protests to overthrow his government. The protesters brought sacks allegedly holding bundles of money in front of the downtown RTS station in the country's capital, Belgrade. The station has been accused of spreading the nationalist pro-government narrative for years. Classes at more than 40 university faculties throughout Serbia have been suspended for days. Many in Serbia blame the deadly collapse on rampant corruption in the country that led to sloppy renovation work on the station building in Novi Sad — part of a wider deal with Chinese state companies involved in a number of infrastructure projects in the Balkan country. The canopy collapse has became a flashpoint for broader dissatisfaction with the president's growingly autocratic rule, reflecting public demands for democratic changes. Almost daily protests have been held since Nov. 1 in Novi Sad, Belgrade and other cities, which sometimes turned violent. Vucic announced at a news conference on Wednesday evening that documentation regarding the renovation of the Novi Sad railway building would be made public, as students have requested. Prosecutors have launched an investigation and detained 13 people. But a government minister has been released, fueling widespread speculation over the probe as ruling populists also control both police and the judiciary. As Vucic spoke on Wednesday, hundreds of students also blew whistles and horns outside the presidency building, which could be heard in the live coverage of the address. The students on Thursday said they also want the thugs who attacked peaceful protesters arrested. 'We came to give back the money,' one of the students told the crowd as they symbolically left improvised money bags outside the television building. 'You can hand them (bags) to the president and tell him that we want a public apology.'	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-protest-roof-collapse-students-d5fefbb6efdefc5ecc76ce4fdb34dfbb	2024-12-12T11:38:07-08:00	
Israeli strike in Gaza kills 25 people as US makes new push for a ceasefire	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli airstrike hit the central Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing at least 25 Palestinians and wounding dozens more, Palestinian medics said, as U.S. President Joe Biden’s two top national security officials were in the region making a renewed push for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire. The strike on a multistory residential building in the Nuseirat refugee camp was just the latest in a series of Israeli attacks throughout Gaza that killed at least 54 Palestinians since late Wednesday night. Palestinian officials at two of Gaza's remaining medical centers, Al-Awda Hospital in the north and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the center, reported together receiving 25 bodies from the Nuseirat strike — which also wounded 40 people, most of them children. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the deadly strike. Israel is trying to eliminate Hamas, which led the attack on southern Israel in October 2023 that sparked the war in Gaza. The Israeli military says Hamas militants hide among Gaza’s civilian population. The U.N. General Assembly's member nations approved a new resolution this week demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, although they do reflect world opinion — the vote Wednesday was 158-9, with 13 abstentions. Israel strikes all across Gaza Photos from the scene in Nuseirat sent to journalists showed a completely collapsed building with people walking through its mangled and charred remains, smoke rising from piles of belongings strewn over the rubble. Palestinian rescuers were searching for more bodies trapped beneath the rubble. The strikes Thursday evening came as Palestinian medics were still surveying the morning’s deadly toll of fierce Israeli attacks, including on Nuseirat camp. Palestinian medical officials had reported at least 28 people killed earlier in the day, including seven children and a woman. One of the strikes flatted a house in Nuseirat, according to Al-Aqsa Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the bodies were taken. Two other strikes killed 15 men who were part of local aid coordination committees set up by displaced Palestinians and the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, according to health officials at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. Eight of the men were killed in an attack near the southern border town of Rafah and the remaining seven were killed by a strike in Khan Younis. The committees aim to establish secure aid convoys, which often face challenges such as looting, hoarding and profiteering in their efforts to deliver humanitarian supplies to Palestinians facing the risk of famine. Israel says it allows enough aid to enter and blames U.N. agencies for not distributing it. The U.N. says Israeli restrictions, and the breakdown of law and order after Israel repeatedly targeted the Hamas-run police force, make it extremely difficult to operate in the territory. In Gaza's isolated and devastated north, Awda Hospital said an orthopedic doctor, Saeed Jouda, was shot in the head and killed Thursday morning. The Health Ministry said the doctor was killed by an armed quadcopter drone as he was traveling from Kamal Adwan Hospital to treat patients at Awda Hospital. The two medical facilities are in northern towns where Israel has waged a blistering offensive against Hamas militants since early October, allowing in almost no humanitarian aid and ordering tens of thousands to flee to nearby Gaza City. Experts have warned that the north may be experiencing famine. Biden administration makes final push for a Gaza ceasefire The latest bombardment came as Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, was holding official meetings in Israel as signs emerge that long-stalled negotiations between Israel and Hamas could regain momentum. On Thursday, Sullivan revived hopes for a deal, telling reporters in Jerusalem that Israel’s ceasefire in Lebanon has helped clear the way for another deal to end the war in Gaza. Sullivan plans to travel next to Qatar and Egypt, key mediators in the ceasefire talks, as the Biden administration makes a final push on negotiations before Donald Trump is inaugurated. Sullivan said 'Hamas’ posture at the negotiating table did adapt' after Israel decimated the leadership of its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon and reached a ceasefire there. 'We believe it puts us in a position to close this negotiation,' he said. Last month, the U.S. vetoes a Security Council resolution demanding an immediate Gaza ceasefire, objecting that the resolution did not link the truce to an immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas. The council’s 14 other members supported the resolution. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,800 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in the war in Gaza. The International Criminal Court found there were reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu and his former defense minister bear responsibility for the war crime of starvation and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. ___ Associated Press writers Samy Magdy in Cairo and Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report. ____ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-12-12-2024-a39e98286d8d270b6e81608a3d17fa4a	2024-12-12T11:18:17-08:00	
North Korean nationals indicted in scheme using IT workers to funnel money for weapons programs	ST. LOUIS (AP) — Fourteen North Korean nationals have been indicted in a scheme using information technology workers with false identities to contract with U.S. companies — workers who then funneled their wages to North Korea for development of ballistic missiles and other weapons, the head of the FBI office in St. Louis said Thursday. The scheme involving thousands of IT workers generated more than $88 million for the North Korean government, Ashley T. Johnson, special agent in charge of the St. Louis FBI office, said at a news conference. In addition to their wages, the workers stole sensitive information from companies or threatened to leak information in exchange for extortion payments, Johnson said. Victims included defrauded companies and people whose identities were stolen from across the U.S., including Missouri, Johnson said. The indictments were filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in St. Louis. All 14 people face wire fraud, money laundering, identity theft and other charges. Most of those accused are believed to be in North Korea. Johnson acknowledged that bringing them to justice will be difficult. To help, the U.S. Department of State is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to any of the suspects. Federal authorities said the scheme worked like this: North Korea dispatched thousands of IT workers to get hired and work remotely or as freelancers for U.S. companies. The IT workers involved in the scheme sometimes used stolen identities. In other instances, they paid Americans to use their home Wi-Fi connections, or to pose in on-camera job interviews as the IT workers. Johnson said the FBI is going after those 'domestic enablers,' too. 'This is just the tip of the iceberg,' Johnson said. 'If your company has hired fully remote IT workers, more likely than not, you have hired or at least interviewed a North Korean national working on behalf of the North Korean government,' Johnson said. The Justice Department in recent years has sought to expose and disrupt a broad variety of criminal schemes aimed at bolstering the North Korean regime, including its nuclear weapons program. In 2021, the Justice Department charged three North Korean computer programmers and members of the government’s military intelligence agency in a broad range of global hacks that officials say were carried out at the behest of the regime. Law enforcement officials said at the time that the prosecution highlighted the profit-driven motive behind North Korea’s criminal hacking, a contrast from other adversarial nations like Russia, China and Iran that are generally more interested in espionage, intellectual property theft or even disrupting democracy. In May 2022, the State Department, Department of the Treasury, and the FBI issued an advisory warning of attempts by North Koreans 'to obtain employment while posing as non-North Korean nationals.' The advisory noted that in recent years, the regime of Kim Jong Un 'has placed increased focus on education and training' in IT-related subjects. In October 2023, the FBI in St. Louis announced the seizure of $1.5 million and 17 domain names as part of the investigation. The indictments announced Tuesday were the first stemming from the investigation. Johnson urged companies to thoroughly vet IT workers hired to work remotely. 'One of the ways to help minimize your risk is to insist current and future IT workers appear on camera as often as possible if they are fully remote,' she said. Officials didn’t name the companies that unknowingly hired North Korean workers.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-it-workers-indictments-7beb2f611489da09fe36ee14736b28b9	2024-12-12T11:09:58-08:00	
Chanel appoints designer Matthieu Blazy as new artistic director	PARIS (AP) — One of the most prestigious roles in global fashion has just been filled, as Chanel appointed Franco-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy as its new artistic director, the fashion house announced Thursday. The 40-year-old will oversee all collections for the world's second biggest luxury brand starting in 2025, replacing Virginie Viard, who parted ways with the house earlier this year. Blazy arrives with a reputation for innovation and craftsmanship, honed through stints at Raf Simons, Maison Margiela and Céline under Phoebe Philo. Most recently, he was creative director at Bottega Veneta. Chanel President Bruno Pavlovsky praised his 'audacious' and 'powerful' approach, adding that Blazy would 'play with the codes and heritage of the House' to take it in 'exciting new directions.' 'I am thrilled and honored,' said Blazy. Critics have noted that Blazy’s relatively young age suggests Chanel may be positioning him for a long tenure, akin to the 36 years Karl Lagerfeld spent at the helm. His appointment marks only the fourth designer in Chanel’s over 100-year history to lead the house, following Lagerfeld, Viard, and founder Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel. Viard, who succeeded Lagerfeld after his death in 2019, left earlier this year after more than three decades with the brand — an abrupt departure, announced in the middle of the night just weeks before the couture show. For a house known for meticulous image execution, the announcement felt unusually unpolished. Later, it was revealed that Viard would not oversee her final couture presentation, with her team stepping in to handle the collection. During her tenure, Viard achieved record sales for Chanel, reaching $19.7 billion last year. But her time was not without controversy. Critics often cited her collections as lacking the theatrical flair of Lagerfeld’s era, and backlash to a poorly received mid-season show in Marseille added pressure. Her appointment was initially viewed as temporary. Critics say that Blazy’s arrival signals a new chapter for Chanel, blending heritage with modernity as the house looks to the future. Chanel’s Global Executive Chairman Alain Wertheimer and CEO Leena Nair described Blazy as 'one of the most gifted designers of his generation.'	https://apnews.com/article/chanel-designer-blazy-lagerfeld-382cdb8761153f7c74981535e36c0f50	2024-12-12T10:54:45-08:00	
Greece launches emergency inquiry into the alleged assault of an Egyptian minor at a migrant camp	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — A prosecutor from Greece’s Supreme Court on Thursday launched an emergency inquiry into the alleged beating and sexual assault of a 16-year-old Egyptian boy at a migrant camp outside Athens. Four other Egyptians housed at the facility aged 16, 17, 18 and 21 have been arrested in connection with the alleged assault at the state-run refugee facility in Malakasa, west of the Greek capital, police said. The four male suspects were detained on charges of sexual assault and causing grievous bodily harm, according to authorities. Greek Migration Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos, described the incident as 'deeply abhorrent,' while his deputy, Sofia Voultepsi, announced an investigation into security procedures at the camp’s area for unaccompanied minors. Voultepsi said the number of unaccompanied minors from Egypt in Greece was rising due to the activity of criminal gangs active in neighboring Libya. Under Greek regulations, unaccompanied minors who arrive in the country illegally are not subject to deportation. 'Out of the total of 2,588 unaccompanied minors currently (registered) in the country, 1,341 — so more than half — are Egyptian,' Voultepsi told private Skai television. 'These children are taken from impoverished villages in Egypt,' she said. 'Criminals take them to Tobruk in Libya. According to testimonies we have, they are often beaten and mistreated in camps there and with the intention of involving them in criminal activity.'	https://apnews.com/article/greece-migrants-migration-assault-egypt-libya-43619869409ed8dd911550398721d566	2024-12-12T08:33:46-08:00	
Zimbabwe's president once faced the death penalty and is now set to abolish it	HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Zimbabwe’s Senate has approved a bill to abolish the death penalty, a key step in scrapping a law last used in the southern African nation nearly 20 years ago. Zimbabwe's Parliament said Thursday that the bill was passed by senators the night before. The death penalty will be abolished if it is signed by the president, which is likely. The southern African country uses hanging, and last executed someone in 2005, partly because at one point no one was willing to take up the job of state executioner, or hangman. President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe's leader since 2017, has publicly spoken of his opposition to capital punishment. He has cited his own experience of being sentenced to death — which was later changed to 10 years in prison — for blowing up a train during the country's war of independence in the 1960s. He has used presidential amnesties to commute death sentences to life in prison. Amnesty International, which campaigns against the death penalty, urged Mnangagwa to sign the bill into law 'without delay' and commute death sentences. Zimbabwe has more than 60 prisoners currently on death row. According to Amnesty, about three-quarters of countries in the world no longer carry out the death penalty. Zimbabwe is one of more than a dozen in Africa and more than 50 across the world that have the death penalty enshrined in law without any official moratorium on it. Amnesty International said it recorded 1,153 known executions globally in 2023, up from 883 the previous year, although countries that carried out executions declined from 20 to 16. Due to a veil of secrecy, the figures do not include those from North Korea, Vietnam and China. China is the 'world’s lead executioner' where thousands of people are believed to have been executed, Amnesty said in a report released in October. Iran and Saudi Arabia accounted for almost 90% of all executions recorded by Amnesty in 2023. The United States recorded an increase from 18 executions in 2022 to 24 in 2023. Last year, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and the U.S. recorded the most executions, in that order. Zimbabwe is among four African countries alongside Kenya, Liberia and Ghana that have recently taken 'positive steps' towards abolishing the death penalty, Amnesty said. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/death-penalty-abolition-law-parliament-175391cdbbf7456247e27f09105a8ae7	2024-12-12T07:58:47-08:00	
Wander Franco's sex abuse trial has been postponed 5 months	PUERTO PLATA, Dominican Republic (AP) — The trial against Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco, who has been charged with sexually abusing a minor, sexual and commercial exploitation against a minor, and human trafficking, was postponed on Thursday and scheduled to resume June 2, 2025. Dominican judge Yacaira Veras postponed the hearing at the request of prosecutors because of the absence of several key witnesses in the case. Franco’s lawyers asked the court to reconsider the postponement, arguing Franco must report to spring training in mid-February. The judge replied that Franco is obligated to continue with the trial schedule, continue his conditional release from detainment and not leave the country. Documents that prosecutors presented to the judge in July and were viewed by The Associated Press alleged that Franco, through his mother Yudelka Aybar, transferred 1 million pesos (about $17,000) to the mother of the minor on Jan. 5, 2023, to consent to the abuse. The mother of the minor has been charged with money laundering and is under house arrest. Prosecutors say the minor’s mother went from being a bank employee to leading an ostentatious life and acquiring assets using the funds she received from Franco. During raids on the house of the minor’s mother, prosecutors say they found $68,500 and $35,000 that they allege was delivered by Franco. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/wander-franco-trial-mlb-rays-2cba7436c3dee91ecebea60773942abf	2024-12-12T07:50:55-08:00	
Paraguay reopens its embassy in Jerusalem, handing Israel a rare diplomatic victory	JERUSALEM (AP) — The small South American nation of Paraguay reopened its embassy in Jerusalem on Thursday, becoming the latest of just a small handful of countries to recognize the bitterly contested city as Israel’s capital. The move marks a welcome diplomatic victory for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has watched Israel’s international isolation deepen as the devastating war in Gaza drags on. Paraguay first relocated its embassy to Jerusalem in 2018 under the pro-Israel government of then-President Horacio Cartes but reversed its decision months later when a new administration came to power. The decision of President Santiago Peña, a protégé of Cartes who has followed in his mentor's footsteps, to reopen the Jerusalem embassy makes Paraguay the first country to make the move since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack last year triggered the war. The fate of Jerusalem is one of the most intractable disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It’s also a controversial move. Israel views the entire city as its unified capital, while the Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Israel annexed east Jerusalem, home to the Old City, with holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in 1967 in a move that was not recognized by the international community. Most countries run their embassies out of Tel Aviv. Paraguay now joins the United States, Honduras, Guatemala, Kosovo and Papua New Guinea as countries that have stationed their embassy in Jerusalem. Spirits were high at the ceremony marking the embassy’s inauguration Thursday, with Netanyahu and Israel’s new Foreign Minister, Gideon Saar, lavishing praise on President Peña. 'My good friend Santiago,' said Netanyahu, addressing Peña. 'We’re a small nation. You’re a small nation. We suffered horrible things but we overcame the odds of history…we can win and we are winning.' 'Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. It will always be the capital of Israel,' Netanyahu said. 'That will never change.' The ceremony came as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has brought a wave of condemnation on Israel, undermining its international standing. The world’s top war-crimes court issued arrest warrants last month for Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza. The Israeli offensive has so far killed over 44,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry which does not say how many are combatants. The warrants turn Netanyahu and Gallant into internationally wanted suspects, putting them at risk of arrest when they travel abroad. Nevertheless, Peña invited Netanyahu to visit Paraguay. Netanyahu hung a Jewish mezuzah, a small scroll containing verses from the Torah, on the doorway of the new Paraguayan embassy. Israel's top diplomat, Saar, said Israel and Paraguay shared a 'friendship based not only on interests but also values and principles.' He said he would soon visit Asunción, Paraguay's capital, with a delegation from the Israeli private sector. He and Paraguayan Foreign Minister Rubén Ramírez Lezcano signed a series of bilateral agreements at the ceremony. Peña thanked Netanyahu and said he looked forward to future collaboration with Israel. 'This is very important for you. We recognize that this is a very strong statement,' Peña said. 'Israel is going to win, and the countries (that) are standing next to Israel, we are going to win.' Despite a tiny Jewish community, far smaller than neighbors Argentina and Brazil, landlocked Paraguay has become one of Israel’s closest allies in Latin America. The other countries in the region to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Guatemala and Honduras, have similarly strong evangelical churches. Evangelicals, many of whom see Israel’s existence connected to biblical prophecy, are among the Israeli government's most hawkish supporters. In the U.S., conservative evangelicals have long inspired the Republican Party’s pro-Israel advocacy. Paraguay's conservative leadership has sought to curry favor with former and future U.S. President Donald Trump by strengthening its alliance with Israel as well as Taiwan — two causes célèbres of Republicans. Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ramírez Lezcano was among the first foreign dignitaries to meet with Trump following his November election victory. Earlier this year, Peña hosted Sen. Marco Rubio — Trump’s pick to become Secretary of State — in what marked the first visit by a U.S. senator to the landlocked country in four decades. The ascension of Peña to the presidency in 2023 helped revive Paraguay's strong ties with Israel years after his predecessor, Mario Abdo Benitez, shuttered Paraguay's Jerusalem embassy and prompted Israel to retaliate by temporarily closing its own in Asunción. Under former President Cartes, a powerful cigarette tycoon sanctioned by the Biden administration for corruption, Paraguay immediately followed Trump's move to relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and break with decades of policy that the city's status should be decided in peace talks. ___ Associated Press writers Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Josh Goodman in Miami contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-paraguay-embassy-jerusalem-capital-pena-netanyahu-ec4249a657d841a1e4ccd3e3b6edd574	2024-12-12T07:39:39-08:00	
Ontario to restrict electricity exports to US and bar American-made alcohol if Trump tariffs applied	TORONTO (AP) — Canada’s most populous province may bar American-made alcohol in addition to restricting electricity exports to Michigan, New York State and Minnesota if President-elect Donald Trump imposes sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products, a senior official said Thursday. The official in Ontario Premier Doug Ford's government said it is contemplating restricting Ontario's liquor control board — the largest alcohol purchaser in the world and the main retailer in the province — from buying American-made alcohol. Ontario is also considering restricting exports of critical minerals required for electric vehicle batteries and preventing U.S.-based companies from the government's procurement process, the official said, speaking on condition on anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the potential measures. Ford confirmed on Wednesday evening that Ontario is contemplating restricting electricity exports to Michigan, New York State and Minnesota. He reiterated that on Thursday and said it would make electricity unaffordable for Americans. 'It’s a last resort,' Ford said. 'I don’t think President-elect Trump wants that to happen. We're sending a message to the U.S. If you come and attack Ontario, you attack livelihoods of people in Ontario and Canadians, we are going to use every tool in our tool box to defend Ontarians and Canadians. Let's hope it never comes to that.' Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the United States from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. Ontario powered 1.5 million homes in the U.S. in 2023 and is a major exporter of electricity to Michigan, Minnesota and New York. 'That's okay if he that does that. That's fine,' Trump told CNBC when asked about Ford's remarks on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 'The United States is subsidizing Canada and we shouldn't have to do that,' Trump added. 'And we have a great relationship. I have so many friends in Canada but we shouldn't have to subsidize a country. We're subsidizing more than a $100 billion dollars a year. We shouldn't have to be doing that.' The CNBC reporter said off camera Trump told him they hope they can work something out with Canada. Canada supplies more oil to the U.S. than any other country. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. 'If you put a 25% tariff on oil from Alberta that increases every gallon of gasoline by one dollar,' said Ford, who is chairman of a council of premiers for Canada’s 10 provinces and three territories. Canada sold $170 billion worth of energy products last year to the U.S. It also has 34 critical minerals and metals the Pentagon is eager for. Ontario's Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said after Wednesday's meeting with the premiers that a number of provincial premiers voiced support for a robust response to the tariffs, including critical minerals being exported to the U.S. Freeland did not mention oil but said 'obviously other ideas were discussed as well' when asked if Canada is considering cutting off oil exports to America. About a third of Canada’s trade to the U.S. is energy. Nearly 3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Canada has promised more border security spending to address Trump’s border concerns. Ford said that will include more border and police officers, as well as drones and sniffer dogs. Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, who along with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago recently, said they plan to share details of those border plans with the incoming Trump administration in the coming days. At the dinner, Kristen Hillman, Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., said America’s trade deficit with Canada was also raised. Hillman said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. is energy exports and prices have been high. Trudeau said this week that U.S.-imposed tariffs would be 'absolutely devastating' for the Canadian economy, but it would also mean real hardship for Americans. Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for goods such as food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and others. The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington-based trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate. Canada imposed duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canadian officials have said it is unfair to lump Canada in with Mexico. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. The U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with irregular migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024, compared to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-us-trump-tariffs-c5d740bed83d71a230194ca28be02100	2024-12-12T07:37:58-08:00	
Funeral for activist turns into call for justice for other missing Syrians	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Hundreds of Syrians marched through central Damascus in a funeral procession Thursday to honor one of the country's most prominent anti-government activists, whose body was found after the ouster of President Bashar Assad. The procession for Mazen al-Hamada — unimaginable only a week earlier — turned the moment of mourning into a call for justice, with marchers carrying posters of other missing detainees and chanting for Assad to be put on trial. The capture of Damascus by insurgents last weekend brought thousands of people into the streets in celebrations, and Thursday’s march recalled the funerals-turned-protests of the early days of the uprising against Assad 13 years ago. 'We will not forget your blood, Mazen,' the marchers, most of them young people, chanted outside a mosque while family and friends held funeral prayers inside. Others chanted: 'We will get our revenge, Bashar. We will bring you before the law.' Al-Hamada joined the anti-government protest movement in its early days and was arrested several times. Released after a long detention in 2013, he left Syria for the Netherlands. There, he became a well-known figure and symbol of the anti-Assad movement, speaking publicly about the torture he endured in prison. Still, he returned to Syria in 2020 — apparently lured by promises of safety — and immediately disappeared. His family found him Tuesday in a hospital morgue. By the condition of his body, al-Hamada, who was in his late 40s, appeared to have been killed only in the past week, his family said. Tens of thousands of Syrians are still seeking information about the fate of loved ones who disappeared under Assad's police state. Many have swarmed prisons and detention facilities in their searches. Dozens of bodies have been found in morgues, some emaciated, and others with wounds that suggest they were tortured. The rebels and the transitional government have called for any information that would help identify secret prisons. In Thursday’s procession, supporters, protesters and family members carried al-Hamada’s body from al-Mujtahid mosque toward a mosque in central Damascus’s al-Hijaz Square. At Abu Awf Mosque, several family members of those still missing joined. Many participants said they last protested in Damascus 13 years ago, before Assad’s brutal crackdown on protesters turned the conflict into full-blown civil war. Mohammad Kulthum, 32, marched in the procession with his mother. 'I could not have imagined going out in a rally in any way, shape or form in Damascus.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-activist-funeral-a275b1cb50b7638d1dc0ff5a56e673e6	2024-12-12T07:32:50-08:00	
2 men deny charges of helping Hong Kong gather intelligence in UK	LONDON (AP) — Two men accused of helping Hong Kong authorities gather intelligence in the U.K. pleaded not guilty Thursday to violating Britain's National Security Act. Chung Biu Yuen, 64, and Chi Leung Peter Wai, 39, are accused of agreeing to undertake information gathering, surveillance and acts of deception likely to assist a foreign intelligence service. Yuen was the office manager of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London and Wai had worked as a U.K. Border Force officer. They had previously pleaded not guilty to a charge of foreign interference for allegedly breaking into a home in the U.K. Wai had also denied a count of misconduct in a public office for allegedly searching Home Office databases without justification when working as a border officer. The two, who are free on bail, face a March 10 trial in London’s Central Criminal Court. Officials in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese control in 1997, have voiced concerns over the charges. Beijing officials strongly criticized the case. A case against a third suspect, Matthew Trickett, an immigration enforcement officer, was discontinued after he was found dead in a park in May. A prosecutor said Trickett attempted suicide after he was charged. Authorities said his death was not considered suspicious.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-hong-kong-spying-charges-5d13785e808bae5d6dc2b8b804a3e264	2024-12-12T07:03:08-08:00	
NATO chief warns that Putin wants long-term confrontation with Europe after Ukraine	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to 'wipe Ukraine off the map' and could come after other parts of Europe next, as he urged Europeans to press their governments to ramp up defense spending. 'It is time to shift to a wartime mindset,' Rutte told security experts and analysts at the Carnegie Europe think-tank in Brussels. He said people should gird themselves for the prospect that Russia might try to use 'swarms of drones' in Europe as it has to deadly effect in Ukraine. Putin 'is trying to crush our freedom and way of life,' Rutte said. The former Dutch prime minister listed Russia’s attacks on Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, and the all-out invasion launched almost three years ago. 'How many more wake-up calls do we need? We should be profoundly concerned. I know I am,' he said. 'Russia is preparing for long-term confrontation. With Ukraine, and with us.' Rutte’s inaugural speech came just over two months after he took office as NATO’s top civilian official. He has since toured the capitals of the 32 allies, including a visit to NATO's most important member, the United States to meet with President-elect Donald Trump. NATO has been a staunch backer of Ukraine and has helped most of its members funnel weapons, ammunition and other support into the country. But Trump’s return, and pledge to end the war quickly, has fueled concern that an unfavorable truce might be forced on Ukraine. Asked by the Associated Press how damaging a quick and shoddy peace agreement might be, Rutte said that 'a bad deal means Putin coming out on top, and that will have worldwide ramifications, not only on Europe and Ukraine.' He insisted that Ukraine must be involved in any peace talks. Trump routinely complains that U.S. allies in NATO are not spending enough on defense. Rutte said Russia’s military spending is likely to amount to 7 to 8% of its GDP next year -– far more than any NATO ally –- while its defense industry churns out tanks, armored vehicles and ammunition. Putin also has the support of allies like China, Iran and North Korea. Rutte noted that defense spending has risen sharply in Europe, with 23 allies expected to reach NATO’s target of putting 2% of GDP into their military budgets. But he added: 'I can tell you, we are going to need a lot more than 2%.' Rutte listed a series of recent 'hostile actions' by Russia against NATO allies, including cyber-attacks, assassinations, an explosion at a Czech ammunition depot, the jamming of radars in the Baltic region to disrupt air traffic, and the 'weaponization' of migrants to destabilize Europe. 'These attacks are not just isolated incidents. They are the result of a coordinated campaign to destabilize our societies and discourage us from supporting Ukraine,' he said. 'They circumvent our deterrence and bring the front line to our front doors.' Beyond increased defense spending in Europe, Rutte noted that NATO now has tens of thousands of troops on high readiness should they be needed to defend allied territory. 'With all this, our deterrence is good -– for now. But it’s tomorrow I’m worried about,' he said, and warned that 'we are not ready for what is coming our way in four to five years. Danger is moving towards us at full speed.' 'What is happening in Ukraine could happen here too, and regardless of the outcome of this war, we will not be safe in the future unless we are prepared to deal with danger,' Rutte added. Rutte appealed to governments to provide the defense industry with 'the big orders and long-term contracts they need to rapidly produce more and better capabilities.' He urged the industry to boost production for defenses against drones and other new war tactics. He added that 'freedom does not come for free' to the estimated 1 billion people living in the Euro-Atlantic area. 'If we don’t spend more together now to prevent war, we will pay a much, much, much higher price later to fight it. Not billions, but trillions of euros. That’s if we come out on top, and that’s if we win,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/nato-russia-ukraine-defense-spending-industry-8a84361c3827081da3f1308851cb19dd	2024-12-12T06:27:55-08:00	
Concern over Syria's chemical weapons stockpile triggers emergency meeting of global monitor	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The global chemical weapons watchdog opened an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the situation in Syria over concerns about the country’s stockpile of toxic chemicals in the wake of the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on Monday told Syria that it is under obligations to comply with rules to safeguard and destroy dangerous substances, such as chlorine gas, after rebels entered the capital, Damascus, over the weekend. 'Chemical weapons have been used in Syria on multiple occasions and victims deserve that perpetrators that we identified be brought to justice and held accountable for what they did and that investigations continue,' Fernando Arias González, the OPCW secretary general, said in his opening remarks. 'Our reports over the past few years have reached very clear conclusions and we hope that the new circumstances in Syria will allow this chapter to be closed soon,' he added, referring to the lack of stockpile declarations and the use of the weapons themselves. Assad’s government has denied using chemical weapons but the OPCW found evidence indicating their repeated use by Syria in the grinding civil war. Earlier this year, the organization found the Islamic State group had used mustard gas against the town of Marea. In a rare move, the OPCW's executive council called the meeting, hoping that under a new government, some of its 80 inspectors may be allowed to pursue investigations into Syria's chemical weapons program. Members of the ousted Syrian government plan to gradually transfer power to a new transitional Cabinet headed by Mohammed al-Bashir, who reportedly headed the rebel alliance’s 'salvation government' in its southwest Syrian stronghold. Arias González also expressed concern about ongoing Israeli airstrikes in Syria. 'We do not know yet whether these strikes have affected chemical weapons related sites. Such airstrikes could create a risk of contamination. Another real risk would be the destruction of valuable evidence for investigations by different independent international bodies related to past use of chemical weapons,' the Spanish diplomat said. The last time the OPCW called an extraordinary meeting was in 2018, in response to the chemical attack on Douma, a town close to Damascus, when some 40 people were killed by poison gas. Last year the watchdog found that the Syrian Armed Forces dropped canisters of chlorine gas during a major military operation. Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 to ward off the threat of airstrikes in response to a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus. The OPCW’s 193 member states are required to disclose their chemical weapons programs and dismantle them. The organization, created in 1997 by the Chemical Weapons Convention, seeks to eliminate all chemical weapons. In 2013, it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its work.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-chemical-weapons-opcw-stockpiles-chlorine-assad-e195ca88035fc2ae1feb9e9106191329	2024-12-12T06:01:14-08:00	
Trump invites China's Xi to his inauguration even as he threatens massive tariffs on Beijing	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration next month — extending a diplomatic olive branch even as Trump threatens to levy massive tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump's incoming press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed on Thursday that Trump invited Xi, but said it was 'to be determined' if the leader of the United States' most significant economic and military competitor would attend. 'This is an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of countries that are not just our allies, but our adversaries and our competitors too,' Leavitt said in an appearance on Fox News' program 'Fox &amp; Friends.' 'We saw this in his first term. He got a lot of criticism for it, but it led to peace around this world. He is willing to talk to anyone and he will always put America’s interest first.' CBS News first reported the invitation to Xi. Asked at a Chinese Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday about Trump's invitation, spokesperson Mao Ning responded: 'I have nothing to share at present.' Leavitt said that other foreign leaders have also been invited, but did not provide any details. The move by Trump to invite a leader of an adversarial nation to the American moment that is Inauguration Day is unorthodox. But it also squares with his belief that foreign policy—much like a business negotiation—should be carried out with carrots and sticks to get the United States' opponents to operate closer to his administration's preferred terms. Jim Bendat, a historian and author of 'Democracy’s Big Day: The Inauguration of Our President,' said he was not aware of a previous U.S. inauguration attended by foreign head of state. 'It's not necessarily a bad thing to invite foreign leaders to attend,' Bendat said. 'But it sure would make more sense to invite an ally before an adversary.' Trump on Thursday during an appearance at the New York Stock Exchange, where he was ringing the opening bell to open the market, said he’s been 'thinking about inviting certain people to the inauguration' without referring to any specific individuals. 'And some people said, ‘Wow, that’s a little risky, isn’t it?’' Trump said. 'And I said, ‘Maybe it is. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens.’ But we like to take little chances.' Meanwhile, a top aide to Hungarian President Viktor Orban, one of Trump's most vocal supporters on the world stage, said Thursday that Orban isn't slated to attend the inauguration. 'There is no such plan, at least for the time being,' said Gergely Gulyás, Orban's chief of staff. The nationalist Hungarian leader is embraced by Trump but has faced isolation in Europe as he's sought to undermine the European Union's support for Ukraine, and routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc’s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion. Orban recently met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Every country's chief of mission to the United States will also be invited, according to a Trump Inaugural Committee official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The invitation comes as Trump has vowed to enact massive tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China to get those countries to do more to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States. He has said that, on his first day in office in January, he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada and that China could be hit with even higher tariffs. China produces precursor chemicals used in the production of fentanyl, but Beijing has stepped up efforts over the last year to crack down on the export of the chemicals. 'We’ve been talking and discussing with President Xi, some things, and others, other world leaders, and I think we’re going to do very well all around,' Trump said in a CNBC interview Thursday. Xi during a meeting with President Joe Biden last month in Beijing urged the United States not to start a trade war. 'Make the wise choice,' Xi cautioned. 'Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other.' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also pushed back on Trump's threats, warning such a tariffs move would be perilous for the U.S. economy as well. Trudeau earlier this week said that Americans 'are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive' and said he will retaliate if Trump goes ahead with them. Trump responded by calling Canada a state and Trudeau the governor. In addition to the tariff dispute, U.S.-China relations are strained over other issues, including what U.S. officials see as Beijing indirectly supporting Russia's war on Ukraine. The Biden administration says China has supported Russia with a surge in sales of dual use components that help keep its military industrial base afloat. U.S. officials also have expressed frustration with Beijing for not doing more to rein in North Korea's support for the Russian war. China accounts for the vast majority of North Korea’s trade. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has dispatched thousands of troops to Russia to help repel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk border region. The North Koreans also have provided Russia with artillery and other munitions, according to U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials. Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration takes place a day after the U.S. deadline for ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of social media giant TikTok, to sell the social media app or face a ban in the United States. — Associated Press writer Balint Domotor in Budapest, Hungary, contributed reporting.	https://apnews.com/article/china-xi-trump-inauguration-d654da01f90bf3bec071bb9890ffbd29	2024-12-12T05:25:10-08:00	
Rescue group saves 11-year-old girl floating alone in the Mediterranean for days after shipwreck	MILAN (AP) — An 11-year-old girl from Sierra Leone was found floating in the Mediterranean Sea off Italy’s southernmost island of Lampedusa, believed to be the only survivor of a shipwrecked migrant boat that had departed from the port of Sfax in Tunisia, a humanitarian group said Thursday. The girl was saved by a German-flagged sailboat named Trotamar III, which brought her to Lampedusa on Wednesday morning, according to the German charity Compass Collective that has been operating in the Mediterranean Sea since August 2023. She had neither food nor water with her, and was suffering from hypothermia. 'It was an incredible coincidence that we heard the voice of a girl even though the motors were running,’’ the sailboat’s captain, Matthias Weidenluebbert, said in a press statement. The crew immediately cut the engines and searched for the source of the voice, Compass Collective's Katja Tempel, told The Associated Press 'She was exhausted and tired and cold, but in general, she was fine when we fetched her out of the water.' According to the girl’s account, she had floated in the sea for three days using innertubes inflated with air and a lifejacket. She told rescuers that she had set out in a metal boat with about 45 others, and that she had been in contact with two other people until two days before the rescue, when the contact was broken. 'We don’t know what happened to the people,'' Tempel said. 'We assume that they all drowned, but we don’t know what.' The girl was found following a storm that had lasted for days, with winds reaching more than 23 knots and waves above 2.5 meters (8 feet.) The Totamar III, a 13-meter vessel with a rotating crew of six, joined humanitarian rescue efforts in August 2023, rescuing more than 230 people to date. After picking up the girl, the boat distributed life jackets to 53 people aboard a wooden boat without a motor, and reported their location to Italian authorities. In all, the Totamar III crew has assisted 1,700 people, handing out life jackets, alerting authorities and staying with them until rescue arrives. In cases when the situation worsens, the stranded people are transferred on board the sailing ship. According to U.N. statistics, which are based largely on survivor accounts, 1,536 people have died or gone missing and are presumed dead in the central Mediterranean so far this year. A total of 64,234 have reached Italy through Thursday, according to the Italian Interior Ministry. That's down by 58% from last year, when 153,211 had arrived in the period. 'I want to emphasize, this girl is just a sign for the (deaths) in the Mediterranean,'' Tempel said. 'She's one person, and its very sad that she probably lost her relatives. But it is just a symbol for the tragedy that is happening.' ___ This story has been corrected to show that the first name of the rescue group's member is Katja, not Katya. ___ Murru reported from Rome.

Syria's new authorities say they've secured the release of an American pilgrim imprisoned by Assad	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — An American citizen who disappeared seven months ago into former Syrian President Bashar Assad’s notorious prison system was suddenly discovered Thursday outside Damascus after being released and handed over to rebel forces, Syria’s new authorities said. The political affairs office of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that led the lightning offensive to topple Assad’s government, said the group had secured the release of U.S. citizen Travis Timmerman. In interviews with media in Syria, Timmerman said he was imprisoned after crossing from Lebanon into Syria on a Christian pilgrimage. He appeared to be among the thousands of people released from Syria's sprawling military prisons this week after rebels reached Damascus, overthrowing Assad and ending his family’s 54-year rule. 'We affirm our readiness to cooperate directly with the U.S. administration to complete the search for American citizens disappeared by the former Assad regime,' the group said, adding that a search was underway for Austin Tice, an American journalist who went missing in Syria 12 years ago. As footage emerged online Thursday of Timmerman, looking disheveled and disoriented as rebels led him out of a family's home near Damascus, some initially mistook him for Tice. In the video, Timmerman could be seen lying on a mattress under a blanket. A group of men in the video said that he was being treated well and would be safely returned home. A Syrian family told The Associated Press they found Timmerman barefoot on a main road in the countryside of Damascus early on Thursday. He appeared cold and hungry so they brought him back to their home. 'I fed him and called a doctor,' said Mosaed al-Rifai, the 68-year-old waste collector who first found Timmerman. Al-Rifai said it was hard to communicate because of the language barrier but it seemed Timmerman had been held by an internal security agency. A few hours after al-Rifai discovered him, rebels arrived at the family’s house to pick him up, he said. Mouaz Mostafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based nonprofit group, said he met Timmerman at the house and arranged for a car to take him to Damascus, where the new authorities gave the ex-detainee food and water and brought him clothes and shoes. Timmerman had lice in his long, unkempt hair, Mostafa said, and reported walking for 13 miles barefoot before being discovered. Timmerman — now recovering until the rebels can figure out how to hand him to U.S. authorities — was planning to get to Jordan after his release to obtain a new passport, Mostafa said. Earlier this year, a Missouri State Highway Patrol bulletin identified him as 'Pete Travis Timmerman,' 29, and said he had gone missing in Hungary in early June. In late August, Hungarian police put out a missing persons announcement for 'Travis Pete Timmerman,' saying he was last seen at a church in Hungary’s capital, Budapest. Authorities in Missouri and Hungary had shared photos of a young man who strongly resembles the ex-prisoner who identified himself as 'Travis Timmerman' in interviews with international news outlets on Thursday. Missouri court records indicate Timmerman is from Urbana, Missouri, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Springfield in the southwestern part of the state. A graduation list from Missouri State University shows he earned his bachelor’s degree in finance in the spring of 2017. Timmerman’s mother, Stacey Collins Gardiner, told National Public Radio that he returned home to Urbana after working in Chicago for a couple of years. He then left for Budapest with the goal of writing about his Christian faith and helping people, she said. Timmerman had warned her, she added, that his travels might make communication difficult. After losing contact with him during his stay in Hungary, Gardiner later learned that her son had gone to Lebanon. On Thursday, she heard that he was found through the media. 'I will hug him. ... And then I probably won’t let him go,' she said, laughing. 'I’ll say, well, thank God you’re still alive. And I’m so happy. Our prayers came true.' U.S. officials said they were working to confirm Timmerman's identity and provide the support. From Aqaba, Jordan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that the White House was 'working to bring him home, to bring him out of Syria' but declined further comment for privacy reasons. Timmerman, with a scraggly beard and grey sweatshirt, later spoke with the Al-Arabiya TV network, saying he had illegally crossed into Syria on foot from the eastern Lebanese town of Zahle seven months ago before being detained and held in a cell alone. He said that he was treated well in detention, but could hear other young men being tortured. 'It was OK. I was fed. I was watered. The one difficulty was that I couldn’t go to the bathroom when I wanted to,' he said. He said he was only allowed to go three times a day. 'I was not beaten and the guards treated me decently,' he added. Washington's top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens, traveled to Lebanon earlier this week in hopes of collecting information on the whereabouts of Tice. President Joe Biden has said his administration believed Tice was alive and was committed to bringing him home, though he also acknowledged on Sunday that 'we have no direct evidence' of his status. The case has frustrated U.S. intelligence officials for years. On Thursday, Blinken emphasized the administration’s work on Tice's case. 'Every single day we are working to find him and to bring him home' Blinken said. 'This is a priority for the United States.' Tice, who has had his work published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and others, disappeared at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus in August 2012 as the Syrian civil war intensified. A video released weeks after Tice went missing showed him blindfolded and held by armed men. He hasn't been heard from since. Assad's government had denied that it was holding him. ___ Follow the AP's Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-war-assad-news-12-12-2024-832bd669d118305bd773a26c29893207	2024-12-12T02:25:22-08:00	
A pro-democracy ex-lawmaker in Hong Kong has been convicted of rioting during 2019 protests	HONG KONG (AP) — A Hong Kong judge on Thursday convicted a pro-democracy former lawmaker of rioting during mob violence at a subway station at the height of the city’s anti-government protests in July 2019. Prosecutors accused Lam Cheuk-ting of provoking a group of about 100 men armed with wooden poles and metal rods who attacked protesters and bystanders at a train station. The men, all clad in white shirts, in contrast with the black worn by protesters, claimed to be protecting their homeland in Yuen Long, a residential district in Hong Kong's New Territories. Dozens of people, including Lam, were injured in the violence, a key chapter that escalated the protest movement as the public criticized police for their delayed response. The landmark ruling could shape the city's historical narrative of the incident. Judge Stanley Chan ruled that Lam was not acting as a mediator as he had claimed, but rather was trying to exploit the situation for political gain. He said Lam's words directed at the white-shirted men had 'fanned the flames.' Lam, who is already in prison on a national security charge, is expected to be sentenced at a later date. Chan was still reading out the verdicts for six other lesser-known co-defendants in the same case. The prosecution alleged the seven defendants had either berated the white-shirted men, used obscene hand gestures, hurled objects or shot jets of water by pointing a hosepipe at them. The defendants had pleaded not guilty to the rioting charge. During the trial, Lam said he chose to go to Yuen Long because he hoped his then position as a lawmaker could pressure the police to act quickly. He said he could not leave the scene while fellow residents were in danger. Some defendants who targeted the white-shirted men with a hosepipe argued that they were just trying to stop the attackers from advancing. The 2019 protests were sparked by a proposed extradition law that would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to the mainland for trial. The government withdrew the bill, but the protesters widened their demands to include direct elections for the city’s leaders and police accountability. The social movement was the biggest challenge to the Hong Kong government since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In response, Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020, leading to the arrest of many activists. Others were silenced or went into exile. In November, Lam was sentenced to six years and nine months in jail in the city's biggest national security case. More than 10,000 people were arrested in connection to the protests for various crimes, such as rioting and participating in an unauthorized assembly. About 10 white-shirted men were convicted in other cases related to the mob violence in July 2019, local media reported.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-riot-verdicts-lam-cheukting-0fc782d0aa375faf8f8c3f91995a9f8f	2024-12-12T00:40:37-08:00

AP photos from Ukraine in 2024 convey wartime horror and hope	A man falls to his death from the window of a burning apartment after a Russian air strike. Two girls in pink tutus join a ballet class in a bomb shelter. The grisly evidence of war is everywhere in Ukraine, where, for a third year, soldiers and civilians are enduring the Russian army’s onslaught. AP photographers have traveled across the country, capturing the agony and the life-affirming joy witnessed in the conflict. Bombs and missiles have turned residential neighborhoods into fiery infernos, while relentless attacks have destroyed homes, hospitals and schools. Evacuations in front-line areas tear apart Ukrainian communities. The elderly are wrenched away from their longtime homes and neighbors. AP photos have evoked the grief and the poignancy of funerals for fallen soldiers and for families killed by the Russian shelling. Open coffins, including those of children, provide a glimpse of the tragedy. The United Nations accuses Russia of numerous human rights violations in Ukraine. They include aiming at civilian targets, devastating attacks on Ukraine’s power grid, and the forced transfer and deportation of children. By the end of October, the UN estimated that the war had killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians and injured almost 27,000. Despite the suffering and hardship, civilians carry on with some everyday activities that wouldn’t be out of place in peacetime. In northeastern Ukraine, about 20 young girls assemble for ballet lessons at the Princess Ballet Studio, where the windowless room doubles as a bomb shelter amid almost hourly air raids. Children leap into the water at Kyiv’s Liko Diving School. Another boy looks thoughtful as he learns chess strategy from an elderly man in one of the Ukrainian capital’s public parks. Clowns perform at a children’s hospital. Young people wave their arms and dance at a festival concert featuring an active serviceman in Ukraine’s Hroza battalion.

Hardest-hit Nigeria is latest African country to provide malaria vaccine to young children	BAYELSA, Nigeria (AP) — Ominike Marvis has lost count of the number of times her 6-year-old son has had malaria. So when Nigeria started offering a malaria vaccine, she was eager to protect her youngest child. She took the 6-month-old baby to get his first shot at a health center in hard-hit Bayelsa state, where the country's vaccination campaign kicked off last week. The vaccine aims to prevent severe illnesses and deaths from the mosquito-borne disease. 'At least I know he’s safe from it now,' Marvis, 31, said. Africa accounts for the vast majority of malaria in the world. Nigeria, the continent's most populous country, has the biggest burden with about a quarter of the cases. According to a World Health Organization report released Wednesday, there were an estimated 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths worldwide last year, mostly in children under 5. That is 11 million more malaria cases compared to 2022 with nearly the same number of deaths. 'No one should die of malaria, yet the disease continues to disproportionately harm people living in the African region, especially young children and pregnant women,' said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, calling for more support. There are now 17 countries giving new malaria vaccines to young children, the WHO report said. Nigeria began its campaign last week, offering a vaccine developed by Oxford University. Research suggests it is more than 75% effective at preventing severe disease and death in the first year and that protection is extended for at least another year with a booster. Nigeria’s health minister, Muhammad Ali Pate, called the vaccination campaign a 'monumental step' in the country’s efforts to eliminate malaria. The disease is caused by a parasite that is spread through mosquito bites. Experts say other measures like bed nets and insecticide spraying remain essential to curb the disease. Experts say Nigeria's population of more than 210 million people, as well as its climate, contribute to its high malaria burden, but so do other factors like poor sanitation and limited tools like treated bed nets. Besides the lack of funding, WHO report said countries with malaria still grapple with fragile health systems, weak surveillance and drug and insecticide resistance. But progress has also been made on several fronts, the report said, including in the African region where countries have achieved a 16% reduction in malaria deaths since 2015. And in 83 countries where malaria is present, 25 of them now report fewer than 10 cases a year, the report said. In the oil-rich but poor Bayelsa state, among the worst-hit in Nigeria, malaria is so common in riverside communities that mothers spoke of how no one in their family has been spared. 'Here, malaria is something we are used to,' said Claris Okah, a community health worker. Among the challenges health workers like Okah face is hesitancy among parents, so they are educating families about the new vaccine and other steps to prevent malaria. 'The vaccine is a good thing,' Okah siad. ___ Asadu reported from Abuja, Nigeria. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

One Tech Tip: How to protect your communications through encryption	LONDON (AP) — After a sprawling hacking campaign exposed the communications of an unknown number of Americans, U.S. cybersecurity officials are advising people to use encryption in their communications. To safeguard against the risks highlighted by the campaign, which originated in China, federal cybersecurity authorities released an extensive list of security recommendations for U.S. telecom companies — such as Verizon and AT&amp;T — that were targeted. The advice includes one tip we can all put into practice with our phones: 'Ensure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible.' End-to-end encryption, also known as E2EE, means that messages are scrambled so that only the sender and recipient can see them. If anyone else intercepts the message, all they will see is a garble that can't be unscrambled without the key. Law enforcement officials had until now resisted this type of encryption because it means the technology companies themselves won't be able to look at the messages, nor respond to law enforcement requests to turn the data over. Here's a look at various ways ordinary consumers can use end-to-end encryption: Texting Officials said the hackers targeted the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts. They also managed to see the content from texts from a much smaller number of victims. If you're an iPhone user, information in text messages that you send to someone else who also has an iPhone will be encrypted end-to-end. Just look for the blue text bubbles, which indicate that they are encrypted iMessages. The same goes for Android users sending texts through Google Messages. There will be a lock next to the timestamp on each message to indicate the encryption is on. But there's a weakness. When iPhone and Android users text each other, the messages are encrypted only using Rich Communication Services, an industry standard for instant messaging that replaces the older SMS and MMS standards. Apple has noted that RCS messages 'aren’t end-to-end encrypted, which means they’re not protected from a third party reading them while they’re sent between devices.' Samsung, which sells Android smartphones, has also hinted at the issue in a footnote at the bottom of a press release last month on RCS, saying, 'Encryption only available for Android to Android communication.' Chat apps To avoid getting caught out when trading texts, experts recommend using encrypted messaging apps. Privacy advocates are big fans of Signal, which applies end-to-end encryption on all messages and voice calls. The independent nonprofit group behind the app promises never to sell, rent, or lease customer data and has made its source code publicly available so that it can be audited by anyone to examine it 'for security and correctness.' Signal's encryption protocol is so reputable that it has been integrated into rival WhatsApp, so users will enjoy the same level of security protection as Signal, which has a much smaller user base. End-to-end encryption is also the default mode for Facebook Messenger, which like WhatsApp is owned by Meta Platforms. What about Telegram? Telegram is an app that can be used for one-on-one conversations, group chats and broadcast 'channels' but contrary to popular perception, it doesn't turn on end-to-end encryption by default. Users have to switch on the option. And it doesn’t work with group chats. Cybersecurity experts have warned people against using Telegram for private communications and pointed out that only its opt-in ‘secret chat’ feature is encrypted from end-to-end. The app also has a reputation for being a haven for scammers and criminal activity, highlighted by founder and CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France. Making calls Instead of using your phone to make calls through a wireless cellular network, you can make voice calls with Signal and WhatsApp. Both apps encrypt calls with the same technology that they use to encrypt messages. There are other options. If you have an iPhone you can use Facetime for calls, while Android owners can use the Google Fi service, which are both end-to-end encrypted. The only catch with all these options is that, as with using the chat services to send messages, the person on the other end will also have to have the app installed. WhatsApp and Signal users can customize their privacy preferences in the settings, including hiding IP address during calls to prevent your general location from being guessed. ___ Is there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

Middle East latest: Israeli airstrikes kill 28 in Gaza, including 7 children, health officials say	Palestinian medical officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 28 people in the Gaza Strip, including seven children and a woman, hours after the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. One of the strikes overnight and into Thursday flattened a house in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the casualties were taken. Two other strikes killed 15 men who were part of local committees established to secure aid convoys. The committees were set up by displaced Palestinians in coordination with the Hamas-run Interior Ministry. On Wednesday, the U.N. General Assembly approved resolutions demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and expressing support for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, although they reflect world opinion. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,800 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the latest: Israeli airstrikes kill at least 28 people, including 7 children, Palestinian medical officials say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 28 people in the Gaza Strip, including seven children and a woman.

Shooting attack on Israeli bus kills child, wounds 2 people JERUSALEM — Israeli hospital officials say a young boy died after being wounded in a shooting attack in the occupied West Bank that also wounded two adults. An Israeli bus came under fire from a suspected Palestinian attacker late Wednesday, the military said, and Israeli forces are searching for the shooter. The shooting took place just outside Jerusalem in an area near major Israeli settlements. Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem said the boy was 12 years old, after initial reports said he was 10. A spokesperson for the hospital did not immediately respond to a request for clarification. The hospital said two other people, ages 24 and 55, were also wounded. UN General Assembly demands ceasefire in Gaza and backs UN agency helping Palestinian refugees UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban. The votes in the 193-nation world body were 158-9 with 13 abstentions to demand a ceasefire now and 159-9 with 11 abstentions to support the agency known as UNRWA. The votes culminated two days of speeches overwhelmingly calling for an end to the 14-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly. Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-12-december-2024-b17c7ab064079d80fd006ab9d058966b	2024-12-11T22:37:57-08:00	
Thousands attend the funeral of a Taliban minister killed by an Islamic State suicide bomber	GARDA SERAI, Afghanistan (AP) — Thousands of people attended the funeral on Thursday of a Taliban minister killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, the day before that was claimed by the Islamic State group. The funeral for Khalil Haqqani, the minister for refugees and repatriation, was held in the eastern Paktia province. The Cabinet member was the most high-profile casualty of an assault in the country since the Taliban seized power three years ago. The minister, who died in a blast Wednesday at his ministry in Kabul along with five others, was the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the acting interior minister and the leader of a powerful faction within the Taliban. The United States has placed a bounty on both their heads. Tight security was in place for the high-ranking officials attending the funeral, including Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Deputy Prime Minister Maulvi Abdul Kabir. Armed men guarded the coffin, which was draped in the Taliban flag, and loudspeakers broadcast sermons and eulogies. Local and international media were invited to cover the funeral in Garda Serai district in Paktia. Sirajuddin Haqqani led the mourners in prayer. They gathered on a vast plain against a backdrop of rugged mountains. Haqqani told the crowd he wished the person who perpetrated this 'weak action' had thought of his uncle as an enemy of non-Muslims. 'The Americans offered a $5 million reward (for information) on him,' said the acting interior minister. 'He was not an enemy of Muslims. How can you call this a great victory, that you martyred a Muslim and are proud of it?' In a statement carried by the Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State Khorasan Province — a regional affiliate of the Islamic State group — said that one of its fighters carried out the suicide bombing. The fighter waited for Haqqani to leave his office and then detonated his device, according to the statement. An official from Paktia, the Haqqanis' heartland, gave a different account of what happened. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. The assailant was able to gain access to the ministry despite setting off an alarm on the body scanner because he told the guard he had metal plates in his hands, the official said. He also claimed he was a refugee. The official added that Haqqani made time for refugees and people with disabilities who come to see him at work because he was sympathetic to their plight. He was approaching the ministry after praying in the compound's mosque when the assailant detonated the bomb, the official added. The U.N. mission in Afghanistan was among those to condemn the ministry attack. 'There can be no place for terrorism in the quest for stability,' the mission said on X. Neighboring Pakistan has also expressed shock over teh attack. Mohammad Sadiq, the special representative for Afghanistan, wrote on X on Wednesday that the government stood in solidarity with Afghanistan and reiterated its commitment to work with Afghanistan in fighting the 'menace of terrorism.' The IS affiliate, a major rival of the ruling Taliban, has previously carried out bombings across Afghanistan. But suicide attacks have become rare since the Taliban seized power in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces were withdrawing after 20 years of war. Such assaults have mostly targeted minority Shiite Muslims, especially in the capital. ___ Associated Press writer Munir Ahmed in Islamabad contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-haqqani-funeral-suicide-bombing-kabul-cf2ec2a67b230ce0a4b919561c85042e	2024-12-11T22:24:56-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mostly higher, tracking a rally on Wall Street	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares were mostly higher Thursday in Asia after Wall Street resumed its upward climb, as an update on inflation appeared to clear the way for more help for the economy from the Federal Reserve. Chinese shares rose as leaders met in Beijing to set economic plans and targets for the coming year. The government announced plans to expand trial private pension programs to the entire country, beginning Dec. 15. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong jumped 1.4% to 20,441.57 and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.9% to 3,461.50. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index advanced 1.2% to 39,849.14, led by buying of technology shares. Advantest Corp., which makes equipment for testing computer chips, gained 5.1%, while chip maker Tokyo Electron was up 0.6%. South Korea's Kospi gained 1.6% to 2,482.12, while the S&amp;P/ASX 200 in Australia slipped 0.3% to 8,330.30. Taiwan's Taiex climbed 0.6% and the Sensex in India shed 0.2%. The SET in Bangkok picked up 0.2%. U.S. stock indexes resumed climbing on Wednesday after an update on inflation appeared to clear the way for more help for the economy from the Federal Reserve. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.8% to break its first two-day losing streak in nearly a month and finished at 6,084.19. Big Tech stocks helped drive the Nasdaq composite up 1.8% to 20,034.89. It was its first close above 20,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, dipped 0.2% to 44,148.56. Inflation in the U.S. ticked up to 2.7% in November from a year earlier from 2.6% in October, fueled by pricier used cars, hotel rooms and groceries. That shows some price pressures remain elevated, but not enough to prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates at its meeting next week. The Fed began trimming rates in September from a two-decade high to support a slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower rates would give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, but they could also provide more fuel for inflation. Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&amp;P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times this year, with the latest coming last week. Tesla jumped 5.9% to finish above $420 at $424.77. It’s a level that Elon Musk made famous in a 2018 tweet when he said he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share. Stitch Fix soared 44.3% after the company that sends clothes to your door reported a smaller loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave financial forecasts for the current quarter that were better than expected, including for revenue. GE Vernova rallied 5% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500. The energy company that spun out of General Electric said it would pay a 25 cent dividend every three months, and it approved a plan to send up to another $6 billion to its shareholders by buying back its own stock. Albertsons fell 1.5% after filing a lawsuit against Kroger, saying it didn’t do enough for their proposed $24.6 billion merger agreement to win regulatory clearance. A day earlier, judges in separate cases in Oregon and Washington had nixed the supermarket giants’ merger. The grocers contended a combination could have helped them compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, but critics said it would hurt competition. Macy’s slipped 0.8% after cutting some of its financial forecasts for the full year of 2024, including for how much profit it expects to make off each $1 of revenue. In other dealings early Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 13 cents to $70.42 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gained 23 cents to $73.75 per barrel. The U.S. dollar slipped to 152.35 Japanese yen from 152.46 yen. The euro rose to $1.0527 from $1.0496.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-41b48ce746dc18a1b5141d4c49cff403	2024-12-11T20:37:16-08:00

She wants to reunite with her family after what she called exploitative work conditions and sexual violence, along with the recent horrors of war in Lebanon. 'My experience in Lebanon is not good for me. I am really tired,' Bah said. 'I want to go home.' Hundreds of migrant workers in Lebanon are waiting to be repatriated after the ceasefire ending the 14-month war between the Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Israel went into effect last month. Lebanon has long drawn migrant workers dreaming of building better lives for their families. Enticed by promises of stable jobs and decent pay, they enter Lebanon via recruitment agencies under a sponsorship-based labor system known as Kafala — only to find themselves often trapped with confiscated passports, long hours, withheld wages and, for many, abuse. The Kafala system has long been criticized by human rights groups, but the government rarely if ever addresses the criticism. But Bah knew little of that when she came to Lebanon in 2022. She was promised a job at a supermarket with a $200 monthly salary, she said. Instead, she was sent to care for an older woman once she arrived. Within a month of her arrival, her 3-year-old son back home fell ill and died. She said she was not given the time to grieve and fled her employer’s house. Since her employer held her passport and other documents, Bah said she had to leave them behind. Her experience in Lebanon then took a darker turn. One day she and five housemates were picked up by a taxi driver who said he would take them home. Instead, she said, the driver dropped them at the wrong spot. As they tried and failed to find another cab, a group of men chased them and raped them. 'Men were coming and they were cheering for us,' said Bah, who gave her consent to be named. 'They beat us and they had sex with us.' She said it took her about two weeks to recover and resume work at two hotels. Without documents, migrants can hesitate to go to police. Two months later, she and another friend found out they were pregnant. Bah recounted the experience as she watched her baby’s wobbly footsteps. With war, their lives became more precarious. When Israel intensified its bombardment of Beirut’s southern suburbs in September, Bah fled the area with her baby and friends on foot. Not every migrant worker escaped the attacks. An estimated 37 have been killed and 150 wounded since October 2023, said Joelle Mhanna with the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. There were few places to turn. Most government-run shelters refused to take in displaced people who were not Lebanese, said activist Dea Hajj Shaheen. After supporting migrant women during previous crises in Lebanon, she stepped in again along with other volunteers. To house over 200 women from Sierra Leone including Bah, they repurposed an abandoned space owned by her family — a former car dealership that was later a venue for pop-up events and named The Shelter. The kitchen was alive with activity as women cooked, some dancing to Nigerian music. In another area, rows of thin mattresses lay in the dim light from broken windows. Despite the modest conditions, the women set up a Christmas tree crafted from sticks. While some migrants have been accepted at government-run shelters, there were regular reports of others being evicted or denied access, the IOM said. Some migrants hesitate to approach the government shelters for fear of detention or deportation, Mhanna said. 'As a result, most are being hosted by embassies, NGOs and community-based organizations including churches, monasteries and other religious groups.' The Lebanese government has not directly addressed the issue of migrant workers being rejected from government-run shelters, despite repeated calls for action from rights organizations and the United Nations. Moving on from the shelters they found posed another challenge for migrants like Bah, as many had passports and other documents confiscated by former employers. 'We had to secure exit permits, immigration clearances and even child travel documents for the five children in this group,' said Shaheen, who coordinated the repatriation last month of 120 women and their children with the support of IOM, who chartered the flight. IOM said it has received requests from around 10,000 migrants seeking to be repatriated, a small fraction of the over 175,000 in Lebanon. As of Nov. 26, the IOM had supported over 400 migrants to return home. That included two charter flights for people from Bangladesh and Sierra Leone. It wasn't clear how many more flights are planned. or to where. Laughter and cheer filled Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport on Nov. 19. The women from Sierra Leone arrived in groups, dragging suitcases and sharing hugs. Some danced in celebration for their long-awaited flight. 'It wasn’t easy in Lebanon,' said Amanata Thullah after four years. 'I am happy to be going back to my country.' Mariam Sesay, who described herself as the head of Sierra Leone's community in Lebanon, said there had been 'a lot of distress and trauma' in recent months. Bah was not among those leaving, but she said she and others at the shelter were happy to see friends return home. She now awaits her turn, along with over 50 others. At first she was told she needed official documents for her baby and the father’s consent to travel. But a lawyer waived the requirement due to her circumstances, Shaheen said. 'I wish to go back home to continue my education,' Bah said. 'Since I was little, I always wanted to be a computer science student, because I’m good at that.' She looked down at Blessing. 'Now I have something to take care of,' she said. 'When I watch her walk or laugh, that gives me joy.' ___ Follow AP coverage of migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-migrants-sierra-leone-war-9c696b80aa3bd5099ffc26394474d1fd	2024-12-11T20:23:38-08:00	
Rights group accuses Russian mercenaries of abuses against civilians in Mali	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Mali’s armed forces, supported by Russian mercenaries, committed abuses against civilians since the withdrawal of a U.N. peacekeeping mission late last year, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday. Malian armed forces and the Russia-backed Wagner Group deliberately killed at least 32 civilians, including seven in a drone strike, kidnapped four others, and burned at least 100 homes in towns and villages in central and northern Mali since May, the rights group said. Human Rights Watch also accused jihadi groups in the region of having summarily executed at least 47 civilians and displaced thousands of people since June. It said the groups burned thousands of houses and looted livestock, which is vital to the survival of the nomadic communities in the region. 'The Malian army with the Wagner Group and Islamist armed groups have been targeting civilians and their property in violation of the laws of war,' Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in the report. Mali, along with its neighbors Burkina Faso and Niger, has for over a decade battled an insurgency fought by jihadi groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Following military coups in all three nations in recent years, the ruling juntas have expelled French forces and turned to Russia’s mercenary units for security assistance. Wagner has been present in Mali since late 2021 following a military coup, replacing French troops and international peacekeepers to help fight the militants. At the same time, the mercenary group has been accused of helping to carry out raids and drone strikes that have killed civilians. In December last year, the United Nations ended its decade long peacekeeping mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA following the government’s request that alleged the force was inadequate to respond to the insurgency. 'Since MINUSMA left Mali a year ago, it has been extremely difficult to get comprehensive information on abuses, and we are deeply concerned that the situation is even worse than reported,' Allegrozzi said. ____ Follow AP’s Africa coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mali-human-rights-watch-russia-wagner-abuses-ee01ab840c6323c176ded02d1d7be5bb	2024-12-11T20:08:38-08:00	
As tourists discover Finland's Santa Claus Village, some locals call for rules to control the masses	ROVANIEMI, Finland (AP) — Shuffling across icy ground on a cold December afternoon, lots of tourist groups poured into Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park perched on the edge of the Arctic Circle. They frolic in the snow, take a reindeer sleigh ride, sip a cocktail in an ice bar or even meet Saint Nick himself in the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, which happily calls itself the 'official hometown of Santa Claus.' The Santa Claus Village theme park, which attracts more than 600,000 people annually, is especially popular during the holiday season. 'This is like my dream came true,' beamed Polish visitor Elzbieta Nazaruk. 'I’m really excited to be here.' Tourism is booming in Rovaniemi — which has hotel and restaurant owners, as well as city officials, excited as it brings lots of money to the town. However, not everyone is happy about the onslaught of visitors, 10 times the town's population, each year at Christmas time. 'We are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it’s not anymore in control,' said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city’s streets. It’s a feeling that has been echoed in other popular European travel destinations, including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Malaga and Florence. Across the continent, locals have protested against 'over-tourism' — which generally describes the tipping point at which visitors and their cash stop benefiting residents and instead cause harm by degrading historic sites, overwhelming infrastructure and making life markedly more difficult for those who live there. Now, it seems to have spread north, all the way to the edges of the Arctic Circle. Rovaniemi counted a record 1.2 million overnight visitors in 2023, almost 30 percent growth on 2022, after rebounding from pandemic travel disruptions. 'Nordic is a trend,' Visit Rovaniemi CEO Sanna Karkkainen, said as she stood in an ice restaurant, where snow carvers were working nearby. 'People want to travel to cool countries to see the snow, to see the Northern Lights, and, of course, to see Santa Claus,' she added. Thirteen new flight routes to Rovaniemi Airport opened this year, bringing passengers from Geneva, Berlin, Bordeaux and more. Most tourists come from European countries like France, Germany and the UK, but Rovaniemi’s appeal has also spread further. Hotel availability is scarce this winter, and Tiina Määttä, general manager of the 159-room Original Sokos Hotel, expects 2024 to break more records. Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi’s city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a 'transient space for tourists.' Finnish law prohibits professional accommodation services in buildings intended for residential use, so campaigners are calling on authorities to act. 'The rules must be enforced better,' said Pakkanen. Not everyone agrees. Mayor Ulla-Kirsikka Vainio notes some make 'good money' on short-term rentals. Either way, stricter regulations likely won’t be in place to impact this winter season, and despite the unease expressed by locals, mass tourism to Rovaniemi is probably only going to grow in 2025 — as visitors want to experience the unique atmosphere up north, especially during the holiday season. 'It’s Christmas time and we would love to see the Northern Lights,' says Joy, a visitor from Bangkok. 'Rovaniemi seems to be a good place.'	https://apnews.com/article/finland-overtourism-santa-claus-hometown-rovaniemi-7dc1f0e8688aee63a86b7b0e3aead8de	2024-12-11T20:04:49-08:00	
US hikes tariffs on imports of Chinese solar wafers, polysilicon and tungsten products	BANGKOK (AP) — The Biden administration plans to raise tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect U.S. clean energy businesses. The notice from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50% from 25% and duties on certain tungsten products will increase from zero to 25%, effective on Jan. 1, following a review of Chinese trade practices under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. The decision followed a public comment period after the USTR said in September that it was considering such actions. 'The tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People’s Republic of China,' USTR Katharine Tai said in a statement. 'These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains.' Reports Thursday said U.S. and Chinese officials were meeting this week and next for trade talks ahead of the year's end. Last week, Washington tightened restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology. Beijing responded by banning exports to the U.S. of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the U.S. China provides a very large share of most of those materials and the United States has been working to secure alternative sources in Africa and other parts of the world. Tungsten is another strategically vital metal whose production is dominated by China. The U.S. does not produce it, but South Korea is a potential big supplier. It's used to make armaments and is also used in x-ray tubes and light bulb filaments, among other industrial applications. U.S. imports of the metal from China fell to $10.9 million in 2023 from $19.5 million the year before. After Beijing announced its ban on exporting gallium and the other materials to the United States, analysts said tungsten was another likely area where China might strike back. Trade frictions have been escalating ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods, among other threats. President Joe Biden has said Trump’s promise of broad tariffs on foreign imports would be a mistake. His administration has kept in place tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term in office, but says it has a more targeted approach. China has sharply ramped up production of cheap electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries at a time when the Biden administration has championed moves to support those industries in the U.S. The U.S. and other trading partners say China improperly subsidizes exports, giving exporters of solar panels and other products an unfair advantage in overseas markets, where its manufacturers charge lower prices thanks to government support. Washington also says China improperly pressures foreign companies to hand over technology. China accounts for more than 80% of the market for solar panels at all stages of production, according to the International Energy Agency, more than double domestic demand for those products. Its huge economies of scale have made solar power more affordable, but also concentrated the supply chain inside China. The IEA has urged other countries to assess their solar panel supply chains and develop strategies to address any risks. In early 2018, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. Beijing filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization charging that the U.S. was unfairly supporting electric vehicle purchases. The investigation that led the USTR to raise the tariffs on solar panels concluded with a report in May that has prompted increases in tariffs on a range of products including electric vehicles, syringes and needles, medical gloves and facemasks, semiconductors and steel and aluminum products, among others. It has pushed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles up to 100% from 25%, raised tariffs on Chinese-made lithium batteries to 25% from 7.5%.	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tariffs-tungsten-solar-a9653d4b14051d78314c2bd8111510e7	2024-12-11T19:39:53-08:00	
In Nigeria's lithium boom, many mines are illegal and children do much of the work	NASARAWA, Nigeria (AP) — Dressed in a faded pink dress, 6-year-old Juliet Samaniya squats under scorching skies to chip at a jagged white rock with a stone tool. Dust coats her tiny hands and her hair as she works hour after hour for less than a dollar a day. The landscape around her is dotted with active and abandoned mineshafts, farmland that may soon be cleared in search of more rich ore, and other mine workers — many of them children. Juliet should be in school, her mother, Abigail Samaniya, admits. Instead, she spends her day mining lithium, a mineral critical for batteries needed in the global transition to clean energy, to earn money that helps sustain her family. 'That is the only option,' Abigail Samaniya said. The International Labour Organization estimates more than 1 million children work in mines and quarries worldwide, a problem particularly acute in Africa, where poverty, limited access to education and weak regulations add to the problem. Children, working mostly in small-scale mines, work long hours at unsafe sites, crushing or sorting rocks, carrying heavy loads of ore, and exposing themselves to toxic dust that can cause respiratory problems and asthma. The growing demand for lithium has created a new frontier for mining in mineral-rich Nigeria. But it has come with a steep cost, exploiting its poorest and most vulnerable: its children. Their work often provides material for Chinese businesses that dominate Nigeria’s laxly regulated extractive industry and are often blamed for illegal mining and labor exploitation. The Associated Press recently traveled to the deep bush of Pasali, near the federal capital of Abuja in Nasarawa state, to follow and interview miners operating illegal mines, including the one where Juliet works. AP also witnessed negotiations and an agreement to purchase lithium by a Chinese company with no questions about the source of the lithium or how it was obtained. That company, RSIN Nigeria Limited, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But in a statement to AP, the Chinese embassy in Abuja said Chinese mining companies in Nigeria 'operate in line with local laws and regulations.' Nigeria has laws requiring basic education and prohibiting child labor, but enforcement is a challenge with many illegal mines in hard-to-reach areas. Corruption among regulatory and law enforcement officials is also a problem. The government said it's pursuing reforms that would toughen laws. Earlier this year it also launched a 'corps of mining marshals' to combat illegal mining, but activists say it's too soon to tell if that program is helping. How Nigeria's illegal mines work Lithium mining began in Pasali a decade ago, transforming a remote and slumbering community into a bustling site for small-scale illegal mining, said Shedrack Bala, a 25-year-old who began working in the mines at age 15 and now owns his own pit. Dozens of mines now dot the area, all unlicensed. The mining methods are primitive and dangerous. Miners use chisels and heavy hammers to break through rocks, descending several feet into dark pits. In some old but still viable mines, they crawl through narrow passages snaking between unstable mud walls before starting to dig. For new mines, the ground is blasted open with dynamite. Bashir Rabiu, now 19, started in these pits as an underage worker. AP journalists watched as he wriggled around at the bottom of a pit, where miners can be at risk if dynamite explodes prematurely. They also face danger of suffocating in narrow tunnels that connect pits, or burial from wall collapse — all fates Rabiu has seen befall other miners. 'But it is God that protects,' he said. Rabiu hauled up raw lithium ore and passed it to Juliet and five other children, all younger than 10. Wearing rubber slippers and dust-stained shorts and shirts, the children hunched over heaps of rubble and chipped away with crude stone tools to extract valuable fragments. Once sorted, the minerals were bagged to begin their journey from Pasali to the global supply chain. A team of six children can sort and bag up to 10 25-kilogram bags of lithium-rich rock a day. When the AP visited, they did 22 kilograms (about 48.5 pounds) in one hour. For working from early morning to late evening, the children typically share 4,000 naira (about $2.42), according to Bala and others who use them. They said it is enough money to cover meals at the children’s homes. In Juliet's group, only she and a 5-year-old boy named Zakaria Danladi had ever attended the local elementary school. Zakaria stopped when he was orphaned. Juliet was pulled out because her family couldn't afford to send both her and her 11-year-old brother, and his education took precedence, her mother said. Basic education is supposed to be free in Nigeria, at least in government schools like the one in Pasali. But hidden fees often put it out of reach of the poorest families. For example, in Pasali, a Parent-Teacher Association levy of 5,000 Naira (about $3) is charged per term, parents said. For Juliet’s family and others, even this amount is too much. About 63% of Nigeria's population lives in poverty. Sule Dantini, the schoolmaster, said his classes have become virtually empty with only three pupils turning up when he spoke with AP in early December. 'I used to have up to 300 pupils, but attendance has been very poor because of mining.' He denied the school charges fees. Miners say they have no trouble finding buyers Nigeria is Africa’s top oil producer, but it also has deep mineral resources including granite, limestone, and gold, and it's seeking to tap those to reduce its reliance on petroleum exports. Yet much of this wealth — including lithium — is siphoned off through unlicensed mines that cost the nation billions of dollars and drive insecurity, according to a parliamentary probe this year. The illegal mining thrives on informal networks of buyers and sellers who operate without much fear of the government. Aliyu Ibrahim, a lithium merchant in Nasarawa, owns unlicensed mines and also buys lithium ore from other illegal sites. At his warehouse, he told AP that his business flourishes by paying officials to look the other way. Ibrahim said he then sells his lithium in bulk to Chinese companies. Ibrahim said he knows that children are working at his mines and others he buys from, but he said many of the children are orphans or poor. 'It is dangerous, but the work helps them survive, while the government has abandoned poor people,' he said. Some of the bush miners avoid middlemen like Ibrahim and sell directly to Chinese companies or Chinese nationals. AP accompanied miners from Pasali illegal mines to Chinese-owned RSIN Nigeria Limited, where a sales agreement was reached without questions about the source of the minerals or the conditions under which they were extracted. Sellers were asked to leave samples to test for lithium content. A price list from the buyers offered 200,000 naira (about $119) for a metric ton of minerals containing up to 3% lithium. China's citizens and companies are frequently in the spotlight for environmentally damaging practices, exploitative labor and illicit mining in several countries. Nigeria has seen multiple cases of illegal mining arrests and prosecutions involving Chinese nationals in recent months. Experts say the materials are exported in a variety of ways, including shipping with false documentation or concealment within legitimate shipments. The Chinese embassy's statement to AP said its government has a zero-tolerance policy toward any illegal mining activity or illegal labor by Chinese companies operating abroad. Philip Jakpor, a Nigerian activist, said his nonprofit Renevlyn Development Initiative has documented widespread child labor practices across Nasarawa state. 'Revenue generation seems to have trumped the need to protect human rights,' Jakpor said. 'We expect those operating in the upper spheres of the supply chain to adopt responsible models that prevent abusive conditions in mineral extraction.' Juliane Kippenberg, associate director of children’s rights at Human Rights Watch, said global demand for lithium is expected to grow rapidly in coming years and it's imperative for governments to protect human rights and press corporations to do the same. Segun Tomori, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mining and Solid Minerals Development, said ongoing reforms such as amending the Minerals and Mining Act are aimed at minimizing the use of child labor. Tomori also said social safety programs such as school feeding initiatives are being revamped to keep children in school and combat child labor. He also cited the program to add mining marshals announced this year to clamp down on illegal mining. Abigail Samaniya, 6-year-old Juliet's mother, said she hopes her daughter will someday escape the mine. 'I still want her to go to school, have a better life, work in an office, not a mine forever,' she said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Papua New Guinea gains a team in Australian rugby league in diplomatic push aimed at curbing China	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Papua New Guinea will gain its own team in Australia’s rugby league in a soft diplomacy deal announced Thursday linked to limiting Chinese influence in the South Pacific. The Australian government will spend 600 million Australian dollars ($380 million) over a decade to add a team from its nearest neighbor to the National Rugby League from 2028. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his Papua New Guinea counterpart James Marape announced the deal at a Sydney news conference. They also announced that a bilateral security deal struck a year ago had officially come into force. China has pursued its own bilateral security pact on policing with Papua New Guinea and with other South Pacific island nations which U.S. allies including Australia fear could undermine regional security. Rugby league is the most popular sport in Papua New Guinea, a poor population of 12 million mostly subsistence farmers that is racked by tribal violence, worsening violent crime and civil unrest. Marape said the security deal with Australia 'fits in neatly' with ensuring the safety of players and officials who would be based in the capital Port Moresby. 'The player is safe when we have good rapport between our two police' forces, Marape told reporters. The prime ministers said in a joint statement the security agreement 'ensures consultation on security-related developments.' Albanese did not directly answer when asked by a reporter if the agreement would prevent Papua New Guinea from striking a security deal with China. 'Security in Pacific is primarily the responsibility of the Pacific family is a principle that we share,' Albanese said. Marape said the security pact with Australia was in his country’s interests. 'Australia is a security partner of choice in the first instance,' Marape said. 'That doesn’t stop us from relating with any nation, especially our Asian neighbors. We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner, a great bilateral partner, but on security, closer to home we have this synergy and our shared territory needs to be protected, defended, policed,' Marape added. Marape described the deal to create a Port Moresby-based football team as 'pivotal in ... anchoring' the Papua New Guinea-Australia relationship. 'At the heart of every foreign relationship lies people-to-people relations. Foreign relations minus people-to-people relations is completely in vain,' Marape said. The security pact signed by Albanese and Marape a year ago strengthened Australia’s place as the preferred security partner. It was signed six months later than initially planned. The original June 2023, date was abandoned after a security deal struck between the United States and Marape’s government sparked protests in the South Pacific nation a month earlier over concerns that it undermined Papua New Guinea’s sovereignty. Australia agreed to support Papua New Guinea’s internal security in areas of policing, courts and prisons. Australia has also helped Papua New Guinea build a new police training center in the Port Moresby that will be open to recruits from other Pacific nations.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-papua-new-guinea-china-rugby-league-37f7e5f4203bc05cbe5485e20d66f4a6	2024-12-11T17:34:58-08:00	
South Korea's Yoon defends martial law as an act of governance and vows to 'fight to the end'	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol defended his martial law decree as an act of governance and denied rebellion charges, vowing Thursday to 'fight to the end' in the face of attempts to impeach him and intensifying investigations into last week’s dramatic move. He spoke hours before the main opposition Democratic Party submits a new impeachment motion against him for a floor vote this weekend. Parliament on Thursday afternoon passed motions to impeach national police chief Cho Ji Ho and Justice Minister Park Sung Jae, suspending them from official duties, over their enforcement of martial law. Yoon’s Dec. 3 martial law declaration has generated political chaos and large protests calling for his ouster. The decree brought hundreds of armed troops attempting to encircle parliament and raid the election commission, though no major violence or injuries occurred. Martial law lasted only six hours as Yoon was forced to lift it after the National Assembly unanimously voted it down. Yoon, a conservative, said he enacted martial law as a warning to the liberal Democratic Party, which controls parliament. He called the party 'a monster' and 'anti-state forces' that he said tried to use its legislative muscle to impeach top officials, undermined the government’s budget bill for next year and sympathized with North Korea. 'I will fight to the end to prevent the forces and criminal groups that have been responsible for paralyzing the country’s government and disrupting the nation’s constitutional order from threatening the future of the Republic of Korea,' Yoon said. 'The opposition is now doing a sword dance of chaos, claiming that the declaration of martial law constitutes to an act of rebellion. But was it really?' he said. Yoon said martial law was an act of governance that cannot be the subject of investigations and doesn’t amount to rebellion. He said the deployment of nearly 300 soldiers to the National Assembly was designed to maintain order, not dissolve or paralyze it. The Democratic Party quickly dismissed Yoon’s statement as 'an expression of extreme delusion' and 'a declaration of war against the people.' Kim Min-seok, head of a party task force, accused the president of attempting to incite pro-Yoon riots by far-right forces. He said the Democratic Party will focus on getting the motion impeaching Yoon passed on Saturday. It's unclear how Yoon's comments will affect his fate. Opposition parties hold 192 seats combined, eight votes short of a two-thirds majority of the 300 members of the National Assembly. The earlier attempt to impeach Yoon failed with most lawmakers from Yoon’s governing People Power Party boycotting the vote. Yoon's speech was expected to deepen a divide inside the PPP. When party chair Han Dong-hun, a critic of Yoon, called Yoon's statement 'a confession of rebellion' during a party meeting, Yoon loyalists angrily jeered and called on Han to stop speaking. Han has urged party members to vote in favor of Yoon's impeachment. Opposition parties and even some PPP members say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. South Korean law allows the president to declare martial law during wartime or similar emergencies, and they said such a situation did not exist. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the constitution doesn’t give a president such rights in any situation. The country's law enforcement authorities are investigating whether Yoon and others involved in imposing martial law committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes. A conviction for rebellion carries a maximum penalty of death. The National Assembly on Thursday passed a bill that could introduce an independent counsel to investigate Yoon on rebellion charges without his approval. A bill it endorsed earlier this week on appointing an independent counsel requires Yoon's approval. The Justice Ministry on Monday placed an oversea travel ban on Yoon. South Korean law gives a president immunity from prosecution while in office, except for allegations of rebellion or treason. This means that Yoon can be questioned and detained by investigative agencies over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. On Wednesday, Yoon’s presidential security service didn't allow police to search the presidential office. Yoon's statement was seen as an about-face. Last Saturday, he apologized over declaring martial law and said he wouldn't avoid responsibility for it. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the political turmoil, 'including matters related to my term in office.' On Wednesday, Yoon's former defense minister, Kim Yong Hyun, was arrested on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. The national police chief, Cho, and the head of Seoul's metropolitan police have been detained while their actions of sending police forces to the National Assembly are investigated as a criminal matter. Park, the impeached justice minister, has faced suspicions raised by the opposition that he was involved in the planning and execution of Yoon’s martial law decree. Park has denied the accusations. Kim, who resigned after martial law was lifted, is one of Yoon’s close associates. He has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. He tried to kill himself in detention, but correctional officers stopped him and he was in stable condition, according to the Justice Ministry. In his speech Thursday, Yoon said he had discussed imposing martial law only with Kim before he informed other top officials about it at a Cabinet meeting just before its declaration. On the night of Dec. 3, besides the National Assembly, Yoon and Kim sent troops to the National Election Commission. That raised speculation that he might have tried to seize computer servers at the commission as he believed unfounded rumors that the results of April's parliamentary elections, in which his party suffered steep losses, were rigged. Yoon said he asked Kim to examine the supposed vulnerabilities of the commission's computer systems, which Yoon said was hampering the credibility of election results.

Slovakia's parliament passes legislation that could ban doctors from protesting low pay	BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) — Slovakia’s parliament on Wednesday approved legislation drafted by the government of populist Prime Minister Robert Fico that could effectively ban doctors from protesting against low pay and force them to continue working. Lawmakers in the 150-seat National Council voted 74-70 in favor of the law, which came in response to a mass resignation threat by more than 3,000 doctors from the nation's hospitals, who said they would quit their jobs at the beginning of next year. The law gives the government the power to declare an emergency in the case health care might not be available. Doctors would be then obliged to work because their notices to leave the job would not be accepted. Refusal to do so could result in imprisonment. The measure is intended to prevent a collapse of the health care system. The emergency measures can last for up to 120 days. Health Minister Kamil Šaško said during the parliamentary debate that he hoped that 'he’ll never be forced to use the tool,' which is strongly opposed by the labor unions representing the doctors. The doctors protested that the government had not discussed with them the cuts to a 2022 plan aimed at increasing their salaries in the next two years. The cuts are part of austerity measures approved by the government to keep the ballooning budget deficit under control.	https://apnews.com/article/slovakia-health-care-hospital-doctors-protest-6c9b0add3a1a9699c1aa7f8b69f4df6c	2024-12-11T12:52:15-08:00	
UN General Assembly demands ceasefire in Gaza and backs UN agency helping Palestinian refugees	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban. The votes in the 193-nation world body were 158-9, with 13 abstentions to demand a ceasefire now and 159-9 with 11 abstentions in support of the agency known as UNRWA. The votes culminated two days of speeches overwhelmingly calling for an end to the 14-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group. Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions. While Security Council resolutions are legally binding, General Assembly resolutions are not, though they do reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly. The Palestinians and their supporters went to the General Assembly after the U.S. vetoed a Security Council resolution on Nov. 20 demanding an immediate Gaza ceasefire. It was supported by the council’s 14 other members but the U.S. objected that it was not linked to an immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas militants during their attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war. The language of the resolution adopted by the assembly is the same as the text of the vetoed resolution, demanding 'an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire to be respected by all parties,' while also reiterating a 'demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' The second resolution backs the mandate of UNRWA, which was established by the General Assembly in 1949. It deplores laws adopted by Israel’s parliament on Oct. 28 banning UNRWA’s activities in the Palestinian territories, a measure to take effect in 90 days. And it reiterates U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ statements that UNRWA is 'the backbone' of all humanitarian operations in Gaza and no organization can replace it. Israel alleges that around a dozen of UNRWA’s 13,000 workers in Gaza participated in Hamas’ attacks on Israel that precipitated the war. It recently provided the U.N. with over 100 names of UNRWA staff it accuses of having militant ties. The resolution adopted Wednesday calls on the Israeli government 'to abide by its international obligations, respect the privileges and immunities of UNRWA and uphold its responsibility to allow and facilitate full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance in all its forms into and throughout the entire Gaza Strip.' U.S. deputy U.N. ambassador Robert Wood reiterated America’s opposition to the ceasefire resolution ahead of Wednesday’s vote and criticized the Palestinians for again failing to mention Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. 'At a time when Hamas is feeling isolated due to the ceasefire in Lebanon, the draft resolution on a ceasefire in Gaza risks sending a dangerous message to Hamas that there’s no need to negotiate or release the hostages,' he said. The Hamas attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw another 250 abducted as hostages. Gaza militants have not returned around 100 hostages, a third of them believed to be dead, and ceasefire efforts have ground to a halt. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the local Health Ministry. It says women and children make up more than half the dead but does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Wood said the U.S. will continue to seek a diplomatic solution to the war and called UNRWA 'a critical lifeline to the Palestinian people.' But he said the UNRWA resolution has 'serious flaws' because it fails to create a path to restore trust between the U.N. agency and Israel — despite U.S. efforts and a U.S. proposal. Just before the vote, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon accused the resolutions’ supporters of complicity with Hamas, which he said has 'hopelessly infiltrated' UNRWA, and denounced their failure to link a ceasefire to the release of the hostages. 'By demanding a ceasefire today without addressing the hostages, this assembly will once again side with those who weaponize human suffering,' Danon said. 'It will send a message that the lives of innocent Israelis, including children, are not worth your consideration.' 'This is not diplomacy,' he stressed. 'It is appeasement. It is enabling terror and abandoning the innocent.' At the opening of the assembly debate last Wednesday, the Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour accused Israel of mass killings, displacements, destruction and starvation — 'a cruel war of atrocities against an entire civilian population.' Mansour said the only way to stop the atrocities, free the hostages, 'and to preserve the hope of a different future' is an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and support humanitarian efforts and prevent Israel’s attempt to eliminate UNRWA. Slovenia’s U.N. Ambassador Samuel Žbogar, reflecting the views of many speakers, pointed to the tens of thousands killed in Gaza. 'Gaza doesn’t exist anymore,' he told the assembly Wednesday. 'It is destroyed. Civilians are facing hunger, despair and death.'	https://apnews.com/article/un-gaza-unrwa-palestinians-israel-resolutions-vote-2df5701e79b9678104e60a99b17d2f7a	2024-12-11T11:32:15-08:00	
The Trump and Biden teams insist they're working hand in glove on foreign crises	WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump doesn't think much of Joe Biden's foreign policy record. The Republican president-elect frequently casts the outgoing Democratic president as a feckless leader who shredded American credibility around the world during his four-year term. But a funny thing happened on Trump's way back to the White House: The Biden and Trump national security teams have come to an understanding that they have no choice but to work together as conflicts in Gaza, Syria and Ukraine have left a significant swath of the world on a knife's edge. It's not clear how much common ground those teams have found as they navigate crises that threaten to cause more global upheaval as Trump prepares to settle back into the White House on Jan. 20, 2025. 'There is a deep conviction on the part of the incoming national security team that we are dealing with ... and on our part, directed from President Biden, that it is our job, on behalf of the American people, to make sure this is a smooth transition,' Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during a weekend appearance at a forum in California. 'And we are committed to discharging that duty as relentlessly and faithfully as we possibly can.' To be certain, Trump and his allies haven't let up on their criticism of Biden, putting the blame squarely on the shoulders of Biden and Democrats for the series of crises around the globe. The president-elect says Biden is responsible for the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, arguing that policies under his watch led to Hamas and Russia becoming emboldened. And shortly before Syria's Bashar al-Assad's government collapsed last week, Trump blamed Biden's old boss, former President Barack Obama, for failing to enforce his own 'red line' in 2013 after Assad deployed chemical weapons that killed hundreds of civilians, and laying the groundwork for Islamic militants to establish a beachhead in the country. But amid the hectoring of Biden, Trump team officials acknowledge that the Biden White House has worked diligently to keep Trump's circle apprised and help ensure there is a smooth handoff on national security matters. 'For our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity that they can play one administration off the other, they’re wrong, and we are — we are hand in glove,' Mike Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said in a Fox News interview last month. 'We are one team with the United States in this transition.' While Trump rarely has a good word for the Democratic administration, there's an appreciation in Trump world of how the Biden White House has gone about sharing critical national security information, according to a Trump transition official who was not authorized to comment publicly. The coordination is precisely how lawmakers intended for incoming and outgoing administrations to conduct themselves during a handover when they bolstered federal support for transitions. It's already the most substantive handoff process since 2009, aides to Biden and Trump acknowledged, surpassing Trump's chaotic first takeover in 2017 and his wide refusal to cooperate with the incoming Biden team in 2021. Trump's pick to serve as special envoy to the Middle East, Florida real estate developer Steve Witkoff, consulted with Biden administration officials as he recently traveled to Mideast to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive talks and spoke on condition of anonymity. Sullivan, who was to travel to Israel on Wednesday for talks with Netanyahu, has in turn kept Waltz in the loop about the Biden administration's efforts at getting a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza before Trump's inauguration. Biden administration officials say that the two national security teams have also closely coordinated on Ukraine and Syria, though they have provided scant detail on what that coordination has looked like. 'Let me put it this way: Nothing that we’re doing and nothing that we’re saying are coming as a surprise to the incoming team,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. 'They will decide for themselves what policies they might want to keep in place, what approaches they might want to continue and which ones they won’t.' Trump made clear during his campaign that he would move to end the war in Ukraine quickly once he came to office. He called on Russian leader Vladimir Putin earlier this week to act to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine. But the Biden White House has begun gently — and publicly — making the case for how continued support for Ukraine lines up with Trump's priorities. On Saturday, Sullivan pointed to comments made by Trump on social media to buttress the case that Biden’s push for continued support of Ukraine falls in line with the incoming president’s thinking. Trump earlier that day had noted that Assad’s rule was collapsing because Russia 'lost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine, where close to 600,000 Russian soldiers lay wounded or dead, in a war that should never have started, and could go on forever.' 'Russia and Iran are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success,' Trump said in the posting on Truth Social. Sullivan underscored that Biden and Trump are in agreement that there should be no American boots on the ground in Syria and that the war in Ukraine was a major factor in Assad’s fall. 'I was a little bit struck by it — earlier in the post, he said part of the reason this is happening is because of Russia’s war against Ukraine,' Sullivan said of Trump. 'And I think he even referenced the sheer scale of the casualties that Russia has suffered in Ukraine, and for that reason, they’re not in a position to defend their client, Assad. And on that point, we’re in vigorous agreement.' Two days later in Washington, Sullivan made the case that Trump should bolster the little-known U.S. International Development Finance Corporation that was created during the Republican’s first term. The push for reauthorizing the foreign aid agency comes as Trump has promised to make massive cuts to the federal bureaucracy. Trump signed into law the agency's authority -- tucked into a five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration — to provide $60 billion in loans, loan guarantees and insurance to companies in developing nations. Sullivan called the agency an effective tool for private-public partnerships, before allowing that 'maybe I shouldn’t be the one' making the case 'since I’m leaving, but I will give my advice anyway.' 'It was created as we’ve all noted, under the Trump administration,' Sullivan said in remarks at the agency’s annual conference. 'It has been strengthened under the Biden administration. And as we look to DFC reauthorization next year, it has to remain a bipartisan priority.' After Assad's government fell, the Biden administration issued a warning to Iran not to speed up its nuclear program after one of its closest allies was toppled, declaring 'that’ll never happen on our watch.' The U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, hinted at coordination on the matter with the Trump team. The official said there had been 'good discussions' with the incoming administration on the matter and there was an expectation the same policy would carry over. Biden has also approved a new national security memorandum that is meant to serve as a road map for the incoming Trump administration as it looks to counter growing cooperation between China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House announced Wednesday. Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it will go about dealing with the tightening relationships between the United States’ most prominent adversaries and competitors, according to two other senior administration officials. One of those officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, sought to assure the incoming Trump team that the Biden White House effort 'isn't trying to box them in or tilt them toward one policy option or another.' Instead, the official said, it's about helping the next administration build 'capacity' as it shapes its policies on some the most difficult foreign policies it will face.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-foreign-policy-ukraine-syria-mideast-d9bdefb745fc3a54b9f32e8e690bf04c	2024-12-11T09:22:44-08:00	
Vatican's keffiyeh Nativity scene raises eyebrows and then disappears — at least until Christmas Eve	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis presided over his weekly general audience Wednesday alongside a Palestinian-crafted Nativity scene that was missing its eyebrow-raising signature element: a keffiyeh-draped manger holding the infant Jesus. The wooden Nativity scene in the Vatican’s main audience hall had generated headlines when it was unveiled Dec. 7 because of the presence of the keffiyeh, the black-and-white checkered headscarf that has become a potent symbol of the Palestinian cause. Pope Francis had prayed before the creche briefly that day when he greeted the artists and donors responsible for all the Vatican’s Christmas decorations this year, which include various depictions of the manger in a Bethlehem stable where Jesus is said to have been born. This year, the Nativity scenes were made by Bethlehem-based artisans. Representatives of the Palestinian Embassy to the Holy See, as well as special representatives of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, had been on hand at the Vatican that day for the unveiling. By Wednesday, when Francis was seen again in the audience hall, the keffiyeh, manger and infant Jesus had been removed from the Nativity scene, while the figures of parents Mary and Joseph remained. While it is tradition in the Vatican for the infant Jesus to only be placed in the manger on Dec. 24, when Catholics celebrate the birth of Jesus, often the mangers remain in the scenes empty until that date. The Christ figure had apparently been placed in the manger on Dec. 7 to show off the finished product while the donors, artisans and pope were there to see it. A Palestinian official said the Vatican had removed the keffiyeh without explanation, and it was unclear whether it would be restored on Dec. 24. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA, in its report on the unveiling, noted the significance of the Jesus figure being wrapped in a keffiyeh. During the encounter with the Christmas donors, Francis again referred to the 'martyred Palestine' and, noting the broader conflict, repeated his call for an end to war. The Holy Land, including Bethlehem, is home to a small Christian community. 'Let us remember the brothers and sisters who, instead, right there and in other parts of the world, are suffering from the tragedy of war,' he said. 'With tears in our eyes, let us raise our prayer for peace. Brothers and sisters, enough war, enough violence!' Francis has called for Hamas to release hostages taken from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but he has long been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. He recently caused an uproar when he called for an investigation to determine if Israel's attacks in Gaza constituted genocide. Two Palestinian children presented the pope with a 'Bethlehem Star' award, which WAFA said was a 'powerful reminder of the suffering and sorrow endured by Palestinian children amid the ongoing Israeli war and blockade in Gaza.' The Israeli Embassy to the Holy See declined to comment on whether it had complained about the keffiyeh creche or asked for it to be removed. Vatican officials merely recalled Vatican tradition that calls for the infant Jesus to only appear in the manger on Christmas Eve. PLO executive committee member Ramzi Khoury who attended the unveiling, expressed deep gratitude for what he said was the pope’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and his tireless efforts to end the war on Gaza and promote justice, WAFA said. Coincidentally, Francis on Thursday is due to meet Abbas, the Palestinian president, at the Vatican. ___ Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Ontario premier says US energy exports will be cut off if Trump imposes sweeping tariffs on Canada	TORONTO (AP) — The premier of Canada's most populous province said Wednesday he will cut off energy to the United States if President-elect Donald Trump imposes sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products. Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. 'We're going to put our list together, and I'm sure the other provinces will as well. But we will go to the full extent, depending on how far this goes. We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy,' Ontario Premier Doug Ford said after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other provincial premiers. Ford said he didn't want this to happen but wasn't optimistic Canada could avoid tariffs. 'This fight is 100% coming on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21,' he said, referencing to the date of Trump’s inauguration. 'We will use every tool in our tool box to fight back. We can’t sit back and roll over. We just won’t as a country. And isn’t this a shame, our closest friends and allies.' About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. It wasn't immediately clear if Ford was talking about all Canadian provinces cutting off energy exports to the U.S. or just his province. But a spokeswoman for Ford, Grace Lee, said it was raised in the call between Trudeau and the provincial premiers. 'Premier Ford can only speak on behalf of Ontario, but its an area of provincial jurisdiction that we would certainly look at,' Lee said in an email. Lee noted Ontario powered 1.5 million homes in the U.S. in 2023 and is a major exporter of electricity to Michigan, Minnesota and New York. Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the threat. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing for national security. 'Canada, of course, will respond to unjustified tariffs,' Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said after the meeting. Freeland said a number of provincial premiers voiced support for a robust response to the tariffs and said that included critical minerals that are exported to the U.S. She didn't specifically mention oil but said 'obviously other ideas were discussed as well' when asked if Canada is considering cutting off oil exports to America. About a third of Canada's trade to the U.S. is energy. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US $2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Canada has promised more border security spending to address Trump's concerns. Ford said that will include more border and police officers as well as drones and sniffer dogs. 'A priority will be to share details of this plan with the incoming Trump administration and with Canadians in the coming days,' Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said. Trudeau said this week tariffs would be 'absolutely devastating' for the Canadian economy, but it would also mean real hardship for Americans. Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods. The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington-based trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate. Canada imposed duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canada’s central bank, meanwhile, lowered its key interest rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday and called Trump’s threat to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada 'a major source of new uncertainty.' 'We did underline that the threat of new tariffs on Canadian exports, particularly at the level suggested, that is a major source of new uncertainty,' Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem said at a press conference. 'But the reality is we don't know if those tariffs are going to be implemented. 'We don't know if exemptions are going to be agreed on some parts, we don't know at what level, we don't know if Canada will take retaliatory measures.' Trudeau, meanwhile, got the attention of billionaire Elon Musk, a big supporter of Trump, with comments he made Tuesday lamenting that U.S. voters selected Trump over Kamala Harris as president. 'We were supposed to be on a steady if difficult sometimes march toward progress. And yet, just a few weeks ago, the United States voted for a second time to not elect its first woman president,' Trudeau said at a event sponsored by Equal Voice, an organization dedicated to improving gender representation in Canadian politics. 'Everywhere, women’s rights and women’s progress is under attack — overtly and subtly.' Musk called Trudeau 'insufferable' in a post on X. 'Won't be in power for much longer,' he wrote. Ford also criticized Trudeau for the remarks. 'They are not helpful at all. It was brought up a couple of times in our meeting,' Ford said. 'Donald Trump was elected democratically. If you like him or you don’t like him that’s not our issue. We elect Canadians and it was not helpful whatsoever. I’m sure the prime minister got the message loud and clear.'	https://apnews.com/article/canada-interest-rate-cut-trump-tariffs-c0ef920ffb02ea0531c93516abad64e0	2024-12-11T09:15:38-08:00	
Syrians flock to morgues looking for loved ones who perished in Assad's prisons	DAMASCUS (AP) — Mohammad Chaeeb spoke softly into his phone, telling a relative the grim news: He found his brother at the morgue. 'I saw him and said my goodbyes,' he said. His gaze lingered on the blackened body of Sami Chaeeb, whose teeth were bared and whose eye sockets were empty. It looked as if he had died screaming. 'He doesn’t look normal. He doesn’t even have eyes.' The dead man was jailed five months ago, disappearing into a dark prison system under the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. His body is just one of many found in Syrian detention centers and prisons since Assad's government fell last weekend. Some of the prisoners died just weeks ago. Others perished months earlier. Syrians across the world are now circulating images of the bodies in hope of seeing slain loved ones whose fate had been a mystery. At the morgue visited by The Associated Press on Wednesday in Damascus, families flocked to a wall where some of the pictures were pinned in a haunting gallery of the dead. Relatives desperately scanned the images for a recognizable face. Mohammad Chaeeb never knew why his brother had been imprisoned. 'We heard stories — cannabis, organ trafficking, drugs, weapon trading. But he had nothing to do with any of that,' he said. He rushed to the morgue after another brother living in Turkey sent him a photo of a body that looked familiar. He was able to identify his brother by a mole under his ear and a half-amputated finger, an injury from when he was 12. Standing over the body, he lifted the drape and gently pulled out his brother’s left hand, examining it closely. 'Here,' he said, pointing to the stump. Nearby, forensic workers worked rapidly to identify the bodies and hand them over to relatives. Yasser Qasser, a forensic assistant at the morgue, said they received 40 bodies that morning from the hospital that were being fingerprinted and having DNA samples taken. The staff had already identified about eight, he said. 'But dozens of families are arriving, and the numbers don’t match.' Some bodies came from the notorious Saydnaya Prison, still dressed in prisoner uniforms, Qasser said. His colleague, Dr. Abdallah Youssef, said identifying all of them would take time. 'We understand the suffering of the families, but we are working under immense pressure. The bodies were found in salt rooms, exposed to extreme cold,' he said. Morgue officials who examined the corpses have seen bullet wounds and marks that appeared to be the result of torture, he added. An estimated 150,000 people have been detained or reported missing in Syria since 2011. Under Assad’s rule, any whiff of dissent could send someone to prison immediately. For years, it was a sentence akin to death, as few ever emerged from the system. Citing testimony from freed prisoners and prison officials, Amnesty International has reported that thousands of Syrians were killed in frequent mass executions. Prisoners were subjected to constant torture, intense beatings and rape. Inmates frequently died from injuries, disease or starvation. Some fell into psychosis and starved themselves, the human rights group said. Among the bodies at the morgue Wednesday was Mazen al-Hamada, a Syrian activist who fled to Europe but returned to Syria in 2020 and was imprisoned upon arrival. His mangled corpse was found wrapped in a bloody sheet in Saydnaya. As they searched the morgue, some families moved among the bodies, weeping quietly and pausing to look for familiar features. The bodies lay covered in white shrouds, each marked with a number and some bearing the label 'unknown.' Hilala Meryeh, a 64-year-old Palestinian mother of four, stood in the dingy identification room, bags of bodies all around her. She had just found one of her sons. She paused, screwed her eyes closed and turned her face toward the ceiling, murmuring a prayer. Her four boys were arrested by the former Syrian regime in 2013 during a crackdown on the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk. She still needed to find three. 'I don’t know where they are,' she said. 'Give me my children, search for my children!' 'Why did he do this to his people?' Meryeh cried out. 'Imprison them, we wouldn’t have objected. Try them, but to slaughter them?' Other Syrians, like Imad Habbal, stood motionless in the morgue, coming to grips with the reality and injustice of their loss. Habbal gazed at the body of his brother, Diaa Habbal. 'We came yesterday, and we found him dead,' he said. 'They killed him. Why? What was his crime? What did he ever do to them? Just because he came back to his country?' Diaa Habbal, a Syrian who had been living in Saudi Arabia since 2003, returned to Damascus in mid-2024 to visit his family, his brother said. He was arrested by the Syrian military police six months ago on charges of evading military service. With trembling hands, Imad Habbal lifted the covering, his voice breaking as he wept and spoke to his brother. 'I told you not to come,' he said. 'I wish you didn’t come.' ___ Associated Press writers Julia Frankel in Jerusalem and Sally Abou AlJoud in Beirut contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-rebels-assad-morgues-death-c64f6f4f3e03e7d063dc90f03ccd4c4b	2024-12-11T09:01:52-08:00	
America's closest ally in Syria is losing ground as a new order takes shape	The jihadi rebels who toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad say they want to build a unified, inclusive country. But after nearly 14 years of civil war, putting that ideal into practice will not be easy. For Syria’s Kurdish minority, America’s closest ally in the country, the struggle for a new order is entering a potentially even more challenging phase. Over the course of Syria’s civil war, Kurdish fighters have fended off an array of armed factions, partnered with the U.S. to rout the Islamic State group and carved out a largely autonomous region in the country’s oil-rich east. But the gains of the non-Arab Kurds are now at risk. The ascendance of the Sunni Arab rebels who overthrew Assad — with vital help from Turkey, a longtime foe of the Kurds — will make it hard for the Kurds to find a place in the new Syria and could prolong the conflict. The jihadi rebels who rode into Damascus over the weekend have made peaceful overtures to the Kurds. But the rebels violently drove Kurdish fighters out of the eastern city of Deir al-Zour days after government forces abandoned it. To the north, a separate opposition faction backed by Turkey that has been battling the Kurds for years seized the town of Manbij. And Turkey carried out airstrikes on a Kurdish convoy it said was carrying heavy weapons looted from government arsenals. The Kurds have long counted on U.S. aid in the face of such challenges. Around 900 American troops are in eastern Syria, where they partner with Kurdish forces to prevent an Islamic State resurgence. But the future of that mission will be thrown into doubt under president-elect Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical about U.S. involvement in Syria. Here's a closer look at the predicament the Kurds find themselves in. Who are the U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters in Syria? The Kurds are among the largest stateless ethnic groups in the world, with some 30 million concentrated in a territory straddling Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. They are a minority in each country and have often suffered persecution, which has fueled armed Kurdish uprisings. In Syria, they carved out an autonomous enclave early in the civil war, never fully siding with the Assad government or the rebels seeking to topple him. When the Islamic State group seized a third of the country in 2014, Kurdish fighters — who are secular and include women in their ranks — proved their mettle in early battles against the extremists, earning support from the U.S.-led coalition. They formed a group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, which also includes Arab fighters, and drove the Islamic State group out of large areas of Syria with help from U.S.-led airstrikes and American special forces. In 2017, these Kurdish-led forces captured Raqqa, the capital of the extremists' self-styled caliphate. Why is Turkey fighting the Kurds? Turkey has long viewed the SDF as an extension of the decades-old Kurdish insurgency within its own borders. It considers the main Kurdish faction a terrorist group on par with the Islamic State and has said it should have no presence in the new Syria. In recent years, Turkey has trained and funded fighters known as the Syrian National Army, helping them wrest control of territory from the Kurds in northern Syria along the border with Turkey. These Turkish-backed fighters have portrayed themselves as part of the opposition against Assad, but analysts say they are largely driven by opportunism and hatred of the Kurds. The Kurds have focused on battling the SNA in recent years. But the new leadership in Damascus, which also has longstanding ties to Turkey, could open another, much longer front. How do the Syrian rebels view the Kurds? The main rebel faction is led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, a former al-Qaida militant who cut ties with the group eight years ago and says he wants to build a new Syria free of dictatorship that will serve all its religious and ethnic communities. Nawaf Khalil, head of the Germany-based Center for Kurdish Studies, said the early signs were positive. He said the rebels steered clear of two SDF-controlled enclaves of Aleppo when they stormed the city two weeks ago at the start of their rapid advance across the country. 'It is also positive that they did not speak negatively about the Syrian Democratic Forces,' he said. It remains to be seen if those sentiments will endure. After sweeping into Deir al-Zour this week, a fighter from al-Sharaa's group posted a video saying they would soon advance toward Raqqa and other areas of eastern Syria, raising the possibility of further clashes with the Kurds. The rebels could still seek some kind of agreement with the Kurds to incorporate them into the post-Assad political order, but that would likely require accepting a degree of Kurdish autonomy in the east. It would also risk angering Turkey, which now appears to be the chief power broker in Syria. Will the Trump administration support the Kurds? The top U.S. military commander for the Middle East, Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, met with SDF forces in Syria on Tuesday, in a sign of the Biden administration's commitment to the alliance post-Assad. But things could change on Jan. 20. Trump has provided few details about his Middle East policy, aside from saying he wants to end the region's wars and keep the United States out of them. In a social media post shortly before Assad was overthrown, Trump wrote that 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, &amp; THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT.' During his previous term, in 2019, Trump abandoned the Kurds ahead of a Turkish incursion, casting it as the fulfillment of a campaign promise to end U.S. involvement in the region's 'endless wars.' The move prompted heavy criticism, including from prominent Republicans who accused him of betraying an ally. Trump backtracked weeks later, approving a wider mission to secure oil fields in the east. The troops remained where they were and the alliance endured. ___ Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed. ___ Follow the AP's Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-war-assad-kurds-rebels-turkey-us-2b4af609c4dcf853ac6d7a22d3dccf5d	2024-12-11T07:50:01-08:00	
Brazil’s President Lula to undergo a new surgery after initial procedure for brain bleed	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will undergo another surgery, doctors at the Sirio-Libanes hospital where the leftist leader is being treated said Wednesday. The minimally invasive procedure that doctors will perform on Lula is called middle meningeal artery embolization and aims to stop persistent bleeding on the surface of the brain, according to the University of California San Francisco’s definition. On Tuesday, the 79-year-old leader underwent surgery for a brain bleed after suffering complications resulting from a fall at home in October. Doctors told journalists after the operation that Lula would remain in intensive care for 48 hours. But doctors on Wednesday said he would undergo another surgery on Thursday. Lula 'spent the day well,' doctors said in their updated statement. 'He underwent physiotherapy, walked and received visits from family members,' they added. Lula remains in intensive care. In an earlier statement on Wednesday, doctors said the Brazilian president was lucid and had his bearings, and that he remained hooked up to a surgical drain as he awaits further routine tests. After the first surgery, doctors had said that there would be no aftereffects and that Lula was expected to return to the capital, Brasilia, at the beginning of next week. Until then, they said, he would be unable to work. Doctors will hold a press conference at 10 a.m. local time on Thursday to provide further updates, they said. Lula canceled a trip to Russia for a BRICS summit after the accident, his office said at the time. It left him with a visible cut on the back of his head, slightly above his neck. Fagnislainny Fernandes, a 40-year-old visual artist, said she went to the hospital 'out of compassion' for Lula. 'This country, unfortunately, has a lot of misinformation and so I came personally to find out if this situation is really happening,' she said. ___ AP videojournalists Thiago Mostazo and Maycron Abade contributed to this report. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-health-surgery-5331cb91a03e0880c10dae81ed643cc6	2024-12-11T07:24:52-08:00	
Macron seeks political deal to name a new prime minister and restore France's stability	PARIS (AP) — French president Emmanuel Macron is seeking a political deal that would allow him to both name a new prime minister and 'guarantee the stability of the country,' following the resignation of ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier, a spokesperson for the outgoing government said Wednesday. Maud Bregeon, the spokesperson, said Macron insisted there was at the moment no 'broader' political alliance than the current one between his centrist allies and conservatives from The Republicans party, which does not have a majority at parliament. She was relaying comments made by Macron during a weekly Cabinet meeting. Last week, the French president vowed to stay in office until the end of his term, due in 2027. The move followed a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes in the National Assembly left France without a functioning government. Barnier’s government has been tasked with handling current affairs pending the appointment of a new prime minister. Two options are still being considered by Macron, Bregeon reported. The first one would be to find a way to 'broaden the alliance,' she said, implicitly suggesting some leftists could join the government in addition to centrists and conservatives. That could give the future government a majority in the assembly. The other option would be to make a deal with opposition parties on the left so that they commit not to vote any no-confidence motion -- even though they would not be governing parties, Bregeon said. Macron did not provided any firm deadline for naming a new prime minister, she said. Since last week, Macron has held talks with politicians from the left and the right, including Socialist leaders who now appear as key in efforts to form a more stable government. Discussions have not involved the far-right National Rally party led by Marine Le Pen nor the hard-left France Unbowed party of Jean-Luc Mélenchon since Macron said he would only speak with more moderate political forces. Le Pen, who helped ousting Barnier by supporting the no-confidence motion, demanded on Wednesday her party's proposals on preserving the purchasing power of the French to be taken into account by the future government. The next prime minister knows 'what needs to be done to work in decent conditions,' that is 'talk to all political forces and build a budget that doesn't cross the red lines of each party,' Le Pen said. She concluded: 'It's perfectly doable.' On Wednesday, the outgoing government unveiled a special bill meant to enable the state to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year’s rules, and avoid a shutdown. The bill, expected to be approved by parliament by the end of the year, is 'temporary,' outgoing budget minister Laurent Saint-Martin said. 'It aims to ensure ... the continuity of the nation’s life, the regular functioning of public services and the fulfillment of our financial commitments.' A proper budget law for year 2025 will then need to be presented by the new government and approved at parliament in the coming months, Saint-Martin said.	https://apnews.com/article/france-new-prime-minister-macron-barnier-lepen-26d09486d37c741a7c048f09e65f0ca3	2024-12-11T05:35:40-08:00	
North Macedonia court delays language law ruling amid ethnic tensions	SKOPJE. North Macedonia (AP) — North Macedonia’s Constitutional Court on Wednesday postponed a ruling on a controversial law concerning the use of minority languages, triggering a new round of ethnic tensions in the tiny Balkan country. The 2019 law made Albanian a second official language in areas with a significant population of ethnic Albanians. It faces multiple legal challenges regarding its constitutionality, some focused on specific articles and others concerning the entire law. Court officials said the delay will allow further deliberations and input from foreign experts and could take up to three months. Ethnic Albanians make up roughly a quarter of North Macedonia’s 2 million population, in a country slightly larger than the U.S. state of Vermont. Several hundred demonstrators joined a protest outside the court Wednesday organized by the DUI, an ethnic Albanian opposition party. The party warned that any rollback would destabilize the country’s fragile ethnic balance. North Macedonia’s multi-ethnic composition was formalized in the 2001 Ohrid Agreement, which ended a brief ethnic conflict and granted broader rights to ethnic Albanians. The DUI accuses the current conservative government of attempting to undermine those gains. 'Any attempt to repeal parts of the Law on the Use of Languages would be absolutely unacceptable for us,' a DUI statement said. 'Such actions would upend the balance between communities and damage the basic pillars of the Ohrid Agreement.' The law has drawn criticism from both domestic and international observers, including the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe’s advisory body on constitutional matters. In 2019, it noted ambiguities in the law, particularly in its application to judicial proceedings. Critics also argue that it fails to clarify whether certain provisions apply solely to Albanian or to other minority languages, such as Turkish, Roma, and Serbian. Bujar Osmani, the DUI party's deputy leader, said he was concerned by the absence of ethnic minority judges during Wednesday’s session. 'Such mono-ethnic meetings or sessions have always been a harbinger of bad times in multi-ethnic states,' Osmani said. 'This is not just a cause for the Albanian language, but for the protection of a multi-ethnic European Macedonia.' Both the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party and the opposition Social Democrats have condemned the politicization of the issue. Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski accused the DUI of exploiting ethnic tensions for political gain. 'They are again abusing Albanians, Macedonians, and others, harassing everyone with attempts to divide and attract attention,' Mickoski said.	https://apnews.com/article/north-macedonia-minorities-language-albanian-0280605e825d4805749446cb91364b40	2024-12-11T05:34:23-08:00	
Scholz sets Germany on course for an early election as he requests a confidence vote next week	BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Olaf Scholz formally set Germany on course for an early election Wednesday by requesting a confidence vote in parliament next week. Five weeks after his three-party governing coalition collapsed in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany's stagnant economy, Scholz's office said he had requested the confidence vote in parliament's lower house, or Bundestag, for Monday. The aim is to hold a parliamentary election on Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally scheduled. Scholz is expected to lose Monday's vote. His center-left Social Democrats hold 207 seats in the Bundestag and their remaining coalition partners, the environmentalist Greens, have 117. That leaves his government well short of a majority in the 733-seat chamber. The confidence vote is needed because Germany's post-World War II constitution doesn't allow parliament to dissolve itself. If Scholz loses the vote, it's up to President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve the Bundestag. He has 21 days to make that decision, and once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. Polls show Scholz's party trailing behind the main opposition center-right Union bloc of challenger Friedrich Merz. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, whose Greens are further behind, is also bidding for the top job. The far-right Alternative for Germany, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it. Germany hasn't had a confidence vote since 2005, when then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder called and lost one as he engineered an early election that was narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-confidence-vote-parliament-election-0320454ead6b883ce70fff78d09df38a	2024-12-11T04:43:11-08:00	
UK spy agency releases annual Christmas card puzzle to uncover future codebreakers	LONDON (AP) — What does a spy agency give for Christmas? How about a riddle wrapped in an enigma inside a mystery. GCHQ, Britain’s electronic and cyber-intelligence agency, on Wednesday published its annual Christmas Challenge – a seasonal greeting card that doubles as a set of fiendishly difficult puzzles designed to excite young minds about solving cyphers and unearthing clues. The challenge is aimed at young people aged 11 to 18, who are encouraged to work in teams and use 'lateral thinking, ingenuity and perseverance' to crack the seven brainteasers set by GCHQ’s 'in-house puzzlers.' The card is sent by the head of GCHQ — short for Government Communications Headquarters — to other national security chiefs around the world. Puzzles were first included in 2015 and have become an annual tradition. The card can be downloaded from the GCHQ website, and has become popular with teachers – the agency says a third of British secondary schools have downloaded it. The agency admits the festive fun has an ulterior motive. GCHQ Director Anne Keast-Butler said she hoped the card would inspire young people to explore STEM subjects – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – 'and to consider what a career in cybersecurity and intelligence might have to offer.' 'The Challenge has been designed for a mix of minds to solve, so is best tackled in groups of classmates, families or friends,' she said. 'Whether you have an analytical mind, a creative brain or prefer engineering, there’s something for everyone.' The card features a map of the U.K., linked to the locations where GCHQ has bases, including its high-tech headquarters in Cheltenham, western England, nicknamed the doughnut because of its shape. Many British people are keen puzzle-solvers, and the link between puzzlers and spycraft is often celebrated – notably in the many books, films and TV shows about Bletchley Park, a complex of buildings and wooden huts northwest of London where, during World War II, hundreds of mathematicians, cryptologists, crossword puzzle experts and computer pioneers worked to crack Nazi Germany’s secret codes. Historians say their work shortened World War II by as much as two years.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-gchq-spy-agency-christmas-card-puzzle-33ab57e85479141ae18fd8abdef2d00f	2024-12-11T04:35:16-08:00	
Father and stepmother of 10-year-old girl found dead in England are convicted of her murder	LONDON (AP) — The father and stepmother of a 10-year-old girl found dead in her home in England were found guilty Wednesday of her murder. Urfan Sharif, 42, was accused of Sara Sharif’s murder alongside his partner, 30-year-old Beinash Batool. His brother, 29-year-old Faisal Malik, was found guilty of causing or allowing the girl's death. Police found Sara’s body under a blanket in a bunk bed at her home in Woking, southwest of London, on Aug. 10, 2023, with dozens of injuries including extensive bruising, burns and fractures. A post-mortem examination concluded she died of unnatural causes. Prosecutors have said that all three defendants played a part in a 'campaign of abuse' against Sara in the weeks leading to her death. The three fled the U.K. for Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, on Aug. 9, the day after Sara was believed to have died. The discovery was made after Urfan Sharif called U.K. police from Pakistan to say he had 'legally punished her, and she died,' prosecutors said. He told the phone operator it wasn’t his intention to kill her but he had 'beat her up too much,' they said. Police in Pakistan found the three suspects after an extensive search and put them on a flight to the U.K. They were arrested upon arrival at London’s Gatwick Airport. Batool and Malik had declined to give evidence. They denied involvement in the abuse. Prosecutor William Emlyn Jones has said all three defendants lived in the same house as Sara and that it was 'inconceivable' that just one of them had acted alone. He alleged that each of the suspects sought to point the finger at the others. He said Sharif’s case was that Batool, Sara’s stepmother, was responsible for the girl’s death, and he made a false confession to protect her. He said that violence against Sara became so normalized that no one batted an eye when she appeared with bruises at a family barbeque. Yet Sara was feisty and dreamed of being a fairytale princess. Her spirit came across on a video taken just two days before her death showing her dancing at home, despite multiple broken bones and iron burns on her bottom. 'Seeing the footage of Sara laughing and joking even when she had signs of injuries to her body and knowing what a happy child she was at school, she loved singing and dancing, and knowing what happened to her, those are the most affecting parts of the case,' Libby Clark, a specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service said.	https://apnews.com/article/sara-sharif-uk-pakistan-murder-c01b9b8285966b26ffc4e6dbcfe1b146	2024-12-11T04:17:12-08:00	
Haiti's main international airport reopens one month after gang violence forced it to close	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Haiti’s main international airport reopened on Wednesday, one month after it closed for the second time this year because of gang violence. Haitian soldiers and police, bolstered by Kenyan police leading a U.N.-backed mission to quell gang violence, boosted security in the area, and a test flight was successful, Haiti’s government said in a statement. The Toussaint Louverture airport in Port-au-Prince closed in mid-November after gangs opened fire on a Spirit Airlines flight that was preparing to land, striking a flight attendant who suffered minor injuries. Other commercial planes were also hit that day, prompting Spirit, JetBlue and American Airlines to cancel their flights to Haiti. A day later, the Federal Aviation Administration banned U.S. airlines from flying to the Caribbean country for 30 days. It wasn’t immediately clear which flights would resume on Wednesday to Port-au-Prince. The FAA’s ban is in place until Thursday. Spokespeople for Spirit, JetBlue and American Airlines did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The Guy Malary terminal, which serves domestic flights, also reopened on Wednesday. For the past month, the only international airport operating in Haiti was the one in the northern coastal town of Cap-Haitien, but traveling there by land is dangerous since gangs control the main roads leading out of Port-au-Prince and are known for opening fire on public transport. The few who could afford to escape the surge of gang violence in the capital this past month paid thousands of dollars for private air transport to Cap-Haitien. The airport in Port-au-Prince closed for nearly three months earlier this year after gangs launched coordinated attacks on key government infrastructure starting in late February. Some 5,000 people have been reported killed in Haiti this year, including more than 100 in a recent massacre in a gang-controlled community in Port-au-Prince. ___ Associated Press writer Dánica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-international-airport-reopen-gang-violence-c3890d9c79df18745e748d8715efad00	2024-12-11T03:54:23-08:00	
TikTok files challenge against Canadian government order to dissolve its business in the country	TikTok has challenged a Canadian government order to shut down the Chinese video-sharing app's business operations in the country that was imposed over national security concerns. The company said Tuesday that it filed an application for a judicial review with the Federal Court in Vancouver on Dec. 5, which seeks to set aside the order for TikTok to wind-up and cease its business in Canada. The Canadian federal government last month announced it was ordering the dissolution of TikTok Technology Canada Inc. after a national security review of its Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. The government is not blocking access to the TikTok app, which will continue to be available to Canadians. TikTok said it has 14 million users in Canada, which is about a third of the population. It has offices in Toronto and Vancouver. The wildly popular platform is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020, but is under increasing pressure in the West. It's facing a possible ban in the U.S. and intensifying scrutiny in Europe over issues including election influence campaigns allegedly coordinated by Moscow. TikTok argues in its court application, which was posted online, that Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne's decision was 'unreasonable' and 'driven by improper purposes.' It says the order is 'grossly disproportionate' and the the national security review was 'procedurally unfair.' The review was carried out through the Investment Canada Act, which allows the government to investigate foreign investment with potential to harm national security. Champagne said in a statement at the time that the government was taking action to address 'specific national security risks,' but did not elaborate. His office said in response to the filling that the government’s decision was informed by a 'thorough national security review and advice from Canada’s security and intelligence community.' TikTok said Champagne 'failed to engage with TikTok Canada on the purported substance of the concerns' that led to the order. It argues the government ordered 'measures that bear no rational connection to the national security risks it identifies' and that the reasons for the order 'are unintelligible, fail to reveal a rational chain of analysis and are rife with logical fallacies.' The platform says there were 'less onerous' options than shutting down its Canadian business, which it said would eliminate hundreds of jobs, threaten business contracts and 'cause the destruction of significant economic opportunities.'	https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-canada-social-media-52e820e4e912ad031691c322fbb9b546	2024-12-11T03:30:02-08:00	
An explosion in the Afghan capital kills the Taliban refugee minister, officials say	ISLAMABAD (AP) — A suicide bombing in the Afghan capital on Wednesday killed the Taliban refugee minister and two others, Interior Ministry officials said. The explosion struck inside the ministry, killing Khalil Haqqani, the refugee minister, officials said. The officials provided no further details. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Khalil Haqqani is the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the acting interior minister who leads a powerful network within the Taliban. Haqqani was the most high-profile casualty of a bombing in Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power three years ago. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. In March 2023, a bomb killed a Taliban-appointed provincial governor, Daud Muzmal, and two others in Afghanistan’s Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of Balkh province. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the killing of Haqqani. Dar, who is also deputy prime minister, wrote on the X platform that he was 'deeply shocked' at the killing of Haqqani and 'loss of precious lives as a result of a terrorist attack' in Kabul. 'We offer our heartfelt condolences,' he said, adding, 'Pakistan unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.' Dar said Pakistan was in touch with Kabul to get further details. The Islamic State group’s affiliate, a major rival of the ruling Taliban, has carried out previous attacks across Afghanistan. In early September, a suicide bomber in the southwestern Qala Bakhtiar neighborhood in Kabul killed at least six people, wounding 13 others. IS had claimed responsibility for the attack.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-explosion-refugee-minister-taliban-6b7044402f0741916584fc40dfc6da6e	2024-12-11T02:40:08-08:00	
Romania's pro-Western parties agree to form a majority government after political turmoil	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania’s pro-European parties agreed Wednesday to form a majority government made up of groupings that were traditionally on opposite sides and shutting out far-right nationalists who made significant gains in the election on Dec. 1. Pro-Western parties won the most votes, with the leftist Social Democratic Party, or PSD, topping the polls. The PSD reached agreement late Tuesday to form a grand coalition with the center-right National Liberal Party, or PNL, the reformist Save Romania Union party, USR, and the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party. The parliamentary election came hard on the heels of a presidential vote in which the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu won the first round. His surprise success plunged the European Union and NATO member country into turmoil as allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference emerged. Days before the Dec. 8 presidential runoff, the Constitutional Court made the unprecedented move to annul the presidential race. A statement from the new coalition said the parties would potentially support a 'common pro-European candidate' in the new presidential elections. It isn’t yet clear whether Georgescu will be allowed to run in the new vote. President Klaus Iohannis, whose second term is set to expire later this month, said a new date for the rerun presidential election would be set once the new government has taken office. He signed a decree on Wednesday to convene parliament on Dec. 20. 'In the coming days, the four parties and the representatives of the national minorities will work on a joint governing program, focusing on development and reforms, while addressing the priorities of Romanian citizens,' the coalition statement said. Elena Lasconi, the leader of USR who was set to face Georgescu in the annulled presidential runoff, said after the agreement was reached that 'Romania is going through a very difficult' period and that cutting state spending and reducing bureaucracy would be part of the governing program. In 2021, despite historically being Romania’s two main opposition parties that have dominated post-communist politics, the PSD and the PNL formed an unlikely but increasingly strained coalition together with UDMR, which exited the Cabinet last year after a power-sharing dispute.	https://apnews.com/article/romania-government-parliament-georgescu-elections-europe-psd-d897d4c03825004637e340fb5205f96a	2024-12-11T02:04:00-08:00	
FIFA prepares to give Saudi Arabia its biggest sports win yet as host of the 2034 World Cup	ZURICH (AP) — Saudi Arabia will be confirmed by FIFA as host of the men's soccer 2034 World Cup on Wednesday, giving the oil-rich kingdom its biggest prize yet for massive spending on global sports driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The decision completes a mostly opaque 15-month bid process which FIFA president Gianni Infantino helped steer toward Saudi Arabia without a rival candidate, without taking questions, and which human rights groups warn will put the lives of migrant workers at risk. FIFA and Saudi officials say hosting the 2034 tournament can accelerate change, including more freedoms and rights for women. A fast-track path to victory was cleared last year by FIFA accepting a three-continent hosting plan for the 2030 World Cup led by Spain, Portugal and Morocco. That bid also will win Wednesday in a combined approval for the 2030 and 2034 tournament hosts by applause from more than 200 FIFA member federations in an online meeting hosted from Zurich by Infantino. It will kick off a decade of scrutiny on Saudi labor laws and treatment of workers mostly from South Asia needed to help build and upgrade 15 stadiums, plus hotels and transport networks ahead of the 104-game tournament. One of the stadiums is planned to be 350 meters (yards) above the ground in Neom — a futuristic city that does not yet exist — and another named for the crown prince is designed to be atop a 200-meter cliff near Riyadh. During the bid campaign, FIFA has accepted limited scrutiny of Saudi Arabia’s human rights record that was widely criticized this year at the United Nations. Saudi and international rights groups and activists warned FIFA it has not learned the lessons of Qatar’s much-criticized preparations to host the 2022 World Cup. The kingdom plans to spend tens of billion of dollars on projects related to the World Cup as part of the crown prince’s sweeping Vision 2030 project that aims to modernize Saudi society and economy. At its core is spending on sports by the $900 billion sovereign wealth operation, the Public Investment Fund, which he oversees. Critics have called it 'sportswashing' of the kingdom's reputation. The prince, known as MBS, has built close working ties to Infantino since 2017 — aligning with the organizer of sport’s most-watched event rather than directly confronting the established system as it did with the disruptive LIV Golf project. The result for Saudi Arabia and FIFA has been smooth progress toward the win Wednesday with limited pushback from soccer officials, though some from women international players. The steady flow of Saudi cash into international soccer is set to increase. FIFA created a new and higher World Cup sponsor category for state oil firm Aramco, and Saudi funding is set to underwrite the 2025 Club World Cup in the United States that is a pet project for Infantino. North American soccer body CONCACAF signed a multi-year deal with PIF, Saudi stadiums host Super Cup games for Italy and Spain, and nearly 50 FIFA member federations have signed working agreements with Saudi counterparts. Lavish spending by PIF-owned Saudi clubs in the past two years buying and paying players – including Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Karim Benzema and Sadio Mané – put hundreds of millions of dollars into European soccer. That influence could be key in talks to agree which months to play the 2034 World Cup. The November-December slot taken by Qatar in 2022 to avoid extreme midsummer heat is complicated in 2034 by the holy month of Ramadan through mid-December and Riyadh hosting the multi-sport Asian Games. Still, January 2034 could be an option — and likely better for European clubs and leagues —after the International Olympic Committee said it saw few issues in clashing with the Salt Lake Winter Games opening Feb. 10, 2034. The IOC also has a major commercial deal with Saudi Arabia, to host the new Esports Olympics. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/fifa-world-cup-2030-2034-saudi-arabia-spain-portugal-945f8d7bf332553de0726901d096b956	2024-12-11T01:55:57-08:00	
Biden approves national security memo on China, Iran, North Korea and Russia ahead of Trump's return	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has approved a new national security memorandum ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House that could serve as a road map for the incoming administration as it looks to counter growing cooperation among China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House said Wednesday. Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it deals with the tightening relationships involving America's most prominent adversaries and competitors, according to two senior administration officials. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the classified memorandum would not be made public because of the sensitivity of some of its findings. The document includes four broad recommendations: improving U.S. government interagency cooperation, speeding up the sharing of information with allies about the four adversaries, calibrating the U.S. government's use of sanctions and other economic tools for maximum effectiveness, and bolstering preparation to manage simultaneous crises involving the adversaries. The U.S. for many years has been concerned about cooperation among the four countries. Coordination has accelerated between the countries in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The officials noted that as Russia has become more isolated by much of the world, Moscow has turned to Iran for drones and missiles. From North Korea, the Russians have received artillery, missiles and even thousands of troops that have traveled to help the Russians try to repel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region. China, meanwhile, has supported Russia with dual use components that help keep its military industrial base afloat. In return, Russia has sent fighter jets to Iran and assisted Tehran as it looks to bolster its missile defense and space technology. North Korea has received from Russia much-needed fuel and funding to help build out its manufacturing and military capabilities. The officials added that Russia has 'de facto accepted North Korea as a nuclear weapon state.' China, meanwhile, is benefiting from Russian know-how, with the two countries working together to deepen their military technical cooperation. The two nations are also conducting joint patrols in the Arctic region. Biden and Trump have sharply different worldviews, but officials in both the incoming and outgoing administrations said they have sought to coordinate on national security issues during the transition. One of the officials said that the Biden White House memo 'isn’t trying to box (the Trump administration) in or tilt them toward one policy option or another.' The official said the document is intended to help the next administration build 'capacity' as it shapes its policies on some the most difficult foreign policies it will face.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-national-security-memorandum-6d3462b37533a2665d1e844ee6f7f662	2024-12-11T01:02:21-08:00	
2 Ukrainian women are pulled alive from rubble hours after Russian missile strike	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Rescue crews working through the night pulled two women from rubble more than seven hours after a Russian missile struck a private medical clinic in a southern Ukraine city, killing eight people and wounding 22 others, authorities said Wednesday. The women called rescue services on their cellphones to say they were buried under the rubble after the attack late Tuesday in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine’s Emergency Services said. Deadly Russian strikes on civilian areas have been a feature of the almost three-year war. Ukraine’s Western allies are sending more aid to help it keep fighting Russia’s invasion, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Zaporizhzhia strike showed that his country still needs more air defense systems. He urged Western partners to send weaponry they are holding in their arsenals. 'We currently do not have enough systems to protect our country from Russian missiles. But partners have these systems,' Zelenskyy said late Tuesday in his daily address to the nation. Air defense systems that Ukraine’s allies possess 'should save lives, and not gather dust in storage bases,' he said. Meanwhile, Ukraine kept up its long-range attacks on areas behind Russian lines that are supporting its war effort. A Ukrainian drone attack caused a blaze at an industrial facility in Russia’s Bryansk region, Gov. Alexander Bogomaz said. Air defenses downed 14 Ukrainian drones over the Bryansk region early Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Also, a Ukrainian missile attack on the city of Taganrog in the Rostov region early Wednesday damaged an industrial plant, regional Gov. Yuri Slusar said. Zelenskyy thanked Ukrainian forces for hitting what he called 'military facilities on the territory of Russia, as well as facilities of the fuel and energy complex.' 'It is precisely such long range and accuracy that step-by-step bring Russia back to reality — to the reality that the war must be ended,' he said on Telegram. It wasn't possible to verify either side's claims. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-missile-strike-zaporizhzhia-ba02d01051b57d10a6fdfa9b54e1be89	2024-12-11T00:45:08-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strike on home in northern Gaza kills 19 people, Palestinian medics say	An Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 19, Palestinian medical officials said Wednesday, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed back to the region reeling from the weekend ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Kamal Adwan Hospital said it received the bodies after the overnight strike in the town of Beit Lahiya. Hospital records show that a family of eight were among those killed, including four children, their parents and two grandparents. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has waged a renewed offensive against Hamas militants in northern Gaza since early October. Another strike in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least seven people, according to al-Awda Hospital. Records show the dead included two children, their parents and three relatives. Blinken is returning to the Middle East this week on his 12th visit since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last year but his first since Assad's ouster. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people, including children and older adults. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health officials. They say women and children make up more than half the dead but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians in their count. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the latest: Germany says it's looking for ways to work with Syria's new rulers BERLIN — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Wednesday addressed Berlin's reservations but also willingness to work the Syrian militant group in control of Damascus, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. 'Nobody overlooks the origins of HTS in the al-Qaeda ideology. It is therefore clear that we will measure HTS by its actions,' Baerbock told reporters in Berlin. 'Any cooperation presupposes that ethnic and religious minorities are protected, women’s rights are respected and acts of revenge are prevented.' She said that 'whether we like it or not, the HTS militia ... is one of the decisive actors for the future of Syria.' 'Together with our partners, we are therefore looking for an adequate way of dealing with HTS, with whom many have had no direct contact for good reasons,' she added. Ahmad al-Sharaa, the insurgent leader also known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has renounced longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicted himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon kills 1, state news agency says BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike near the southern Lebanese town of Bin Jbeil killed one person and wounded another, the state news agency reported. National News Agency said Wednesday’s airstrike hit a home. It gave no further details and there was no immediate comment from Israeli military. More than a dozen people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes since a ceasefire went into effect on Nov. 27, ending the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war. Blinken is returning to the Middle East WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is returning to the Middle East this week on his 12th visit since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last year but his first since the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Assad's departure has sparked new fears of instability in the region now wracked by three conflicts despite a ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. Blinken will travel to Jordan and Turkey on Thursday and Friday for talks expected to focus largely on Syria but also touch on long-elusive hopes for a deal to end the fighting in Gaza that has devastated the territory since October 2023. The State Department said Blinken would meet Jordanian officials, including King Abdullah II, in the port of Aqaba on Thursday before flying to Ankara for meetings with Turkish officials Friday. Other stops in the region are also possible, officials said. Blinken 'will reiterate the United States’ support for an inclusive, Syrian-led transition to an accountable and representative government,' department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. Insurgents set fire to Hafez Assad's tomb, a war monitor says BEIRUT — Insurgents have set on fire the tomb of Syria’s former President Hafez Assad in his hometown in the northwest, a war monitor and a local journalist said Wednesday. Hafez Assad had ruled Syria for 30 years until his death in 2000, when his son, Bashar, succeeded him. Both ruled Syria with an iron fist and were blamed for crackdowns that left tens of thousands dead, mainly in the central city of Hama in 1982, and in much of the country since the civil war in 2011. Bashar Assad was ousted over the weekend and fled to Russia where he was given political asylum. Rami Abdurrahman of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Syrian journalist Qusay Noor told The Associated Press that the tomb was set on fire Wednesday in the town of Qardaha in Latakia province. UN appeals for $4 billion for humanitarian operations in Palestinian territories JERUSALEM — The United Nations is asking donors for over $4 billion to fund humanitarian operations in the Palestinian territories, most of it earmarked for war-ravaged Gaza. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs also called for the 'lifting all impediments to the entry of aid' in its appeal issued Wednesday. U.N. agencies say aid operations in Gaza are hindered by Israeli restrictions and the breakdown of law and order. Israel says it allows enough aid to enter and blames the U.N. for not distributing it within the territory. The appeal for 2025 includes $3.6 billion for Gaza and about $450 million for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel’s offensive, launched after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, has destroyed vast areas of the besieged territory and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million. Many have been displaced multiple times and are now crammed into squalid tent camps with little in the way of food or other essentials. Most of the population relies on international aid. Paraguay's president addresses the Knesset ahead of embassy reopening in Jerusalem JERUSALEM — The president of Paraguay addressed the Israeli parliament Wednesday ahead of the reopening of the country’s embassy in Jerusalem. The decision to reopen the embassy in Jerusalem and recognize the city as the capital of Israel is a diplomatic win for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and puts Paraguay in a small group of countries that have taken the move. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in 1967 but it wasn't recognized by the international community, and most countries run their embassies out of Tel Aviv. 'Without Jerusalem, the land of Israel is a body without a soul,' President Santiago Peña said in a speech to the Knesset. 'So I say here today that without an embassy in Jerusalem, diplomatic relations with Israel do not have a real heart.' He said he hoped the move would inspire other countries to do the same. The embassy is set to open Thursday. Pena’s move was welcomed by Netanyahu, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, along with other Israeli leaders. 'Tomorrow we will inaugurate together the embassy of Paraguay in our eternal capital, and that will happen not for the first time, but for the second time,' Netanyahu said. Paraguay had an embassy in Jerusalem in 2018, under Former President Horacio Cartes. That embassy was moved back to Tel Aviv by Cartes’ successor, Mario Abdo Benitez, prompting Israel to close its embassy in Asuncion. Israel reopened its embassy in September. Russia says it's in touch with new authorities in Syria MOSCOW — Russia said Wednesday it has maintained contacts with the new authorities in Syria. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that 'we are monitoring most closely what is happening in Syria.' 'We, of course, maintain contacts with those who are currently controlling the situation in Syria,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. 'This is necessary because our bases are located there, our diplomatic mission is located there and, of course, the issue related to ensuring the security of these facilities is extremely important and of primary significance.' Peskov wouldn’t give details of those contacts, saying only that Russia has contacted 'those who are controlling the situation on the ground.' He wouldn’t give the number of Russian troops in Syria. Asked to comment about Israel’s seizure of a buffer zone on the border with Syria, Peskov called them destabilizing. 'The strikes and actions in the Golan Heights area, in the buffer zone area, are unlikely to help stabilize the situation in an already destabilized Syria,' he said. Russia has granted political asylum to ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad and his family after they fled rebels who seized Damascus over the weekend. Iran's supreme leader says fall of Syrian government was part of joint plan by US and Israel TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says the recent events in Syria, including the fall of its government, were part of a joint plan by the United States and Israel. 'There should be no doubt that what has happened in Syria is the result of a joint American and Zionist plan,' Khamenei said in a speech in Tehran on Wednesday that was broadcast on state TV. 'We have evidence, and this evidence leaves no room for doubt.' The Supreme leader added: 'A neighboring state of Syria has played a clear role in this matter, and it continues to do so. Everyone can see this.' Khamenei also rejected speculation by analysts who have said that Iran will be weakened by the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government. 'Those ignorant analysts are unaware of the meaning of resistance. They think that if resistance weakens, Islamic Iran will also weaken. But I say, with the help and power of God — by the will of Almighty Allah — Iran is powerful and it will become even more powerful,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-11-december-2024-90f14a411f4e58cdf773b85ee75e8b4d	2024-12-10T22:10:07-08:00

Taiwan demands that China end its military activity in nearby waters	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan demanded Wednesday that China end its ongoing military activity in nearby waters, which it said is unilaterally undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and disrupting international shipping and trade. The Foreign Ministry, in a statement posted on its website, said it was responding in part to the activities of a 'large number' of Chinese naval and coast guard ships in the first-island chain, the Pacific archipelago off the Asian continental mainland that includes Japan, Taiwan and part of the Philippines. 'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs solemnly demands that the Beijing authorities immediately stop military intimidation and all irrational activities that endanger regional peace and stability,' the statement said. Taiwan defense officials say they have detected Chinese ship s since Monday, both off Taiwan and farther out along the first-island chain. They described the formations as two walls designed to demonstrate that the waters belong to China. China restricted airspace off its southeast coast from Monday to Wednesday, an indication that it was planning to hold drills, but the country's People's Liberation Army has not confirmed whether it is doing so. Taiwan has been expecting drills following stops by its president, Lai Ching-te, in Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam during an overseas trip last week. China claims self-governing Taiwan as its territory and opposes any official contact with America and other foreign governments. A Chinese spokesperson didn't comment directly on any military exercises but said in a statement posted online Wednesday that the government would not let provocations by Taiwan in collusion with external forces go unchecked. 'We will take necessary measures to resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and safeguard the fundamental interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,' said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the government's Taiwan Affairs Office. The Taiwan Strait is a 160-kilometer- (100-mile-) wide body of water between China and the island of Taiwan. China's military held major exercises around Taiwan following both Lai's inauguration in May and his national day speech in October. It also held a major drill after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-military-drills-b48c59b819f2d32e3a6d9b9635c7aa53	2024-12-10T21:36:12-08:00	
A Lebanese man who spent 32 years in Syrian prisons is welcomed home	CHEKKA, Lebanon (AP) — Suheil Hamwi spent 32 years in a Syrian prison, and now, after an offensive by insurgents that toppled the government of Bashar Assad, he's finally returned to his home in Lebanon. In 1992, Hamwi worked as a merchant, selling various goods in the town of Chekka in northern Lebanon. On the night of Eid il-Burbara, or Saint Barbara’s Day — a holiday similar to Halloween — a man came to his door to buy some whiskey. Hamwi said he handed his 10-month-old son, George, to his wife and went to his car to fetch the whiskey and make the sale. As Hamwi approached his vehicle, a car filled with men pulled up, he said, forcing him inside and taking him away. It would be years before his family heard from him again. Hamwi was one of hundreds of Lebanese citizens detained during Syria’s occupation of Lebanon from 1976 to 2005 and believed to be held in Syrian prisons for decades. On Sunday, freedom came to him and others unexpectedly — prisoners who'd heard rumors about Syria’s opposition forces and their sweeping campaign found that guards had abandoned their posts. Hamwi and other prisoners left, he said, and he would soon be among the first from Lebanon to reenter the country. 'I’m still scared this might not be real,' he told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday from his home — the same one he left more than three decades ago. This new reality feels fragile, but, he said, 'I found my freedom.' Years of uncertainty and imprisonment For years after the night of his disappearance, Hamwi’s family didn’t know where he was. It wasn’t until 16 years later that his wife discovered he was imprisoned in Syria. Even then, the reason for his detention remained unclear, Hamwi said. It took another four years before authorities finally told him the charge, he said: He was detained because he was a member of the Lebanese Forces, a Christian political party that also functioned as a militia during the 15-year Lebanese civil war that ended in 1990. The party fought against Syrian forces and remained opposed to Syria's military presence in Lebanon afterward. Hamwi said prison interrogations were cryptic. 'They asked for my name, my parents’ names, my age, and where I was from. That’s all,' he said. Then he would be sent back to his cell. 'There was no lawyer, no nothing.' He said he spent his first years in Syria’s notorious Saydnaya prison before being transferred to other facilities, eventually ending up in prison in Latakia. Torture marked his early days behind bars, he added, 'but that stopped after a while.' For years, he said, he lived in nearly complete isolation. He was alone in a small cell, surrounded by other Lebanese detainees as well as Palestinians and Iraqis. In 2008, he said, his wife was able to visit him for the first time. Then she came about once a year. The door opens to freedom Last week, there was some buzz in the prison about what was happening outside. 'But we didn’t know the dream would reach us,' Hamwi said. Early Sunday morning, chaos erupted as prisoners discovered the guards were gone. 'The first door opened,' Hamwi said, describing how rebels stormed the prison and started opening cell gates. 'Then others followed. And for those who couldn’t open their gates, they started coming out through the walls.' The prisoners left 'walking toward the unknown,' he said. 'And I walked with them.' Strangers on the street helped guide him back to Lebanon, Hamwi said. He came into the country through the Arida border crossing in northern Lebanon, where his family waited on the other side. Back home, at last As Hamwi walked through his door, it was his two grandchildren who greeted him. 'This is the first time I met them,' Hamwi later told AP, his voice tinged with disbelief. In the living room, Hamwi lit a cigarette and took a slow drag. He took in photos of moments he'd missed: George’s graduation portrait; George with his wife; Hamwi's own smiling wife, Josephine, with granddaughter Tala. Grandson Chris clung to Hamwi's hand, giggling as he called out 'Jeddo!' — Arabic for grandpa. Josephine handed out sweets, her hands steady despite the emotions of the last several days. Outside, neighbors and friends gathered, their voices echoing in the narrow hallway outside his apartment. They sat on chairs in a circle, sharing laughter and memories, as plates of the Arabic sweets and small chocolates were passed around. 'Do you know me? Do you remember me?' one friend asked, shaking Hamwi’s hand. Hamwi paused, studying the man’s face. 'You’re Jean! Yes, you’re Jean,' he said. Hawmi has visited a hospital, for tests to assess the toll of 32 years in captivity. And he has to relearn life outside prison walls. He hoped one of the best moments was yet to come: his reunion with only son George, an engineer working in the Gulf. In their first phone call, Hamwi said, George told him the words he'd been longing to hear: 'I miss you. I love you. I’m waiting to see you.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-prisoners-prison-suheil-hamwi-deae45f72edd7d4544d5d411c1717123	2024-12-10T21:35:25-08:00	
Rural resurrection: A Greek village leans into faith in fight against demographic collapse	FOURNA, Greece (AP) — Fourna, home to 180 people and hidden in the fir-tree covered mountains of central Greece, is a vanishing village that is determined to keep its place on the map. A winding four-hour drive from Athens, it enjoys near total silence, periodically broken by church bells and howling dogs. Elderly residents measure the village’s chances of survival by the number of children enrolled at the local primary school. Last year, there were only two. But Fourna’s fortunes have been reversed by an unlikely and tireless partnership. The local schoolteacher, a Ph.D. student studying artificial intelligence, found common cause with the Rev. Constantine Dousikos, a burly Orthodox priest and former lumber machine operator who was ordained shortly before turning 50. They started a despair-fueled campaign to attract families to Fourna, offering settling-in money raised from private donations and municipal programs. It’s working: Two families have moved to the village, five more are on a 2025 wait list, and hundreds of others have made inquiries. Eight children now attend elementary classes. Dousikos, equally at ease behind the wheel of his pickup or in front of the church altar, says the initiative was partly inspired by calls from the Orthodox church hierarchy urging clergy to promote family life. 'I think we did the obvious thing: Help the people here keep our village alive,' he says, standing in the Church of Transfiguration of Christ on the main square. 'Of course, village life is not for everyone. You need to be good at manual work.' Greece has one of the world’s oldest populations with 23% aged 65 or older in 2023, according to World Bank data. The central Greek region of Evrytania, home to Fourna, faces low birth rates and rural depopulation, with an average age of 56.2 – one of the three highest in the European Union. Panagiota Diamanti, Fourna’s only elementary schoolteacher and co-founder of the family campaign 'New Life in the Village,' says the urgency of the situation is palpable. 'If the kids don’t come, the teacher gets transferred and the school will close. And a closed school will never reopen,' she says. 'We need bold action.' More than 200 publicly run schools and kindergartens were shut down across Greece in the current school year due to low enrollment, many in remote parts of the country with sparse populations due to its mountainous mainland terrain and numerous small islands. Several local authorities have reached out to the Fourna campaign, and asked Diamanti to help them start a similar program. After class, she joins her eight students in a game of dodgeball at the school yard which overlooks Evrytania’s jagged mountains. The kids enjoy a local-celebrity status; their birthdays are often celebrated in the main village square. Vassiliki Emmanouil relocated to Fourna with her six children – five sons and a daughter – and says she has been showered with kindness. Village residents leave food outside her door overnight and are encouraging her to restart an old bakery when her husband returns from a spell of work in Germany. 'I’ve been here for nearly three months, and I would be ungrateful to say I’ve struggled,' Emmanouil says. 'The local priest and his wife treat me as if I’m part of their family. The entire village has been by our side, from offering daily essentials to emotional support.' Deaths overtook annual births in Greece in 2010 as the country sank into a severe financial crisis and the numbers have steadily worsened since then, reaching almost double the birth level in 2022. The conservative government last year created a ministry of family and social cohesion. It has increased family benefits in the 2025 budget and reached out to the Orthodox Church for help. Last year, the church’s governing Holy Synod issued a circular that was read out at all of Greece’s Orthodox churches, arguing that financial incentives will not be enough to reverse the dire demographic trends. 'Experts propose various solutions to address the issue, emphasizing its significant social, economic, and geopolitical implications,' the message said. 'The Church underscores the spiritual dimension of family life, advocating for unity, love, and the creation of families as a testament to divine purpose,' it added. 'Children, considered gifts from God, bring meaning to life and symbolize hope and renewal.' For Fourna’s residents, even church attendance is tied to village survival. Two dozen churches in the area remain empty most of the year, but are well maintained and open for important dates on the religious calendar. The appearance of children in church and on the village’s long-quieted streets caught most residents off guard. 'At the start, I never thought families would come to live here. It’s a remote village, very small, without much here,' local business owner Giorgos Vassilikoudis said. 'But to my surprise, families did come and they’re happy,' said Vassilikoudis, who runs a restaurant and guesthouse. 'It’s very good for the village and for people who have shops and businesses. For other villages, it serves as an example. It’s a good start.' ___ AP journalist Lefteris Pitarakis contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Brazilian beef and leather companies fall short in tackling deforestation, a study finds	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — The next United Nations climate conference, COP30, will be held in Belem, the capital of an Amazon region where widespread deforestation mainly driven by cattle farming has turned the surrounding rainforest from a vital carbon sink into a significant carbon source. Now a new report concludes around 80% of Brazil’s leading beef and cow leather companies and their financiers have made no commitments to stop deforestation. The study, released Wednesday by the environmental nonprofit group Global Canopy, highlights the country´s 175 most influential beef and leather companies and financial institutions that have supported them with $100 billion. This amount is one-third of the annual funding that wealthy nations pledged to provide for climate finance in developing countries during COP29 last month in Baku, Azerbaijan. 'Although cattle is the single most influential commodity for deforestation and linked greenhouse gas emissions, the report ... reveals a picture of staggering inaction from corporates and financial institutions alike in Brazilian supply chains,' the study said. The record is poor even among companies that commit to halting deforestation, such as JBS, according to the report. The giant meatpacker is one of the few to make such commitments and one of only two to have a system for tracing cattle all the way to the production unit. Yet the report ranks the company as the most likely to be buying cattle and cow leather from recently deforested land. This assessment of deforestation risk is based on the number of cattle bought from ranchers in each Brazilian municipality and its deforestation rate. Meatpackers buying from high-deforestation areas are more likely to source from recently cleared land than those buying from low-deforestation areas. The methodology was created by Do Pasto ao Prato, an independent Brazilian consumer app that aims to increase transparency in the livestock sector. 'Commitments are critical as one of the first steps a company takes to address deforestation,' Emma Thomson, one of the coauthors, told The Associated Press. 'But it has to be followed by effective implementation and by monitoring suppliers and indirect suppliers for compliance with those standards. It has to have effective traceability mechanisms and transparent reporting on the progress that is — or isn´t — being made.' Besides JBS, the report lists three processing companies with units based in Para state as likely to be buying cattle and cow leather from recently deforested land: Mercurio, Mafrinorte and Frigol. In a written response, JBS said the study's methodology provides a simplistic and inaccurate assessment of deforestation risk, ignoring factors such as corporate policies, sustainable procurement systems and exclusion of noncompliant suppliers. The company said that since 2009 it has maintained a system to ensure suppliers meet socio-environmental criteria. 'The companies that have made significant progress in their controls end up being criticized, and their transparency is used not as an incentive but as a penalty,' it said. Mercurio, Mafrinorte and Frigol didn´t reply to requests for comment. Global Canopy´s report was funded by the Bezos Earth Fund. Do Pasto ao Prato is financed by Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative. The state of Para harbors Brazil´s second largest cattle herd, with 25 million animals — and 35% of its territory is cleared, an area slightly smaller than Syria. As a result, it ranks first in greenhouse gas emissions among Brazilian states. A landmark study published in the journal Nature in 2021 found that the eastern Amazon, where Para is located, has ceased to function as a carbon sink, or absorber, for the Earth, due to widespread deforestation and climate change. Niki Mardas, executive director of Global Canopy, said there will be an update to Wednesday's baseline report in the runup to COP30 next November, when all eyes will be on the Amazon. 'This isn't a fixed picture. This is a call to action.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

US Biathlon officials ignored sexual harassment and abuse of female racers for decades, athletes say	Sexual abuse and harassment by coaches and others who held positions of power over women on the U.S. Biathlon team have been dismissed, ignored or excused over decades by officials more concerned with winning medals than holding offenders accountable, according to a half-dozen former Olympians and other biathletes. And while the men involved climbed the ranks of the sport, these women — who described a culture of abuse dating back to the 1990s — told The Associated Press they were forced to end their racing careers early. One coach resigned after the young biathlete he was accused of sexually abusing attempted suicide, but he was later hired to coach the U.S. Paralympic team. Max Cobb, who the women say was informed but failed to address the claims, went from U.S. domestic team manager to CEO of the U.S. Biathlon Association and is now secretary general of the International Biathlon Union, the worldwide governing body of the sport, which combines cross-country skiing on trails with target shooting. Two male coaches and a former racer on the men's biathlon team confirmed the culture of misogyny described by the women, who all said they faced retaliation for speaking up. 'My safety on the team was clearly secondary to a top-down power structure focused on image, medals and marketing,' said two-time Olympian Joan Wilder, 58, who said her coach got away with trying to sexually assault her in 1990 despite her complaints to Cobb. Grace Boutot, a 2009 Youth World Championship silver medalist, said her reports to Cobb and other officials about abuse committed by two coaches, beginning when she was 15, also went unheeded, eventually leading to a suicide attempt. 'U.S. Biathlon leadership always seems to choose to support the predators instead of the person who was abused,' the now 33-year-old Boutot said. The women came forward after the AP reported that Olympian Joanne Reid was sexually abused and harassed for years, according to findings by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, a watchdog group created to investigate sex-abuse allegations in Olympic sports in the aftermath of the Larry Nassar U.S. Gymnastics scandal. Reid told the AP her repeated complaints to top U.S. Biathlon officials, which were relayed to Cobb, were ignored for three years. Cobb denied the women's allegations that he failed to act. 'During my 33 years at U.S. Biathlon, athlete safety was always fundamental to me and I can't recall ever hearing from athletes or others that my efforts in this regard were not appropriate,' he said in an email to the AP. Cobb declined to be interviewed to respond to specific allegations raised by the women, saying it would be a violation of SafeSport's code. However, an independent investigation ordered by U.S. Biathlon into team culture and safety following the AP report found biathletes faced 'misogynistic' behavior while racing and feared retaliation if they came forward with their concerns. The assessment by outside auditor Vestry Laight, released last week, said the athletes surveyed described a sport 'dominated by men who have a very different outlook on how to treat women' and criticized the 'lack of attention paid to create a respectful environment.' Biathlon officials said they were adopting an 'action plan' in response to the auditor's report, including workshops with staff and athletes to define core values and create a way to measure progress. SafeSport interviews also confirmed the sexualized atmosphere. U.S. Biathlon team psychologist Sean McCann described 'a European boys club culture' in the watchdog group's 2022 report on the Reid case, with some men sharing sexual comments and other explicit content on a private WhatsApp group. Turning a blind eye in pursuit of elusive Olympic medals, athletes say Biathlon is the only winter sport for which the U.S. has never won an Olympic medal. Desperate to excel in the European-dominated sport, U.S. officials hired European coaches and staff, and turned a blind eye when women raised claims of sexual harassment or abuse on the team, all those interviewed said. In 1990, to prepare for the first-ever women’s biathlon race at the Olympics, U.S. officials hired German biathlete Walter Pichler, a 1984 Olympic bronze medalist, to coach the U.S. women’s team. During a training camp in Montana that year, the team went out one night but then 20-year-old Wilder said she went to bed early. She suddenly woke to someone on her back. Pichler was holding her down and trying to force her to have sex, she said in a complaint filed with SafeSport. Pichler denied trying to sexually assault Wilder. 'This is unbelievable,' he told AP. 'I’m speechless. If this comes out, it does damage to me.' 'I always had a super relationship with Joanie, or with all the athletes, all the female, the men athletes. All of them.' Wilder said she chased Pichler from her room and reported it to then-team manager Cobb. He showed concern, she said, 'but didn’t consider it discipline-worthy.' Cobb justified Pichler’s behavior by saying he didn’t know U.S. laws or culture, she said. 'I recall pressing Max Cobb about sending Walter back to Germany. The conversation didn’t last long,' said Wilder, who competed under her maiden name Guetschow. Pichler's visa had taken two years to secure, he told her, 'and we were so close to the Olympics. We needed their expertise to perform well.' 'The message I felt, and it hurt, was not to harm the team, organization, Olympics over a very inconvenient ‘incident,’' she said. 'Basically, shut up for the team’s sake.' Wilder said in her SafeSport complaint that she faced retaliation for pressing the issue of firing Pichler. 'I was targeted as a ‘problem’ athlete,' she said, in the complaint. She said her rifle disappeared, her skis went to another athlete, and she was temporarily bumped from the 1994 Olympic team, then dropped from the national team before the 1998 Olympics without being told. That put her health insurance at risk. She had undergone heart surgery, so losing coverage with a pre-existing condition was catastrophic, she said. She called Cobb in distress. 'Max ended the conversation with, ‘Well, if you write a letter to the U.S. Olympic Committee and say that you’re resigning from biathlon, I’ll extend your medical insurance,’' she told the AP. She hung up, she said, deciding she didn’t have any fight left. 'It was time for me to move on.' Two coaches prey on teenage Maine biathlete Boutot grew up homeschooled and mostly isolated from others her age in Fort Kent, Maine, a town of 4,000 on the Canadian border. The Maine Winter Sports Center ran a world-class Nordic ski facility there used by U.S. Biathlon. Boutot was 12 when she was recruited into the program in 2003. She started racing biathlon the next year and began training with newly hired coach Gary Colliander when she was 15. Colliander gave her a lot of coaching attention, but also a lot of hugs, she said. Her parents had divorced and she rarely saw her father, so she appreciated his support. 'I didn’t think he would do anything to hurt me,' she told the AP of Colliander, who was 15 years her senior. As she got older, she said, his attention increased. He invited her to his home, massaged her legs and rubbed her back and buttocks, she said. He was married, but his wife lived part time in Colorado. The conduct escalated after she turned 18 to 'kissing, sexual fondling and oral sex,' according to a treatment summary by therapist Jacqueline Pauli-Ritz, shared with the AP. Boutot said she begged him to stop but Colliander ignored her. She said he warned her against telling anyone, saying his life would be ruined and her biathlon career would end. She loved racing, and felt trapped; to compete internationally she needed her coach's recommendation: 'I didn’t know what to do,' she said. She became severely depressed and started cutting herself, according to the therapist's notes. In September 2010, Pauli-Ritz contacted Colliander and told him Boutot was suffering from major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and he should stop coaching her, the treatment summary said. 'He did not do this until after the suicide attempt,' Pauli-Ritz wrote, referring to Boutot's Oct. 7, 2010, overdose on antidepressants while at a training camp in Soldier Hollow, Utah. She was found by a teammate and hospitalized. The next day, Colliander resigned. He took a coaching job in Colorado and was hired in December 2016 by the U.S. Paralympic team, where he is associate director of high performance for U.S. Paralympics Nordic Skiing. Colliander did not respond to phone messages and emails seeking comment. In October 2010, Boutot informed the CEO and the vice president of the Maine Winter Sports Center about the abuse by Colliander, according to a letter she sent to the sports center’s board. But, she said, there was no investigation. Boutot said she also faced abuse by then-U.S. Biathlon junior team coach Vladimir Cervenka of the Czech Republic, starting in 2007. He caressed her buttocks and legs, she said, and also grabbed other girls and gave 'good luck pats.' When she won a silver medal at the 2009 Youth World Championships in Canada, Cervenka grabbed her, she said. 'He forcibly kissed me and groped my entire body, smothering me and crushing me until he was pulled off of me by our team masseuse,' she said of Cervenka, who was 26 years older than her. Cervenka denied Boutot's claims. 'I absolutely did not kiss her or grope her body,' he told the AP in an email. 'Regarding inappropriate touching Grace, I have no memory of any of that and I for sure did not have any intention of doing that. All these accusations are absurd and very upsetting.' Boutot reported the alleged abuse by Cervenka twice to U.S. Biathlon officials, including in a Jan. 6, 2011, email to Cobb and a U.S. Biathlon board member in which she also expressed concern about Cervenka's inappropriate contact with other young teammates and her worries about retaliation for speaking up. In the email exchange, she was told the issues were serious, but she had to make her complaint public so Cervenka could defend himself. Boutot said she expected them to investigate. 'I wish I would have spoken up more at the time but it was terrifying,' she told the AP. 'I told them of the abuse and they never took me seriously. It felt like an insurmountable battle, me against them. I went to USBA hoping for help, and it felt like they continuously shut me down and wanted me to leave the sport.' Boutot tried to keep racing but faced retaliation by the Maine Winter Sports Center, she said in a 2011 complaint filed with the Maine Human Rights Commission. She accused the center of failing to prevent Colliander’s sexual misconduct and retaliating against her when she reported it — denying her coaching and ending its financing of equipment, travel, athlete housing and other U.S. Biathlon competition-related expenses. The center settled for $75,000, and Boutot quit racing. What comes next? SafeSport has ordered a new investigation into whether Reid was retaliated against for exposing the abuse she endured to the watchdog group. SafeSport spokeswoman Hilary Nemchik said she could not comment on the ongoing case. Olympian Deedra Irwin, Reid's teammate who is competing at the World Cup in Europe this winter, said the misogynistic culture described by SafeSport grew under Cobb's leadership. 'Max Cobb just hired all his friends,' Irwin told the AP. 'The amount of people working in USBA right now who are all ex-athletes that are all really close with Max Cobb, it's like, OK, this is how this kept happening for so many years.' 'You just keep hiring people who are comfortable with what's already happening.' SafeSport, which was created in 2017, decades after the abuse reported by Wilder and Boutot, investigates claims even when the legal statute of limitations has expired. After receiving an anonymous tip, SafeSport contacted Boutot in 2021 about filing a complaint about the abuse allegations involving Colliander, she said. She declined. A coach found guilty might only face a six-month suspension, she said, but 'what I have endured has been a life sentence.' Wilder said she didn’t know she had the option and filed a SafeSport complaint, naming Cobb and Pichler, after she found out. She said it is 'an important next step.' 'I love the sport of biathlon,' Wilder said. 'I sincerely hope that my shared story with other women biathletes results in this being bookends to a darker period — that it never happens again.' ___ EDITOR'S NOTE — Martha Bellisle is an amateur biathlete who has won several U.S. national and world championship gold medals in the master’s division for competitors 60 and older.

Rights group demands probe of ex-governor, 2 army officers in Congo for possible humanitarian crimes	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Amnesty International called for an investigation Wednesday into a former governor and two top army officials in Congo for 'possible crimes against humanity' during a deadly crackdown on demonstrators last year protesting the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the country. The human rights group said in a report Congo's security forces killed at least 56 people and injured 80 more, during a protest in the eastern city of Goma in August 2023. The protest was organized by a sect called the Natural Judaic and Messianic Faith Towards the Nations and known colloquially as Wazalendo. Its supporters were demonstrating against the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, called MONUSCO. The MONUSCO force arrived in Congo in 2010 after taking over from an earlier U.N. peacekeeping mission to protect civilians and humanitarian personnel and to support the Congolese government in its stabilization and peace consolidation efforts. However, frustrated Congolese say that no one is protecting them from rebel attacks, leading to several protests against the U.N. mission. Eastern Congo has struggled with armed violence for decades as more than 120 groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources, while others try to defend their communities. Some armed groups have been accused of mass killings. More than 7 million people have been displaced. Goma’s Mayor Faustin Napenda Kapend banned the protest soon after it was announced over concerns the organizers were inciting hate and violence. Amnesty International said it found no evidence of incitement to violence in the statements and messages from the Wazalendo it reviewed. Congolese security and defense forces amassed at major intersections in anticipation of the protest when violence broke out early in the morning. Amnesty International said it saw operational plans in which the security forces were given orders to 'destroy isolated enemy elements.' 'This massacre was not the result of a blunder by a few soldiers who intervened unexpectedly after Wazalendo followers stoned a police officer, as authorities have claimed,' Tigere Chagutah, the rights group regional director for East and Southern Africa, said in the statement. 'It was the result of a series of deliberate, planned actions by the Congolese authorities, after MONUSCO explicitly requested they prohibit the protest.' Amnesty International said it traced the timeline and locations of the killings, identifying three top officials who should be investigated and, if evidence supports it, prosecuted for possible crimes against humanity. They include Lt. Gen. Constant Ndima, who was governor of the North Kivu province at the time, Col. Mike Kalamba Mikombe, who was head of the Republican Guard unit in Goma, and Maj. Peter Kabwe, who led the Republican Guard's Special Forces. The rights group said Ndima had directed the army and the police to 'take all measures' to protect MONUSCO facilities and the city, after he informed the army and police that the Wazalendo posed a serious threat. Mikombe was accused of ordering soldiers to open fire on the protesters, who were unarmed, according to Amnesty International and two Congolese military trials, killing dozens. Amnesty International accused Kabwe of leading a raid on a Wazalendo radio station ahead of the protest in which six people, including a journalist, were summarily executed. While Mikombe was convicted and sentenced to death, which the rights group said it opposed, Ndima and Kabwe have not faced justice. 'The Democratic Republic of Congo authorities must reopen the investigations into this massacre, in line with regional and international standards, to establish the truth and hold all of those involved accountable,' Chagutah said. He added that Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi should suspend Ndima and Kabew, further investigate Mikombe, and ban the Republican Guard and Special Forces from law enforcement operations.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-army-crimes-against-humanity-amnesty-international-eb7d662c7b0efe2ef138f60df8a34e81	2024-12-10T20:08:09-08:00	
These Palestinians disappeared after encounters with Israeli troops in Gaza	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Reem Ajour says she last saw her husband and then 4-year-old daughter in March, when Israeli soldiers raided a family home in northern Gaza. She is haunted by those chaotic last moments, when the soldiers ordered her to go – to leave behind Talal and Masaa, both wounded. Eight months later, the 23-year-old mother still has no answers about their fate. The military says it does not have them. Troops leveled the house where they were staying soon after the raid. 'I am living and dead at the same time,' she said, breaking down in sobs. Ajour is one of dozens of Palestinians that an Israeli legal group, Hamoked, is helping in their search for family members who went missing after being separated by Israeli soldiers during raids and arrests in the Gaza Strip. Their cases — a fraction of the estimated thousands who have gone missing during the 14-month-long war — highlight a lack of accountability in how the Israeli military deals with Palestinians during ground operations in Gaza, Hamoked says. Throughout the war, the military has conducted what amounts to a mass sifting of the Palestinian population as it raids homes and shelters and sends people through checkpoints. Troops round up and detain men, from dozens to several hundreds at a time, searching for any they suspect of Hamas ties, while forcing their families away, toward other parts of Gaza. The result is families split apart, often amid the chaos of fighting. But the military has not made clear how it keeps track of everyone it separates, arrests or detains. Even if troops transfer Palestinians to military detention inside Israel, they can hold them incommunicado for more than two months — their whereabouts unknown to families or lawyers, according to rights groups. When people vanish, it’s nearly impossible to know what happened, Hamoked says. 'We’ve never had a situation of mass forced disappearance from Gaza, with no information provided for weeks and weeks to families,' said Jessica Montell, the director of Hamoked. Israel's High Court of Justice has refused to intervene to get answers, despite Hamoked's petitions, she said. Asked by The Associated Press about the cases of Ajour and two other families it interviewed, the Israeli military declined comment. 4-year-old Masaa Ajour was shot, then separated from her mother The Ajours were sheltering at a home in Gaza City that belonged to Talal's family after being displaced from their own house earlier in the war. Israeli troops raided the home on March 24, opening fire as they burst in, Ajour said. Ajour, who was three months pregnant, was shot in the stomach. Talal was wounded in his leg, bleeding heavily. Masaa lay passed out, shot in the shoulder – though Ajour said she saw her still breathing. As one soldier bandaged the little girl's wound, another pointed his gun in Ajour’s face and told her to head out of Gaza City. She said she pleaded that she couldn’t leave Masaa and Talal, but the soldier screamed: 'Go south!' With no choice, Ajour collected her younger son and went down to the street. 'It was all in a blink of an eye. It was all so fast,' she said. Still bleeding, she walked for two and a half hours, clutching her son. When they reached a hospital in central Gaza, doctors treated her stomach wound and found her fetus’ pulse. Weeks later, doctors found the pulse had gone. She miscarried. Ajour said that several weeks later, a Palestinian released from a prison in southern Israel told her family he had heard her husband’s name called out over a loudspeaker among a list of detainees. The rumor has kept her hope alive, but the military told Hamoked it had no record of Masaa or Talal being detained. Another possibility is that they died on the scene, but no one has been able to search the rubble of the family's building to determine if any bodies are there. The storming of their building came as Israeli forces were battling Hamas fighters in surrounding streets while raiding nearby Shifa Hospital, where it claimed the militants were based. Troops cleared families out of nearby homes and often then destroyed or set the buildings ablaze, according to witnesses at the time. The military itself may not know what happened to Ajour’s husband and daughter, said Montell of Hamoked. 'That illustrates a broader problem,' she said. Ajour and her son now shelter in a tent camp outside the central Gaza town of Zuweida. Masaa, she said, 'was my first joy' — with blond hair and olive-colored eyes, a face 'white like the moon.' Masaa’s fifth birthday was in July, Ajour said, sobbing. 'She turned five while she is not with me.' Does the military document what troops do in Gaza? Under a wartime revision to Israeli law, Palestinians from Gaza taken to military detention in Israel can be held for over two months without access to the outside world. Israel says the law is necessary to handle the unprecedented number of detainees as it seeks to destroy Hamas following the Oct. 7 2023, attack on Israel that killed 1,200 and took around 250 people hostage inside Gaza. The military has transferred some 1,770 of its Gaza detainees to civilian prisons, according to rights groups, but it has not revealed the number still in its detention. Milena Ansari, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said Israel is obligated under international law to document what happens during every home raid and detention. But the military is not transparent about the information it collects on detainees or on how many it is holding, she said. Hamoked has asked the military for the whereabouts of 900 missing Palestinians. The military confirmed around 500 of them were detained in Israel. It said it had no record of detaining the other 400. The group petitioned Israel’s High Court of Justice seeking answers in 52 cases, including that of Masaa and two other children, where witnesses testified that the missing were handled by troops before their disappearances. 'The judges just dismiss the cases, without even inquiring what measures might be necessary to prevent such cases in the future,' said Montell. A court spokesperson said it often asks the military to provide additional information but isn’t authorized to investigate if the military says it is not detaining them. In the cases of three missing adult Palestinians presented by Hamoked, the military first claimed it was not holding them, then found records of them being detained after being pressed by Hamoked to double-check. In another case, military police discovered that two Palestinians they had initially denied holding -- a father and his adult son -- had died in Israeli custody. The U.N. Human Rights Office says at least 53 Palestinians are known to have died in Israeli detention during the war. Ailing with cancer, Mahmoud Alghrabli disappeared after raid The last time the Alghrabli family saw their 76-year-old patriarch, Mahmoud Alghrabli, was when Israeli troops stormed their district in Khan Younis on Feb. 4. The soldiers ordered residents out of the area. The Alghrablis had to carry Mahmoud, suffering from cancer, out of their building on a chair, his son Ahmed Algharbli told the AP. After detaining some men, the soldiers ordered the rest to leave. Mahmoud Alghrabli made it to a sand mound near the house. Ahmed Algharbli said his brother went to help the father, but soldiers shouted at him to leave. 'He left our father by force, or he would have been shot,' he said. The family returned a month later. There was no trace of Mahmoud. Ahmed Algharbli said he 'walked meter by meter' searching for traces, finding bones but not knowing whose they were. He keeps them wrapped in a piece of cloth at home. Hamoked was told by the military there was no indication of him in Israeli detention. 'By God, I don’t sleep at night,' said Mahmoud’s wife, Sabah Abdul-Salam. Whether he was arrested or killed, she said, 'let us know, we will rest.' Mahmoud Almoqayed vanished while searching for his family The only traces left of another missing man, 77-year-old Mahmoud Almoqayed, are his torn shirt and pants with his ID in the pocket. They were found in the dirt near the school where he and his family were sheltering when it was raided by Israeli troops on May 23 in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. The soldiers released Almoqayed and sent him and other men to another shelter, said his son, Rani Almoqayed, a doctor working in Saudi Arabia who pieced together the account from witnesses and family members. Once at the second shelter, the elderly Almoqayed immediately turned back, determined to find his wife and grandchildren left behind at the school, witnesses told his son. It was dark, well after 1 a.m., and troops were all around the area. Almoqayed was never seen by his family again. Weeks later, his family found his abandoned clothes. They also found skulls and body parts nearby, Rani Almoqayed said. The military police told Hamoked it had no indication Almoqayed was detained. Rani Almoqayed believes it's possible his father was killed and Israeli troops took the body. Since December 2023, the military has returned at least 318 bodies and a sack of body parts to Gaza after seizing them to search for hostages, a senior U.N. official in Gaza told the AP, speaking anonymously to discuss confidential matters. The bodies, with no identification and often decomposed, are buried in anonymous mass graves. The family had Mahmoud Almoqayed declared officially dead, his son said. 'But the doubt will not stop and one’s heart won’t ease unless they see the body.' ___ El Deeb reported from Beirut, and Frankel from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-war-missing-military-court-f5a8633d750e496e1fe91dd07fa71a4f	2024-12-10T20:02:53-08:00	
Stock market today: Trading muted on Wall Street ahead of key US inflation report	Trading on Wall Street was muted early Wednesday ahead of the latest update on inflation coming out before markets open. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 edged less than 0.1% higher before the bell, while futures for the Dow were off less than 0.1%. Wednesday’s update on consumer inflation and a report Thursday on inflation at the wholesale level will be the final big pieces of data the Federal Reserve will get before its meeting next week, where many investors expect this year’s third cut to interest rates. The Fed has been easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high since September to take pressure off the slowing jobs market, after bringing inflation nearly down to its 2% target. Lower rates would help give support to the economy, but they could also provide more fuel for inflation. Expectations for a series of cuts through next year have been a big reason the S&amp;P 500 has set so many records this year. In premarket trading Wednesday, Macy's tumbled close to 10% after the department store chain reported a decline in third-quarter profits and sales as consumers continue to divert spending toward essentials amid elevated prices. Macy's raised its annual sales forecast but lowered profit projections, citing an uncertain economic environment. Shares of Kroger stabilized early Wednesday following a more than 5% decline late Tuesday when the supermarket giant's proposed merger with Albertsons was nixed by judges in separate cases in Oregon and Washington. The grocery stores contend the merger would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, but critics of the deal, including the Federal Trade Commission, said the tie-up would hurt competition. Stitch Fix was a big gainer early Wednesday after the personalized fashion styling service posted a narrower loss than expected raised its full-year outlook. Its shares jumped 20% before the bell. Dave &amp; Buster's tumbled 15% after the restaurant and arcade chain posted more than double the loss that Wall Street expected as sales fell. In Europe at midday, Germany’s DAX was flat, while the CAC 40 in Paris and Britain’s FTSE 100 each gained 0.3%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.8% to 20,155.05 while the Shanghai Composite index advanced 0.3% to 3,432.49 as Chinese leaders convened an annual planning meeting in Beijing that is expected to set economic policies and growth targets for the coming year. Earlier this week, top leaders agreed on a 'moderately loose' monetary policy during a meeting of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo. That’s the first move in 10 years away from a more cautious, 'prudent' stance. Readouts from state media hinted at more robust stimulus to support the world’s second-largest economy, but analysts remained skeptical about any dramatic measures. South Korea's market rose for a second straight day, recovering from last week's political turmoil. The Kospi added 1% to 2,442.51. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was little changed at 39,372.23 after data showed that Japan’s wholesale inflation in November rose 3.7% year-on-year, marking three consecutive months of increases and adding to pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates. Japan's central bank will hold a two-day policy meeting next week. Markets widely expect the bank to raise short-term interest rates from the current level of 0.25%. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped 0.5% to 8,353.60. U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 91 cents to $69.50 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 7 cents to $71.05 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 152.65 Japanese yen from 151.93 yen. The euro was trading at $1.0504, down from $1.0531.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-inflation-rates-f52917dbab997a2c95fbeb9b83d175f1	2024-12-10T19:37:44-08:00	
What should I do?' Unpredictable school fees bar many children in Africa from an education	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — The day Shalom Mirembe was sent home from school last month over unpaid tuition, her father lay dying in a hospital. Even as her mother sat by his bedside, school officials were calling and demanding payment. For Mirembe's mother, a shoe vendor who looks after four children, it was a heartbreaking moment in the daily struggle to pay often unpredictable and unregulated school fees. Constant threats demanding payment can leave her feeling helpless. Some officials are more tolerant, but eventually they all grow tired of her pleas. 'You have to care for this one, you have to care for the other one,' Justine Nangero said, describing a delicate balancing act to keep Mirembe and the others enrolled. 'I try to fight to see that I pay to all these schools.' It is a crushing issue for many across sub-Saharan Africa, where the lack of a few hundred dollars can determine a child's future. The region has long had the world's highest dropout rates. Reasons vary, but financial pain is the biggest. Last year, the World Bank said 54% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa rank the issue of paying school fees higher than medical bills and other expenses. It said school fees were the biggest source of financial worry for 40% of people in Uganda, where top government-funded schools now charge nearly $700 in tuition per three-month term. That's a significant amount in this East African country where annual GDP per capita was $864 in 2023. More than anything, it’s the unpredictable tuition hikes — for sometimes questionable reasons — that haunt parents across the country of more than 45 million people. Some critics, including Uganda's parliament speaker, have called for regulation to protect parents from exploitation. The Equal Opportunities Commission, a government agency that tracks inequality and discrimination, released a report in September calling for punitive measures against government-supported schools that appear to set excessive fees. It warned that arbitrarily raising fees can force children to drop out. Attendance falls from 68% in grade school to 22% in secondary school, with financial difficulty the main reason for failure to continue studies, according to new figures from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. Uganda does have a program for universal secondary education, introduced in 2007 and similar to one for primary education, but such schools are often rundown and undesirable for many families. They are generally tuition-free, but parents must pay sometimes burdensome fees for uniforms, textbooks and other items. When it comes to more popular, and more expensive, private schools, the government is not interested in price intervention, said Dennis Mugimba, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education. Setting fees for private schools is 'purely administrative and it is adjusted according to the business environment,' he said. But certain charges such as those including 'capital development' should not be the responsibility of parents, he said. Such private schools have mushroomed across Uganda and now make up the majority of the country's schools, addressing growing demand but also emphasizing the profitability of education as a business. That worries some experts. 'We can’t let education be treated like a market stall,' said Fagil Mandy, a former inspector of schools. Education authorities should standardize regulations to make school fees universally predictable, he said. Routine school expenses, for both private and some top government-funded schools, can include everything from a contribution towards the purchase of a bus to the procurement of laboratory equipment. But when the list of fees includes a ream of photocopying paper or a bag of cement from each student, questions emerge about where they end up. The school that Mirembe attends outside the capital, Kampala, charges the equivalent of $300 per term. Its officials expect 70% of fees to be paid at the beginning of a term, but many parents fail to meet that threshold. Some, like Nangero, send their children to school having paid nothing, counting on the mercy of officials. But measures to track payments include gate passes that show how much is owed and when, and a student may be denied entry, said Joanita Seguya, a deputy head teacher at the school, Wampewo Ntakke Secondary. In the school of more than 2,100 students, roughly 400 are from working-class families that routinely struggle to pay fees, according to Seguya, who said the system can seem harsh. To accommodate some parents, the school accepts in-kind payments such as vegetables and fruit, she said. But Nangero, whose family shares a single room, has nothing of the sort to offer. Her shoe business, long drained of cash by school fees, has collapsed. The death of her husband, whose carpentry once supplemented the family income, has increased the pain. She said anxiety over school fees is more damaging for her children, who spend days at home whenever school officials lose patience. She's grateful that two of her sons in secondary school are now supported by an evangelical cleric — rare support made possible via contact through their religious fellowship. The 20-year-old Mirembe, who is taking her final exams this year, was able to start the school term in September because of a bursar's sympathy, she said, but other officials were not so lenient weeks later as her father was near death. 'At least maybe I will come and pay something tomorrow,' her mother recalled pleading with one official. 'And she told me, ‘No, we are not going to allow your daughter to be here.’' Mirembe arrived home hours before her father died. Vincent Odoi, a teacher at her school, recalled the incident as unfortunate, saying administrators didn’t know of the family’s challenges. Mirembe was allowed to return days after her father’s burial, which some of her teachers attended. Other families are not so fortunate. One is a nearby family of seven children who dropped out of school in recent years for lack of tuition. Their jobless father, Moses Serikomawa, described the scramble in vain for school fees as 'like a cancer. It cannot be treated.' Raising a total of over $200 in school fees each term is too much trouble when the family sometimes lacks food, he said. His oldest child, who would be in high school now, dropped out after completing secondary school last year. Now the boy is idle. 'The children still want to go back to school,' Serikomawa said.

Humanitarian aid to North Gaza mostly blocked for the last 2 months, UN says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Humanitarian aid to North Gaza, where Israel launched a ground offensive on Oct. 6, has largely been blocked for the past 66 days, the United Nations said Tuesday. That has left between 65,000 and 75,000 Palestinians without access to food, water, electricity or health care, according to the world body. In the north, Israel has continued its siege on Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya with Palestinians living there largely denied aid, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, said. Recently, it said, about 5,500 people were forcibly displaced from three schools in Beit Lahiya to Gaza City. Adding to the food crisis, only four U.N.-supported bakeries are currently operating throughout the Gaza Strip, all of them in Gaza City, OCHA said. Sigrid Kaag, the senior U.N. humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told reporters after briefing the U.N. Security Council behind closed doors Tuesday afternoon that civilians trying to survive in Gaza face an 'utterly devastating situation.' She pointed to the breakdown in law and order and looting that has exacerbated a very dire situation and left the U.N. and many aid organizations unable to deliver food and other humanitarian essentials to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in need. Kaag said she and other U.N. officials keep repeatedly asking Israel for access for convoys to North Gaza and elsewhere, to allow in commercial goods, to reopen the Rafah crossing from Egypt in the south, and to approve dual-use items. Israel’s U.N. Mission said it had no comment on Kaag’s remarks. The U.N. has established the logistics for an operation across Gaza, she said, but there is no substitute for political will that humanitarians don’t possess. 'Member states possess it,' Kaag said. And this is what she urged Security Council members and keeps urging the broader international community to press for — the political will to address Gaza’s worsening humanitarian crisis.	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-aid-united-nations-f529bf77d09e609265179e259b799c6b	2024-12-10T15:45:24-08:00	
Ex-defense chief in South Korea tried to kill himself after being arrested over martial law case	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s previous defense minister was stopped from attempting suicide while in detention over last week's martial law, officials said, as police were reported to be raiding President Yoon Suk Yeol’s office Wednesday in their intensifying investigation. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party also plans to submit a new motion to impeach Yoon for his Dec. 3 declaration that imposed martial law. Yoon’s ill-conceived power grab has paralyzed South Korean politics, frozen its foreign policy, and rattled financial markets, greatly reducing his chances of completing his five-year term and casting a turbulent shadow over one of Asia’s most robust democracies. Shin Yong Hae, commissioner general of of the Korea Correctional Service, told lawmakers Wednesday that Kim tried to kill himself at a detention center in Seoul. He said that Kim's suicide attempt failed after center officials stopped him and that he is in a stable condition now. At the same parliament committee meeting, Justice Minister Park Sung Jae confirmed Kim's failed suicide attempt. Kim was arrested earlier Wednesday after a Seoul court approved a warrant for him on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. Kim became the first person formally arrested over the Dec. 3 martial law decree. Later in the day, National Police Agency Commissioner General Cho Ji Ho and Kim Bong-sik, head of the metropolitan police agency of the capital, Seoul, were detained over their actions during martial law. They are being investigated for their roles in deploying police forces to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting to lift Yoon’s martial law decree. South Korean police also searched Yoon's office Wednesday over his martial law decree, Yonhap news agency reported. Other South Korean media also carried similar reports. but Yoon's office and police have not immediately confirmed the search. The country’s main law enforcement institutions are focusing on finding whether Yoon and others involved in imposing martial law committed the crime of rebellion. Yoon survived an impeachment attempt last Saturday when the ruling party boycotted the vote, but the Democratic Party is aiming to put the new motion to a vote on Saturday. After last week’s impeachment motion fell through, the leader of Yoon’s conservative party pledged to arrange his stable exit from power, saying the party will coordinate with Cabinet members over state affairs and that Yoon will be sidelined from duties during a transition to an early election. However, the plans have been widely criticized as unrealistic and unconstitutional. The constitution explicitly states that impeachment is the sole method for suspending presidential powers and that the authority to command the military rests solely with the president. The Defense Ministry said this week that Yoon remains in charge of the country’s military forces. The Assembly was also encircled by heavily armed troops, which military commanders say were deployed on the orders of the former defense minister. But enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and unanimously rejected Yoon’s decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun to obstruct lawmakers from entering the Assembly’s main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim’s instructions was to prevent the 300-member parliament from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon’s martial law order. Kwak said Yoon later called him directly and asked for the troops to 'quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.' Kwak said he discussed Yoon’s order with the commander at the scene and that they concluded there was nothing that could be done, ruling out the possibility of threatening the lawmakers by shooting blanks or cutting off electricity. At the same hearing, senior officer Kim Dae-woo of the military’s counterintelligence agency said his commander, Yeo In-hyung, asked him if an army bunker in Seoul had space to detain politicians and other figures after martial law was imposed. Yeo is considered a close associate of Kim Yong Hyun. Last week, Hong Jang-won, a deputy director of the country’s spy agency, said Yoon ordered him to help Yeo’s command to detain some of his political rivals but he ignored the president’s order. Kwak and Yeo are among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended them last week. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If he is dismissed from office, a new presidential election would be required. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' and South Korea wasn’t in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean Constitution doesn’t allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces,' a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has had near-constant friction with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which introduced motions to impeach some of his top officials and launched a political offensive over scandals involving Yoon and his wife. On Wednesday, North Korea’s state news agency for the first time reported about the political turmoil and street protests triggered by Yoon’s martial law decree. The report mostly attempted to explain the South Korean events though it used its typical abusive language like calling Yoon 'a traitor' and his military 'gangsters.' Many experts say North Korea is sensitive to the domestic spread of news on massive anti-government protests in foreign countries because its own people have no official access to international news and could be affected by such events.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-3210438b8663fe609bfe4cb8b748a114	2024-12-10T15:35:52-08:00	
Vandals burn a car and spray graffiti in latest antisemitic attack in Australia	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Vandals torched a car and sprayed graffiti with anti-Israel slogans including an apparently misspelled 'Kill Israiel' on Wednesday in a Sydney suburb that is home to Australia's largest Jewish community. Officials condemned the attack as antisemitic. The incident in the eastern suburb of Woollahra came after federal police this week established a task force to investigate increasing antisemitic crimes across the country. Police were searching for two male suspects, aged between 15 and 20, who were seen running from the scene of the attack, wearing face masks, or balaclavas, and dark clothing, New South Wales state Police Commissioner Karen Webb said. She said there were 'antisemitic writings' on the walls of two buildings, two cars including the burnt car, and the sidewalks. She did not detail what words were spraypainted, but the media photographed 'Kill Israiel' painted on a garage door. Last week's arson at a Melbourne synagogue marked an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and the militant Hamas group started over a year ago in the Gaza Strip. Premier Chris Minns, the Sydney-based leader of the New South Wales state government, described the attack as an attempt to 'intimidate the Jewish community in Sydney.' 'This was a targeted attack in Sydney’s eastern suburbs ... directly after the burning down of a synagogue,' Minns told reporters. 'This was a deliberate attack ... designed to put fear into the hearts of the people who live in Sydney’s east,' he added. Police say the torched car had been stolen from elsewhere and used by the suspects to get to Woolahra. Stolen cars are often torched before they are abandoned. Two men are in custody facing multiple charges after buildings were similarly graffitied with antisemitic slogans and a car was set alight in another part of Woolahra on Nov. 21. They each face prison sentences of up to 10 years if convicted. Assistant Police Commissioner Peter McKenna said detectives did not believe the Woollahra crimes were linked. 'We will get to the bottom of this. We will bring people to justice,' McKenna said. David Ossip, president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, which represents the state's Jewish community, said the latest Woolahra attack was part of a 'sustained campaign of intimidation, harassment and terror against the Jewish community.' 'But the message to the perpetrators and all who wish ill on the Jewish community is that the Jewish community is strong, it is proud, it is united and it will not be cowed by these attempts to intimidate and harass us,' Ossip said. This week, authorities declared the attack on Melbourne's Adass Israel Synagogue a terrorist attack, which increases the resources and information available to investigators. Also this week, federal police announced Special Operation Avalite to target those behind antisemitic attacks around the country — including the arson at the Melbourne synagogue, the attack on Jewish lawmaker Josh Burns’ Melbourne office in June, and the Woollahra attacks last month. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the Woollahra attack on Wednesday as an 'outrage' and a 'hate crime.' 'It is another antisemitic attack and all Australians must condemn it,' Albanese said. 'I stand with the Jewish community and unequivocally condemn this attack. There’s no place for antisemitism in this country or anywhere else for that matter.' He said he had been briefed by Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw on the attack and would soon be briefed by Special Operation Avalite officials, and rejected allegations the attack could be a criticism of Israel rather than Jews. 'This isn’t an attack on a government, this is an attack on people because they happen to be Jewish,' Albanese said. 'The idea that we take a conflict overseas and bring it here is something that is quite contrary to what Australia was built on.' Government opponents argue that Albanese has been too slow to call out rising antisemitism for fear of alienating pro-Palestinian groups. Opposition Sen. Jane Hume said she knew a Jewish couple who were considering moving from Australia to Israel because they would feel safer there, despite the raging Mideast wars. 'Because the government has prevaricated, because it has used weasel words and wishy-washy language, it does seem that those that are committing these offenses have been emboldened if not enabled by a government that has failed to take leadership,' Hume said. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish global human rights organization, issued a travel warning on Tuesday, urging Jews to 'exercise extreme caution' in Australia as 'a result of the failure of Australian authorities to stand up against persistent demonization, harassment and violence against Jews and Jewish institutions in Australia.'	https://apnews.com/article/australia-sydney-graffiti-woollahra-antisemitism-89f8b08f58047ba1e3e7fb8c6447f52f	2024-12-10T14:07:37-08:00	
The swift fall of Syria's Assad brings moments inconceivable under his iron rule	It took barely 10 days for Syria’s insurgents to march from their stronghold in the northwest into Damascus and bring an end to the Assad family rule that had gripped the country for half a century. Every step of the way brought moments that would have been unbelievable only days earlier. Raising their hands and automatic rifles into the air, insurgents rode out of their enclave in Idlib province on Nov. 28. Some wore Islamic extremist emblems on their uniforms, a sign of the jihadi roots of the leading insurgent faction, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. First to fall was Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, with a swiftness that may have amazed even the fighters. They celebrated by taking photos of each other stomping on a poster of President Bashar Assad in his sunglasses and military uniform. At the airport, they tore down a poster glorifying the ruling family — Bashar; his father and predecessor Hafez Assad; and Bashar’s elder brother Basel, who was supposed to succeed their father but died in a 1994 car crash. More towns and cities fell like dominoes in the following days, including Hama and Homs. Along the way, Assad’s army melted away. Surrendered soldiers lined up for rebel-issued certificates of amnesty. Advancing rebel fighters passed army trucks and tanks abandoned on the side of the highway. There was little fighting. The main response from the government was sporadic airstrikes from Syrian and Russian warplanes. Among the dead was a Syrian photographer, Anas Alkharboutli, who worked for Germany’s DPA news agency. Friends mourned over his body, his press helmet and flak jacket laid on his chest. Overnight Saturday into early Sunday, the fighters marched unopposed into their greatest prize, the capital, Damascus. Assad and his family fled, ultimately taken in by his ally Russia. Assad's regime was deplored by many for its brutality and corruption. Insurgents and civilians celebrated his downfall by waltzing freely into his private residence and ransacking it. One man yanked a chandelier from the ceiling. A fighter posed for a photo behind a gigantic desk surrounded by luxurious furniture of wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl. A family posed in the palace’s grandiose atrium lined with colored marble beneath a giant chandelier. Others streamed into the biggest symbol of Assad’s police state, Saydnaya Prison, hoping to find relatives who had disappeared years or even decades earlier. One man held up nooses he found — a reminder of the mass executions that rights groups say killed thousands of inmates. Insurgents set fire to a military court building, where rights group say death sentences were churned out after perfunctory trials that often lasted just minutes. Some insurgents danced in the streets while others posed — cheering — on an army tank. Many waved the flag of the Syrian opposition, green, white and black with three red stars, instead of the Assad-era flag of red, white and black with two green stars. The insurgent takeover has pushed the country into the unknown. There is potential for more chaos with jihadi militants hoping to seize power and the possibility of conflicts between the many armed factions. But with the end of Assad’s rule, it is a time for celebration.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-fall-of-assad-photo-gallery-f4862a7f801eae711a69482f04b88c8a	2024-12-10T11:08:26-08:00	
Citizens against smog: Protesters in North Macedonia demand action against pollution	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — Thousands of protesters across North Macedonia took part in demonstrations Tuesday to demand better air quality in cities that are among the most polluted in Europe. In the capital, Skopje, demonstrators gathered outside the Environment Ministry, some wearing gas masks to highlight the problem blamed by authorities for some 3,500 premature deaths annually. Pollution levels often spike during the winter months due to the widespread use of log fires. Many urban households, unable to afford central heating, burn wood, old tires, plastic and other waste materials, releasing a toxic mix of harmful chemicals. Protest organizers called for rare national action after winter weather brought another spike in air pollution levels. They demand stricter government regulation of traffic and industry, citing decades of neglect. Gorjan Jovanovski, a prominent environmental campaigner who created a mobile app to monitor air quality, said pollution was forcing city-dwellers to flee as 'ecological migrants.' 'It’s enough! We have waited decades for governments to act, but they’ve done nothing,' Jovanovski said. According to European Union health authorities, pollution levels in Skopje and other Macedonian cities often exceed World Health Organization's limits by more than four times. Several thousands joined Tuesday's protests that were organized by Green Human City, one of several environmental campaign organizations largely focused on air pollution.	https://apnews.com/article/north-macedonia-pollution-protest-e865d9fcd676f6ba169dfc636aeb312d	2024-12-10T10:39:52-08:00	
Haitians demand protection after gang leader massacres dozens of people to avenge son's death	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A gang leader accused of killing more than 100 people in Haiti's capital to avenge his son's death was still persecuting residents on Tuesday, according to a rare witness account. Mackenson Cangé, whose father was among the victims, told Magik9 radio station that residents in the gang-controlled area said gunmen were still hunting down older people and killing younger ones as well. 'I believe in the justice of my country. But I’m tired of the government (only) condemning these massacres. We need to take action,' he said. Few details about the two-day killing spree in the community of Cité Soleil on Friday and Saturday have been made public. Residents have not been allowed to leave, and no images of the killings have been shared on social media like they often have been in previous incidents. A spokesman for Haiti’s National Police did not return messages for comment on Tuesday. Neither did the leader of a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police that deployed earlier this year to help quell gang violence in Haiti. For years, police have been unable to penetrate the gang-controlled area, and even human rights groups have not been able to access it this time, relying on witnesses who live there and often refuse to talk for fear of being killed. Two local human rights groups say more than 100 people were killed on Friday and Saturday, while Volker Türk, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said at least 184 people were killed. It isn't clear how they determined the number of victims. Numbers vary wildly following massacres in Haiti since they occur in areas with limited or no access. The killings blamed on gang leader Micanor Altès, also known as Monel Felix and Wa Mikanò, were triggered by his son’s illness and eventual death, according to the National Human Rights Defense Network and the Cooperative for Peace and Development. The two rights groups said Altès blamed Vodou religious leaders and older people in the community of practicing witchcraft and harming his son. On Tuesday, Haiti’s Office of Citizen Protection decried the killings, noting the victims were between 60 and 80 years old. The ombudsman agency said 'sorcery accusations never justify violence or summary executions. Older people, who have contributed so much to society, deserve respect and protection.' It called on police and judicial officials to react quickly and identify all those responsible. The Haitian Bridge Alliance, a U.S.-based nonprofit, also called for a thorough investigation on Tuesday as it demanded that the government improve security. 'This massacre is a profound tragedy that underscores the escalating crisis of gang violence and lawlessness in Haiti,' said Guerline Jozef, the alliance's executive director. Altès controls the coastal communities of Wharf Jérémie, La Saline and Fort Dimanche and is known for robbery, extortion and hijacking of goods and trucks, according to a U.N. report. Experts say he was not known for being as brutal as other Haitian gang leaders. Cangé said residents in Wharf Jérémie told him that gunmen are still hunting down older people and killing young ones as well. He said his father, Marcel Cangé, was killed after three men showed up at his home on Friday night and demanded he go with them. The older Cangé was already preparing for bed because he was going to church early Saturday and liked to be punctual. When he requested that the men allow him to put on a shirt and pants, they told him it wasn’t necessary, according to his son. 'I never believed something like that would happen to my father,' Mackenson Cangé said, noting he had lived in that community for 29 years. 'My father was assassinated. Stabbed and then burnt.' Cangé said he personally knows some 30 other people who were killed. His mother and sister, who lived with his father, survived. 'I lost a best friend, someone who supported me my whole life,' Cangé said. The gang-controlled area, like many others, remains inaccessible to police and other authorities. While the government has pledged to bring those responsible to justice, it wasn’t clear how it planned to do so. 'A red line has been crossed, and the state will mobilize all its forces to track down and destroy these criminals,' the government said in a statement Monday. More than 4,500 people have been reported killed so far this year in Haiti.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-massacre-killed-gangs-5fe82962c3111f433308ec1b28913857	2024-12-10T10:34:02-08:00	
Venezuela's opposition signals flexible timeline toward long-sought government transition	MADRID (AP) — Venezuela’s political opposition on Tuesday signaled a shift toward a flexible timeline for a government transition that it had long insisted would come next month when the new presidential term is set to begin. The change came as the faction’s candidate in the July presidential election, Edmundo González, remained in exile in Spain and its leader Maria Corina Machado continued to hide in Venezuela, both efforts meant to avoid arrest, with only 30 days left before Venezuela’s constitutionally mandated swearing-in ceremony. The move underscores the challenges the opposition coalition faces to deliver on its promise to remove President Nicolás Maduro from office, even as dozens of nations back the faction's claim to victory and denounce the government for electoral fraud. 'On January 10, the one who is against the wall is really Maduro, not us,' Machado said via livestream during an event in Madrid, that highlighted the repression ruling party opponents have faced since the July 28 election. 'When will that understanding really be reached and trigger the transition? It could be before, it could be on January 10, it could be after.' Machado did not give details of the 'terms of a negotiation' which she said the opposition has offered the government. But the faction has repeatedly said that a top priority is the release from prison of hundreds of people detained for being actual or perceived government opponents. Venezuela’s National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared him the election winner hours after polls closed. But unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. Meanwhile, the main opposition coalition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said the voting records showed González won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. The government ignored calls for transparency from inside and outside Venezuela, and instead, the ruling party-controlled National Assembly sent Maduro an invitation for his swearing-in ceremony. González left Venezuela in September for exile in Spain after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with an investigation into the publishing of the vote tally sheets, while Machado has been hiding for months at an undisclosed location, which she says is in Venezuela. González again told reporters Tuesday that he is willing to return to Venezuela to take office. 'I see myself assuming the position for which I was voted by the majority of Venezuelans on July 28,' he said without offering a timeframe. Dozens of governments, including the United States, have recognized González as the election winner, but it is unclear whether Maduro and allies would allow him to enter Venezuela. Anti-government protests erupted nationwide the day after the election, drawing repression from state security forces, which arrested more than 2,200 people, including political leaders, lawyers, poll workers, election volunteers and protesters, both minors and adults. Relatives of a few of the detained attended the event in Madrid and spoke of the conditions detainees face. The arrests had a chilling effect across the country, with people carefully choosing what they say in public or on social media. The move also hit the opposition's capacity to summon thousands to the streets. Not a single massive rally has taken place since August, but Machado sought to quelch doubts about the strength of her movement, arguing that it continues to gain 'more and more support' and characterizing the repression as the actions of a government 'in a terminal state.' 'We were told that it was impossible for us to defeat the regime on July 28, and we did,' she said. 'The voices that today want us to believe that it is not possible to enforce (the election’s result) will be wrong again. So, it is time to move forward firmly.'	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-election-president-maduro-opposition-machado-edmundo-f9edc6ec5276728eeea6446010b09c2a	2024-12-10T09:09:55-08:00	
Syrians in Germany worried by some politicians' eagerness for them to go home after Assad's fall	BERLIN (AP) — Nearly a decade after he arrived in Germany from Syria and took a selfie with then-Chancellor Angela Merkel, Anas Modamani has finished his university studies and has a German passport. He’s less positive about some German politicians’ reactions to the fall of Bashar Assad, which was followed within hours by the first talk of Syrians returning. 'Berlin has become my second home, I will definitely stay here,' Modamani said Tuesday. 'I managed it' — a reference to Merkel's famous slogan 'We will manage it,' coined as Germany faced the challenge of integrating hundreds of thousands of migrants. As Syrians took to the streets of Berlin Sunday, far-right leader Alice Weidel wrote on social platform X that anyone celebrating a 'free Syria' in Germany 'evidently no longer has a reason to flee. He should return to Syria immediately.' With a German election approaching and the government under longstanding pressure to reduce irregular migration, some mainstream opposition politicians also appeared eager to kickstart the return of Syrians. On Monday, prominent conservative lawmaker Jens Spahn suggested on n-tv television the government could say that 'for everyone who wants to go back to Syria, we will charter planes for them, they will get a starting fund of 1,000 euros ($1,055).' He stressed, though, that it will take time before it's clear whether things have stabilized. Such ideas strike Syrians as indecently hasty. Modamani, a 27-year-old from Damascus who came to Germany in 2015, said he was 'shocked' by reports of the 1,000-euro proposal. 'I think that’s a terrible idea,' he said as he sat over lunch with Syrian friends at a Berlin restaurant. 'The situation in Syria is still just as dangerous as before.' Modamani, who says he shares an apartment with his girlfriend from Ukraine and finished his studies in business communication, illustrates what German officials acknowledge is the successful integration of many Syrians. A deputy interior minister, Juliane Seifert, said Syrians are 'a group that has significantly above-average educational qualifications,' among them many doctors. The number of Syrians gaining German citizenship has risen from 6,700 in 2020 to 75,500 last year, when they were the biggest single group and accounted for 38% of all naturalizations. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, whose conservative party has talked tough on migration, said Tuesday that many Syrian refugees are now 'superbly integrated in our country, have a job and are urgently needed here' and no one is thinking of getting such people to leave Germany. 'Those who have already integrated well are still cordially welcome,' Herrmann told Deutschlandfunk radio Tuesday. 'But it is clear that there are also people who have been here for 10 years and don’t have a job and haven’t integrated well, and then it’s right to help them return to their homeland' if Syria stabilizes. It's not surprising that hopes of a more stable Syria raise hopes in Germany of reducing immigration. Official figures show that, at the end of October, there were nearly 975,000 Syrian nationals in Germany, a country of 83 million. The majority had some kind of refugee or other protected status. On Monday, Germany and a string of other European countries announced that they were suspending decisions on Syrians' asylum applications as they wait for the situation in Syria to become clearer. Over 47,000 cases are pending in Germany, one of the main destinations for Syrians outside the Middle East. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said that is the right thing to do, but it would be 'unserious to speculate in such a volatile situation' about the eventual return of Syrians. Among those who will may face a longer wait is Basil Khalil, a 26-year-old Kurdish Syrian who said he applied for asylum Monday after crossing from Turkey into Bulgaria and traveling to Germany on the back of a truck. Khalil said he spent the last nine years as a refugee in Turkey, but was worried that Turkish authorities may soon start deporting Syrians. 'I applied for asylum in Germany because I’m afraid that back in Syria I may get drafted as a soldier,' he told The Associated Press as his cousin translated for him. 'But if the German government will deport me, then I guess I will go back,' Khalil said. 'We Syrians have been through so much suffering, all we want to do is survive.' Tarek Alaows, a spokesperson for pro-refugee group Pro Asyl, said that 'many from the Syrian community naturally want to return ... Many want to participate in the reconstruction. But they must not be forced to leave the country' for a still-unstable Syria. Alaows, 35, who fled Damascus in 2015 and became a German citizen over three years ago, said many Syrians in Germany were concerned to hear public calls so soon for the quick return of Syrians. 'These debates that are going on right now — nobody needs them,' he said. Yamn Molhem, who arrived 10 years ago, sees it the same way. The 39-year-old father of four now manages the Aldimashqi restaurant on Berlin’s Sonnenallee boulevard, known for its many Arabic stores and businesses. 'All of my family has left Aleppo, and the situation in Syria is generally very unstable,' he said. Molhem said he is applying for a German passport, proudly adding that his youngest son already has one. ’They can’t deport our family,' said, 'My son is German.' In general, Molhem said, Germans should think twice before they even consider sending back Syrians who work, pay taxes and help keep the economy running. 'Syrians don’t just sleep here,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-syria-refugees-asylum-future-ab24be8f2ffef4e118ed12a4b0df110f	2024-12-10T08:04:27-08:00	
US says it will support new Syrian leaders who protect women and renounce terrorism	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Tuesday it will recognize and support a new Syrian government that renounces terrorism, destroys chemical weapons stocks and protects the rights of minorities and women. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the U.S. would work with groups in Syria and regional partners to ensure that the transition from President Bashar Assad’s deposed government runs smoothly. He was not specific about which groups the U.S. would work with, but the State Department has not ruled out talks with the main Syrian rebel group despite its designation as a terrorist organization. The qualified pledge of support for a post-Assad Syria comes as the Biden administration continues to look to target Islamic State fighters to prevent the group from reemerging as an international threat and maintains support for Israel as its forces conduct their own operations inside Syria. The sudden ouster of Assad has left President Joe Biden's outgoing administration having to delicately maneuver through yet another volatile moment in the Middle East and as President-elect Donald Trump demands that the United States tread carefully in the region and stay out of the fray. 'The transition process and new government must also uphold clear commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbors, and ensure that any chemical or biological weapons stockpiles are secured and safely destroyed,' Blinken said. He added that Syrians should decide their future and that other countries should 'support an inclusive and transparent process' and not interfere. 'The United States will recognize and fully support a future Syria government that results from this process,' Blinken said. 'We stand prepared to lend all appropriate support to all of Syria’s diverse communities and constituencies.' The Assad government collapsed over the weekend during lightning strikes led by the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, known as HTS, which has been designated a 'foreign terrorist organization' by the U.S. since 2012. The State Department says it will review that designation if the group takes steps to reverse the reasons for it but says the listing itself does not prohibit discussions between its members and U.S. officials. Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, whom Trump has picked to serve as his national security adviser, said the 'jury is out' on HTS and its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani. 'On the one hand, though, he’s not, at least so far, beheading former Assad regime officials or hanging them from bridges. They do seem to be sitting and talking, which is a very, which is a good initial first sign,' Waltz said in a Fox News interview. 'But President Trump and our team are watching very closely., and we’re also watching very closely the tens of thousands of ISIS fighters and their, and their families that are still held in camps from when President Trump in his first term cleaned up and destroyed the ISIS caliphate.' The White House also signaled its approval of Israel’s strikes against Syrian military and alleged chemical weapons targets as well as the seizure of a buffer zone in the Golan Heights after the fall of the Assad government. 'These are exigent operations to eliminate what they believe are imminent threats to their national security,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday, saying the U.S. would leave it up to the Israelis to discuss their operations. 'They have, as always, the right to defend themselves,' Kirby said. He declined to say whether any U.S. intelligence cooperation with the Israelis may have gone into the strikes. Kirby said the White House was reasserting its support of the 1974 Golan Heights disengagement agreement, but he didn’t criticize the Israeli seizure of the demilitarized zone. The agreement on disengagement between Israel and Syria, which concluded the Yom Kippur War, established the buffer zone. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel's military is temporarily seizing control of the buffer zone, saying the disengagement agreement has collapsed with the rebel takeover of Syria. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar are condemning Israel’s deployment into Golan Heights, a plateau about 60 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Damascus. Israel seized the strategic highlands from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War and unilaterally annexed it in 1981. The U.S., during Trump's first White House term, became the only country to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan, which the rest of the international community regards as Israeli-occupied. Biden is dispatching his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Israel this week for talks with Netanyahu and Israelis officials about the situation in Syria and ongoing efforts to win a ceasefire and hostage deal that could bring an endgame to the war in Gaza. Sullivan is scheduled to meet on Tuesday at the White House with the families of American hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Kirby said while Israel and Hamas are 'not on the verge of completion of a deal,' U.S. officials think the evolving situation could bolster the chances of getting a deal done. 'Hamas has got to be looking out at the world today and realizing that the cavalry’s not coming to rescue them. and so one would hope that recent developments in Syria reinforce, for them, that they are just increasingly isolated and ought to take a deal,' Kirby said.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-united-states-assad-b02790878868ddb3d2f5bc887b66fd5e	2024-12-10T07:30:54-08:00	
US officials to investigate labor and human rights abuses in Nicaragua	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is opening an investigation into labor and human rights abuses in Nicaragua, impacting relations with a country the U.S. has a free trade deal with amid growing concerns over President Daniel Ortega’s increasingly authoritarian rule. The investigation being opened by the U.S. Trade Representative must be completed within a year. 'Numerous reports suggest the Government of Nicaragua is engaging in repressive acts that harm Nicaragua’s own workers and people, undermine fair competition, and destabilize our region,' U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a statement. The investigation, authorized under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, will look into not only allegations of abuse but also the extent to which they affect commerce with the U.S. Only after that determination is made will retaliatory actions, if any, be taken. The U.S. trade representative, in her statement, cited credible reports by several watchdog groups against Ortega's government, including politically-motivated arrests, forced labor, human trafficking and repression of freedom of association and collective bargaining. 'Such actions exacerbate worker exploitation and diminish economic growth and trade opportunities,' the agency said, adding that its decision to open the probe was part of a range of actions taken Tuesday to mark International Human Rights Day. Nicaragua Vice President and government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo did not immediately respond to an emailed request seeking comment. In May, the U.S. government imposed Section 301 tariffs on an array of Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel and aluminum. Those tariffs largely reflected the government’s conclusion that China was unfairly subsidizing those industries. 'For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies,' President Joe Biden said about those tariffs. 'It’s not competition, it’s cheating.' In Nicaragua’s case, any retaliatory action would be complicated by its membership in a regional free trade pact, the Central America Free Trade Agreement. Of the five members of the trade pact, Nicaragua is one of only two to run a trade surplus with the U.S., about $3 billion in 2022, or almost 20% of its gross domestic product. Ortega last month proposed a constitutional reform that would officially make him and his wife, Murillo, 'copresidents' of the Central American nation and extend the presidential term to six years from five. The proposals come amid an ongoing crackdown by the Ortega government that has resulted in the mass imprisonment and forced exile of adversaries including religious leaders and journalists. Since 2018, the government has shuttered more than 5,000 organizations, largely religious, and forced thousands to flee the country. — AP Writer Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/us-nicaragua-trade-investigation-labor-abuse-211917bda504c6b35a60c39709a71b2d	2024-12-10T07:09:32-08:00	
Japanese survivor of atomic bomb recalls its horrors in Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech	OSLO, Norway (AP) — A 92-year-old Japanese man who lived through the American atomic bombing of Nagasaki described on Tuesday the agony he witnessed in 1945, including the charred corpses of his loved ones and the ruins of his city, as he accepted this year's Nobel Peace Prize on his organization's behalf. The prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of Japanese atomic bombing survivors who have worked for nearly 70 years to maintain a taboo around the use of nuclear weapons. The weapons have grown exponentially in power and number since being used for the first and only time in warfare by the United States on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945. The bombings pushed Japan to surrender to the Allies. They killed some 210,000 people by the end of 1945, but the full death toll from radiation is certainly higher. As the survivors reach the twilight of their lives, they are grappling with the fear that the taboo against using the weapons appears to be weakening. It was a concern expressed by the 92-year-old-survivor, Terumi Tanaka, who delivered the acceptance lecture in Oslo's City Hall to an audience that included Norway's royal family. 'The nuclear superpower Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, and a cabinet member of Israel, in the midst of its unrelenting attacks on Gaza in Palestine, even spoke of the possible use of nuclear arms,' Tanaka said. 'I am infinitely saddened and angered that the nuclear taboo threatens to be broken.' That concern drove the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award this year's prize to the Japanese organization, though it had honored other nuclear non-proliferation work in the past. Jørgen Watne Frydnes, the chair of the committee, said in introducing the laureates that it was important to learn from their testimony as the nuclear dangers grow. 'None of the nine countries that possess nuclear weapons — the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea — appear interested in nuclear disarmament and arms control at present,' he said. 'On the contrary, they are modernizing and building up their nuclear arsenals.' He said the Norwegian Nobel Committee was calling upon the five nuclear weapon states that have signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons — the U.S., Russia, China, France and the U.K. — to take seriously their obligations under the treaty, and said others must ratify it. 'It is naive to believe our civilization can survive a world order in which global security depends on nuclear weapons,' Frydnes said. 'The world is not meant to be a prison in which we await collective annihilation.' In his speech, Tanaka described the attack on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. He recalled the buzzing sound of a bomber jet followed by a 'bright, white light,' and then an intense shock wave. Three days later, he and his mother sought out loved ones who lived near the hypocenter. 'Many people who were badly injured or burned, but still alive, were left unattended, with no help whatsoever. I became almost devoid of emotion, somehow closing off my sense of humanity, and simply headed intently for my destination,' he said. He found the charred body of an aunt, the body of her grandson, his grandfather on the brink of death with severe burns and another aunt who had been severely burned and died just before he arrived. In all, five family members were killed. He described the efforts of survivors to use their experiences to try to abolish nuclear weapons for the sake of humanity, and to try to receive compensation from the Japanese state, which started the war, for their suffering. 'I hope that the belief that nuclear weapons cannot — and must not — coexist with humanity will take firm hold among citizens of the nuclear weapon states and their allies, and that this will become a force for change in the nuclear policies of their governments,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/norway-nobel-japan-peace-prize-nuclear-9f39bcd5d6035fb1e75ac2030cf5c009	2024-12-10T07:00:55-08:00	
Negotiations over the war in Ukraine could start 'in the winter,' Poland's leader Tusk says	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s prime minister said Tuesday that negotiations over Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine could start 'in the winter,' as his country prepares to take over the rotating presidency of the European Union on Jan. 1. 'Our presidency will have, among others, joint responsibility for the shape of the political landscape, for what the situation will look like probably during the negotiations that, perhaps — there are still question marks here — will begin in the winter of this year,' Prime Minister Donald Tusk told his Cabinet. He said he hoped that the 'end effect' of Poland's and the EU's efforts will be peace in Ukraine. He offered no details of the efforts or any time frame. He didn't say who might be involved in the negotiations or where or when they might take place. Poland has been one of Ukraine's strongest backers against Russia's full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022. Poland will assume the EU presidency just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in the U.S. Trump has been pushing for an end to the war in Ukraine and during his campaign said that he could settle the matter in a day if he were elected. In a television interview that aired Sunday, Trump also said he would be open to reducing military aid to Ukraine and pulling the United States out of NATO. Those are two threats that have alarmed Ukraine, NATO allies and many in the U.S. national security community. Tusk said that he would be holding numerous meetings with political leaders concerning the situation relating to the war in Ukraine. Later Tuesday, he was meeting with Friedrich Merz, the head of Germany's CDU party, who was returning from talks in Kyiv with the Ukrainian government. Tusk will also speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. French President Emmanuel Macron is expected in Warsaw on Thursday, and Tusk said they will talk about meetings Macron recently held in Paris with Trump and Zelenskyy. Tusk said that Poland was taking the six-month EU presidency during a 'very dramatic' situation for the continent. Last week, he pointed to armed conflicts, also in Europe's vicinity, political crises some of Europe's biggest countries are going through and to the change in U.S. leadership. 'I would like it very much for Poland to be the country that will not only mark its presence all the time, but will also set the tone of the decisions that are to bring us security and safeguard Poland's interests,' Tusk told a government meeting.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-war-poland-tusk-negotiations-russia-eu-23802e5b26f5c0c1d45a32e9cc80f362	2024-12-10T05:36:21-08:00

Netanyahu is testifying in his corruption trial. He has been dogged by scandal for years	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the witness stand Tuesday for the first time in his long-running trial on corruption charges. But long before these accusations emerged, Netanyahu has been vexed by a flurry of embarrassing scandals and allegations. Netanyahu consistently and vehemently denies wrongdoing and has assailed investigations into his conduct or that of his family as witch hunts driven by a hostile media and a biased justice system. Here’s a look at some of the scandals that have beset Netanyahu, his family and his aides since he began to dominate Israel’s political scene. Submarine suspicions Close confidants of Netanyahu are suspected of receiving bribes to advance a deal to purchase submarines and other warships from Germany. Netanyahu is not a suspect in that case. But a state commission of inquiry looking into the affair earlier this year sent a letter to the prime minister warning him that he could be harmed by its conclusions. The committee did not detail the precise accusations against Netanyahu, but painted a picture of improper decision-making at multiple levels in government, the defense establishment and the military. He denies wrongdoing. Leaked and doctored documents A spokesperson for the Israeli leader has been charged with leaking classified information to German tabloid 'Bild' that indictments alleged harmed Israel's wartime security and interests. Netanyahu himself has not been accused of wrongdoing. Critics say the leak was meant to sway public opinion to be more in favor of Netanyahu's negotiating positions with Hamas, and diminish public pressure on him to reach a deal to release hostages held by the militants. Another Netanyahu aide is being investigated for doctoring documents, a move critics say was meant to protect Netanyahu from future investigations into his wartime conduct. Big spending In 2016, an official expense report revealed that Netanyahu spent more than $600,000 of public funds on a six-day trip to New York, including $1,600 on a personal hairdresser. Three years earlier, he was criticized for spending $127,000 in public funds for a special sleeping cabin on a five-hour flight to London. Netanyahu contended he was unaware of the cost and halted the practice. He also was forced to stop purchasing ice cream from an artisanal Jerusalem parlor after news erupted that his office ran up a $2,700 bill for his favorite flavors, vanilla and pistachio. His wife, Sara, has also been charged with misusing some $100,000 in public funds to order lavish meals from celebrity chefs at the prime minister’s official residence, even though she already had cooks on the government payroll. She agreed to pay $15,000 for misusing state funds as part of a plea deal. Allegations also mounted against the Netanyahus for using government money to purchase furniture for their private beach house and to cover the medical expenses of Sara Netanyahu’s late father. The attorney general ultimately dismissed the allegations. Flying high Netanyahu was suspected of double billing travel expenses and using state funds to cover personal travel in the 2000s, while he was finance minister and opposition leader. After a drawn-out investigation, the attorney general dismissed the case. Unhappy household Netanyahu's household staff has repeatedly accused Sara Netanyahu of explosive tirades and mistreatment. During Netanyahu’s first stint as prime minister, the family’s nanny said she was fired by Netanyahu’s wife for burning a pot of vegetable soup. The young woman said she was thrown out of the family’s home without her clothes or passport, and later was ordered to pick up her belongings dumped outside the front gate. Netanyahu’s office said the woman was fired because she was prone to violent outbursts. Two household aides have won damages in lawsuits accusing Sara Netanyahu of abusive conduct. In 2016, a Jerusalem court awarded one domestic worker over $42,000 in damages. Netanyahu and his wife have both rejected the accusations. In 2018, a recorded phone conversation surfaced of the prime minister's wife screaming at her publicist about how a gossip column omitted mention of her educational credentials. Joyride In 2018, a recording surfaced of Netanyahu’s eldest son, Yair, joyriding with his super-rich buddies to Tel Aviv strip clubs in a drunken night out in a taxpayer-funded government vehicle. He later apologized. The 33-year-old Netanyahu has also sparked controversy for lewd and offensive social media posts over the years, such as his publishing a caricature that drew on classic antisemitic tropes. Facebook briefly suspended his account after he wrote he would prefer an Israel without any Muslims. Mistress leak Back in the 1990s, rumors circulated that a videotape existed depicting Netanyahu and his image consultant, a married woman named Ruth Bar, in 'compromising romantic situations.' In response, Netanyahu went on television and confessed to adultery, even though the tape never turned up. Influence peddling During his first term in office in the 1990s, Netanyahu was suspected of appointing a crony as attorney general in exchange for political support from the ultra-religious Shas party. Prosecutors called Netanyahu’s conduct 'puzzling' but ultimately closed the case, citing lack of evidence. Lining pockets During that same spell in office, Netanyahu and his wife were suspected of pocketing gifts and foreign contributions received from world leaders — items considered state property. The Netanyahus also were suspected of accepting favors from a contractor. Both cases were closed without charges.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-netanyahu-corruption-trial-scandals-13d309b5513d8f18c67a7cb364b97533	2024-12-10T05:20:07-08:00	
France flies out 2 Mirage fighter jets from Chad to signal beginning of military withdrawal	PARIS (AP) — France flew out the two Mirage fighter jets it had stationed in Chad on Tuesday, signaling the beginning of the withdrawal of its military forces from the former French colony in Central Africa that last month broke off its defense cooperation agreement with Paris. The pair of Mirage 2000-D fighters took off after midday from a French base in the capital, N’Djamena, after Chadian military forces came to wish them farewell, and were returning to a French air force base in Nancy in eastern France, French military spokesman Col. Guillaume Vernet said. He added that negotiations with Chadian authorities were continuing on how and when France might withdraw other members of its 1,000-strong force in Chad, and whether all or just some of them will leave. In announcing the end of the defense cooperation agreement with France last month, the Chadian government described the decision as a historic turning point for the country that gained independence in 1960, and said that it would enable Chad to redefine its strategic partnerships in line with national priorities. Chad was one of the last countries in the region in which France maintained a large military presence, having been ousted in recent years from Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso after years of fighting Islamic extremists alongside regional troops. Those countries have inched closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel, the vast expanse below the Sahara desert. France has maintained about 1,000 troops in Chad. Chadian authorities didn’t specify when they have to leave and said the end of the defense agreement in no way calls into question the countries’ historical ties and that it wants to maintain relations in other areas of common interest. Last week, hundreds of people marched in N’Djamena to call for the withdrawal of French troops, chanting 'Chad for us, France out!' Some held banners that read, 'We do not want to see a single French person in Chad.'	https://apnews.com/article/france-chad-military-withdrawal-mirage-fighter-jets-6d98f486f122e0792b66397633aca3a8	2024-12-10T04:07:42-08:00	
Dutch police arrest 3 with possible links to huge apartment explosion that killed 6 in The Hague	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Dutch police said Tuesday that they have arrested three suspects who might have been involved in the explosion and fire that killed six people in an apartment building in The Hague over the weekend. Authorities had said they were investigating 'all possibilities' that could have caused the disaster, and the arrests indicate there might have been a criminal intent. 'More arrests are not excluded,' The Hague police said in a statement. It didn't elaborate on any reason for the arrests and said the three were seen as 'possibly implicated in the explosion.' Police also seized several vehicles, but they said that it was unclear whether they included the one which was seen driving away at high speed from the site shortly after the explosion. Early Saturday, residents of the northeastern neighborhood of Mariahoeve in The Hague heard the blast and screams before dawn, and authorities were still working at the scene of collapsed homes on Tuesday.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-gas-explosion-fire-apartments-hague-11f06d110ca7dc6ebc8a7eca73992a78	2024-12-10T03:45:14-08:00	
China's CATL forms joint venture with Stellantis to build electric vehicle battery factory in Spain	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Chinese electric battery company CATL and automaker Stellantis will build a major battery factory in northern Spain, the partners announced Tuesday. They said the plant will be located in Zaragoza and start producing lithium iron phosphate batteries by the end of 2026. The joint venture represents an investment of 4.1 billion euros ($4.3 billion), they said in a statement. The plant plans to be carbon neutral, apparently by making use of Spain's ample supplies of solar, wind and water power. The announcement comes after CATL and Stellantis agreed in November 2023 to collaborate on fabrication of batteries to help build electric cars in Europe. European carmakers are struggling to keep up with their Chinese counterparts in electric cars, a key pillar of the green transition that the European Union is pursuing. The bloc's 27 member states won’t be able to produce internal combustion cars after 2035. The EU, like the United States, is applying tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China to help protect domestic producers and encourage Chinese carmakers to move production to Europe and create local jobs. CATL and other Chinese battery makers are far ahead in the critical area of producing batteries for electric vehicles. Northvolt, Europe’s great hope for catching up, filed for bankruptcy last month. CATL is already producing batteries at two European factories in Germany and Hungary. The deal comes a day after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez met with CATL Chairman Robin Zeng in Madrid. Spain produces the second most cars in the EU after Germany. Sánchez posted on X that he was 'very satisfied' when the deal was made official. Spain’s Minister of Industry Jordi Hereu applauded the announcement, which he said received public funding from Europe’s post-pandemic recovery plan that includes Spain's ambitious plan to shift to electric vehicles. 'We all have a lot riding on the transition toward an electric transport model,' Hereu told reporters. 'Therefore we consider this investment to be a great sign that the car industry believes in Spain.' Stellantis includes the Chrysler, Citroen, Dodge, Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat, Opel and Alfa Romeo brands, among others. In Spain, Stellantis group has car factories in Zaragoza, Vigo and Madrid. The production of electric vehicles in Spain has risen from just 16,000 models in 2019 to 323,000 in 2023, but that is still 13% of the total output of 2.4 million vehicles produced, according to ANFAC, the Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers. Germany, which is now seeing layoffs in its car industry, led Europe with 4.1 vehicles of all types produced in 2023, ANFAC said. Volkswagen Group, through its Spanish affiliate SEAT, announced in 2022 its plans to build an electric battery plant in Spain's eastern Valencia region.	https://apnews.com/article/electric-car-batteries-china-spain-stellantis-catl-eaec84bbc375c8814c1030dab73f389b	2024-12-10T01:56:59-08:00	
Death toll in Italy fuel depot blast rises to 5	ROME (AP) — Rescuers found the body of the last missing person on Tuesday at the site of a fuel depot explosion in Italy's central Tuscany region, bringing the death toll to five, Italian media reported. The blast on Monday caused the collapse of a building with offices, injuring 14 people, Tuscany’s governor Eugenio Giani said, adding that two were in critical condition. The explosion struck an ENI fuel depot north of Florence, sending a dark plume of smoke into the air. Witnesses kilometers away reported a large bang and tremors. Residents were initially advised to keep their windows closed, but environmental officials later determined that the air quality was safe. The smoke temporarily interrupted regional train services. The cause of the blast at the depot in the town of Calenzano was under investigation. The flames were quickly contained, preventing the fire from spreading to storage tanks from a loading dock area where the explosion occurred. Prosecutors in the nearby city of Prato have started an investigation into the deadly blast.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-calenzano-eni-fuel-depot-explosion-deaths-116a9a499c9d041d6db943d3b8d53cb2	2024-12-10T00:38:36-08:00	
Hundreds protest in New Delhi against reported attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh	NEW DELHI (AP) — Hundreds of protesters rallied near the Bangladesh diplomatic mission in the Indian capital on Tuesday, pressing for an end to reported attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh after former premier Sheikh Hasina fled into exile in India in August. The protesters demanded an intervention by the United Nations, carrying banners and placards that criticized the world body for not doing more to address the problems in Bangladesh. They also rejected claims by interim government officials in Bangladesh that the targeting of minorities was an internal matter. 'It's a very serious attack, a very sustained attack on the lives of the (Hindu) minority,' said Veena Sikri, a former Indian ambassador to Bangladesh. Attacks on the livelihoods, homes and businesses of minorities in Bangladesh must stop, she said. Scores of social and cultural organizations joined the protest in New Delhi a day after top Foreign Ministry officials from the two countries, Vikram Misri and Mohammad Jashim Uddin, met in Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital, to discuss their strained relations. It was the first high-level visit to Bangladesh by an Indian official since massive protests ended Hasina’s 15-year rule. Following Hasina's ouster, minorities — and particularly Hindus — have reported widespread attacks in the Muslim-majority nation of Bangladesh, but Bangladesh says the reports are widely exaggerated. Most Bangladeshi Hindus are thought to support Hasina’s secular Awami League party. Tensions spiked over the recent arrest of a Hindu spiritual leader in Bangladesh, which is currently being run by an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. India also stopped issuing visas to Bangladeshis, except for emergency medical visas, after Hasina fled. Many Indian nationals working on infrastructure projects also left Bangladesh because of security threats. After Monday's meeting, Misri told reporters there was no reason for the mutually beneficial relationship between the two countries to deteriorate. 'To that end, therefore, I have underlined today India’s desire to work closely with the interim government of Bangladesh,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/indians-protest-bangladesh-diplomatic-mission-hindu-minority-attack-154c6cef14508507aab5a841846c4e21	2024-12-10T00:10:30-08:00	
Doctors say Brazil's Lula is recovering after surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is recovering in an intensive care unit after undergoing unplanned surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage, doctors said Tuesday. The procedure was performed after the 79-year-old leftist leader suffered complications resulting from a fall at home in October, doctors said. 'He is in a stable condition, talking normally and eating. He will remain under observation for the next few days,' Dr. Roberto Kalil with the Sirio-Libanes hospital in Sao Paulo told a press conference. There will be no aftereffects, doctors said, adding that Lula expected to return to the capital, Brasilia, at the beginning of next week. Until then, he will not be working, they said. Lula traveled from Brasilia in the early hours Tuesday to be treated in Sao Paulo, 1,000 kilometers south (620 miles). Doctors said the first lady was at his side and the president had no other visitors. Lula canceled a trip to Russia for a BRICS summit after the accident, his office said at the time. It left him with a cut visible on the back of his head, slightly above his neck. Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa sent his best wishes for a full and speedy recovery, according to a statement. Colombia's President Gustavo Petro posted his wishes on X, calling Lula a 'comrade.'	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-surgery-recovering-icu-bb058df92bf29fb67a5fb1d44700aa39	2024-12-09T23:45:07-08:00	
Israeli warplanes pound Syria as troops reportedly advance deeper into the country	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Israel carried out a wave of heavy airstrikes across Syria as its troops advanced deeper into the country, a Syrian opposition war monitor said Tuesday. Israel denied its forces were advancing toward Damascus after they pushed into a buffer zone inside Syria following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. Associated Press reporters in the capital heard heavy airstrikes overnight and into Tuesday on the city and its suburbs. Photographs circulating online showed destroyed missile launchers, helicopters and warplanes. There was no immediate comment from the insurgent groups — led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS – that have taken control of much of the country. Their lightning advance brought an end to the Assad family’s half-century rule after nearly 14 years of civil war. There are concerns over what comes next. ‘Damascus is more beautiful now’ Life in the capital is slowly returning to normal after the overthrow of Assad, who fled the country over the weekend and has been granted political asylum in Russia. Private banks reopened on instructions from the Central Bank, said Sadi Ahmad, who runs a branch in the upscale Abu Rummaneh neighborhood. He said all his employees returned to work. Shops also reopened in the city's ancient Hamidiyeh market, where armed men and civilians could be seen buying things like perfume and ice cream. A clothing shop owner, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said he hoped vendors would no longer have to pay bribes to security officials. At Bakdash, a famous ice cream shop, a poster outside read: 'Welcome to the rebels of free Syria. Long live free Syria.' 'Damascus is more beautiful now,' said Maysoun Qurabi, who was shopping in the market. 'It has a soul, and people feel at ease and secure.' Under Assad, she said, 'people were hungry and scared. The regime was strong.' Israeli incursion draws condemnation In the immediate aftermath of Assad's fall, Israeli forces moved into a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) buffer zone inside Syria that had been established after the 1973 Mideast war, a move it said was taken to prevent attacks on its citizens. Israel has also said it is striking suspected chemical weapons sites and heavy weapons to prevent them from falling into the hands of extremists. Israeli officials rarely acknowledge individual strikes. Israel has a long history of seizing territory during wars with its neighbors and occupying it indefinitely, citing security concerns. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally, except by the United States. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has closely tracked the conflict since the civil war erupted in 2011, said Israel has carried out more than 300 airstrikes across the country since the rebels overthrew Assad. The Observatory, and Beirut-based Mayadeen TV, which has reporters in Syria, said Israeli troops are advancing up the Syrian side of the border with Lebanon and had come within 25 kilometers (15 miles) of Damascus, which the Israeli military denied. Israel denies advancing toward Damascus Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said 'the reports circulating in the media about the alleged advancement of Israeli tanks towards Damascus are false.' He said Israeli troops are stationed within the buffer zone in order to protect Israel. Israel's military had previously said troops would enter the buffer zone 'and several other places necessary for its defense.' Israeli media meanwhile reported that the air force was methodically destroying Syria's military assets to ensure whoever rules the country next would have to rebuild them. The operations 'have been systematically destroying all that remains of the escaped tyrant’s military,' wrote Yossi Yehoshua, the military correspondent for Israel's largest daily, Yediot Ahronot. 'Dozens upon dozens of targets, including arms depots of various kinds, have been hit in waves of attacks so as to prevent them from falling into hostile hands and from posing a threat to Israel.' The air force 'currently enjoys complete freedom of action,' he added. Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have condemned Israel’s incursion, accusing it of exploiting the disarray in Syria and violating international law. Turkey, which has been a main backer of the Syrian opposition to Assad, also condemned Israel’s advance. The Turkish Foreign Ministry accused Israel of'displaying a mentality of an occupier' at a time when the possibility of peace and stability had emerged in Syria. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Monday said Israel's incursion constitutes a violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement and called on both Israel and Syria to uphold it. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut and Lidman from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Frieder Reimold, journalist who wrote AP’s iconic ‘East Germany opens borders’ bulletin, dies at 80	BERLIN (AP) — Frieder Reimold, a former Berlin bureau chief of The Associated Press German-language service who wrote the iconic 1989 bulletin that East Germany had opened its borders, has died. He was 80. Reimold died Thursday in Berlin of complications related to cancer, his daughter Nancy Stephan told the AP. He began working for AP as a political correspondent in Bonn in the late 1970s after entering journalism on a German newspaper. After months of overtime writing about upheaval and protests in East Germany, Reimold, who had by then become the Berlin bureau chief of AP’s German-language service, settled in on Nov. 9, 1989, to watch a televised evening briefing by Günter Schabowski, a member of the communist country’s Politburo. History didn’t give Reimold a break that night. About an hour into the rambling news conference, Schabowski mentioned that East Germany was lifting all restrictions on travel across its border into West Germany. Pressed on when the new regulations would take effect, he looked at his notes and stammered, 'As far as I know, this enters into force ... this is immediately, without delay.' The remark was so offhanded that it took Reimold a little time to recognize the implications of the statement — that East Germany was opening the Berlin Wall and the heavily fortified border with West Germany. Carefully, Reimold then typed out what has become his iconic alert: 'DDR öffnet Grenzen' — 'East Germany opens borders.' 'This was the alert that changed the course of the night,' Reimold said during an interview with the AP in 2019, when Germany celebrated the 30-year-anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. 'The alert sped up a development that sooner or later would have been inevitable in any case.' Reimold sent out his alert at 7:05 p.m. Other wire services alerted the news as well, but none went so far that moment as to say that Schabowski’s announcement in fact meant that East Germany had opened its border. His alert is widely seen as having helped nudge the process along, and in a nod to its significance his words are today immortalized in a plaque in the sidewalk on Bornholmer Strasse, the border crossing where people first walked over from East to West. Frieder Reimold was born on April 21, 1944, in the Bavarian village of Irschenhausen. His family moved to Hannover in northern Germany a couple of years later when his father took a job at a museum there. After graduating from high school, Reimold left Germany for Canada, where he first stayed with relatives and later worked in logging before attending university in Vancouver to study languages, his sister Sabine Reimold told the AP. During his three decades with the AP, Reimold worked as political correspondent in Bonn, led the Berlin bureau and later covered the foreign ministry. He also spent several years in Vienna reporting on the upheavals created by the war in Yugoslavia. 'He was a terrific journalist and dear friend who helped me a great deal during the Cold War when I was a correspondent for the Associated Press in Bonn,' in the 1980s, Susan Cornwell, a retired former AP reporter, said in an email from Washington D.C. 'Frieder was always ready to explain the political and historical background to the events I was covering. I used to call him the ‘spazierendes Brockhaus'' — a walking German encyclopedia, Cornwell remembered. He 'knew details about key German political figures and was especially good at helping me understand the historical backdrop for events going on at that time, from the rise of the Greens party to NATO’s deployment of Pershing II missiles in West Germany,' she said. Annette Ramelsberger, another colleague, who covered the fall of the Berlin Wall and its aftermath with Reimold at the AP German service, remembered him as very smart and accurate, and at the same time as a caring and supportive manager with a fine sense of humor. 'It was great to go together with him through this wild time,' Ramelsberger, who now works for German daily newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, said. After his retirement in 2009, Reimold took on archery and enjoyed working in his garden at his home in Stahnsdorf, on the outskirts of Berlin, friends said. He was also very interested in history, culture and traveling, his sister said. Reimold 'was always a journalist, always conscientious, always put his own feelings aside,' his niece Rebekka Reimold said. 'The facts were important to him — even in the last days of his life, when he spoke soberly about the facts concerning his illness and its consequences.' ___ Randy Herschaft contributed reporting from New York.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-frieder-reimold-associated-press-dies-6e92d49a09cd9e549f1afd6ed6e19a87	2024-12-09T23:33:04-08:00	
Greyhound racing is increasingly rare worldwide. New Zealand now plans to outlaw the practice	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand plans to outlaw greyhound racing because too many dogs are hurt or killed, the government said Tuesday, spelling an end to the practice in one of the few countries where it still operates. The racing of greyhounds as a betting sport was wildly popular at times last century. But the number of dogs euthanized due to race-day injuries, or because homes cannot be found for them after their short careers end, has provoked animal welfare campaigns and growing public distaste for the sport. Commercial greyhound racing continues in the United States, Australia, the U.K. and Ireland, with only two tracks remaining in the U.S. after many states ended the practice. New Zealand’s ban is not yet law but has universal political support. The government plans to stop the racing from Aug. 1, 2026, to allow the 2,900 racing dogs to be rehomed and more than 1,000 people employed in the industry to find other work, Racing Minister Winston Peters said Tuesday. Unease over animal welfare New Zealand’s greyhound racing industry has faced repeated reviews in recent years over its dog safety record, with multiple reports urging sweeping changes. Peters said the industry had made progress -– but not enough. Stricter policies governing when dogs can be euthanized, and rehoming programs that send retired New Zealand greyhounds abroad as pets when homes cannot be found domestically, have reduced the numbers killed each year. But the percentage of dogs injured 'remains persistently high,' Peters said. 'The time has come to make a call in the best interest of the animals,' he said. Greyhound Racing New Zealand, an industry group, accused the government of not recognizing improvements made, including its commitment to tracking the care of every retired dog for the rest of its life. Tuesday’s announcement was 'a devastating blow,' said chair Sean Hannan. The animal welfare organization SPCA praised the government for showing 'compassion for dogs made to work in a dangerous gambling industry.' The practice has long been out of favor in New Zealand, spokesperson Arnja Dale said. A racing industry in global decline Some lawmakers in parliament on Tuesday described the racing industry’s end as inevitable following the steady decline of greyhound racing worldwide. Commercial racing operates in four other countries. In the U.S., its popularity peaked in the 1980s and the number of states allowing the practice has dwindled since then amid reports of dog mistreatment and the explosion of other gambling options. Only two tracks remain -– both in West Virginia -– after Iowa, Arkansas and Florida shuttered their racing industries. Greyhounds have become popular as pets in the U.S., and New Zealand has sent dozens of dogs to new owners there when homes could not be found in the country of 5 million people. Greyhound racing is also legal in Australia, where critics have decried the practice, and the rules governing it vary by state. Commercial racing currently operates throughout the U.K. and Ireland, but the Scottish parliament is considering a ban there. The practice remains legal in Mexico and Vietnam, but there are no longer operational tracks in either country, according to information supplied by Peters’ office. A swift legal change to protect dogs Hours after it announced the end to greyhound racing, New Zealand's government rushed through a law to prevent dogs from being killed while the industry winds down, unless a veterinarian deems it unavoidable. This will prevent owners from euthanizing dogs for economic reasons, Peters said. Lawmakers unanimously agreed to the change. The law shutting down the industry will take longer, however, and is not expected to pass until next year after a period of public submissions. All political parties support the ban.	https://apnews.com/article/greyhound-racing-ban-zealand-dogs-welfare-11159c996fa5e5ee6602bbbb4e6a40e4	2024-12-09T22:31:27-08:00

Middle East latest: Netanyahu prepares to testify in court in a corruption trial	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to testify in court on Tuesday, facing charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three separate cases. Netanyahu has repeatedly requested to delay his testimony because of the conflicts roiling the Middle East but was mostly denied by the courts. The long-running trial comes as Netanyahu is already facing accusations by critics in Israel of dragging out the war in Gaza and putting off a cease-fire deal that could release some 100 hostages who remain in the territory after 14 months of war triggered by the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in the Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, according to local health authorities. They say most of the dead are women and children but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250, including older adults and children. Meanwhile, U.S. prosecutors have accused two senior Syrian officials of overseeing a notorious prison that tortured peaceful protesters and other political prisoners, including a 26-year-old American woman who was later believed to have been executed. The indictment was unsealed Monday, two days after a shock rebel offensive overthrew Syrian President Bashar Assad. The U.S., U.N. and others accuse him of widespread human rights abuses in a 13-year battle to crush opposition forces seeking his removal from power. Assad fled to Russia, where he received asylum from his longtime ally. ___ Here's the Latest: Israeli military official says troops plan to seize a buffer zone inside Syria TEL AVIV, Israel — An Israeli military official says troops plan to seize a buffer zone inside Syria as well as 'a few more points that have strategic meaning.' The official spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The official dismissed reports of a larger Israeli invasion as 'rumors.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israeli forces were moving to control a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized buffer zone in Syrian territory. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. Following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad, Israel sent troops into the buffer zone. It said the move was temporary and was aimed at preventing attacks. It said the 1974 agreement establishing the zone had collapsed and that Syrian troops had withdrawn from their positions. Israel has also carried out airstrikes across Syria in recent days targeting what it says are suspected chemical weapons and long-range rockets. Egypt and Saudi Arabia have condemned Israel’s incursion, accusing it of exploiting the disarray in Syria and violating international law. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move not recognized by the international community, except for the United States. The rest of the world views the strategic plateau as occupied Syrian territory. ___ From AP journalist Joseph Krauss. Israeli air force has launched hundreds of airstrikes in Syria, war monitor says DAMASCUS, Syria — Israel’s air force has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Syria as its ground forces move north of the Golan Heights along the border with Lebanon, according to an opposition war monitor. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Tuesday that since the fall of President Bashar Assad’s government, Israel’s air force has carried out more than 300 airstrikes against research centers, arms depots and military infrastructure across Syria, as well as a naval base along the Mediterranean coast. Associated Press journalists in Damascus witnessed intense airstrikes on the city and its suburbs overnight into Tuesday morning. Photographs posted online by activists showed destroyed missile launchers, helicopters and warplanes. Meanwhile, Israeli troops marched along the border with Lebanon and now control a long stretch on the Syrian side facing Lebanon’s Rashaya region, according to the war monitor's head, Rami Abdurrahman, and the Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV, which has reporters in Syria. Israeli troops are now about 25 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Damascus, according to the monitor. Saudi Arabia condemns Israeli incursion into a buffer zone in Syria DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Saudi Arabia has condemned Israel’s incursion into a buffer zone in Syria and a wave of Israeli airstrikes launched after the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. The Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that 'the assaults carried out by the Israeli occupation government, including the seizure of the buffer zone in the Golan Heights, and the targeting of Syrian territory confirm Israel’s continued violation of the principles of international law and its determination to sabotage Syria’s chances of restoring its security, stability and territorial integrity.' Israel sent troops into a buffer zone inside Syria that had been established after the 1973 Mideast war. It said the move was temporary and was taken to prevent any cross-border attacks after Syrian troops withdrew. Israel has also carried out heavy airstrikes that it says are aimed at preventing suspected chemical weapons and long-range rockets from falling into the hands of extremists. Saudi Arabia has been in talks with the United States in recent years over normalizing relations with Israel in exchange for a U.S. defense pact, American assistance in establishing a civilian nuclear program and a pathway to the establishment of a Palestinian state. But the kingdom has also repeatedly condemned Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip, where it is at war with the Hamas militant group. Last month, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and day-to-day ruler Mohammed bin Salman accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, allegations Israel adamantly rejects.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-10-december-2024-90bc663aea10628735f8c1acd75664d4	2024-12-09T21:57:57-08:00	
Is it a military drill? China deploys ships and planes around Taiwan but remains mum	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China's secretive military appears to be up to something around Taiwan, but it's unclear exactly what. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that it had detected a dozen Chinese naval ships and 47 military planes in the past 24 hours but no live-fire activity as in previous drills. Taiwan's military has been bracing for possible exercises by China in response to a recent overseas trip by Taiwan's president that included Hawaii and Guam, an American territory. Without any Chinese announcement, Taiwan officials are calling it training, said Taiwanese Lt. Gen. Hsieh Jih-sheng, while noting that training can become drills, and drills can become war. 'It’s in the status of regular training,' he said at a news conference. 'But under the status of normalized training, it’s able to mobilize military forces on such a large scale and carry out exercises in such a large area.' China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and opposes the self-governing island having official interactions with other countries, and in particular, the United States. Lai spoke with with U.S. congressional leaders by phone while in Guam last week. While the U.S., like most of the world, doesn't formally recognize Taiwan a a country, it is the largest supplier of arms to the island of 23 million people for its defense. China, which views Lai as a separatist, held major military exercises around Taiwan following his inauguration in May and his National Day speech in October. It also held a major drill after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022. Taiwan's military set up an emergency response center on Monday in response to increased Chinese naval activity and the announcement of flight restrictions in seven zones off China's east coast. The restrictions are in place until Wednesday. 'We have noticed that there are no live-fire drill activities in the seven exercise areas as planned in the past,' said Hsieh, who heads the office of the deputy chief of general staff for intelligence.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-military-drills-training-d1da8a88fab175fc816b919b384ac964	2024-12-09T21:28:01-08:00	
Israel's Netanyahu vows to challenge 'absurd' corruption charges as he takes the stand in his trial	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised defiantly on Tuesday to knock down corruption allegations against him as he began testifying in his long-running trial, becoming the first sitting Israeli leader to take the stand as a criminal defendant. The testimony is another low point for Israel’s longest-serving leader, who also faces an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war in Gaza. In his opening testimony in a packed Tel Aviv courtroom, Netanyahu argued that he was a dedicated leader and a defender of Israel’s interests, swatting away the charges against him as a 'drop in the sea' compared to the challenges he has faced protecting his country. But the charges have torn open divisions in Israel and complicated Netanyahu's legacy, which has also been tainted by the war in Gaza and the growing international isolation Israel faces because of it. Speaking freely and appearing at ease, Netanyahu said he could balance appearing at his trial with his duties as prime minister at a time when Israel is still fighting a war in Gaza and contending with the fall of Bashar Assad in neighboring Syria. 'I waited eight years for this moment, to say the truth,' Netanyahu said, standing at a podium, with his son Avner and several members of his Likud party seated on the courtroom benches. He said his testimony would 'poke holes in the absurd accusations.' Netanyahu will answer during his court appearances to charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. He is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assistance with personal and business interests. He is also accused of promoting advantageous regulations for media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage of himself and his family. Netanyahu, 75, denies wrongdoing, saying the charges are a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media and a biased legal system out to topple his lengthy rule. His testimony caps years of scandals that have swirled around him and his family, who have gained a reputation as enjoying a lavish lifestyle at taxpayers' expense. Netanyahu's testimony is taking place in an underground, fortified courtroom for security reasons. Outside the courthouse, dozens of protesters gathered, both supporters of Netanyahu and his opponents. A banner draped outside read 'Crime Minister' as each side chanted slogans. Some families of hostages held in Gaza also demonstrated. At the start of his testimony, a judge told Netanyahu he had the same privileges as other witnesses and could sit or stand as he chose. Netanyahu told his version of events and shared personal details about his life that he might hope would shape the judges’ perception of him. He said at the start of his career in public service he would lose sleep over media coverage but learned it had no meaningful bearing — in contrast to the prosecution’s attempts to paint him as image-obsessed. He said he smoked cigars but could hardly finish them because of his workload, and hated champagne. Ahead of the testimony's start, Netanyahu’s lawyer, Amit Hadad, accused the Israeli justice system of making up the charges in an attempt to ensnare Netanyahu. 'There was a huge effort … to find a few pieces of a puzzle that don’t connect to each other,' Haddad said, as Netanyahu sat on a bench behind him. 'In court, in the light of day, we see everything falls apart.' The testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu’s working hours, prompting critics to ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran. His lawyer asked that he be allowed to receive notes while testifying to help ensure he could continue running the country, and at some points during the trial, Netanyahu did. Under Israeli law, indicted prime ministers are not required to step down. But the charges against Netanyahu cleaved deep divisions in Israel, with protesters demanding he resign and former political allies refusing to serve in government with the Israeli leader, triggering a political crisis that led to five elections in less than four years beginning in 2019. Netanyahu’s supporters view the charges as the result of bias and overreach by the justice system. Despite the pressure, Netanyahu has rejected calls to step down and has used his position as prime minister to lash out at law enforcement, media and courts. An Israeli court rejected a request by Netanyahu’s lawyers to reduce the expected number of hours of testimony, as well as several other requests to delay its start, which they said were necessary because of the prime minister’s busy schedule and the country’s significant challenges. A verdict isn’t expected until 2026 at the earliest and Netanyahu will have the option to appeal to the Supreme Court. Since the trial began in 2020, the court has heard prosecution witnesses in the three cases, including some of Netanyahu’s once closest aides who turned state witnesses. The prosecution has tried to portray the prime minister as an image-obsessed leader who broke the law to improve his public perception. Netanyahu’s testimony could further tarnish his image at a complicated time. His popular support dropped after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, with the public blaming his leadership for failing to prevent the assault, and if elections were held today he would struggle to form a government. Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza with no end in sight, despite heavy international pressure to wind down the war, as well as pressure from the families of hostages held in Gaza and their supporters to bring their loved ones home. The Israeli leader along with his former defense minister also face an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes charges related to the war in Gaza. The warrant puts Netanyahu in the same company as Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-netanyahu-corruption-trial-gaza-478c957c7749986d5b8b2d039f670d54	2024-12-09T21:08:44-08:00	
US defense secretary in Japan to support alliance as Osprey aircraft safety causes concern	TOKYO (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with officials in Japan on Tuesday to reaffirm the importance of their alliance and Washington's commitment to regional security as threats rise from China and North Korea. Austin also stressed that U.S. trilateral cooperation with Tokyo and Seoul is crucial for regional stability even as South Korea is in political turmoil following President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived declaration of martial law last week. Austin’s visit also came amid growing concerns over the safety of Osprey military aircraft, which have been grounded in the United States following a near crash at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico last month. The incident, caused by weakened metal components, was similar to a fatal crash off southwestern Japan last year. The U.S. measure prompted Japan to also ground its Ospreys. After confirming details with the U.S. military, Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force has suspended operations of its 17 Ospreys, except for possible disaster relief and other missions, beginning Tuesday to prioritize safety, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters. During their meeting, Austin and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba noted the collapse of the Syrian government and praised the strength of the Japan-U.S. alliance at a time of rapid global political change. 'The world can change drastically in a week,' Ishiba told Austin, referring to political unrest in South Korea and Syria. The U.S. defense chief, whose term ends in January when President-elect Donald Trump takes office, told Ishiba that he appreciated the steady alliance with Japan during 'very dynamic times' and that he was proud of the modernization of alliance command and control, strengthening of force posture and deterrence capabilities over the past several years. Austin later met with Japanese counterpart Gen Nakatani and noted China's 'coercive behavior' in the East and South China Seas, North Korean support for Russia's war in Ukraine as growing challenges. Austin underlined U.S. commitment 'to advancing our historic trilateral cooperation' with South Korea. Washington's commitment of 'extended deterrence,' including its nuclear umbrella, to Japan and South Korea is 'iron clad,' he added. Nakatani earlier told reporters that cooperation between Japan and the U.S., as well as with South Korea and other partners, is important as tensions escalate in the region. The trilateral partnership between Japan, the U.S. and South Korea has significantly strengthened under President Joe Biden’s administration, but faces new uncertainty amid ongoing political unrest in South Korea, which already led to the cancellation of Austin's planned trip to that country. On Monday, Austin greeted crew members of the USS George Washington, a nuclear-powered flagship aircraft carrier docked at the U.S. Navy base in Yokosuka, near Tokyo. Austin stressed the importance of U.S. cooperation with allies and partners in the region as he singled out China as the only country in the world with the intent and capability to change the rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific, according to the U.S. Defense Department. 'We want to see this region remain open to freedom of navigation and the ability to fly the skies in international airways,' Austin was quoted as saying on the Defense Department's website. 'We will work with allies and partners to ensure we can do just that,' he added. The U.S. carrier, which is under maintenance in Yokosuka, will carry the advanced F-35C stealth combat aircraft squadron currently based in the Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in the southwestern Japanese prefecture of Yamaguchi. ___ Mayuko Ono contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-us-defense-austin-alliance-korea-osprey-d5d4319cb9b5ce687f951b8c50689664	2024-12-09T20:44:57-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares mostly higher as Chinese stocks are lifted by latest stimulus	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares in Asia were mostly higher on Tuesday as Chinese shares were buoyed by an apparent shift in Beijing toward easier credit and other forms of stimulus for the sluggish economy. Shares in market superstar Nvidia fell 0.6% in afterhours trading extending a 2.6% loss after China said it’s investigating the company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws. The Shanghai Composite index surged 1.6% to 3,456.12 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 1%, at 20,618.18. At a meeting announced late Monday, top Chinese leaders agreed on a 'moderately loose' monetary policy for the world’s second-largest economy. That’s the first move in 10 years away from a more cautious, 'prudent' stance. A major planning meeting expected Wednesday could also bring more stimulus for the Chinese economy. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 0.5% to 39,335.74 while the Kospi in South Korea jumped 2.3%, recovering some of its recent losses as the country's recent political turmoil simmered on. On Tuesday, South Korean prosecutors were seeking to formally arrest the former defense minister alleged to have colluded with President Yoon Suk Yeol in imposing martial law last week, as both men are being investigated on rebellion and other charges. Taiwan's Taiex shed 0.8% as the government said China’s military appeared to be preparing for widely anticipated drills in response to a recent visit by its president, Lai Ching-te's visits to Hawaii and Guam. Taiwan’s defense ministry said Monday that it has detected Chinese naval and coast guard ships entering the Taiwan Strait and the western Pacific and that China had restricted airspace along its southeast coast through Wednesday. The moves ratchet up tensions after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he would not commit to defending Taiwan if China were to invade during his presidency. Elsewhere in the region, Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.4% to 8,389.30. Markets in Thailand were closed for a holiday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.5% to 44,401.93, and the Nasdaq composite pulled back 0.6% to 19,736.69. Nvidia’s decline was by far the heaviest weight on the S&amp;P 500. It has skyrocketed to become one of Wall Street’s most valuable companies because its chips are driving much of the world’s move into artificial-intelligence technology. That gives its stock’s movements more sway on the S&amp;P 500 than nearly every other. U.S.-listed stocks of several Chinese companies climbed, including a 12.4% jump for electric-vehicle company Nio and a 7.4% rise for Alibaba Group. Stocks in Shanghai. The week’s highlight for Wall Street will arrive midweek when the latest updates on inflation arrive. Economists expect Wednesday’s report to show consumer inflation was little changed last month. A separate report on Thursday, meanwhile, could show an acceleration in inflation at the wholesale level. They’re the last big pieces of data the Federal Reserve will get before its meeting next week on interest rates, where it is expected to cut its main interest rate for the third time this year. The Fed has been easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high since September help the slowing jobs market, after bringing inflation nearly down to its 2% target. In the oil market early Tuesday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude gave up 44 cents to $67.93 per barrel.

Biden is rushing aid to Ukraine. Both sides are digging in. And everyone is bracing for Trump	WASHINGTON (AP) — The grinding war between Ukraine and its Russian invaders has escalated ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration, with President Joe Biden rushing out billions of dollars more in military aid before U.S. support for Kyiv’s defenses is thrown into question under the new administration. Russia, Ukraine and their global allies are scrambling to put their side in the best possible position for any changes that Trump may bring to American policy in the nearly 3-year-old war. The president-elect insisted in recent days that Russia and Ukraine immediately reach a ceasefire and said Ukraine should likely prepare to receive less U.S. military aid. On the war's front lines, Ukraine's forces are mindful of Trump's fast-approaching presidency and the risk of losing their biggest backer. If that happens, 'those people who are with me, my unit, we are not going to retreat,' a Ukrainian strike-drone company commander, fighting in Russia's Kursk region with the 47th Brigade, told The Associated Press by phone. 'As long as we have ammunition, as long as we have weapons, as long as we have some means to defeat the enemy, we will fight,' said the commander, who goes by his military call sign, Hummer. He spoke on condition he not be identified by name, citing Ukrainian military rules and security concerns. 'But, when all means run out, you must understand, we will be destroyed very quickly,' he said. The Biden administration is pushing every available dollar out the door to shore up Ukraine's defenses before leaving office in six weeks, announcing more than $2 billion in additional support since Trump won the presidential election last month. The U.S. has sent a total of $62 billion in military aid since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. And more help is on the way. The administration is on track to disperse the U.S. portion of a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, backed by frozen Russian assets, before Biden leaves the White House, U.S. officials said. They said the U.S. and Ukraine are in 'advanced stages' of discussing terms of the loan and close to executing the $20 billion of the larger loan that the U.S. is backing. Biden also has eased limits on Ukraine using American longer-range missiles against military targets deeper inside Russia, following months of refusing those appeals over fears of provoking Russia into nuclear war or attacks on the West. He's also newly allowed Ukraine to employ antipersonnel mines, which are banned by many countries. Biden and his senior advisers, however, are skeptical that allowing freer use of the longer-range missiles will change the broader trajectory of the war, according to two senior administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. But the administration has at least a measure of confidence that its scramble, combined with continued strong European support, means it will leave office having given Ukraine the tools it needs to sustain its fight against Russia for some time, the officials said. Enough to hold on, but not enough to defeat Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces, according to Ukraine and some of its allies. Even now, 'the Biden administration has been very careful not to run up against the possibility of a defeated Putin or a defeated Russia' for fear of the tumult that could bring, said retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, a former supreme allied commander of NATO. He is critical of Biden’s cautious pace of military support for Ukraine. Events far from the front lines this past weekend demonstrated the war's impact on Russia’s military. In Syria, rebels seized the country’s capital and toppled Russia-allied President Bashar Assad. Russian forces in Syria had propped up Assad for years, but they moved out of the way of the rebels’ assault, unwilling to take losses to defend their ally. Biden said it was further evidence that U.S. support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was wearing down Russia’s military. Trump, who has long spoken favorably of Putin and described Zelenskyy as a 'showman' wheedling money from the U.S., used that moment to call for an immediate ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. And asked in a TV interview — taped before he met with Zelenskyy over the weekend in Paris — if Ukraine should prepare for the possibility of reduced aid, Trump said, 'Yeah. Probably. Sure.' Trump's supporters call that pre-negotiation maneuvering by an avowed deal-maker. His critics say they fear it shows he is in Putin's sway. Zelenskyy said Monday that Russian forces’ retrenchment from outposts worldwide demonstrates that 'the entire army of this great pseudo-empire is fighting against the Ukrainian people today.' 'Forcing Putin to end the war requires Ukraine to be strong on the battlefield before it can be strong diplomatically,' Zelenskyy wrote on social media, repeating near-daily appeals for more longer-range missiles from the U.S. and Europe. In Kursk, Hummer, the Ukrainian commander, said he notices Russian artillery strikes and shelling easing up since the U.S. and its European allies loosened limits on use of longer-range missiles. But Moscow has been escalating its offensives in other ways in the past six months, burning through men and materiel in infantry assaults and other attacks far faster than it can replace them, according to the Institute for the Study of War. In Kursk, that includes Russia sending waves of soldiers on motorcycles and golf carts to storm Ukrainian positions, Hummer said. The Ukrainian drone commander and his comrades defend the ground they have seized from Russia with firearms, tanks and armored vehicles provided by the U.S. and other allies. Ukraine’s supporters fear that the kind of immediate ceasefire Trump is urging would be mostly on Putin’s terms and allow the Russian leader to resume the war when his military has recovered. 'Putin is sacrificing his own soldiers at a grotesque rate to take whatever territory he can on the assumption that the U.S. will tell Ukraine that U.S. aid is over unless Russia gets to keep what it has taken,' Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at Scotland’s University of St. Andrews, wrote on his Substack channel. Putin's need for troops led him to bring in North Korean forces. Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range missiles more broadly in Russia was partly in response, intended to discourage North Korea from deeper involvement in the war, one of the senior administration officials said. Since 2022, Russia already had been pulling forces and other military assets from Syria, Central Asia and elsewhere to throw into the Ukraine fight, said George Burros, an expert on the Russia-Ukraine conflict at the Institute for the Study of War. Any combat power that Russia has left in Syria that it could deploy to Ukraine is unlikely to change battlefield momentum, Burros said. 'The Kremlin has prioritized Ukraine as much as it can,' he said. ___ Novikov reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-military-aid-russia-biden-efbcff8ed068e621055e8fa70b5905e1	2024-12-09T20:07:59-08:00	
Here's how the US is countering the Islamic State group during Syria's upheaval	WASHINGTON (AP) — Massive U.S. airstrikes on Islamic State militants in Syria were meant in part as a message to the group and a move to ensure that it doesn't try to take advantage of the chaos following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad's government. The U.S. and its partners want to make sure the Islamic State group, which still has a presence in Syria, can't step into the leadership void and once again exert control over wide swaths of the country, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Monday. The U.S. on Sunday struck about 75 IS targets in the Syrian desert. The U.S. has had troops in Syria for the last decade to battle IS. The tumult following a rebel offensive that toppled Assad has raised fears of an Islamic State resurgence. 'ISIS will try to use this period to reestablish its capabilities, to create safe havens,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday, using another acronym for the group. 'As our precision strikes over the weekend demonstrate, we are determined not to let that happen.' So far, U.S. officials are saying that they do not plan an increase in American forces in Syria but are focused on making sure those already there are safe. Here's a look at the U.S. fight against the Islamic State group: What's the U.S. military presence in Syria? The U.S. has about 900 troops and an undisclosed number of contractors in Syria, largely at small bases in the north and east, with a small number farther south at the al-Tanf garrison closer to the Iraq and Jordan borders. U.S. special operations forces also routinely move in and out of the country but are usually in small teams and are not included in the official count. Islamic State militants seized large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014, declaring a caliphate. The U.S. gathered a coalition of allies and was able to defeat IS in Iraq in 2017. The U.S. partnered with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, and after fierce fighting, ultimately declared an end to the caliphate in Syria in 2019. Remnants of the militant group remain, including as many as 10,000 fighters held in SDF-run detention facilities in Syria and tens of thousands of their family members living in refugee camps. And IS fighters have been more active over the past year or so, including in attacks against U.S. and Kurdish forces in Syria. The country has been wracked by violence and competing interests. Russia has a naval port in the north, and while there have been fewer Russian forces in the area since the onset of the war in Ukraine, the U.S. maintains a deconfliction phoneline with Moscow to avoid any troop miscalculations on the ground or in the air. Iran also has had a significant presence, often using Syria as a transit route to move weapons into Lebanon for use by Hezbollah militants against Israel. The al-Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria is located on a vital road that can link Iranian-backed forces from Tehran all the way to southern Lebanon and Israel’s doorstep. So troops at the U.S. garrison can try and disrupt those shipments. Why is the U.S. striking Islamic State targets? The U.S. has, over the past decade, routinely targeted IS leaders, camps and weapons in Syria to keep the group at bay and prevent it from coalescing. In the past year, as Israel's war with Hamas widened into a broader conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, attacks by Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria as well as by the Islamic State group have escalated. As a result, the U.S. has kept up a steady drumbeat of counterattacks against all the groups, including against IS camps in the desert, where fighters found safe haven. Officials say that while the group is vastly weaker than in 2014, it still maintains thousands of militants in Syria. On Sunday, the U.S. launched one of its larger, more expansive assaults against IS camps and operatives in the desert, taking advantage of the Assad government's downfall. The U.S. bombed at least 75 targets in about five locations using B-52 bombers, A-10 attack aircraft and F-15 fighter jets. 'Does it send a message? I mean, I think it absolutely sends a message that we use B-52s, A-10s and F-15s,' Singh told reporters. She had no other details on the result of the strikes. What's next for the U.S. in Syria? The Biden administration insists the U.S. will not get involved in Syria's war or the overthrow of the Assad government. But the U.S. and its allies have deep interests in Syria, including the efforts to defeat IS, disrupt Iran-backed groups and contain the remnants of al-Qaida and other terror groups that have found sanctuary. 'I think it is a harbinger of more instability and the potential for more political violence,' Chris Costa, former senior director for counterterrorism in the first Trump administration, said last week before the fall of Damascus. Costa spent decades in the U.S. Army and ran special operations in combat zones. 'I think there’s the potential for ISIS again to make trouble not just for the Iraqis but also be emboldened in the region.' Alex Younger, who led Britain’s foreign intelligence agency, MI6, between 2014 and 2020, said a big concern is the 'very large number of ISIS detainees left over from the destruction of the caliphate.' Younger told the BBC that IS remnants are 'currently contained by the Kurdish groups in the east, but if they go off the job, you can expect a serious spike in the threat posed to Europe by ISIS.' Who will rule Syria? Another problem is figuring out who's in charge. The opposition forces that stormed into Damascus and sent Assad fleeing to Russia are led by a group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, that originally was part of al-Qaida, but split a number of years ago. HTS is considered a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. Its leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has sought to reassure Syrians that the group is more moderate. U.S. officials say that while he may be saying some of the right things, they are adopting a wait-and-see attitude for now. White House national security spokesman, John Kirby, told CNN News Central on Monday that while HTS 'was the vanguard' they aren't the only opposition group involved. 'We’re going to be working through all the processes we can, including at the U.N., to make sure that there is adequate communication with these opposition groups and that we are all working together,' he said. Singh said she is not aware of any formal U.S. channel of communications with the group. But, she said, 'We have other ways of getting messages through, you know, groups and other allies in the region.' ___ Associated Press reporters Eric Tucker and Sagar Meghani in Washington and Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-islamic-state-united-states-airstrikes-b4e72b3fd8fff4e9364597a1ca817803	2024-12-09T20:05:26-08:00	
Thousands scour Syria's most horrific prison but find no sign of their loved ones	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — They came from all over Syria, tens of thousands. The first place they rushed to after the fall of their longtime tormentor, former President Bashar Assad, was here: Saydnaya Prison, a place so notorious for its horrors it was long known as 'the slaughterhouse.' For the past two days, all have been looking for signs of loved ones who disappeared years or even decades ago into the secretive, sprawling prison just outside Damascus. But hope gave way to despair Monday. People opened the heavy iron doors lining the hallways to find cells inside empty. With sledgehammers, shovels and drills, men pounded holes in floors and walls, looking for what they believed were secret dungeons, or chasing sounds they thought they heard from underground. They found nothing. Insurgents freed dozens of people from the Saydnaya military prison on Sunday when Damascus fell. Since then, almost no one has been found. 'Where is everyone? Where are everyone’s children? Where are they?' said Ghada Assad, breaking down in tears. She had rushed from her Damascus home to the prison on the capital’s outskirts, hoping to find her brother. He was detained in 2011, the year that protests first erupted against the former president's rule – before they turned into a long, grueling civil war. She didn’t know why he was arrested. 'My heart has been burned over my brother. For 13 years, I kept looking for him,' she said. When insurgents last week seized Aleppo — her original hometown — at the start of their swiftly victorious offensive, 'I prayed that they would reach Damascus just so they can open up this prison,' she said. Civil defense officials helping in the search were as confused as the families over why no further inmates were being found. It appeared fewer were held here in recent weeks, they said. But few were giving up, a sign of how powerfully Saydnaya looms in the minds of Syrians as the heart of Assad’s brutal police state. The sense of loss over the missing — and the sudden hope they might be found -- brought a kind of dark unity among Syrians from across the country. During Assad’s rule and particularly after the 2011 protests began, any hint of dissent could land someone in Saydnaya. Few ever emerged. In 2017, Amnesty International estimated that 10,000-20,000 people were being held there at the time 'from every sector of society.' It said they were effectively slated for 'extermination.' Thousands were killed in frequent mass executions, Amnesty reported, citing testimony from freed prisoners and prison officials. Prisoners were subjected to constant torture, intense beatings and rape. Almost daily, guards did rounds of the cells to collect bodies of inmates who had died overnight from injuries, disease or starvation. Some inmates fell into psychosis and starved themselves, the human rights group said. 'There is not a home, there is not a woman in Syria who didn’t lose a brother, a child or a husband,' said Khairiya Ismail, 54. Two of her sons were detained in the early days of the protests against Assad – one of them when he came to visit her after she herself had been detained. Ismail, accused of helping her son evade military service, spent eight months in Adra prison, northeast of Damascus. 'They detained everyone.' An estimated 150,000 people were detained or went missing in Syria since 2011 — and tens of thousands of them are believed to have gone through Saydnaya. 'People expected many more to be here ... They are clinging to the slightest sliver of hope,' said Ghayath Abu al-Dahab, a spokesman for the White Helmets, the search and rescue group that operated in rebel-held areas throughout the war. Five White Helmet teams, with two canine teams, came to Saydnaya to help the search. They even brought in the prison electrician, who had the floor plan, and went through every shaft, vent and sewage opening. So far, there were no answers, Abu al-Dahab said. He said the civil defense had documents showing more than 3,500 people were in Saydnaya until three months before the fall of Damascus. But the number may have been less by the time the prison was stormed, he said. 'There are other prisons,' he said. 'The regime had turned all of Syria into a big prison.' Detainees were held in security agencies, military facilities, government offices and even universities, he added. Around the Y-shaped main building of the prison, everyone kept trying, convinced they could find some hidden chamber with detainees, dead or alive. Dozens of men tried to force a metal gate open until they realized it led only to more cells upstairs. Others asked the insurgents guarding the prison to use their rifle to lever open a closed door. A handful of men were gathered, excavating what looked like a sewage opening in a basement. Others dug up electrical wiring, thinking it might lead to hidden underground chambers. In a scene throughout the day, hundreds cheered as men with sledgehammers and shovels battered a huge column in the building’s atrium, thinking they had found a secret cell. Hundreds ran to see. But there was nothing, and tears and loud sighs replaced the celebrations. In the wards, lines of cells were empty. Some had blankets, a few plastic pots or a few names scribbled on walls. Documents, some with names of prisoners, were left strewn in the yard, the kitchen and elsewhere. Families scoured them for their loved ones’ names. A brief protest broke out in the prison yard, when a group of men began chanting: 'Bring us the prison warden.' Calls on social media urged anyone with information of the secret cells of the prison to come forth and help. Firas al-Halabi, one of the prisoners freed when insurgents first broke into Saydnaya, was back on Monday visiting. Those searching flocked around him, whispering names of relatives to see if he met them. Al-Halabi, who had been an army conscript when he was arrested, said he spent four years in a cell with 20 others. His only food was a quarter loaf of bread and some burghul. He suffered from tuberculosis because of the cell conditions. He was tortured by electrocution, he said, and the beatings were constant. 'During our time in the yard, there was beating. When going to the bathroom, there was beating. If we sat on the floor, we got beaten. If you look at the light, you are beaten,' he said. He was once thrown into solitary for simply praying in his cell. 'Everything is considered a violation,' he said. 'Your life is one big violation to them.' He said that in his first year in the prison guards would call out hundreds of names over the course of days. One officer told him it was for executions. When he was freed Sunday, he thought he was dreaming. 'We never thought we would see this moment. We thought we would be executed, one by one.' Noha Qweidar and her cousin sat in the yard on Monday, taking a rest from searching. Their husbands were detained in 2013 and 2015. Qweidar said she had received word from other inmates that her husband was killed in a summary execution in prison. But she couldn’t know for sure. Prisoners reported dead in the past have turned up alive. 'I heard that (he was executed) but I still have hope he is alive.' Just before sundown on Monday, rescue teams brought in an excavator to dig deeper. But late at night, the White Helmets announced the end of their search, saying in a statement they had found no hidden areas in the facility. 'We share the profound disappointment of the families of the thousands who remain missing and whose fates are unknown.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-saydnaya-prison-assad-families-search-9f533d54b4df72f97416f90921dd2a9c	2024-12-09T20:05:04-08:00	
Soros' Open Society Foundations say they remain focused on human rights	NEW YORK (AP) — Despite years of internal turmoil and changes, Open Society Foundations wants those in the human rights sector to know their movements will still receive support from the organization, its president Binaifer Nowrojee said Tuesday. The foundations, founded by billionaire investor George Soros and now led by one of his sons, Alex Soros, have historically been one of the largest funders of human rights groups. But since 2021, they closed some of their programs and reduced their staff as part of a major internal reorganization. In the process, many grantees and others in the human rights movement have waited anxiously to see where the chips would fall. 'A reimagination has taken place under the leadership of the new board chair at Open Society Foundations,' Nowrojee said, referring to Alex Soros. 'One of the reasons that we wanted to really reiterate in a large way, with balloons, et cetera, that we are still committed to human rights, is because of this fear that’s permeated with the changes that somehow Open Society Foundations is no longer going to be working on rights or equity or justice,' she said in advance of Human Rights Day, which the United Nations observes on Dec. 10. Nowrojee offered few new details about OSF's specific funding priorities, though earlier this year, the foundations committed $400 million toward green jobs and economic development. Another new program focuses on protecting environmental defenders that will work in a few countries, like Colombia and the Democratic Republic of Congo and end after five years, said Sharan Srinvias, a director of programs at OSF. 'We did a survey of what other donors are supporting and in general, we saw that this is where the gap is,' he said of people who come under attack for defending land, water or other resources. 'Especially bilateral donors find it much easier to support global organizations, who in turn are able to support prominent rights defenders in capital cities who are well known.' One benefit of the limited time horizon, Srinvias said, is his team will mostly make grants of three or five years — longer than OSF's typical grants — and offer grantees more flexibility. It will also have some funds to respond to emergencies for human rights defenders all over the world. In 2020, OSF was the largest global human rights funder, giving out the most money overall and making the largest number of grants. That's according to the Human Rights Funders Network, a membership organization of grantmakers that tracks philanthropic funding for human rights groups. 'When major funders adjust their priorities, it can have a ripple effect. Their decisions can dramatically impact the human rights movements they once supported, especially in regions where they’ve been a long-time champion,' HRFN wrote in its most recent Advancing Human Rights report from September. To add to the atmosphere of uncertainty, another major human rights funder, Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, announced earlier this year that it would end its work by 2028. OSF's board aims to employ 600 people in total around the world, Nowrojee said, which is down from a reported 800 in 2021. Some of the changes OSF made in the last three years include winding down its global public health program and significantly diminishing its programs in the European Union. It spun off its area of work focused on Roma communities into a new organization and issued final grants to many of its partners. 'You never want philanthropy to just be doing the same thing. You want philanthropy to be getting out of stuff,' Nowrojee said. 'And so there’s large areas of work where huge achievements were made, which we have retreated from, not because we don’t think that there’s value in them, but the movements themselves have strengthened.' People who worked for OSF's public health program and some of their grantees have spoken about its impacts over almost three decades through an oral history project led by University of Southern California Institute on Inequalities in Global Health and funded by OSF. Jonathan Cohen, who led the OSF public health program and now holds positions at USC, told an interviewer with the oral history project about a decision in 2020 by OSF's leadership to take funding from its programs and reallocate it to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 'That claw-back in April should have been a sign, I think, to all of us that we were not long for this world,' Cohen said, of the public health program. 'But of course, you don’t accept that. You fight. You resist. You try to keep your program, which is what we did until we couldn’t.' Among the movements that OSF had supported under its public health program was the the Network of Sex Work Projects, a global coalition of sex worker groups. It formed in 1992 in part in response to the killing of sex workers who had HIV, said Ruth Morgan Thomas, who was NSWP's global coordinator for many years, as part of the oral history project. She said she was saddened to see the closure of OSF's public health work. 'I hope as it reemerges and its global strategy reemerges, it will retain its stance and support for promoting the realization of sex workers’ rights and inclusion in our societies,' she said. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

China's exports slow, imports decline, in November falling below forecasts	HONG KONG (AP) — China’s exports slowed in November and its imports declined, falling below forecasts and underscoring potential weakness in trade at a time when its leaders are striving to boost the economy after the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Customs data Tuesday showed exports grew 6.7% from a year earlier, down from a 12.7% increase in October. Analysts had estimated that exports had risen more than 8%. Imports fell 3.9% from a year earlier, reflecting weak demand from industries and consumers. With exports outpacing imports, China’s trade surplus rose to $97.4 billion. The report came a day after Beijing pledged to loosen monetary policy and provide more support for the world’s No. 2 economy. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs of 60% or more on imports of Chinese goods, complicating Beijing's efforts by threatening an area of the economy that has performed relatively well while the property sector remains in the doldrums and consumer spending remains fragile. Some analysts say that the latest setbacks are likely to be temporary. 'We expect exports to accelerate again in the coming months, supported by gains in export competitiveness and exporters front-running tariffs,' Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a note. 'Import volumes declined last month, but they are likely to recover in the short run as accelerated fiscal spending boosts demand for industrial commodities,' she said. The effects of tariffs will likely only be felt in the middle of 2025, Huang wrote. In another sign of slack demand, consumer inflation in November was a lower-than-expected 0.2%, according to data released Monday, down from 0.3% the month before mainly due to lower food prices. But late last month, an official survey by the National Bureau of Statistics showed China's factory activity expanding for a second consecutive month in November, rising to 50.3, the highest figure reported in seven months. A reading above 50 suggests growth while below 50 represents a contraction. The revival in factory orders may also reflect efforts to beat higher tariffs, analysts said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-trade-exports-economy-47d2788059c9dabbb2905120d16f6ea9	2024-12-09T19:42:05-08:00	
South Korean prosecutors seek to arrest ex-defense minister over martial law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean prosecutors are seeking to formally arrest the former defense minister alleged to have colluded with President Yoon Suk Yeol in imposing martial law last week, as authorities are investigating whether their acts amount to rebellion. Martial law lasted only about six hours but was the first of its kind in more than 40 years and has caused a domestic firestorm and large street protests. Yoon and his associates face criminal investigations and impeachment attempts. The Justice Ministry has banned Yoon and eight others from leaving the country as authorities see them as key suspects in the martial law case. It’s the first time that a sitting president in South Korea has received such a travel ban. The Seoul Central District Court said Tuesday it’ll review prosecutors' request for a warrant to arrest former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber to unanimously reject Yoon’s decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Dec. 4. Kim released a statement through his law firm, saying that he 'deeply apologizes for causing significant anxiety and inconvenience.' He said that all responsibility over the martial law enforcement rests solely with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers deployed to enforce martial law, saying they were only following orders. If the arrest warrant is issued, Kim would be the first person arrested over the martial law case. Prosecutors would have up to 20 days to investigate Kim and determine whether to indict him. A conviction on the charge of rebellion would carry up to the death penalty. Prosecutors reportedly accuse Kim of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power by staging a riot to disrupt the constitution in collaboration with Yoon and other military and police officers. Prosecutors' offices in Seoul couldn't immediately confirm the reports. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun, to obstruct lawmakers from entering the National Assembly’s main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim’s instructions was to prevent the assembly from gathering the required 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon’s martial law order. Kwak is among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended him last week. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' but South Korea wasn’t in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean constitution doesn’t allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed the need to rebuild the country by eliminating 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces' in a reference to his liberal rival rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has been on a near-constant collision course with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which has introduced motions seeking to impeach some of his top officials and launched a fierce political offensive against Yoon over a spate of scandals involving him and his wife. The focus of attention is how authorities could investigate Yoon and whether they can detain him. South Korean law gives a president immunity from prosecution while in office, except for allegations of rebellion or treason. This means that Yoon can be questioned and detained by investigative agencies over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. They also say the security service won’t likely permit searches of Yoon’s office, citing a law that prohibits searches on sites with state secrets without approval from those in charge of those areas. In the case of former President Park Geun-hye, who was thrown out of office in 2017 after being impeached by parliament over a corruption scandal, prosecutors failed to search her office and ended up receiving documents outside the compound because presidential officials turned them away. After refusing to meet with prosecutors while in office, Park underwent questioning by them and was arrested after the Constitutional Court approved her impeachment and ruled to dismiss her as president in March 2017. Yoon avoided impeachment Saturday, after most ruling party lawmakers boycotted a floor vote. The Democratic Party said it would prepare for a new vote to impeach Yoon on Saturday. The party on Tuesday submitted motions to impeach Yoon’s police chief and justice minister as well. It pushed to impeach Kim Yong Hyun and the safety minister, but they resigned before parliament votes took place. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If it voted for removal, a new presidential election would be required.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-defense-minister-c07fea5a701d5d708bfc236b3b81ee6f	2024-12-09T19:40:33-08:00	
Argentina’s Milei marks one year in office. Here's how his shock measures are reshaping the economy	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — When libertarian President Javier Milei assumed office one year ago, Argentine supermarkets were marking price increases on an almost daily basis. Middle-class families tried to spend their rapidly depreciating pesos as quickly as they got them, and economists warned the country was teetering on the brink of hyperinflation. It was popular outrage over this upside-down economy that fueled the rise of Milei, a self-declared 'anarcho-capitalist' and former TV pundit who rode to power on vows to 'blow up' the central bank, take an axe to the bloated government and kill sky-high inflation. It was an almost impossible job, and Milei's lack of government experience, unkempt hairdo, sexual boasts and missionary-like zeal for his dead dog, the Rolling Stones and the free market didn't inspire much confidence in a country with a history of failed economic reforms. 'It wasn’t a given that he could govern Argentina when he took office,' said Marcelo J. García, Americas director at geopolitical risk firm Horizon Engage. 'He was Mr. Nobody.' On taking power, Milei implemented a series of austerity measures, including slashing energy and transportation subsidies, laying off tens of thousands of government workers, freezing public infrastructure projects and imposing wage and pension freezes below inflation. It has been brutal. Unemployment has climbed, economic activity has declined and poverty has surged. But now signs have emerged that Argentina’s bizarre and long mismanaged economy is starting to look a little more normal. Monthly inflation has plummeted, bonds have rallied and the closely watched gap between the black market dollar and the official rate has shrunk as much as 44%. Argentina's country-risk index, an influential measure of the risk of default, is at its lowest point in five years. 'He reaches the anniversary at the best moment of his administration,' García said. Inflation: a priority Inflation, Argentina's perpetual scourge and Milei's top priority upon coming to office, slowed from a monthly rate of 25.5% in December 2023 to just 2.7% in October — its lowest level in three years. 'Inflation has gone down faster than what everyone has expected,' said Ignacio Labaqui, a Buenos Aires-based senior analyst at risk consultancy Medley Global Advisors. 'That’s something that validates his narrative and sustains his popularity.' In a sign of Milei's long way to go — and the unmitigated shambles he inherited — Argentina's annual inflation rate remains at 193%. But Argentines are paying closer attention to month-to-month inflation, taking the sharp decline as a sign that Milei’s fiscal shock therapy is paying off. 'Last year it was a shock to the system, I couldn’t keep up with the prices,' said 34-year-old deli worker Jazmin Quintana. 'I’m not saying I like the guy, I find his personality very weird and aggressive, but I admit — if he continues on this route I’ll be very happy.' A stronger peso A stronger peso is also boosting confidence. The black market dollar price has dropped since July, narrowing its gap with the official rate of 980. Chileans, once accustomed to bargain-hunting in Argentina, are now surprised to see the traffic reversed. Shoppers unable to afford iPhones and kitchen appliances in Argentina arrive at Chilean border towns by the busload to get the most bang from their buck. The customs office shut down briefly last month because officials were overwhelmed. Underpinning the currency appreciation is a new tax amnesty to lure Argentines to declare their hidden U.S. dollar savings — longs squirreled away in offshore bank accounts and under mattresses. Ahead of the first-phase deadline on Oct. 31, the scheme drew some $19 billion into Argentina’s banks, the tax agency reported, boosting scarce foreign exchange reserves. But a strong peso also carries risks — squeezing domestic industry by making exports more costly, deterring investors and raising fears of a crash. Foreign visitors are warned of higher prices as peak tourism season begins. 'The prices are INSANE,' reads a popular Reddit post about travel in Argentina, filled with cautionary tales of $50 dinners and $100 T-shirts. Painful consequences Argentina's first budget surplus in 12 years has come at a steep cost. Milei halted inflation increases for university budgets, leaving some universities struggling to keep their lights on and elevators running. He downgraded the culture ministry, closed the national theater institute, shuttered a state-funded news agency and defunded scientific research. He suspended public works projects, leaving cities littered with white-elephant structures. An estimated 200,000 construction workers lost their jobs in the last year, says the Argentine Chamber of Construction. The brutal austerity has deepened Argentina's recession, with consumer spending falling 20% percent in the past year and poverty rates soaring to a two-decade high of 52.9% in the second half of last year. Argentina’s retirees are perhaps the most potent symbol of the strife inflicted by Milei’s fiscal shock. Some of the government’s biggest savings came from holding down the real value of pensions. The average minimum monthly pension is just $300. 'We have always been in bad shape, but now things are even harsher,' said Rubén Cocurullo, 76, among dozens of pensioners protesting at the social welfare office in Buenos Aires last week. 'Do they want to kill us?' An uncertain future In a country with a long history of raucous street protests, it's striking that the mass unrest pundits predicted last year has not materialized. That his approval ratings have held up at some 50% is also a sign of how desperately Argentines wanted change after years of crisis. 'Strangely enough, there comes a time in all societies, when the cost of a fiscal adjustment becomes less than the cost of continuing with inflation,' said Sebastián Mazzuca, an Argentine political scientist at Johns Hopkins University. 'It’s like a fire. There are badly injured people, but the fire was put out, wasn’t it?' It helps Milei that Argentina's left-leaning Peronist opposition is in disarray, with former President Alberto Fernández charged with beating his ex-wife while in office. Many also attribute the social peace to Milei’s expectation management. He warned that things would get worse before they got better. But now, as an ebullient Milei declares his government the most successful in history and assures Argentines they’ll soon collect on the economic revival he pledged would follow the pain, the bar is getting higher even as risks remain. To fulfill his promise of transforming the heavily regulated nation into one of the world’s freest economies, Milei needs to lift strict currency controls. That requires a fresh infusion of cash or a new deal with the International Monetary Fund, which would relieve pressure on the billions of dollars in debt repayments due next year. Foreign investors, as well as the IMF, to which Argentina owes an unprecedented $44 billion, have expressed excitement about Milei’s changes. But, still haunted by Argentina’s 2001 crisis — which culminated in the largest foreign-debt default in modern history — they’re cautious. 'Argentina still seems to be mired in a major ‘wait and see’ period,' said consulting firm Zuban Córdoba and Associates in a report on Milei’s first year. The radical populist hopes to profit from his budding bromances with President-elect Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk. As president of the biggest shareholder of the IMF in 2018, Trump was key to Argentina securing a record $56 billion loan package. The three men dined and danced together at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida last month. Milei claims his brutal cost-cutting inspired Trump and Musk to plan their so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Last week the Conservative Political Action Conference brought its traveling program to Buenos Aires, where Milei and right-wing political figures railed against socialism, praised Trump and pledged to battle what they saw as the global scourge of liberal 'woke-ism.' 'Everyone assumed that we were going to fail politically,' Milei told the cheering crowd. 'Today they admit, through gritted teeth, that they are surprised.' ___ Associated Press reporter Debora Rey contributed to this report. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-trump-musk-default-economy-inflation-libertarian-18efe55d81df459792a038ea9e321800	2024-12-09T19:20:26-08:00	
Mass evacuation of Philippine villages underway after a brief but major volcanic eruption	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — About 87,000 people were being evacuated in a central Philippine region Tuesday a day after a volcano briefly erupted with a towering ash plume and superhot streams of gas and debris hurtling down its western slopes. The latest eruption of Mount Kanlaon on central Negros island did not cause any immediate casualties, but the alert level was raised one level, indicating further and more explosive eruptions may occur. Volcanic ash fell on a wide area, including Antique province, more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) across seawaters west of the volcano, obscuring visibility and posing health risks, Philippine chief volcanologist Teresito Bacolcol and other officials said by telephone. At least six domestic flights and a flight bound for Singapore were canceled and two local flights were diverted in the region Monday and Tuesday due to Kanlaon’s eruption, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines. The mass evacuations were being carried out urgently in towns and villages nearest the western and southern slopes of Kanlaon which were blanketed by its ash, including in La Castellana town in Negros Occidental where nearly 47,000 people have to be evacuated out of a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) danger zone, the Office of Civil Defense said. More than 6,000 have moved to evacuation centers aside from those who have temporarily transferred to the homes of relatives in La Castellana by Tuesday morning, the town’s mayor, Rhumyla Mangilimutan, told The Associated Press by telephone. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said authorities were ready to provide support to large numbers of displaced villagers and that his social welfare secretary flew early Tuesday to the affected region. 'We are ready to support the families who have been evacuated outside the 6-kilometer danger zone,' Marcos told reporters. Government scientists were monitoring the air quality due to the risk of contamination from toxic volcanic gases that may require more people to be evacuated from areas affected by Monday’s eruption. Disaster-response contingents were rapidly establishing evacuation centers and seeking supplies of face masks, food and hygiene packs ahead of the Christmas season, traditionally a peak time for holiday travel and family celebrations in the largely Roman Catholic nation. Authorities also shut schools and imposed a nighttime curfew in the most vulnerable areas. The Philippines’ Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the nearly four-minute eruption of Kanlaon volcano on Monday afternoon had caused a pyroclastic density current — a superhot stream of gas, ash, debris and rocks that can incinerate anything in its path. 'It's a one-time but major eruption,' Bacolcol told the AP, adding that volcanologists were assessing if Monday's eruption spewed old volcanic debris and rocks clogged in and near the summit crater or was caused by rising magma from underneath. Few volcanic earthquakes were detected ahead of Monday's explosion, Bacolcol said. The alert level around Kanlaon was placed on Monday to the third-highest of a five-step warning system, indicating 'magmatic eruption' may have begun and may progress to further explosive eruptions. The 2,435-meter (7,988-foot) volcano, one of the country’s 24 most-active volcanoes, last erupted in June sending hundreds of villagers to emergency shelters. In 1996, three hikers were killed near the peak and several others were later rescued when Kanlaon erupted without warning, officials said. Located in the so-called Pacific 'Ring of Fire,' a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the Philippines is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms a year and is among the countries most prone to natural disasters.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-kanlaon-volcano-eruption-ceb5c089dd807d39d96b94536911abd8	2024-12-09T18:10:29-08:00	
Trudeau says Americans are realizing that Trump's tariffs on Canada make life a lot more expensive	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday said Americans 'are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive' and said he will retaliate if Donald Trump goes ahead with them. Speaking at an event put on by the Halifax Chamber of Commerce, Trudeau also said dealing with Trump will be 'a little more challenging' than the last time because Trump’s team is coming in with a much clearer set of ideas of what they want to do right away than after his first election win in 2016. The U.S. president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. 'Trump got elected on a commitment to make life better and more affordable for Americans, and I think people south of the border are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive,' Trudeau said. On the weekend, Trump appeared in an interview with NBC’s 'Meet the Press,' where the president-elect said he can’t guarantee that his promised tariffs on key U.S. foreign trade partners won’t raise prices for American consumers. 'Let’s not kid ourselves in any way, shape or form, 25% tariffs on everything going to the United States would be devastating for the Canadian economy,' Trudeau said. 'It would also, however, mean real hardship for Americans as well. Americans import 65% of their crude oil from Canada, significant amounts of electricity. Just about all the natural gas exported from Canada goes to the United States. They rely on us for steel and aluminum. They rely on us for a range of agriculture imports. All of those things would get more expensive.' If Trump makes good on his threat to slap 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, the price increases that could follow will collide with his campaign promise to give American families a break from inflation. Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods. The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate. 'We will of course, as we did eight years ago, respond to unfair tariffs,' Trudeau said. Trudeau said his government is still mulling over 'the right ways' to respond, referencing when Canada put billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports just $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most of it comes from one plant in Wisconsin, the home state of then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty. 'It was the fact that we put tariffs on bourbon and Harley-Davidsons and playing cards and Heinz ketchup and cherries and a number of other things that were very carefully targeted because they were politically impactful to the president’s party and colleagues,' Trudeau said. Trudeau said when Trump says things he means them but they also know Trump is trying to insert uncertainty and 'a bit of chaos' into democracies. 'One of the most important things for us to do is not freak out, not to panic,' Trudeau said. 'Knowing these would be absolutely devastating means we have to take them seriously but it does mean we have to be thoughtful and strategic and not going around making our opponents arguments for him but making our arguments in a significant and united way.' Canadian officials have said it is unfair to lump Canada in with Mexico. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with irregular migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time. Trump has also claimed the U.S. is 'subsidizing Canada to the tune of over $100 billion a year.' On America’s trade deficit Canada’s ambassador to Washington, Kirsten Hillman, told the AP U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and prices have been high. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing for national security. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trudeau-us-trump-tariffs-f23417b8f6671adf6b4c908be630615f	2024-12-09T15:49:17-08:00	
US hostage envoy in Beirut to seek information on missing journalist Austin Tice	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government's top hostage negotiator is in Beirut in hopes of collecting information on the whereabouts of Austin Tice, an American journalist missing in Syria for 12 years, the State Department said Monday. Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, is talking to officials in the region following the overthrow of Bashar Assad’s government to find out where Tice is and 'get him home as soon as possible,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters Monday. Lebanon has been involved for years in mediating talks about Tice. President Joe Biden said Sunday that his administration believed Tice was alive and was committed to bringing him home, though he also acknowledged that 'we have no direct evidence' of his status. Tice, who has had his work published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and others, disappeared at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus as the Syrian civil war intensified. A video released weeks after Tice went missing showed him blindfolded and held by armed men and saying, 'Oh, Jesus.' He has not been heard from since. Syria has publicly denied that it was holding him.	https://apnews.com/article/tice-journalist-syria-carstens-e20547144d1ad0580e7d64462b8c4135	2024-12-09T11:22:52-08:00	
Virginia man charged in FBI sting with supporting Islamic State goes on trial	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A Virginia man accused of funneling tens of thousands of dollars to the Islamic State group was a lonely man looking for a wife and relentlessly targeted by FBI sting operations, a defense lawyer told jurors Monday, including one undercover operative who pretended to be a willing bride. A jury in U.S. District Court in Alexandria heard opening statements in the terrorism trial of Mohammed Chhipa, 35, of Springfield, Virginia. Prosecutors say he met several times with an undercover FBI operative who gave him hundreds of dollars on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, earmarked for a Syrian woman and Islamic State member known as Umm Dujanah. In his opening statement, prosecutor Andrew Dixon said Chhipa took the money on each occasion, converted it to Bitcoin and sent it to accounts in Turkey, destined for the Islamic State. Dixon said Chhipa sent more than $74,000 in similar fashion to accounts in Turkey, collecting money from willing donors and funneling it to the Islamic State through Umm Dujanah. Chhipa was particularly interested in sending funds to help women from the Islamic State escape prison camps to which they had been sent after the terrorist group was routed from territory it held in Iraq and Syria, Dixon said. Dixon said Chhipa was well aware that what he was doing was illegal, fleeing the country at one point, only to be forced back to the United States. At one point, he said while under surveillance, 'I'm not sure why I'm not in prison.' Chhipa's defense attorney, Zachary Deubler, said the FBI had closely scrutinized Chhipa for years, based largely on advocacy of extremist views on social media. But he said the FBI never came up with a reason to arrest him, even after searching his home in 2019 and finding a cache of Islamic State propaganda. Deubler acknowledged that Chhipa left the country, through Latin America with an ultimate goal of getting to Egypt. The FBI met Chhipa when he returned to the U.S. at Dulles International Airport and questioned him about his activities but never arrested him. Deubler said the government's entrapment efforts intensified, to include a fake bride at one point and a supposed Muslim marriage broker at another. 'He was a lonely, sad, inflated man who the government tried to set up,' Deubler said. The trial began with several quirks. Chhipa appeared at trial in a green jumpsuit from the Alexandria jail, where he is being held. He said he did not want to wear civilian clothes, which are typically provided to defendants out of concern that jail outfits will prejudice the jury against a defendant. After a morning break, Chhipa's family refused to stand when the clerk said 'all rise' as the judge left the bench, and U.S. District Judge David Novak angrily told the family either to stand or be taken into custody. No arrests were made, even though several family members refused repeated directives from court security officers to stand. Last year, after Chhipa's arrest, prosecutors said Chhipa considers himself to be married to Allison Fluke-Ekren, an American from Kansas who is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Fluke-Ekren pleaded guilty last year to organizing and leading the Khatiba Nusaybah, a battalion in the Islamic State in which roughly 100 women and girls learned how to use automatic weapons and detonate grenades and suicide belts. Prosecutors, though, say that the marriage was apparently conducted online and has no legal status in the U.S. They said Chhipa, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from India, has been trying to adopt Fluke-Ekren’s children. The trial is expected to last about a week.	https://apnews.com/article/islamic-state-financing-chhipa-virginia-fbi-77235ab9804887d4ed6692612abd2c7b	2024-12-09T11:22:24-08:00	
A long road ahead to decide Syria’s future after rapid end to Assad’s rule	BEIRUT (AP) — For the first time in 50 years, the question of how Syria will be governed is wide open. The end of the Assad family's rule is for many Syrians a moment of mixed joy and fear, of the total unknown. The insurgency that swept President Bashar Assad out of power is rooted in Islamist jihadi fighters. Its leader says he has renounced past ties to al-Qaida, and he has gone out of his way to assert a vision of creating a pluralistic Syria governed by civil institutions — not dictators and not ideology. But even if he is sincere, he is not the only player. The insurgency is made up of multiple factions, and the country is riven among armed groups, including U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters controlling the east. Remnants of the old regime’s military — and its feared security and intelligence services — could coalesce once again. Foreign powers with their own interests have their hands deep in the country, and any of them — Russia, Iran, Turkey, the United States and Israel — could act as spoilers. Syria’s multifaith and multiethnic population sees itself poised on a moment that could tip either into chaos or cohesion. The country’s Sunni Muslims, Shiite Alawites, Christians and ethnic Kurds have often been pitted against each, whether by Assad’s rule or a 14-year civil war. Divisions from the conflict run deep, and many worry about revenge killings, whether against former figures of Assad’s state or — more frightening — whole communities seen as backing the old system. The civil war displaced half of Syria's prewar population of 23 million. Many who fled are watching developments closely to determine whether the time has come to return. Right now there are only questions. How will Syria be governed? In the short period following Assad’s abrupt fall, rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has sought to reassure Syrians that the group he leads — Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS – does not seek to dominate the country and will continue government services. He has spoken of setting up a decentralized governance system. Government officials who remained in Damascus as Assad fled — including Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali — have met with the rebels to discuss the transfer of power. The Al Jazeera television network reported Monday that HTS had decided to appoint the head of the 'salvation government' running its stronghold in northwest Syria, Mohammed Al-Bashir, to form a transitional government. There was no official confirmation. Details on what form the government will take have been scarce. The rebels likely did not expect to be saddled with running an entire country when they launched their offensive against Aleppo less than two weeks ago, said Qutaiba Idlbi, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs. The rapid fall of Damascus and the melting away of police and military, left security challenges, he said. The only existing framework for a transition is no longer relevant. U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 had called for a political process involving both Assad’s government and opposition groups. 'Everyone’s saying, especially rebels on the ground, ‘That framework is no longer applicable, because there is no longer a regime. We’re not going to give the regime in politics what they lost through military means,’' Idlbi said. So far, public sector workers have not heeded calls from the caretaker prime minister to go back to their jobs -- causing troubles in places like airports, borders and at the Foreign Ministry, said Adam Abdelmoula, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Syria. 'I think it will take a couple of days — and a lot of assurance on the part of the armed groups — for these people to return to work again,' he said. In the current chaos, U.N. workers have had difficulty accessing the country, and that has hampered distribution of humanitarian aid, he said. How inclusive will the insurgents be? The insurgents have sought to reassure Syria’s religious minorities that they will not be targeted, despite HTS' fundamentalist Sunni Muslim origins. So far the civil peace seems to be holding. The insurgents have appeared disciplined, working to keep order, with no sign of reprisals. Experts say only time will tell what post-Assad Syria will look like. 'Everyone’s still willing to really engage, really work with others,' said Haid Haid, a consulting fellow at the Middle East and North Africa program of Chatham House. 'That sort of positive atmosphere is crucial, but it might not last long.' Splits could open as decisions are made. It can’t be guaranteed all the fighters within the HTS will back al-Sharaa’s talk of a pluralist system. Outside Damascus’ historic Hamadiyeh market on Sunday, around a dozen fighters chanted, 'Down, down with a secular state' — a sign that at least some among the insurgents may seek a harder Islamist line. 'The opposition is not a homogenous movement,' said Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow for Middle East Security at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London. There are multiple armed opposition groups, including forces in the south who are distinct from HTS and the Turkish-backed groups in the north. Internal fractures within the HTS-led movement, 'which may become more salient in the weeks and months to come, may lead to discord and threaten Syrian stability,' Ozcelik said. There may be pressure to purge former members of Assad’s large state bureaucracy, especially those employed as part of a vast security state that included informers and officers widely hated for torture, abuses and corruption. Insurgents and many in the public don’t want them to return. But a purge can spark a destabilizing backlash — as when U.S. administrators disbanded Iraq’s army after Saddam Hussein’s fall in 2003, fueling a Sunni insurgency. Syria’s Alawite population is feeling particularly vulnerable. Assad and his family were Alawites — a branch of Shia Islam — and many among the Sunni insurgents see the community as his loyalists. The question of the Kurds looms large Kurdish-led forces allied with the United States have run a semi-autonomous zone in Syria’s northeast for years, where they have been a key player in the fight against the Islamic State militant group. While both were opponents of the government during the civil war, the relationship between the Kurds and the Arab opposition groups is tense. HTS has been extending an olive branch to the Kurds. Reintegrating the east would likely mean some form of concession to Kurdish autonomy. But that risks angering neighboring Turkey, which vehemently opposes the Kurdish factions that run Syria’s east. Already, Turkish-backed insurgents allied with HTS have taken the opportunity to push the Kurds out of some pockets of territory, seizing the northern town of Manbij, and clashes have broken out in other areas. While the insurgents' largely benign approach to minorities so far has allayed many international worries, Abdelmoula said, 'those pockets of fighting are very significant because the fighting is mostly along ethnic lines. And that’s dangerous.' ——— Associated Press writers Danica Kirka in London and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.

Mexican soldiers will get a pay raise after elimination of oversight agencies, president says	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president said Monday that much of the money gained by eliminating independent oversight and regulatory agencies will go to the army to fund a rise in soldiers’ pay. The announcement by President Claudia Sheinbaum is the latest in a a series of new and unusual funding sources to pay for the country’s increasingly influential military. Last week, Mexico’s Congress approved charging every cruise ship passenger a $42 immigration fee, with much of that money also going to the armed forces. Under Sheinbaum's Morena party, since 2019 the military has been given powers to build and run everything from railways, airports and airlines in Mexico, and some of those projects appear to be losing money. For over a century before, Mexico's armed forces were very limited in their actions, restricted from taking any role in politics and didn't have many business interests. But that all changed under Sheinbaum's predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who saw the army as a loyal, unquestioning ally and a safeguard for his political and policy legacy. López Obrador, Sheinbaum's political mentor, also made the armed forces, and the quasi-military National Guard, the country's main law enforcement forces. In late November, Mexico’s Senate voted to eliminate seven independent regulatory and oversight agencies, a move that critics warn will cement the ruling party’s power and avoid outside scrutiny. Sheinbaum called it a money-saving measure, arguing that the government can more efficiently handle functions like freedom of information requests, anti-monopoly enforcement and energy-market regulation. However, critics and foreign investors and critics fear this could open the door to favoritism and a lack of transparency. And earlier this month, Mexico’s Senate — controlled by the president's Morena party — voted to charge cruise ship passengers $42 per head for port calls, drawing sharp criticism from the tourism industry. Mexican business chambers say the immigration charge — from which cruise passengers used to be exempt — may hurt the country’s $500 million per year cruise industry. Two-thirds of the money raised from the cruise ship charges would go to the Mexican army, not to improve port facilities. Moreover, many of the military-run projects appear to be big money losers, which may help explain the government's urge to find extra funding for the armed forces. For example, one of López Obrador's pet projects — the 'Maya Train,' a tourist line which runs in a loop around the Yucatan Peninsula — has drawn only 20% of the ridership expected when it was proposed. The Maya Train started service on Dec. 16, 2023. While it's not completely finished — two relatively little-used stretches are scheduled to enter service later this months — the most popular and heavily-travelled parts of the line are already in service. As of Dec. 8, authorities announced the train line had carried a little more than 600,000 passengers in its first 51 weeks. That is only one-fifth of the 3 million passengers authorities had claimed it would carry per year. On Monday, the government announced a 'package tour' deal in which another military-run, money losing project — the government-owned Mexicana airline — would offer flights to stations along the Maya Train line. The flight would take off, of course, from another military-run project, the new Mexico City Felipe Angeles airport, which is just starting to break even because the government forced cargo planes, and some passenger flights, to use it. Mexico’s ruling Morena party is already running enormous budget deficits to fund its favorite building projects like railways and oil refineries — some of which are being built by the army. The government is desperate to find new revenue sources.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-army-funding-projects-e6ad34e863414c47f5180be63cefccdc	2024-12-09T09:34:13-08:00	
Ghana's ex-leader is declared the winner of the presidential election	ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — Ghana’s former leader John Dramani Mahama was officially declared the winner of the presidential election on Monday evening, after voters vented anger at the government’s handling of the economy. Previously president between 2012 and 2017, Mahama, 65, received 6.3 million votes, or 56.5% of votes cast, the electoral commission said. Mahama’s main opponent, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, conceded defeat on Sunday. Bawumia got 4.6 million votes, or 41%. The turnout based on the votes from 267 constituencies stands at 60.9 percent, said Jean Mensa, the electoral commissioner. Although vote counting was ongoing in nine constituencies, that will not change the final result, Mensa added. Mahama has described his victory as 'emphatic.' He had promised to 'reset' the country on various fronts, during a campaign that prioritized the economy and largely appealed to young Ghanaians who saw the vote as a way out of the country’s economic crisis. After Bawumia conceded defeat, celebrations broke out on Sunday among the supporters of the opposition candidate in parts of the country, including the capital city. Wearing the opposition party’s white, green, red and black colors, women and young people danced to music and trumpet blasts on the streets and at the party’s national headquarters The election for both the president and members of parliament was held against the backdrop of the country’s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. It was seen as a litmus test for democracy in a region shaken by extremist violence and coups. West Africa’s regional bloc of ECOWAS said the election was generally peaceful, a continuing trend in Ghana. Bawumia was running as the flagbearer of the ruling New Patriotic Party, or NPP, which has struggled to resolve the economic crisis under outgoing President Nana Akufo-Addo. Mahama’s National Democratic Congress also won the majority in parliament, he said. Mahama’s win is viewed as following the latest trend of elections around the world, favoring opposition parties against incumbents, from the United States to European countries — such as Britain and France — as well as South Africa. The former president is 'the only person' who can fix the ailing economy in Ghana, one of West Africa’s economic powerhouses, said Jude Agbemava, a policy analyst who voted for him. Like in most other elections in countries where the incumbent lost, the vote in Ghana was about the people making their disaffection known against a government that has lost goodwill, said Seidu Alidu, head of the department of political science at Ghana’s University of Legon. 'I think it has to do with the economy, which is largely a bread and butter issue for every Ghanaian,' said Alidu. 'When the people elect you, they require you to do certain things for them. But it was also about the style of governance (because) even in other countries facing economic challenges, governments were being honest with the people, telling them what the reality is, and the steps they have taken to manage it,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/ghana-election-president-mahama-409cfac5c60e0ab8056b04c867e068bc	2024-12-09T09:15:53-08:00

As Israel advances on a Syrian buffer zone, it sees peril and opportunity	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The dramatic downfall of Syrian President Bashar Assad presents possible danger, and an opening, for neighboring Israel. After fighting wars on multiple fronts for months, Israel is now concerned that unrest in Syria could spill over into its territory. Israel also views the end of the Assad regime as a chance to disrupt Iran's ability to smuggle weapons through Syria to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The Israeli military over the weekend began seizing control of a demilitarized buffer zone in Syria created as part of a 1974 ceasefire between the countries. It said the move was temporary and meant to secure its border. But the incursion sparked condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria for a land grab. Israel still controls the Golan Heights that it captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed — a move not recognized by most of the international community. Here’s a look at recent developments along the Syrian frontier. Where are the Israeli troops? Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israeli forces were moving to control a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized buffer zone in Syrian territory. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. A U.N. force of about 1,100 troops has patrolled the area since then. On a visit Sunday to a Golan Heights hilltop overlooking Syria, Netanyahu said that because Syrian troops had abandoned their positions, Israel's move into the buffer zone was necessary as a 'temporary defensive position.' 'The peacekeepers at (the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, or UNDOF) informed the Israeli counterparts that these actions would constitute a violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement, that there should be no military forces or activities in the area of separation,' said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric. He added that the buffer zone was calm and UNDOF peacekeepers remained in their position. The Security Council is scheduled to meet for special consultations called by Russia to discuss the buffer zone issue. The rebels who ousted Assad and now control much of Syria are led by a former senior al-Qaida militant, although he severed ties with the extremist group years ago and has promised representative government and religious tolerance. On Monday evening, Netanyahu said Assad’s fall is the 'direct result of the heavy blows we landed on Hamas, on Hezbollah and on Iran.' He added that Israel would occupy the summit of Mount Hermon, which is within the buffer zone on the Syria-Lebanon border, and at 2,814 meters (9,232 feet) is the highest peak in the eastern Mediterranean coast. Israel has sent both ground and air troops into the buffer zone, including on the Syrian side of snow-dusted Mount Hermon, which is divided between the Golan Heights, Lebanon, and Syria. Only the United States recognizes Israel's control of the Golan Heights. How long will Israeli troops be in the buffer zone? Israeli troops began moving into the buffer zone Saturday. Also on Saturday, armed men attacked U.N. forces near the border with Israel, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. '(The Israeli military) took targeted and temporary control of certain areas near the border to prevent an Oct. 7 scenario from Syria,' Saar said, referring to Hamas' surprise 2023 attack into Israel from the Gaza Strip. Many in the region condemned the move. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry accused Israel of 'exploiting the power vacuum … to occupy more Syrian territories and create a fait accompli in violation of international law.' This isn’t the first time Israel has entered the buffer zone this year. An Associated Press report last month examining satellite imagery found that Israel had been working on a construction project, possibly a new road, along the border with Syria from as early as July, and had in some cases entered the buffer zone during construction. Following the AP report, U.N. forces warned that the Israeli military has committed 'severe violations' of its ceasefire deal with Syria. Is Israel invading Syria? Israeli political and military leaders have stressed that the seizure of the buffer zone is temporary and not a prelude to entering other parts of Syrian territory. 'The plan at the moment is that this is a temporary step to make sure stability is kept in the border, making sure the buffer zone is kept, and the U.N. forces can stay,' said a military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military guidelines. The official noted that in 2014, U.N. peacekeepers fled the buffer zone after al-Qaida-linked Syrian rebels attacked their encampments. After armed men attacked U.N. forces over the weekend, Israel wanted to ensure the situation did not repeat itself, the official said. Israel isn’t currently trying to change the border or prepare for an invasion into Syria, said Carmit Valensi, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think-tank. 'Right now, it’s a tactical operation, not a long-term strategy, in response to the dynamic situation in Syria,' she said. With the collapse of the Syrian army, Israel wants to protect its borders until the situation stabilizes, she said. What are Israel’s interests? Israel says its immediate goal is to prevent the instability in Syria from spreading into the border region. Defense Minister Israel Katz on Monday laid out Israel’s plans for the border area. He said that after completing the takeover of the buffer zone, Israel would create a 'security zone' beyond it by destroying heavy artillery across Syria and preventing Iran from smuggling weapons through Syria into Lebanon. Foreign Minister Saar said Monday that Israel has struck multiple sites holding chemical weapons and long-range missiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of hostile actors. Saar did not say when the strikes occurred. Analysts said Israel is likely to continue carrying out strikes against targets across Syria. Israel is planning outreach to Syria’s Druze population, a close-knit religious minority that also lives in Israel, Jordan and Lebanon and has maintained some ties across borders. Israel is also trying to open lines of communication with Syrian rebel groups, to help ensure Iranian-backed factions don’t reclaim any territory, according to Valensi. For many years, Israel quietly provided food, medicine, clothing and other assistance to war-ravaged southern Syria through 'Operation Good Neighbor,' which ended in 2018. More than 4,000 wounded and sick Syrians received medical treatment in Israel or in Israeli field hospitals, and those non-diplomatic connections could now prove crucial. ___ Associated Press writer Edith M.

Assad’s downfall is a humbling blow to Russia. How will it affect Putin's prestige?	Almost exactly seven years ago, President Vladimir Putin stood with Russian troops at their air base in Syria and proudly declared victory over 'terrorists' in that country as part of the Kremlin’s military intervention to prop up the government of Bashar Assad amid a civil war. This weekend, those hard-won gains seemed a distant memory. Assad hastily fled to Moscow as his power crumbled during a lightning offensive by rebels that his main international allies, Russia and Iran, were unable to stem. The Kremlin’s failure to prevent Assad’s swift downfall has exposed limits of Russia’s power and dented its international clout at a pivotal stage of its war in Ukraine. A look at Russia’s involvement in Syria and the possible consequences of Assad’s demise for Moscow: What was Russia's role in Syria and its civil war? The Soviet Union was a longtime ally of Assad's father, Hafez Assad, who ruled the country for nearly 30 years, and provided military advisers and aid. After an 2011 uprising against Bashar Assad’s rule morphed into a civil war, Russia continued to be a key backer of Damascus, offering political support at the United Nations. When Assad’s rule neared collapse after a series of battlefield defeats in 2015, Russia joined Iran to intervene militarily. Russia deployed warplanes to the Hemeimeem air base in Syria’s coastal province of Latakia, delivering thousands of tons of military equipment and supplies in an operation dubbed the 'Syrian Express.' On Sept. 30, 2015, Moscow launched its air campaign. Russia kept only about 50 warplanes at Hemeimeem, but they operated at a frenetic pace, each flying several sorties a day. Most of the Russian air force personnel were rotated through the base, giving them combat experience. At the same time, Moscow expanded and upgraded its naval base in Tartus, the only such outpost outside the former USSR. It deployed special operations forces for critical ground missions and sent hundreds of military advisers to train Syrian troops and direct their operations. Mercenaries from Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner Group military contractor also joined the battle. The military intervention allowed Assad to reclaim control of most of Syria, making the Kremlin a key power broker in the Middle East and boosting Russia’s prestige. Putin's triumphal visit to Hemeimeem on Dec. 11, 2017, came a week after Russia declared victory over the Islamic State group in Syria and shortly after he announced a reelection bid for 2018. It was Russia’s first military operation outside the former Soviet Union since the USSR's collapse in 1991 and gave Moscow a chance to test its latest weapons in combat. That military success emboldened Putin and was a key factor that contributed to his decision to invade Ukraine in 2022. Why did Russia fail to keep Assad in power? After helping Assad regain control over most Syria, Russia urged him to engage in talks with moderate opposition groups. Buoyed by opposition defeats, however, Assad staunchly resisted any initiatives aimed at national reconciliation. 'Trying to minimize its costs in Syria, Russia has increasingly focused on maintaining the shaky and inefficient status quo, preserving the crumbling and delegitimized Assad regime without any perspectives,' said Ruslan Pukhov, a Moscow-based military expert, in an analysis. During recent contacts between Syrian and Turkish officials that Moscow helped broker this year, Assad’s government showed little interest in compromise -– a recalcitrance that paved the way for the offensive by Turkey-backed opposition groups that ousted Assad. Syria’s economic woes, exacerbated by isolating international sanctions, weakened the country and its military. The demoralized Syrian army quickly crumbled under the brunt of the opposition offensive, a rapid meltdown that Tehran and Moscow couldn't avert with the small contingents they had in Syria. Russia dedicated the bulk of its assets to the war in Ukraine, while Iran, weakened by international sanctions and locked in a tense standoff with Israel, similarly lacked resources to help Assad. Alexander Dugin, an ideologue linked to some hawkish Kremlin circles, called Assad’s demise as a painful blow to Russia. 'The Assad regime that we supported through enormous efforts collapsed in just a few days. It’s very sad,' Dugin said. What happens to Russian assets in Syria? With Assad’s demise, the future of Russia bases in Syria — its only military foothold outside the former Soviet Union — is in question. The number of Russian warplanes at Hemeimeem air base has shrunk from several dozen to just a few, although it continues to be a key logistics point. Russian military cargo planes ferrying private contractors and supplies to Africa used it for refueling, and its loss would pose logistical problems for operations there. 'The importance of Syria for Russia’s operations in Africa has been invaluable,' Moscow-based Middle East expert Nikolai Sukhov said in televised comments. The Tartus naval base is used by Russian warships for maintenance, refueling and replenishing supplies on visits to the Mediterranean. While opposition forces that eventually ousted Assad swept across Syria in late November, the Russian navy and air force held drills in the eastern Mediterranean, with Tartus as its operational center. Even as Putin granted Assad and his family an asylum in Russia, Moscow reached out to the new Syrian authorities to try to ensure the security of its bases and to extend their stay. An opposition flag quickly was hoisted at the Syrian Embassy in Moscow. Asked about the bases, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would be a topic for future discussions with the new authorities. 'For now, we are witnessing a period of transformation and extreme instability, so it will obviously take time and require a serious conversation with those who will have power,' he said. Syria's new leaders reportedly promised not to attack Russian military facilities. Bronwen Maddox, director and chief executive at Chatham House, noted in a commentary that 'whatever government emerges in Damascus is expected – for the moment -– to respect the deal that Assad struck granting Russia use of a military base on the Syrian coast.' But she added that this 'important asset is vulnerable,' and that risks Russia's regional influence. What does Assad's demise mean for Russia? Assad's rapid downfall dealt a heavy blow to Putin at a time when he is preparing for a new U.S. administration and what that means for the war in Ukraine. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to negotiate an end to the conflict. Many observers note that the humiliating loss of Russia's only ally in the Middle East has dented Kremlin prestige on the global stage and could weaken Putin’s hand in any negotiations on Ukraine. 'The key issue is how Moscow will now try to adapt to the new realities and whether it will have enough flexibility to deal with the new masters of Syria, who seem to be interested in avoiding conflict with Moscow for now,' Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center wrote in a commentary. There is also the possibility that Putin could take an even more uncompromising stance in negotiations to avoid looking weak. 'Assad’s collapse has also shaken Putin, making him less inclined to demonstrate flexibility with Ukraine,' Stanovaya added. 'The war in Ukraine has, to some extent, cost him Syria, which reinforces his unwillingness to compromise.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-syria-assad-ukraine-war-31fa9b933372b3704ed285c96863892b	2024-12-09T07:59:57-08:00	
A gang leader in Haiti is accused of massacring older people to avenge his son's death	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A gang leader who controls a key port in Haiti's capital is accused of massacring older people and Vodou religious leaders in his community to avenge his son's death, according to the government and human rights organizations that estimate more than 100 killed. Reports on the number of dead in Port-au-Prince can vary wildly in a country where such killings often occur in gang-controlled, largely inaccessible areas. Haiti’s government in a statement Monday acknowledged the massacre, saying over 100 were killed in the Cité Soleil neighborhood, and promised to bring to justice those responsible for 'this unspeakable carnage.' Volker Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told journalists on Monday that at least 184 people were killed by a powerful gang leader. It wasn’t clear where his office had obtained that number, and a spokesperson did not return a request for comment. The U.N. secretary-general's office said 127 of the dead were older people. Haitian watchdogs also estimated more than 100 were killed, at times citing community residents. The Cooperative for Peace and Development, a local rights group, said in a statement Sunday its monitoring unit found that around 20 older people were killed. But it noted that unidentified residents in the community controlled by gang leader Micanor Altès, also known as Monel Felix and Wa Mikanò, claimed there were more than 100 victims. The National Human Rights Defense Network, another local rights group, said at least 110 people were killed between Friday and Saturday. The group and its executive director, Pierre Espérance, did not say where it obtained that information, and Espérance did not return requests for comment. The murky information was a worrying sign in a country in the grip of widespread gang violence. 'The fact that we have so many doubts about what happened days after the massacre is a signal that clearly indicates the level of control (gangs) have on the population,' said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. The accused gang leader controls the coastal communities of Wharf Jérémie, La Saline and Fort Dimanche and was known for robbery, extortion and hijacking of goods and trucks, according to a U.N. report earlier this year. 'Micanor was not known for being as brutal as other gang leaders,' Da Rin said. 'Not until now.' The gang leader could not be reached for comment and has not posted on social media. A spokesman for Haiti's National Police did not return a message for comment. The National Human Rights Defense Network said the massacre occurred because the gang leader's child was severely ill, prompting him to seek advice from a Vodou priest. After his son died, he accused older people in the community 'of practicing witchcraft and harming the child.' The Cooperative for Peace and Development said that according to information circulating in the community, Micanor accused people in the neighborhood for causing his son’s illness. 'He decided to cruelly punish all elderly people and (Vodou) practitioners who, in his imagination, would be capable of casting a bad spell on his son,' the group said. It said gunmen rounded up well-known community leaders and took them to the gang leader’s stronghold, where they were executed. Also killed were motorcycle drivers who tried to save some victims. The group also noted that there’s a ban on people leaving the community 'in order to continue to identify (Vodou) practitioners and the elderly with the aim of carrying out the silent killing.' Da Rin noted that usually killings in Haiti are documented and posted on social media, though they can be difficult to verify. 'In this case, there was not even a message on WhatsApp or a video on TikTok, which is very unusual,' he said. The Cooperative for Peace and Development said Micanor has previously targeted Vodou practitioners, killing a dozen older women and Vodou leaders 'wrongly accused of witchcraft' in recent years. It’s not unusual for Haitians to seek medical and other advice from Vodou priests known as 'oungans.' The religion that mixes Catholicism with animist beliefs was at the root of the revolution that led Haiti to become the world’s first free Black republic in 1804. The massacre in Port-au-Prince comes two months after over 70 people were killed in the central town of Pont-Sondé, where gangs are vying to control more territory. Such killings have overwhelmed Haiti’s National Police and a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police that lacks funds and personnel, with the U.S. and other countries pushing for a U.N. peacekeeping mission. 'The crisis in Haiti has reached catastrophic levels with allied criminal groups intensifying large-scale, coordinated attacks on the population and key state infrastructure,' Human Rights Watch said Monday as it called for a U.N. mission. It noted that 'many Haitians live with the constant fear of being killed, raped, kidnapped, or forcibly recruited even as they struggle every day to find adequate food, water, and health care to survive.' More than 4,500 people have been reported killed in Haiti this year, according to the U.N. ___ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-massacre-gangs-vodou-97c1206c79648b61b43fd6be6ee1079a	2024-12-09T07:55:33-08:00	
Nobel Peace Prize winner urges Putin to understand the destructiveness of nuclear weapons	OSLO, Norway (AP) — Terumi Tanaka, a survivor of the U.S. atomic bombings of Japan and the representative of an organization that won this year's Nobel Peace Prize, called on Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday to stop making nuclear threats. The 92-year-old spoke at a news conference in Oslo, Norway, a day before a ceremony where he is to deliver a lecture on behalf of Nihon Hidankyo, an organization of survivors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that won this year's prize. Asked by a reporter if he had a message for Putin, Tanaka said that the Russian leader's repeated nuclear threats convinced him that Putin must not understand how devastating the use of nuclear weapons would be. He said that his organization's message to Putin — which he said had also been conveyed to the Russian leader directly — is that 'nuclear weapons are things which must never be used.' 'I don’t think he has even thought about this or understood this. Therefore, he is able to say these kind of things. So I think that how we can change his way of thinking is what we need to do to have him really understand what these are,' he said through a translator. The first U.S. atomic bombing killed 140,000 people in the city of Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945. A second on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killed another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, ending World War II. Japan's Kyodo news agency says that Tanaka was 13 and living in Nagasaki when the United States dropped the atomic bomb there. While he did not suffer major injuries himself, he lost five family members, and has said that the images of burned bodies in the devastated city are etched in his memory. Jørgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said in announcing the award weeks ago that it was made as the 'taboo against the use of nuclear weapons is under pressure.' The committee noted that rather than embrace disarmament, nuclear powers are upgrading their arsenals, while other countries appear to be preparing to acquire nuclear weapons. It also noted that threats are being made to use the weapons in ongoing warfare, an apparent reference to Russia's threats amid its war in Ukraine. The Japanese group's elderly members are calling for the abolishment of nuclear weapons, a message also directed at the United States. Tanaka noted that 'we are old now' but still carry a 'heavy sense of responsibility' as witnesses to remind the world of the destructiveness of nuclear weapons. 'Nuclear weapons and humanity cannot coexist,' he said. Back in Japan, Empress Masako on Monday described the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Nihon Hidankyo as a key event of this year that impressed upon her the importance of global peace efforts. In a statement, she said she 'felt anew the importance for the people of the world to strive for mutual understanding and work together in order to build a peaceful world.' ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.	https://apnews.com/article/nobel-peace-prize-nihon-hidankyo-terumi-tanaka-5920653f1f577c591ea3dc644e92b3bb	2024-12-09T05:28:37-08:00	
Zelenskyy open to Western troops providing security for end to war in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that he's open to the potential deployment of Western troops in Ukraine to guarantee the country’s security as part of a broad effort to end the almost three-year war with Russia. The deployment would be a step toward Ukraine joining NATO, Zelenskyy said in a post on his Telegram channel. 'But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO,' Zelenskyy said. His proposals tread a delicate diplomatic path amid international efforts to find a way of ending Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II at a time when Russia has gained an upper hand in the fighting. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is seeking to bring about a ceasefire and met with Zelenskyy in Paris on Saturday. But Zelenskyy said Monday that he would approach outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden about Ukraine’s possible NATO membership because he's still in office, while Trump doesn't yet have 'legal rights' to decide on the matter. The possibilities of Ukraine joining the 32-nation military alliance and of Western troops being stationed on its soil have been deeply divisive and contentious issues since Russia’s full-scale invasion began on Feb. 24, 2022. At their summit in Washington in July, NATO declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership, but stopped short of inviting the country in. The United States and Germany have balked at Ukraine joining NATO while at war with Russia. One obstacle has been the view that Ukraine’s borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the alliance’s pact of mutual defense would come into effect. Russia’s invading army occupies about one-fifth of Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron floated the idea of Western troops on the ground in Ukraine last February. But it raised the same fears of escalation that have led Western leaders to place limits on weapons supplies and permissions for their use. European military heavyweights Germany and Poland immediately said they wouldn't send troops to Ukraine. Macron declined to provide details about which nations were considering sending troops, saying he preferred to maintain some 'strategic ambiguity Meanwhile, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s challenger in the upcoming German election, Friedrich Merz, said that there’s a 'basic consensus' in Germany on continuing to provide military aid to Ukraine. But during a visit to Kyiv, he also highlighted differences with Scholz, who has refused to send Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine as he insists that everything must be done to prevent a wider war between the West and Russia. Merz has been open to providing them and allowing Ukraine to hit military targets inside Russia. As he met Zelenskyy, Merz noted that France, the U.K. and the U.S. have a different position from the current German government. 'Our position is clear, as is that of my parliamentary group: we want to put your army in a position to reach military bases in Russia – not the civilian population, not the infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being fought,' he said. 'With this range restriction, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand behind its back, and that is not our position,' he added. Merz’s center-right Union bloc leads German opinion polls. The election is expected on Feb. 23. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-troops-nato-9bf883670879e2a398fe1a7ebfb71ddb	2024-12-09T04:47:09-08:00	
Indigenous Mayans want their sacred cenotes to have personhood status	HOMUN, Mexico (AP) — A huge poplar tree stands proud in Maribel Ek's courtyard, adorned with a sign that reads: 'Florece desde adentro' ('It blooms from within'). Deep underground, the tree's long roots search for the water that makes this land special: a sinkhole lake, known as a cenote. Cenotes provide an important water source to Ek's community of Homun, in the Mexican state of Yucatan, and a livelihood for locals who lead tourists from around the world into the caverns to bathe in their crystalline waters. But more than that, cenotes are sacred to Indigenous Mayans like her. As she descends into the cavern, Ek shines a light on a stone covered in flowers, pots, and candles —the remains of an offering she made to thank the cenote for everything it has given her. She refers to the sacred space as her 'neighbor,' one that needs protection. That belief is the basis of a lawsuit that seeks personhood status for the Ring of Cenotes, made up of hundreds of subterranean lakes that surround the northwest of the Yucatan peninsula in a semicircle, and provide the main source of freshwater in the region. The lawsuit, from the Indigenous Mayan organization Kana’an Ts’onot, or Guardians of the Cenotes, seeks to protect the area from further contamination by industries that have moved there to take advantage of the plentiful water. The group, as designated guardians, would be able to fight on behalf of the Ring of Cenotes in court. If they win, this would become the first ecosystem in Mexico to have its own rights, following in the wake of other cases worldwide, such as the Whanganui River in New Zealand or the Komi Memem River in the Brazilian Amazon. Ek, a member of the Guardians group, speaks of the cenote and its waters as a person, as she explains the reasons behind their fight. 'Because you have to be the voice, that she doesn’t have,' she said. 'Because you have to be the hands, that she doesn’t have.' Polluting the waters The threats to cenotes have been multiplying in recent years. In addition to uncontrolled urban development and the lack of drainage in cities, new dangers include the increase in breweries and massive soybean fields and the construction of the Maya Train, which has embedded thousands of steel pillars in this underground paradise. But what most worries the Guardians of the Cenotes are the pig farms. According to Mexico’s Ministry of the Environment, 507 pig farms are operating near the Ring of Cenotes, 90% of which don’t have environmental impact studies and more than 60% that don’t have a wastewater discharge permit. That means there is no control over what happens to the thousands of liters of water filled with pig excrement and urine generated at the facilities. In many cases, the pollutant-filled water seeps into the aquifer. The area is particularly vulnerable because the soil is karstic, made up of very thin and porous limestone full of conduits and cavities that allow everything that is dumped on the surface to filter underground, explains biologist Yameli Aguilar, master in environmental engineering from the Autonomous University of Yucatan. A comprehensive report conducted last year by the Ministry of the Environment analyzed the water quality of 20 cenotes near pig farms and found that all of them exceeded the limits for fecal coliform (E. coli), set by Mexican authorities to protect aquatic life. In addition, in 26 of the 51 municipalities in Yucatan where pig farms operate, they found 'critical conditions for the water sustainability of the aquifer' due to high amounts of nitrogen from pig excrement and urine. The state designates the land as a natural protected area, and it is considered a wetland of international importance by the Ramsar Convention, an organization formed around a global treaty to protect wetlands. Yet the government fails to prevent the 'serious contamination' and the cenotes are suffering, said lawyer Lourdes Medina, who represents the Guardians in the process. Ek and other cenotes’ owners created the Guardians of the Cenotes group to lead the fight against a 49,000 pig farm that was installed on the outskirts of Homun in 2017. They organized dozens of protests, sit-ins, public consultations and legal actions, but nothing seemed to have any effect. A year later, a lawsuit filed by six children from Homun demanding their right to water and a healthy environment succeeded in getting a judge to order the farm closed. It remains closed nowadays, but the legal battle continues. In 2022 they filed the personhood lawsuit that would not only protect Homun, but also the other 52 communities located within the Ring of Cenotes. And it's already bearing fruit: a judge of the state of Yucatan ordered the authorities not to grant permits to any project that could impact the area until the lawsuit is resolved. That could happen at the beginning of next year. Without protections, the group fears that their sacred cenotes will be contaminated and lose the pristine waters they depend on. What do the pig farmers say? Pig farms and other large industries are drawn to the area because of the availability of water. The farms use large quantities of water (about 20 liters per kilo of meat produced) to cool the animals and clean their waste. The industry says they are not to blame for the contamination. Carlos Ramayo Navarrete, director of the Pig Farmers Association in Merida, which represents the largest pig companies in Yucatan, said the problem is the lack of drainage in cities and the small-scale and 'backyard' pig operations, because they are not as regulated by the authorities as are the bigger farms he represents. He said around half the water the farms use is then reused. In addition, he said that all of the farms have treatment plants to reduce the load of pollutants in their wastewater, which is then used as fertilizer to irrigate fields. 'An industry that does everything within its reach and more can't be demonized,' he said. However, both the Ministry of the Environment and Aguilar have said that the measures taken by the industry are still not enough to prevent contamination of the aquifer. 'As so much (water) is used, to date there is no treatment plant that can lower the pollution load of all that wastewater,' Aguilar said. What will the future bring? As the lawsuits wend their way through the courts, tension between mega-farms and the local population has increased. In 2023, the residents of Sitilpech, about 50 kilometers from Homun, took to the streets to protest against the 48,000 pig farm located on the outskirts of their village. The demonstrations were repressed by the police and resulted in the arrest of several villagers. When a group of AP reporters approached the farm earlier this year, owned by pig giant Kekén, they saw a security guard with a machete in his hand at the entrance. The Sitilpech house closest to the farm is small and painted green, with a porch overlooking the road and a banner written in capital letters demanding that the pig farm leave. In the backyard, Marcela Chi Eb has just put in a washing machine and is hanging clothes on ropes supported by two lemon trees. Their leaves are dry and brownish; she said they got that way when the farm started operating. At night she is awakened by the farm's stench and, although the heat is unbearable, she closes the windows to keep out the smell that permeates her nose and clothes. While one of her daughters rests in a hammock, Chi Eb talks about what worries her most: that in the future neither she nor her children will be able to use the water that comes from the faucet in her house. Back in Homun, Maribel Ek reaches the end of the cavern and, without a second thought, dives into the turquoise waters of the cenote. As a child she came down here every day to collect water because the public supply didn’t reach her house. Since then she learned this wasn't just 'a dark hole with bats,' but 'a blessing, a dark hole that becomes a friend,' she says. 'That's why we demand rights for our cenotes.' ___ Follow Teresa de Miguel on X at @tdemigueles ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Head of UN human rights promises advice to FIFA and Saudi Arabia over 2034 World Cup issues	GENEVA (AP) — Two days before FIFA confirms Saudi Arabia as the 2034 World Cup host, the United Nations’ top human rights official pledged Monday to try to ensure migrant labor standards are 'properly respected' around the tournament. Saudi Arabia is the only candidate and sure to win Wednesday when FIFA will ask an online meeting of its 211 member federations to award the 2034 hosting rights by acclaim without an itemized vote. The oil-rich kingdom’s World Cup plan needs to build eight of the 15 promised stadiums from scratch, plus add 175,000 hotel rooms. It will rely heavily on migrant workers, often from South Asia, within a labor law framework that activist groups say does not protect them. On Monday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, said his organization in Geneva was not directly engaged by FIFA on World Cup issues. 'What we are involved in though is to make sure that indeed, in each and every major sporting event, human rights are part and parcel of the way that sports events are not only conceived but also conducted,' Türk said at a news conference on the eve of the UN’s annual Human Rights Day. Critics of FIFA say a Saudi-hosted World Cup risks repeating rights abuses seen during a decade of similar preparations for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Allegations of widespread labor abuses in Saudi Arabia are already part of an investigation by the UN-backed International Labor Organization (ILO) after a formal complaint by trade unions. Two United States senators have cited human rights in urging FIFA to find a different host for its marquee men’s event that earns billions of dollars in profit for the soccer body. 'Whatever the decision is, to whoever is going to organize it, we will provide precisely that type of advice to the organizers,' Türk, an Austrian lawyer, said. 'That will include also, of course, the need to make sure that migrant labor standards are properly respected and all the various other human rights dimensions of major sporting events.' FIFA has been criticized for not using its leverage ahead of the World Cup decision with Saudi Arabia, despite its president Gianni Infantino building close ties to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi officials made some promises in a formal bid document to engage with the ILO and domestic agencies but not international groups like unions and rights groups that have limited or no access to work in the country. Soccer’s world body praised the Saudi bid in a mandatory in-house evaluation published Nov. 30 and noted the 48-team, 104-game tournament offers 'significant opportunities for positive human rights impact.' FIFA also acknowledged that Saudi Arabia must invest 'significant effort and time' to comply with international standards, which were widely criticized this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council. In their letter to Infantino in October, U.S. senators Ron Wyden and Dick Durbin — Democrats representing Oregon and Illinois, respectively — urged finding a 2034 host 'with a record of upholding human rights.' 'The kingdom continues to torture dissidents, engage in extrajudicial killings, discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community, oppress women and religious minorities, exploit and abuse foreign workers, and restrict almost all political rights and civil liberties,' the letter said. The FIFA decision to confirm Saudi Arabia on Wednesday will be combined with awarding the 2030 World Cup to Spain, Portugal and Morocco. That project gives one game each to Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which was the original World Cup host in 1930. By teaming up Europe, South America and Africa for 2030 — four years after North American neighbors the United States, Canada and Mexico are due to co-host in 2026 — FIFA was able in October last year to open an unexpected and fast-track 2034 contest limited to bidders from Asia or Oceania. That all-but ensured a Saudi win. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/un-human-rights-2034-world-cup-fifa-saudi-arabia-325e17597c7b10fa49034fa1763e6862	2024-12-09T03:01:29-08:00	
Taiwan says China has sent naval ships into nearby waters ahead of anticipated drills	BEIJING (AP) — China's military appears to be preparing for widely anticipated drills in response to a recent visit by Taiwan's president to Hawaii and Guam. Taiwan's defense ministry said Monday that it detected Chinese naval and coast guard ships entering the Taiwan Strait and the western Pacific and that China had restricted airspace along its southeast coast through Wednesday. There was no immediate confirmation from the Chinese side. It comes as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he would not commit to defending Taiwan if China were to invade during his presidency. China says Taiwan is part of its territory and opposes American support and military sales to the self-governing island. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te made stops in Hawaii and Guam during a weeklong tour of the Pacific that ended Friday. China maintains that Taiwan is a province that should not have its own president or foreign relations. Taiwan's defense ministry said it has set up an emergency response center and launched combat readiness exercises in response to Chinese activity in the Taiwan Strait. It did not say what those exercises entailed. 'It must be pointed out that there is no such thing as a defense ministry in Taiwan,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said when asked about the Taiwanese statement. 'Taiwan is part of China, and the Taiwan issue is China’s internal affairs. China will firmly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.' China, which views Lai as a separatist, held major military exercises around Taiwan following his inauguration in May and his national day speech in October. It also held a major drill after Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022. The Taiwan defense ministry statement said China had restricted air space in seven zones off Fujian province, which faces Taiwan, and off Zhejiang province, which stretches north from Fujian to Shanghai. Trump was asked during a televised interview if he would commit to defending Taiwan. 'I never say, because I have to negotiate things, right?' he told NBC's 'Meet the Press.' He said he had spoken in recent days with Chinese leader Xi Jinping but the two did not discuss the Taiwan issue. 'We talked about other things,' he said. 'But I have a very good relationship, and I hope he doesn’t do it.'	https://apnews.com/article/china-taiwan-tensions-military-drills-2ab811378272b53e270e3848ecefa893	2024-12-08T23:09:19-08:00	
Syrian prime minister says government is still functioning but foreign and domestic challenges loom	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syria's prime minister said Monday that most cabinet ministers are still working from offices in Damascus after rebels entered the capital over the weekend and overthrew President Bashar Assad. Streams of refugees crossed in from neighboring countries, hoping for a more peaceful future. But there were already signs of the difficulties ahead for the rebel alliance now in control of much of the country, which is led by a former senior al-Qaida militant who severed ties with the extremist group years ago and has promised representative government and religious tolerance. The rebel command said Monday they would not tell women how to dress. Israel said it is carrying out airstrikes on suspected chemical weapons sites and long-range rockets to keep them from falling into the hands of extremists. Israel has also seized a buffer zone inside Syria after Syrian troops withdrew. In northern Syria, Turkey said allied opposition forces seized the town of Manbij from Kurdish-led forces backed by the United States, a reminder that even after Assad's departure to Russia the country remains split among armed groups that have fought in the past. The Kremlin said Russia has granted political asylum to Assad, a decision made by President Vladimir Putin. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on Assad’s specific whereabouts and said Putin was not planning to meet with him. Damascus was quiet on Monday, with life slowly returning to normal while most shops and public institutions were closed. In public squares, some people were still celebrating. Civilian traffic resumed but there was no public transport. Long lines formed in front of bakeries and other food stores. There was little sign of any security presence, and Associated Press reporters saw a few SUVs on the side of a main boulevard that appeared to have been broken into. In some areas, small groups of armed men were stationed in the streets. A video circulating online showed a man in military fatigues holding a rifle attempting to reassure residents of the Mezzeh neighborhood in Damascus that they would not be harmed. 'We have nothing against you, neither Alawite, nor Christian, nor Shiite, nor Druze, but everyone must behave well, and no one should try to attack us,' the fighter said. Prime minister says the government is still operational Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali, who remained in his post after Assad and most of his top officials vanished over the weekend, has sought to project normalcy. 'We are working so that the transitional period is quick and smooth,' he told Sky News Arabia TV on Monday, saying the security situation had already improved from the day before. He said the government is coordinating with the insurgents, and that he is ready to meet rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who made a triumphal appearance at a famed Damascus mosque on Sunday. Syrians who only days ago were working at all levels of the bureaucracy in Assad’s government were adjusting to the new reality. At the court of Justice in Damascus, which was stormed by the rebels to free detainees, Judge Khitam Haddad, an aide to the justice minister in the outgoing government, said Sunday that judges were ready to resume work quickly. 'We want to give everyone their rights,' Haddad said outside the courthouse. 'We want to build a new Syria and to keep the work, but with new methods.' The rebels, meanwhile, said they would guarantee personal freedoms and would not impose Islamic dress on women. 'It is strictly forbidden to interfere with women’s dress or impose any request related to their clothing or appearance, including requests for modesty,' the General Command said in a statement on social media. Separately, a Syrian opposition war monitor said a top aide to Assad's brother, Maher, was found dead in his office near Damascus. A video that circulated on social media purportedly showed Maj. Gen. Ali Mahmoud covered with blood and with his clothes burned. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was not clear if he was killed or died by suicide. Maher Assad led the army's 4th Armored Division, which played a major role in the civil war that erupted in 2011, after a popular uprising against Assad led to a violent crackdown on dissent and the rise of an insurgency. Israel confirms it has struck suspected chemical weapons, rockets Israelis welcomed the fall of Assad, who was a key ally of Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, while expressing concern over what comes next. Israel says its forces temporarily seized a buffer zone inside Syria dating back to a 1974 agreement after Syrian troops withdrew in the chaos. 'The only interest we have is the security of Israel and its citizens,' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters on Monday. 'That’s why we attacked strategic weapons systems, like, for example, remaining chemical weapons, or long-range missiles and rockets, in order that they will not fall in the hands of extremists.' Saar did not provide details about when or where the strikes took place. An AP journalist in Damascus reported airstrikes in the area of the Mezzeh military airport, southwest of the capital, on Sunday. The airport has previously been targeted in Israeli airstrikes. Strikes were also heard in the capital on Monday. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria in recent years, targeting what it says are military sites related to Iran and Hezbollah. Israeli officials rarely comment on individual strikes. Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons stockpile in 2013, after the government was accused of launching an attack near Damascus that killed hundreds of people. But it is widely believed to have kept some of the weapons and was accused of using them again in subsequent years. Turkey says its allies have taken northern town Officials in Turkey, which is the main supporter of the Syrian opposition to Assad, say its allies have taken full control of the northern Syrian city of Manbij from a U.S.-supported and Kurdish-led force known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. The SDF said a Turkish drone struck in the village of al-Mistriha in eastern Syria, killing 12 civilians, including six children. Turkey views the SDF, which is primarily composed of a Syrian Kurdish militia, as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has waged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey. The SDF has also been a key ally of the United States in the war against the Islamic State group. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Monday expressed hope for a new era in Syria in which ethnic and religious groups can live peacefully under an inclusive government. But he warned against allowing Islamic State or Kurdish fighters to take advantage of the situation, saying Turkey will prevent Syria from turning into a 'haven for terrorism.' ___ Mroue reported from Beirut and Goldenberg from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Middle East latest: Israeli strikes hit Gaza and also target suspected weapons sites in Syria	Israeli strikes killed at least six people in the central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical officials said Monday, while also hitting suspected chemical and long-range weapons sites in Syria to keep them from rebels who seized Damascus. The U.N. Security Council plans to hold emergency closed consultations on Syria later Monday at the request of Russia, which on Monday said it granted asylum to its longtime ally Syrian leader Bashar Assad. Russian President Vladimir Putin personally made the decision to offer asylum to Assad, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov wouldn’t comment on Assad’s specific whereabouts and said that Putin wasn’t planning to meet with him. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in the Gaza since the start of the war, according to local health authorities. They say most of the dead are women and children but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250, including older adults and children. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here's the Latest: Syrian insurgents say they won't interfere with women's dressing or personal freedoms DAMASCUS, Syria — Syrian insurgents who toppled President Bashar Assad said they won't impose any religious dress code on women and vowed to guarantee personal freedom for everyone. In a statement posted on social media, the insurgents' General Command said 'it is strictly forbidden to interfere with women’s dress or impose any request related to their clothing or appearance, including requests for modesty.' The command said it affirms that personal freedom is guaranteed to everyone, and that respect for the rights of individuals is the basis for building a civilized nation. In areas that were controlled by Syrian opposition groups since the civil war erupted in 2011, the vast majority of women dressed modestly, only revealing their faces and hands. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the militant leader whose forces entered Damascus over the weekend, has renounced longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicted himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. T housands of Syrian soldiers cross into Iraq, an official says BAGHDAD — More than 4,000 Syrian army soldiers have crossed into Iraq since rebel forces seized Damascus and overthrew the government of Bashar Assad, a militia official in western Iraq said Monday. The official with the Anbar Tribal Mobilization Forces said that the soldiers had turned over their weapons, ammunition and armored vehicles and would be housed in a camp. He did not say where the camp was located. Another security official said that the governor of the Syrian province of Hasakeh had come to the border late Sunday night with a convoy of Syrian army soldiers who wanted to cross into Iraq, and they were allowed in via the Qaim crossing. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The Iraqi government has close ties with Iran and used to be one of Assad's primary backers but Baghdad has taken a neutral position on the advance of the insurgents and Assad’s downfall. — By Qassim Abdul-Zahra UN human rights chief says Assad and other officials should face justice GENEVA — The U.N. human rights chief said Monday that former President Bashar Assad and other top Syrian officials behind possible war crimes 'should be brought to justice.' Volker Türk also said any transition process in Syria should not be separated from the need for accountability for alleged war crimes that took place in its civil war that began in 2011, leaving hundreds of thousands dead and millions fleeing their homes. Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, also noted that Syria has not ratified the International Criminal Court statute, but the court in The Hague could have jurisdiction if the 'new Syria' decides to ratify it -- an allusion to whoever the new leadership of Syria becomes. Turk said there were 'serious grounds to believe' that Assad and others in serious leadership positions in his government may have committed atrocity crimes, 'and as a result, yes, they should be brought to justice.' Russia grants political asylum to Assad, Kremlin says MOSCOW — The Kremlin said Monday that Russia has granted political asylum to former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Russian President Vladimir Putin has personally made the decision to offer asylum to Assad, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 'Such decisions certainly can’t be made without the head of state,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. 'It was his decision.' Peskov wouldn’t comment on Assad’s specific whereabouts. He said that Putin wasn’t planning to meet with Assad. The Kremlin spokesman said that Moscow has been doing everything needed to ensure the security of its military bases in Syria. He said the future of the Russian bases will be a subject for discussion with the new authorities. 'For now, we are witnessing a period of transformation and extreme instability, so it will obviously take time and require a serious conversation with those who will have power,' he said. 'The developments have surprised the world, and we weren’t an exclusion,' Peskov said when asked whether the Kremlin was surprised by Assad’s quick demise. Turkish foreign minister says Ankara hopes for ‘an inclusive government’ in Syria ANKARA, Turkey — Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday that Ankara hopes the fall of the Syrian government will usher in a new era where different ethnic and religious groups can live peacefully under an inclusive new government. Fidan also said his country hopes that a 'new Syria' would maintain good relations with its neighbors and bring stability to the volatile region. 'The developments in Syria yesterday have given us a glimmer of hope,' Fidan said in a speech to Turkish ambassadors. 'We expect international actors, especially the United Nations, to reach out to the Syrian people and support the formation of an inclusive government.' The minister said Turkey would continue to support Syria’s territorial and political unity and work toward the country’s 'prosperity, security and stability.' But Fidan said it was important that the Islamic State group and Kurdish militants do not take advantage of the situation, adding that Turkey 'would work with determination' to prevent Syria from turning into a 'haven for terrorism.' 'Turkey, which has reached out to its Syrian brothers during difficult times, will also be by their side, as the new page opens in Damascus,' Fidan said. 'We believe that the Syrian people will also make good use of this golden opportunity.' Israel says a drone that appears to have originated in Yemen hit a city in central Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said Monday that a drone that appeared to have originated in Yemen slammed into a city in central Israel. Video posted by Israeli news sites showed a large burst of smoke erupting from a high-rise apartment building. The military said sirens were not sounded to warn of the incoming drone. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Iran-backed militants in Yemen have been attacking Israel since Hamas’ assault on southern Israel in October 2023. Their drones have at times evaded Israel’s sophisticated aerial defense system. Turkey-backed forces take full control of Syrian city from U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led force ANKARA, Turkey — The Turkish-backed forces known as the Syrian National Army launched an offensive against the Syrian Democratic Forces in the northern Syrian city of Manbij on Dec. 6, days after expelling SDF fighters from the city of Tal Rifaat. Turkish security officials said Monday that 'control of Manbij has been secured,' without providing further details. The officials provided the information on condition of anonymity, in line with Turkish regulations. Turkey views the SDF, which is primarily composed of a Syrian Kurdish militia group, as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, and a terrorist organization. The force, however, has been a key partner of the United States in the fight against the Islamic State group. Separately, the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement on Monday that a Turkish drone strike in the village of al-Mistriha north of Raqqa in eastern Syria killed 12 civilians, including six children. Top aide to Assad's brother found dead, war monitor says BEIRUT — A Syrian opposition war monitor says a top aide to the brother of Syria’s ousted president was found dead in his office near the capital, Damascus. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Maj. Gen. Ali Mahmoud, who was in charge of Maher Assad’s office, had led a 2018 military campaign in southern Syria. A video that circulated on social media allegedly showed Mahmoud covered in blood while sitting on a chair. His clothes appear to have been set on fire. It was not clear if he was killed by Maher Assad or he committed suicide, the observatory’s chief Rami Abdurrahman said. Maher Assad was in charge of the army’s 4th Armored Division which played a major role in Syria’s conflict since it began in March 2011. Israel says it has struck suspected chemical weapons sites and long-range rockets in Syria JERUSALEM — Israel’s foreign minister says the strikes were to prevent them from falling into the hands of hostile actors. Gideon Saar said Monday that 'the only interest we have is the security of Israel and its citizens.' 'That’s why we attacked strategic weapons systems, like, for example, remaining chemical weapons, or long-range missiles and rockets so that they will not fall in the hands of extremists.' Syrian prime min ister says Cabinet working to ensure smooth transition of power DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s prime minister says most Cabinet ministers who are in Damascus are performing their duties from their offices to promote security and that food and medicine are available to the public. 'We are working so that the transitional period is quick and smooth,' Mohammed Ghazi Jalali told Sky News Arabia TV station on Monday. The government is working with insurgents, Jalali said, adding that he is ready to meet their leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who heads the jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Israeli strikes kill 6 in central Gaza, Palestinian officials say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes in the central Gaza Strip overnight killed at least six people, including a woman, Palestinian medical officials said Monday. Among the dead were Raed Ghabaien, who was released from Israeli detention in 2014, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the casualties were taken. He was killed along with his wife when an Israeli strike hit their tent in the central town of Zuweida, the hospital records showed. Two other people were killed in a strike that hit their house late Sunday in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp. Another two were killed in a strike in the Wadi Gaza area early Monday. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital’s morgue. Mourners held funeral services Monday morning for the six dead and nine others who were killed in a strike the previous day in the urban refugee camp of Bureij. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in the Gaza since the start of the war, according to local health authorities. They say most of the dead are women and children but do not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel says it only strikes militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in residential areas. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250, including older adults and children. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. US Central Command forces launch airstrikes in central Syria TAMPA, Fla. – U.S. Central Command says its forces launched dozens of airstrikes targeting Islamic State group camps and operatives in central Syria. The strikes on Sunday were intended to 'disrupt, degrade, and defeat ISIS, in order to prevent the terrorist group from conducting external operations and to ensure that ISIS does not seek to take advantage of the current situation to reconstitute in central Syria,' it said in a statement. The airstrikes hit over 75 targets using B-52s, F-15s and A-10s, it said, noting that damage assessments were underway and there were no indications of civilian casualties. Japanese official says Tokyo is ‘gravely worried’ about situation in Middle East TOKYO — Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi says Tokyo is watching recent development in Syria 'with serious interest,' while hoping for an improvement in human rights conditions for the Syrian people. 'Japan is gravely worried about large number of deaths among citizens and strongly concerned about further worsening of the humanitarian conditions,' Hayashi said Monday. He added that Japan is 'hopeful' that the latest developments could lead to an improvement in the situation. New Zealand foreign minister calls for ‘peaceful transition’ in Syria WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters says his country is closely following developments related to the collapse of former President Bashar Assad’s government in Syria. 'This was a regime that perpetrated significant human rights abuses, including repeated chemical weapons attacks, against its own people for many years,' Peters said in a statement issued on Monday. 'Now we need to see a peaceful transition with civilians protected and UN Security Council resolutions upheld. This is critical for moving towards a sustainable and comprehensive political solution.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-news-9-december-2024-0a5c8edb3a7dc438f8407f44a0fd7154	2024-12-08T22:40:02-08:00	
Netanyahu is set to take the witness stand for the first time in his corruption trial in Israel	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to take to the witness stand Tuesday for the first time in his trial on corruption allegations, a pivotal point in the drawn-out proceedings that comes as the leader wages war in Gaza and faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes charges. At home, Netanyahu is on trial for accusations of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate affairs. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing, but his appearance on the witness stand will be a low point in his decades-long political career, standing in contrast to the image of a sophisticated, respected leader he has tried to cultivate. The trial will take up a chunk of Netanyahu's time at a crucial point for Israel. While he makes his case for weeks from the stand, he will still be tasked with managing the war in Gaza, maintaining a fragile ceasefire with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and keeping tabs on threats from the wider Middle East, including Iran. It will be the first time an Israeli prime minister has taken the stand as a criminal defendant, and Netanyahu has repeatedly sought to delay the proceedings, citing the ongoing Gaza war and security concerns. The judges ordered the trial to resume Tuesday, moving the proceedings to an underground chamber in a Tel Aviv court as a security precaution. Netanyahu's appearance in the courtroom will also draw attention to other legal issues in the Israeli leader's orbit. Close advisers in his office are embroiled in a separate series of scandals surrounding leaked classified information and doctored documents. While Netanyahu is not suspected of direct involvement in those, they could weaken his public image. Here is a look at the ongoing trial. Where does Netanyahu's trial stand? The trial, which began in 2020, involves three separate cases in which prosecutors say Netanyahu exchanged regulatory favors with media titans for favorable press coverage and advanced the personal interests of a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for lavish gifts. Prosecutors have called roughly 140 witnesses to the stand — fewer than the 300 initially expected to testify. Those witnesses have included some of Netanyahu's closest former confidants who turned against him, as well as a former prime minister, former security chiefs and media personalities. Lawyers have submitted thousands of items of evidence -- recordings, police documents, text messages. A new documentary, 'The Bibi Files,' has shined new light on the cases by obtaining footage of Netanyahu being questioned by police, as well as interrogations of his wife and some key witnesses. In a glimpse of what can be expected in the courtroom, Netanyahu appears both combative and anxious at times, accusing police of unfairly picking on him and denigrating other witnesses as liars. The prosecution called to the stand its final witness over the summer, bringing to an end three years of testimony and setting the stage for the defense to lay out its case, with Netanyahu its first witness. Netanyahu’s appearance will give Israelis a chance to see the long-serving Israeli leader answer to the charges before the three-judge panel. What are some notable moments from Netanyahu's trial? The prosecution has sought to portray Netanyahu as media-obsessed, to push its narrative that he would break the law for favorable coverage. Witness accounts have shed light not only on the three cases but also on sensational details about Netanyahu’s character and his family’s reputation for living lavishly on the backs of taxpayers and wealthy supporters. One former aide and a key prosecution witness called him a 'control freak' over his image. Another witness described expensive gifts for Netanyahu and his wife. Arnon Milchan, an Israeli producer of Hollywood blockbuster films such as 'Pretty Woman,' took the stand last year by videoconference, describing how he routinely delivered tens of thousands of dollars of champagne, cigars and other gifts requested by the Israeli leader. One key witness, a former top aide to Netanyahu, stunned prosecutors by backtracking from his earlier claims against the prime minister, opening the door for the defense to erode his credibility as a witness. The trial was jolted by Israeli media reports that police used sophisticated phone-hacking software to spy on this witness. What happens next in Netanyahu's trial? The prosecution formally rested its case in July, and the court recessed for the summer and fall. The defense has repeatedly asked for delays in Netanyahu's testimony, which have mostly been denied. Like other witnesses, Netanyahu will testify three days a week, for hours at a time, and his testimony is expected to last weeks. The defense will seek to depict Netanyahu as a law-abiding leader who was a victim of careless and biased police investigations. Netanyahu's critics have sought to draw a clear line between the cases and the war in Gaza. They say the allegations led Netanyahu to promote a contentious judicial overhaul plan last year that bitterly divided the country and created an image of weakness that encouraged the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that triggered the war. Netanyahu’s critics, including families of hostages held by Hamas, now accuse him of dragging out the conflict — and risking the lives of their loved ones — to avoid an embarrassing investigation and new elections that could force him from power. If he is eventually voted out of power, being away from the prime minister’s seat would make it harder for Netanyahu to rail against the justice system and delegitimize the verdict in the eyes of the public. A verdict isn’t expected until 2026 — at least — and then Netanyahu can choose to appeal to the Supreme Court. Israel's courts are notoriously sluggish, and the case was further delayed last year when courts went on hiatus for two months after war broke out following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Once the defense rests, each side will summarize their cases before judges convene to deliberate over Netanyahu's fate.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-corruption-trial-gaza-war-a84a5a2743d111bb13982be3a4a1ea7b	2024-12-08T21:53:49-08:00	
Landslides and flash floods hit Indonesia’s Java island, leaving 10 dead and 2 missing	SUKABUMI, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian rescuers recovered 10 bodies that were swept away in flash floods or buried under tons of mud and rocks that hit hilly villages on the country’s main island of Java, officials said Monday. Two people are still missing. Torrential rains since last week have caused rivers to burst their banks, tearing through more than 170 villages in Sukabumi district of West Java province, as mud, rocks and trees tumbled down mountainside hamlets, said Lt. Col. Yudi Hariyanto, who heads a rescue command post in Sukabumi. Landslides, flash floods and strong winds devastated 172 villages and forced more than 3,000 people to flee to temporary government shelters, Hariyanto said. Authorities have warned nearly 1,000 people to evacuate as more than 400 houses are threatened by extreme weather. The disasters also destroyed 31 bridges, 81 roads and 539 hectares (1,332 acres) of rice fields, while 1,170 houses were flooded up to the roof. Extreme weather has also damaged more than 3,300 other houses and buildings, the local Disaster Management Agency said. Rescue workers on Monday pulled out 10 bodies in the worst-hit villages of Tegalbuleud, Simpenan and Ciemas, including three children, and rescuers are searching for two villagers who are reportedly still missing, Hariyanto said. Videos circulating on social media showed flash floods caused by heavy downpours in Sukabumi swept away almost everything in their path, including cars, motorbikes, buffaloes and cows. Footage released by West Java's Search and Rescue Agency showed roads that were transformed into murky brown rivers and villages covered by thick mud, rocks and uprooted trees as soldiers, police and rescue workers pulled mud-caked bodies from a devastated hamlet. Seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains. Last month, a landslide and flash floods triggered by heavy downpours hit Indonesia’s North Sumatra province, leaving 20 dead and two missing. A landslide in the region also hit a tourist bus that killed nine people. ___ Karmini reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-west-java-rain-landslide-flash-floods-cd3ea5fb6ae47b53aa87ba307c73a4c3	2024-12-08T21:41:30-08:00	
Russia has used its hypersonic Oreshnik missile for the first time. What are its capabilities?	The silent black-and-white surveillance camera video of the Russian missile attack in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro was brief but chilling: Six huge fireballs pierced the darkness and slammed into the ground at astonishing speed. Within hours of the Nov. 21 attack on the military facility, Russian President Vladimir Putin took the rare step of speaking on national TV to boast about the new, hypersonic missile. He warned the West that its next use could be against Ukraine’s NATO allies who allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Putin said the missile was called the 'Oreshnik' — Russian for 'hazelnut tree.' A look at the weapon, how it fits into Moscow's battle plan and what political message Russia wants to send by using it: What's known about the Oreshnik? A satisfied smile played across Putin's face as he described how the Oreshnik streaks to its target at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, 'like a meteorite,' and claimed it was immune to any missile defense system. Ukrainian military officials said it reached Mach 11. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, head of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, said the Oreshnik could carry nuclear or conventional warheads and has a range to reach any European target. The Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia's RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. The attack marked the first time such a weapon was used in a war. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019. Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate said the missile had six warheads, each carrying six submunitions. Its payload of independently targetable warheads, like a cluster of hazelnuts growing on a tree, could be the inspiration for the missile's name. Video of the attack appeared to show six warheads surrounded by clouds of plasma raining down in a fiery descent. The six submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives. Putin claimed the weapon is so powerful that using several such missiles — even fitted with conventional warheads — could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. It’s capable of destroying underground bunkers 'three, four or more floors down,' he boasted, threatening to use it against the government district in Kyiv. Ukraine’s Security Service showed The Associated Press wreckage of the missile -- charred, mangled wires and an ashen airframe — at Dnipro's Pivdenmash plant that built missiles when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. There were no fatalities in the attack, and authorities haven’t described the damage to the plant. They said the missile was fired from the 4th Missile Test Range of Kapustin Yar in Russia’s Astrakhan region on the Caspian Sea. What other missiles has Russia used? Russia has used an assortment of missiles to pummel Ukraine since the start of its invasion in February 2022, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik. They included subsonic long-range cruise missiles that carry about 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of explosives, enough to inflict a significant damage to Ukrainian power plants and other key infrastructure. The winged, jet-propelled cruise missiles have a range of up to 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles), able to reach all of Ukraine. Russia also used swarms of inexpensive, Iranian-designed drones that carry only about 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of explosives. The slow-flying drones are relatively easy to intercept, but Russia used dozens of them at a time to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses and divert attention from simultaneously launched cruise missiles. For some priority targets, Russia has used faster and harder-hitting missiles, including the ground-launched Iskander short-range ballistic missile with a range of 500 kilometers (310 miles). For particularly important targets, Moscow has used the hypersonic Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile. Its high speed — able to briefly reach Mach 10 — and ability to maneuver in flight helps it evade air defenses, although Ukraine claims to have shot down a few of them. Oreshnik is even more difficult to intercept than Kinzhal. It can inflict significantly heavier damage because of its multiple high-energy warheads. What message is Putin sending with the Oreshnik? Putin described the Oreshnik as a response to the U.S. and U.K. allowing Ukraine to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory, a move he said gave 'elements of a global character' to the conflict. 'We believe that we have the right to use our weapons against military facilities of the countries that allow to use their weapons against our facilities,' he said. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Putin’s Security Council, said Oreshnik could reach targets in Europe within minutes, inflicting 'catastrophic' damage. 'Bomb shelters will not save you,' he posted on his messaging app channel. Russian state media extolled the Oreshnik, claiming it will take just 11 minutes to reach an air base in Poland and 17 minutes to reach NATO’s headquarters in Brussels. T-shirts have appeared with images of Putin and the Oreshnik, and he was told at a briefing that a couple planned to name their daughter after the missile. Military expert Mathieu Boulègue of Chatham House in Britain said that while the Oreshnik isn’t a game-changer on the battlefield, 'in terms of psychological warfare, it works great' in serving the Kremlin’s goal to scare a Western audience. The Nov. 21 attack came two days after Putin signed a revised version of Russia’s nuclear doctrine, which lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons. The doctrine allows for a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. The use of the Oreshnik was an expression of Moscow’s anger at the use of longer-range Western missiles and a signal to Ukraine and President-elect Donald Trump that Russia was going to pursue its goals, regardless of the support for Kyiv, said James J. Townsend, senior fellow at the Center for New American Security. 'This is a very powerful message being sent,' Townsend said. 'It’s showing Trump how serious Russia looks on what the Biden administration has been doing and how seriously they look on and how angry they are about this type of assistance.' Putin’s warning about potential strikes on NATO assets follows calls by Russian hawks for such attacks to force Ukraine’s allies to back down. Unlike other Russian conventional weapons with a shorter range, Oreshnik offers the capability to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether Oreshnik carries a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target. 'The enemy must understand that we are ready to take the most resolute steps and strike the territory of NATO members with conventional weapons first,' said Sergei Karaganov, a political expert who advises the Kremlin. 'At the same time, we will warn them that if they respond to that attack in an escalatory way, a nuclear strike would come second, and a third wave will target American bases.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-oreshnik-hypersonic-missile-putin-ukraine-war-345588a399158b9eb0b56990b8149bd9	2024-12-08T20:26:56-08:00	
Fishing boat capsizes after colliding with sand barge in South Korea, killing 7	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A fishing boat capsized after colliding with a sand barge in waters off South Korea’s southeastern coast early Monday, leaving seven crew members dead and one missing, according to local coast guard and fire departments. The 29-ton fishing boat, which had eight passengers, three South Koreans and five Indonesian nationals, capsized after colliding with a 456-ton barge in waters near the city of Gyeongju, according to Kim Eul-dong, an official at the Pohang coast guard. Dozens of emergency workers, along with 15 coast guard vessels and six helicopters, were mobilized to search for the missing passenger, who was Indonesian. None of the passengers from the barge were hurt.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-capsized-fishing-boat-gyeongju-199c41bc8863dae87ea85c9c41439f8e	2024-12-08T20:25:11-08:00	
2 men are standing trial on charges they chopped down Britain's scenic Sycamore Gap tree	LONDON (AP) — It was neither Britain’s biggest tree nor its oldest. But the majestic sycamore that stood for 150 years along a stretch of Hadrian’s Wall in northern England was one of the most beloved. Perched symmetrically in a dip between two hills, the Sycamore Gap tree had been the site of first kisses, wedding proposals and even a place where the ashes of loved ones were scattered. When local residents and admirers woke to the news last fall that it had been cut down in the dark of night, they wanted to know why and who could have committed such a senseless act. On Monday, prosecutors are expected to start providing those answers. Two men are scheduled to go on trial in Newcastle Crown Court on charges related to toppling the tree and damaging the ancient wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire. Little has been said about the case, including a possible motive, to protect the integrity of the trial and rights of the accused. Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, have pleaded not guilty to two counts each of criminal damage. Prosecutors said the value of the tree exceeded 620,000 pounds ($790,000) and damage to the wall was assessed at 1,100 pounds ($1,400). 'This is a case that will be instantly recognizable to you, indeed anyone hearing the charges read out,' prosecutor Rebecca Brown said at a court appearance for the two men in May. 'The prosecution say the tree was deliberately felled on Sept. 28 last year and the resultant fall damaged Hadrian’s Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,' Brown said. 'The prosecution say these defendants are responsible as part of a joint enterprise.' Word of the tree's demise spread swiftly and the impact reverberated through the wild and scenic Northumberland region. 'I still can’t come to terms with the fact that the tree’s not there,' said Catherine Cape, who lives nearby. 'I am still really angry about it. I can’t understand why you would want to destroy something so beautiful.' The tree became famous after being featured in Kevin Costner’s 1991 film 'Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves,' and was a big draw for tourism. Before the tree was cut down, about 80% of the inquiries at Northumberland National Park 's main visitors center were from people planning to walk to the tree, the park's chief executive, Tony Gates, said after the tree was cut down. The sycamore’s broad canopy framed between two hills had long been a popular draw for landscape photographers and a scenic stop for walkers on the path along the wall. Cape walked to the tree on her first and second dates with her future husband. They later watched their daughter take her first steps there. And after her mother and sister both died in 2020, she met her brother-in-law and nephews there when they couldn’t gather indoors during the COVID-19 lockdown. The tree was a huge draw for the guests that stayed at a small cabin Cape owns. Bookings dropped off after the tree was downed but they have largely rebounded. She used to drive past the tree two or three days a week but now takes the highway instead because she doesn't like to see the empty space on the hillside where it stood. The sycamore was removed with a crane and taken to a National Trust property for storage. A section of the trunk went on display at the park visitor center this fall and seeds from the tree that were used to grow saplings are being donated for planting around the U.K. In time, the tree itself may grow back. More than two dozens shoots were discovered sprouting from the stump. 'The tree does still live on, but just not in the form that it was,' Cape said. 'We’ll never see it in our lifetime grow into a tree, or what it was before.'	https://apnews.com/article/sycamore-gap-tree-northumberland-trial-3c65e5416be23dbf2afebefed362345e	2024-12-08T20:12:24-08:00	
Syrian rebels free prisoners from Assad's notorious dungeons who celebrate in Damascus streets	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Bashar Barhoum woke in his dungeon prison cell in Damascus at dawn Sunday, thinking it would be the last day of his life. The 63-year-old writer was supposed to have been executed after being imprisoned for seven months. But he soon realized the men at the door weren't from former Syrian President Bashar Assad ’s notorious security forces, ready to take him to his death. Instead, they were rebels coming to set him free. As the insurgents swept across Syria in just 10 days to bring an end to the Assad family’s 50-year rule, they broke into prisons and security facilities to free political prisoners and many of the tens of thousands of people who disappeared since the conflict began back in 2011. Barhoum was one of those freed who were celebrating in Damascus. 'I haven’t seen the sun until today,' Barhoum told The Associated Press after walking in disbelief through the streets of Damascus. 'Instead of being dead tomorrow, thank God, he gave me a new lease of life.' Barhoum couldn’t find his cellphone and belongings in the prison so set off to find a way to tell his wife and daughters that he’s alive and well. Videos shared widely across social media showed dozens of prisoners running in celebration after the insurgents released them, some barefoot and others wearing little clothing. One of them screams in celebration after he finds out that the government has fallen. Torture, executions and starvation in Syria's prisons Syria's prisons have been infamous for their harsh conditions. Torture is systematic, say human rights groups, whistleblowers, and former detainees. Secret executions have been reported at more than two dozen facilities run by Syrian intelligence, as well as at other sites. In 2013, a Syrian military defector, known as 'Caesar,' smuggled out over 53,000 photographs that human rights groups say showed clear evidence of rampant torture, but also disease and starvation in Syria's prison facilities. Syria’s feared security apparatus and prisons did not only serve to isolate Assad’s opponents, but also to instill fear among his own people said Lina Khatib, Associate Fellow in the Middle East and North Africa program at the London think tank Chatham House. 'Anxiety about being thrown in one of Assad’s notorious prisons created wide mistrust among Syrians,' Khatib said. 'Assad nurtured this culture of fear to maintain control and crush political opposition.' Just north of Damascus in the Saydnaya military prison, known as the 'human slaughterhouse,' women detainees, some with their children, screamed as men broke the locks off their cell doors. Amnesty International and other groups say that dozens of people were secretly executed every week in Saydnaya, estimating that up to 13,000 Syrians were killed between 2011 and 2016. 'Don’t be afraid … Bashar Assad has fallen! Why are you afraid?' said one of the rebels as he tried to rush streams of women out of their jam-packed tiny cells. Tens of thousands of detainees have so far been freed, said Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based pro-opposition war monitor. Over the past 10 days, insurgents freed prisoners in cities including Aleppo, Homs, Hama as well as Damascus. Families seek loved ones who have been missing for years Omar Alshogre, who was detained for three years and survived relentless torture, watched in awe from his home far from Syria as videos showed dozens of detainees fleeing. 'A hundred democracies in the world had done nothing to help them, and now a few military groups came down and broke open prison after prison,' Alshogre, a human rights advocate who now resides in Sweden and the U.S., told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, families of detainees and the disappeared skipped celebrations of the downfall of the Assad dynasty. Instead, they waited outside prisons and security branch centers, hoping their loved ones would be there. They had high expectations for the newcomers who will now run the battered country. 'This happiness will not be completed until I can see my son out of prison and know where he is,' said Bassam Masri. 'I have been searching for him for two hours. He has been detained for 13 years,' since the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011. Rebels struggled to control the chaos as crowds gathered by the Court of Justice in Damascus. Heba, who only gave her first name while speaking to the AP, said she was looking for her brother and brother-in-law who were detained while reporting a stolen car in 2011 and hadn't been seen since. 'They took away so many of us,' said Heba, whose mother’s cousin also disappeared. 'We know nothing about them ... They (the Assad government) burned our hearts.' ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut. Associated Press writers Sarah El-Deeb and Ghaith Alsayed in Damascus contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-prisons-human-rights-detainees-saydnaya-982edfde78e852431d94f3f1a51b26ba	2024-12-08T20:11:22-08:00	
Emilia Pérez' leads Golden Globe nominations with 10, followed by 'The Brutalist' and 'Conclave'	Jacques Audiard’s audacious musical 'Emilia Pérez,' about a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirming surgery to become a woman, led nominations to the 82nd Golden Globes on Monday, scoring 10 nods to lead it over other contenders like the musical smash 'Wicked,' the papal thriller 'Conclave' and the post-war epic 'The Brutalist.' The nominations for Globes, which will be televised by CBS and streamed on Paramount+ on Jan. 5, were announced on Monday morning by Mindy Kaling and Morris Chestnut. The embattled Globes, which are no longer presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are still in comeback mode after years of scandal and organizational upheaval. Working in the Globes favor this year: a especially starry field of nominees. Zendaya, Timothée Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Glen Powell and Selena Gomez all scored nominations. The young Donald Trump drama 'The Apprentice' also landed nominations for its two central performances, by Sebastian Stan as Trump and Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn. The president elect has called 'The Apprentice' a 'politically disgusting hatchet job' made by 'human scum.' How much the recent president election will figure into Hollywood's awards season remains to be seen. In the season's first awards ceremony, the Gotham Awards, Trump went unmentioned but sometimes alluded to. Stan also received a nomination Monday for the dark comedy 'A Different Man.' While 'Oppenheimer' and, to a lesser degree, 'Barbie,' sailed into the Globes nominations as the clear heavyweights of awards season, no such frontrunner has emerged this year. The Globes don’t often align with the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, a much larger group that far more closely reflects the film industry. But they can give movies a major boost, and ripe fodder for their awards marketing. Following 'Emilia Pérez,' Brady Corbet’s 'The Brutalist' landed seven nominations, including best picture, drama, and acting nods for Adrian Brody and Guy Pearce. The soon-to-be-released film, from A24, is uncommonly ambitious, with a runtime of three-and-a-half hours, including an intermission. Close behind it was Edward Berger’s 'Conclave,' starring Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal tasked with leading the conclave to elect a new pope. It landed six nominations, including best picture, drama, and acting nods for Fiennes and Isabella Rossellini. Sean Baker's Palme d'Or-winning 'Anora,' starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn sex worker who marries the son of a Russian Oligarch, was nominated for five awards, including best picture, comedy or musical, and best female actor for Madison and best supporting actor for Yura Borisov. The Golden Globes will be hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser, who scored her own nomination for best stand-up special. CBS, which began airing the Globes last year on a new deal, will hope Glaser manages to do better than last year’s emcee, Jo Koy, whose stint was widely panned. Here’s details from the nominations: Who are this year's Globes nominees? The nominees for best motion picture drama are: 'The Brutalist'; 'A Complete Unknown,'; 'Conclave'; 'Dune: Part Two'; 'Nickel Boys;' 'September 5.' The nominees for best film musical or comedy are: 'Wicked'; 'Anora'; 'Emilia Pérez'; 'Challengers'; 'A Real Pain'; 'The Substance.' The nominees for best male actor in a motion picture musical or comedy are: Jesse Eisenberg, 'A Real Pain'; Hugh Grant, 'Heretic'; Gabriel LaBelle, 'Saturday Night; Jesse Plemons, 'Kinds of Kindness'’ Glen Powell, 'Hitman'; Sebastian Stan, 'A Different Man.' The nominees for best animated film are: 'Flow'; 'Inside Out 2'; 'Memoir of a Snail'; 'Moana 2'; 'Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl'; 'The Wild Robot.' The nominees for cinematic and box office achievement are: 'Alien: Romulus'; Beetlejuice Beetlejuice'; Deadpool &amp; Wolverine'; 'Gladiator II'; 'Inside Out 2'; 'Twisters'; 'Wicked'; 'The Wild Robot.' The nominees for best original score: 'Conclave'; 'The Brutalist'; 'The Wild Robot'; 'Emilia Pérez'; 'Challengers'; 'Dune: Part Two.' How about the TV categories? The nominees for best television drama are: 'Shogun'; 'The Diplomat'; 'Slow Horses'; 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith'; 'The Day of the Jackal'; 'Squid Game.' The nominees for TV series (comedy or musical) are: 'Abbott Elementary'; 'The Bear; 'Hacks'; 'Nobody Wants This'; 'Only Murders in the Building'; 'The Gentlemen.' The nominees for best male actor in a drama series are: Donald Glover, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith'; Jake Gyllenhaal, 'Presumed Innocent'; Gary Oldman, 'Slow Horses'; Eddie Redmayne, 'The Day of the Jackal'; Hiroyuki Sanada, 'Shogun'; Billy Bob Thornton, 'Landman.' The nominees for female actor in a comedy series are: Kristen Bell, 'Nobody wants This'; Quinta Brunson, 'Abbott Elementary'; Ayo Edebiri, 'The Bear'; Selena Gomez, 'Only Murders in the Building'; Kathryn Hahn, 'Agatha All Along'; Jean Smart, 'Hacks.' What’s new this year? Last year, the Globes introduced two new categories that remain this time around: the cinematic and box office achievement award and the best performance in stand-up comedy on television. One tweak this time comes in the lifetime achievement awards. This year, those are going to Ted Danson (for the Carol Burnett Award) and Viola Davis (for the Cecil B. DeMille Award). Those will be handed out in a gala dinner on Friday, Jan. 3, several days before the Globes. What’s the deal with the Golden Globes, anyway? The Globes aren’t ever quite drama-free, but things have settled down for the embattled awards body. Last year’s Globes were the first after the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and their acquisition by Dick Clark Productions and billionaire Todd Boehly’s private equity firm Eldridge Industries. However, earlier this fall, the Ankler reported that former members of the HFPA filed a letter with the California Attorney General’s office questioning 'the validity of the purchase.' ___ For more coverage of the 2025 Golden Globe Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/golden-globe-awards	https://apnews.com/article/golden-globes-nominations-2025-84e022069bd2083252c08918242cf7f9	2024-12-08T20:07:42-08:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mixed as oil prices jump following ouster of Syria's Assad	BANGKOK (AP) — World shares were mixed and oil prices jumped Monday after the weekend overthrow of Syrian leader Bashar Assad, who sought asylum in Moscow after rebels ended the Assad family’s 50 years of iron rule. That added to uncertainty in a region fraught with conflict. U.S. benchmark crude oil jumped 75 cents to $67.95 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard gained 69 cents to $71.81 per barrel. In early European trading, Germany's DAX fell 0.3% to 20,322.32, while the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.3% to 7,448.45. Britain's FTSE 100 edged 0.2% higher. The future for the S&amp;P 500 edged 0.1% lower while that for the Dow was unchanged. Hong Kong shares bounced higher after top Chinese leaders met and agreed on a 'moderately loose' monetary policy, shifting away from a more cautious 'prudent' stance for the first time in 10 years. Chinese shares were mixed, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rebounding from early losses to gain 2.8% to 20,414.09. The Shanghai Composite index fell less than 0.1% to 3,402.53. Investors took heart from the state media’s readout from a meeting of the ruling Communist Party’s Politburo that pledged more support for the sluggish economy. A major planning meeting later this week is expected to set the policy agenda for coming months, possibly bringing fresh stimulus for the world’s No. 2 economy. The Kospi in Seoul slumped 2.8% to 2,360.58. South Korea’s political situation remained tense as local media reported that the police were considering imposing an overseas travel ban on President Yoon Suk Yeol. Yoon’s status was uncertain after he declared martial law last week in the midst of a budget dispute and then reversed that hours later. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index edged 0.2% higher, to 39,160.50 after the government reported that the economy expanded at a 1.2% annual rate in July to September, higher than the initial estimate of 0.9% growth. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 was nearly unchanged at 8,423.00. India's Sensex shed 0.3%, while Taiwan's Taiex gained 0.3%. In Bangkok, the SET declined 0.3%. On Friday, U.S. stocks rose to records after data suggested the job market remains solid enough to keep the economy going, but not strong enough to raise immediate worries about inflation. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.2% to 6,090.27, just enough to log another all-time high, closing a third straight winning week in what looks to be one of its best years since the 2000 dot-com bust. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.3% to 44,642.52, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.8% to set its own record of 19,859.77. The jobs report strengthened traders’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in two weeks. It showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected last month, but also said the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. The hope is that the job market can help U.S. shoppers continue to spend and keep the U.S. economy out of a recession that had earlier seemed inevitable after the Fed began hiking interest rates swiftly to crush inflation. A report on Friday suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers may be improving more than economists expected. The preliminary reading from the University of Michigan’s survey hit its highest level in seven months. The survey found a surge in buying for some products as consumers tried to get ahead of possible increases in price due to higher tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened. In tech, Hewlett Packard Enterprise jumped 10.6% for one of the S&amp;P 500’s larger gains after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected. Tech stocks were some of the market’s strongest this week, as Salesforce and other big companies talked up how much of a boost they’re getting from the artificial-intelligence boom. In other dealings early Friday, Bitcoin was sitting near $98,300 after bursting above $103,000 to a record the day before. The euro rose to $1.0583 from $1.0561. The dollar was trading at 150.44 yen early Monday, up from 150.07 yen.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-korea-inflation-syria-2cf5e3044843320565fae24dd99d2ca8	2024-12-08T20:02:22-08:00	
Morocco produces Africa’s first mpox tests as the continent tries to rely less on imports	TAMESNA, Morocco (AP) — After African countries struggled to get testing kits during the COVID-19 pandemic, officials vowed to make the continent less dependent on imported medical supplies. Now, in a first for Africa, a Moroccan company is filling orders for mpox tests as an outbreak continues. Moroccan startup Moldiag began developing mpox tests after the World Health Organization declared the virus a global emergency in August. Africa’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported more than 59,000 mpox cases and 1,164 deaths in 20 countries this year. The WHO has also announced a plan to provide mpox tests, vaccines and treatments to the most vulnerable people in the world’s poorest countries, after facing criticism for moving too slowly on vaccines. It recommends all suspected mpox cases be tested. But in some far-flung areas of the mpox outbreak, tests have to be delivered to distant labs for processing. Most of Congo’s 26 provinces don’t have such facilities. And some areas have no tests. In eastern Congo’s South Kivu province, doctors are still diagnosing patients by taking temperatures and looking for visible symptoms. That makes it difficult to tell how the virus is spreading, health officials say. 'This is a major problem,' said Musole Robert, medical director of the Kavumu Referral Hospital, one of the few treating mpox patients in eastern Congo. 'The main issue remains the laboratory, which is not adequately equipped.' Mpox primarily spreads through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions. A health worker swabs the rash and sends the sample to a lab. Mpox testing is critical because many symptoms resemble diseases like chicken pox or measles. When mpox cases were found in some Western countries like the United States in 2022, some companies began developing rapid test kits that don’t require lab processing. But they shelved those efforts when the virus was largely contained. Then outbreaks emerged again in Africa. Scientists are concerned by the spread of a new version of the disease that might be more easily transmitted among people. Morocco has reported three mpox cases, though most have been in central Africa. At his factory in Morocco, Moldiag founder and chief scientific officer Abdeladim Moumen said the tests they make — sold for $5 each — can help to remedy shortages affordably. The company last month began accepting orders from Burundi, Uganda and Congo and has also sold them to Senegal and Nigeria as well. 'It’s rather easy to send tests from an African nation to another one rather than waiting for tests to come in from China or Europe,' Moumen said. Moldiag was founded out of Morocco’s Foundation for Advanced Science, Innovation and Research, a university-affiliated nonprofit whose research has received funding from the European Commission and Morocco’s government. The startup previously developed similar genetic tests for COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Moldiag won approval to distribute its mpox tests from the Africa CDC in November. But it hasn't submitted paperwork to be considered for expedited approval from the WHO, which during this outbreak has approved three mpox tests and is considering five others. Each is made in North America, Europe or Asia. The Africa CDC’s acting director for laboratory diagnostics and systems, Yenew Tebeje, said the organization created a process to accelerate approval of tests like Moldiag’s because the WHO’s approval process can take months or years and 'be a limiting factor for access to diagnostics.' Historically, international institutions have not always ensured medical supplies like tests are quickly made available for crises in Africa, Tebeje added. Only mpox tests that require laboratory processing have been approved by the WHO and Africa CDC, which has expressed the need for rapid tests that don't need to be sent to labs. Moldiag and other companies are working to develop rapid tests and pursue approval. Moldiag's $5 price for the current tests aligns with recommendations from both the WHO's target product standards and demands of health advocates who have criticized the cost of other tests. The nonprofit Public Citizen last month called on Cepheid — one of the WHO's three approved mpox test manufacturers — to reduce its price from about $20 to $5, citing a Doctors Without Borders analysis showing genetic tests can be produced for less. Africa-based manufacturing fulfills a primary objective that African Union member states agreed on after the COVID-19 pandemic, which revealed global disparities and unequal access to medical supplies, including vaccines, tests and antiviral medications. In 2022, shaken by the pandemic, African leaders called for action to address those disparities plaguing the continent's over 1.4 billion people, who experience the highest incidence of public health emergencies. Moumen said experts were waking up to the fact that it makes more sense for tests to come from regions where outbreaks are taking place so manufacturers can tailor production to address issues close to home. 'They want African tests for Africa,' he said. ___ Alonga reported from Goma, Congo.

Australian synagogue fire declared terrorism in a decision that increases investigation resources	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian law enforcement authorities on Monday declared an arson attack on a synagogue last week a terrorist act in a decision that increases resources available to the investigation. Arson squad detectives have been investigating the blaze that extensively damaged the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne on Friday. But the investigation was taken over on Monday by the Joint Counter-Terrorism Team which involves Victoria state Police and Australian Federal Police as well as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, the nation’s main domestic spy agency. 'The decision ... to transition the Adass Israel Synagogue fire attack to the Victorian Joint Counter-Terrorism Team is a crucial turning point in this investigation,' Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Krissy Barrett told reporters. 'I want to thank Victoria Police investigators for the significant information they have gathered so far, which has helped lead us to believe that this is likely to be a politically motivated attack. This is now a terrorism investigation,' Barrett added. The declaration gave investigators more resources, information and legal powers to pursue the three suspects, police said. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said investigators had made 'significant progress,' but declined to detail that progress. Witnesses reported seeing two masked men spreading a liquid accelerant in the mosque before the fire. Police have not revealed what role the third suspect played. Police have also not revealed if they know the identity of any suspect. The synagogue fire is the first declared terrorist incident in Australia since April when a 16-year-old boy allegedly stabbed a bishop and priest in a Sydney Assyrian church while a service was being streamed online. Some lawmakers had been calling for the arsonists to be charged with terrorism offenses so that they would potentially face longer prison sentences. The blaze is an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and Hamas last year. Cars and buildings have been vandalized and torched around Australia in protests inspired by the war. In a separate initiative, Australian Federal Police announced on Monday the formation of Special Operation Avalite to target antisemiticism around the country. The investigators were brought together in response to arson attacks on the synagogue, Jewish lawmaker Josh Burns' Melbourne office in June and on a car in a Sydney street last month that was related to antisemitic vandalism. 'Special Operation Avalite will be an agile and experienced squad of counter-terrorism investigators who will focus on threats, violence, and hatred towards the Australian Jewish community and parliamentarians,' Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said. Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, who is Jewish, said his government was striving to make the Jewish community 'feel safe.' 'We’ve experienced in Australia, in the last year, the highest level of antisemitism that I’ve experienced in my lifetime. That’s a common reaction from members of the Australian Jewish community,' Dreyfus said. The Victoria government on Friday offered 100,000 Australian dollars ($64,300) to help repair the synagogue and said there would be an increased police presence in the area. The federal government on Sunday offered the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, an umbrella body representing more than 200 Jewish organizations, AU$32.5 million ($20.8 million) to enhance security at community sites including synagogues and schools. ___ This story has corrected the Victoria police official’s surname to Patton not Patterson.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-synagogue-fire-melbourne-terrorism-a9b3940618560648504ce48b02fdcd36	2024-12-08T18:52:22-08:00	
South Korean police considering overseas travel ban on President Yoon over martial law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Police are considering placing an overseas travel ban on South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol as they investigate possible rebellion charges over his brief imposition of martial law last week, reports said Monday. Yoon’s martial law decree last Tuesday, which brought armed special forces troops into Seoul streets, is plunging South Korea into huge political turmoil. On Sunday, he avoided an opposition-led bid to impeach him, with most ruling party lawmakers boycotting a floor vote. But the opposition parties vowed to submit a new impeachment motion against him this week. On Monday, Yonhap news agency cited police as saying that they are considering banning Yoon from leaving the country as they investigate charges of rebellion. Other South Korean media carried similar reports. Repeated calls to the National Police Agency weren’t immediately answered. The main opposition Democratic Party called Yoon’s martial law imposition 'unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or a coup.' It has filed complaints with police against at least nine people, including Yoon and the former defense minister, over the alleged rebellion. While the president mostly has immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. South Korean prosecutors on Sunday detained former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who allegedly recommended Yoon declare martial law. He became the first person detained over the martial law case. The Defense Ministry said it has separately suspended three top military commanders over their alleged involvement in imposing martial law. They were among those facing the opposition-raised rebellion allegations. On Saturday, Yoon issued an apology over the martial law decree, saying he won’t shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country’s political turmoil, 'including matters related to my term in office.' Since taking office in 2022 for a single five-year term, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid scandals involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a 'den of criminals' bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.'	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-a196573506375f39d5645843bcf87828	2024-12-08T17:07:09-08:00	
Mbappé speaks to French TV station for first time about reports of a rape investigation in Sweden	PARIS (AP) — Kylian Mbappé says he reacted with disbelief when he saw media reports from Sweden two months ago that he was the subject of a rape investigation. The Real Madrid star spoke about the case publicly for the first time in an interview that aired Sunday on French TV station Canal Plus. Several Swedish media reported in October that Mbappé was the subject of a rape investigation following a visit to Stockholm during time off from playing for Madrid and France. At the time Mbappé's legal team dismissed those reports as false. 'I was surprised and I still am surprised, by the way. These are things that come into your life like that, you can’t see them coming,' Mbappé told Canal Plus. 'It’s just incomprehension. I don't think it weighed on me in the sense that I have never considered myself involved.' Mbappé added that he 'would go' to Sweden if ever he were summoned but that he has not been contacted by authorities. 'Listen, I haven’t received anything, no summons, nothing,' he told Canal Plus. 'The Swedish government has not said anything, so I’m not concerned (involved).' When the reports emerged in October, Swedish authorities confirmed that they were investigating a suspected rape at a Stockholm hotel but didn't name any suspect. A prosecutor told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet late last month that the investigation was still ongoing but didn't give other details. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/mbappe-rape-accusations-sweden-3f9167d659c0ca3ffad736cc3b3f484c	2024-12-08T12:27:31-08:00	
Georgian journalists allege brutal beatings as protests rage against ending EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Tens of thousands of people joined an 11th straight day of protests in Georgia on Sunday after the governing party suspended negotiations on joining the European Union, while a separate demonstration decried violence against Georgian journalists covering the rallies. Police have been using increasing force in their attempts to curb the demonstrations, which have centered on the parliament building in the capital, Tbilisi. Riot police have used water cannons and tear gas every day to disperse the rallies, beating scores of protesters who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital’s central boulevard. At Saturday night’s demonstration, reporter Maka Chikhladze and her colleague from the independent Pirveli TV channel were targeted by a violent mob, Chikhladze told The Associated Press. Chikladze said her colleague managed to capture footage of men dressed in black who were beating demonstrators before they turned on the pair, violently pushing Chikhladze to the ground. She later told AP that her colleague sustained a head injury and had his camera stolen. Chikhladze charged that Georgia’s government was using bands of thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, an allegation denied by representatives of the Georgian Dream party. On Sunday, several hundred media workers marched down Tbilisi’s central Rustaveli Avenue before putting up posters of colleagues they say had been assaulted while doing their jobs. 'Our colleagues are beaten, injured, some remain in hospital in serious condition,' TV Pirveli anchor Ekaterine Mishveladze told AP. In a separate incident Saturday, AP journalists saw several masked men violently tackle a protester attempting to enter the offices of an opposition party, Ahali. The man, Koba Khabazi, lay slumped on the ground while his attackers repeatedly kicked him. He later showed AP his head injuries. Georgian Dream retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 election, a vote widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president, Salome Zourabichvili, have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia’s help and have boycotted parliament sessions. Opposition protests gained new momentum after the Georgian Dream’s decision last Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. Riot police have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the rallies and beat scores of protesters, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on Rustaveli Avenue. The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials. Speaking Thursday at a ministerial conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken denounced what he described as the brutal 'repression of those calling for their country to stay on the path to closer ties with Europe.' Mamuka Mdinanradze, leader of the Georgian Dream party, condemned mob violence against protesters during a news briefing Sunday, and denied any connection with the government. The office of Georgia’s rights ombudsman on Sunday issued a statement criticizing Georgian police for 'failing to take adequate measures' to ensure safety during the demonstrations. President Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, refused to recognize the official election results and contested them before the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal earlier this week. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. The law requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-protest-opposition-police-violence-russia-tbilisi-6c7bf69d66c468c5833d97a60ba3461b	2024-12-08T11:59:42-08:00

Gaza health officials say latest Israeli airstrikes kill at least 14 including children	DEIR AL BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes in central Gaza killed at least 14 people including children Sunday, Palestinian health officials said, while the bombing of a hospital in northern Gaza wounded a half-dozen patients. Israel’s military continues its latest offensive against Hamas militants in northern Gaza, whose remaining Palestinians have been almost completely cut off from the rest of the territory amid a growing humanitarian crisis. One airstrike flattened a residential building in the urban Bureij refugee camp Sunday afternoon, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where the casualties were taken. At least nine people were killed including six children and a woman. An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies at the hospital’s morgue. Earlier on Sunday, another Israeli strike hit a tent in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least five people including two parents and their two children, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said. In northern Gaza, the Health Ministry said a bombing targeted the Indonesian Hospital wounding six patients, one of them seriously. It is the largest hospital north of Gaza City. 'We demand international protection for hospitals, patients and medical staff,' the ministry said in a statement that also urged safe passage to and from hospitals, more medical supplies and fuel and safe evacuation of the wounded. The Israeli military Sunday evening said it was unaware of any attack on the Indonesian Hospital 'in the last three to four hours.' Meanwhile, the military said it briefly closed the key Kerem Shalom crossing after fighters launched mortar shells several meters (feet) from the nearby humanitarian corridor toward its troops. It said Gaza's main cargo crossing was reopened after those who fired were 'eliminated,' though it added that the arrival and distribution of humanitarian aid was delayed. Kerem Shalom is the only crossing between Israel and Gaza that is designed for cargo shipments and has been the main artery for aid since the Rafah crossing with Egypt was shut in May. Last month, nearly two-thirds of aid entering Gaza came through Kerem Shalom. A second cold, rainy winter is beginning in Gaza, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in squalid tent camps and reliant on international aid. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 45,600 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-war-news-20a0d3732f81d88246f446b9e169113e	2024-12-08T09:18:34-08:00	
Cataldi promises hospitalized teammate Bove a goal and delivers as Fiorentina wins 8th straight	ROME (AP) — Danilo Cataldi texted hospitalized Fiorentina teammate Edoardo Bove to say that he would score for him Sunday and then fulfilled his promise in a 1-0 win over Cagliari on Sunday. It was Fiorentina’s first Serie A match since Bove collapsed on the field during a game against Inter Milan last weekend and was placed in a medically induced coma. The 22-year-old has been awake and alert since last Monday as doctors continue to investigate the cause of his collapse. Cataldi found the top corner midway through the first half and that was all Fiorentina needed for its eighth straight win in the Italian league to match the club record set in 1960. After he scored, Cataldi ran toward a TV camera, held up four fingers to match Bove’s No. 4 jersey then created a heart symbol with his fingers as he shouted, 'I told you. I told you.' 'I texted him before the match, saying: ‘Watch the game on TV because I'm going to score a goal into the top corner,’' Cataldi said. 'He said it was ‘impossible.’ We’re pleased that he’s feeling well and about these three points.' Fiorentina, which has a game in hand since the match against Inter was abandoned, moved level on points with third-place Inter. Fiorentina is three points behind new leader Atalanta, which is on a nine-game winning streak, and one point behind second-place Napoli, which was beaten 1-0 at home by Lazio. Gustav Isaksen scored for Lazio with a long-range shot late in the second half. Lazio also moved level on points with Inter and Fiorentina. Napoli had led for most of the season under first-year coach Antonio Conte but has now lost at home to both Atalanta and Lazio. Lazio has won six of its last seven matches. Also, Empoli won 4-1 at Hellas Verona and moved up to ninth; and Venezia and Como drew 2-2. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/fiorentina-cataldi-promise-bove-napoli-lazio-italy-93865f5f3257d73d040e2a0bea0fa9b0	2024-12-08T08:15:00-08:00	
Global reaction to Assad's sudden ouster from Syria ranges from jubilation to alarm	Across the Middle East and beyond, the fall of Syria’s authoritarian government at the hands of jihadi militants set off waves of jubilation, trepidation and alarm. Expatriate Syrians and many residents across the Middle East exulted at the overthrow of a leader who led his country through 14 years of civil strife that left half a million Syrians dead and displaced millions to countries around the world. Others worried about still more instability rocking a region in turmoil. Governments — whether allies or opponents of Assad — scrambled to absorb the sudden, stunning development and assess the implications for the Middle East and the world. Mixed emotions in the Middle East In Lebanon, thousands of Syrians headed for the Masnaa border crossing to return to their home country, despite the uncertainty. 'Anything is better than Bashar,' said Sami Abdel-Latif, a refugee from Hama who was heading back to join his wife and four children. 'This is a feeling we’ve been waiting 14 years for,' said Malak Matar, who was preparing to return to the capital Damascus. Now, he said, 'Syrians have to create a state that is well organized and take care of their country.' Many citizens in Syria's neighboring countries reacted with joy to news Assad was gone. In Jordan’s capital, Amman, resident Muhab al-Majali said his fall marked the end of 'unjust and tyrannical rule.' 'I believe that the future is beautiful and prosperous for the Syrians,' he said. Others were not so sure, in a region that saw the energy of the 2011 Arab Spring democracy movement collapse into conflict and authoritarian rule. Saeed Sawy, an engineer in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, predicted that Syria’s rebel groups would descend into infighting over the country’s future. 'We saw this happen before,' he said. 'We saw this in Libya, in Tunisia, in Yemen and Sudan. People rejoice over the fall of tyrants, then they disagree and fight, and a civil war starts.' Syria’s neighbors stepped up security along their borders. Lebanon said it was closing all but one of its land border crossings with Syria. Jordan also closed a border crossing. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces had — temporarily, he said — seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement, after Syrian troops abandoned their positions. Airstrikes were reported on a military airport near Damascus, which has previously been targeted by Israel, and on other Syrian military sites. Iran, a key ally of Assad, said the Syrian people should decide their country’s future 'without destructive, coercive foreign intervention.' The Foreign Ministry in Tehran said Iran supports Syria’s unity and national sovereignty, and hopes to see 'the end of military conflicts, the prevention of terrorist activities and the start of a national dialogue' with the participation of all groups. The Iraqi government, which is close to Iran, said it 'supports all international and regional efforts seeking to open a dialogue' for Syria. Egypt’s foreign ministry urged a 'comprehensive political process' to establish a new era of peace in the war-torn county. The head of Yemen’s internationally recognized government welcomed the fall of Assad as 'a historic moment.' Yemen’s government is at war with the Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran. Turkey has backed anti-Assad militant groups in Syria, and could play a key role in what happens next. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the fall of Assad brought 'hope.' He called on the world to help 'unite and reconstruct' Syria. Fidan, who met in Qatar on Saturday with diplomats from Russia and Iran, the main backers of the Assad regime, said regional and global powers should try 'to act with prudence and calm.' Europe urges calm The war sent millions of Syrians fleeing to Europe and expatriates took to the streets in celebration in cities including Paris, London, Stockholm, Helsinki and Athens. Many European governments welcomed Assad’s departure while urging a rapid return to stability. 'The end of Assad’s dictatorship is a positive and long-awaited development,' said Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s newly appointed foreign policy chief, in a post on X. 'Our priority is to ensure security in the region. I will work with all the constructive partners, in Syria and the region.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement that the end of Assad’s rule was 'good news,' adding that 'what matters now is that law and order are quickly restored in Syria.' France’s foreign ministry welcomed the fall of Assad, saying 'the Syrian people have suffered too much.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also welcomed the end of Assad’s 'barbaric regime.' 'We call on all sides to protect civilians and minorities and ensure essential aid can reach the most vulnerable in the coming hours and days,' he said. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also called for calm and urged work to ensure an 'orderly political transition to renewed institutions.' Russia, which backed Assad with troops and warplanes, said it has been following the 'dramatic events' in Syria 'with extreme concern.' Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha of Ukraine, which is at war with Russia, wrote on X that the ousted Syrian leader had suffered the fate of 'all dictators who bet on (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. He always betrays those who rely on him.' The U.S. assesses events In Washington, President Joe Biden was meeting with his national security team Sunday for an update on the situation in Syria. President-elect Donald Trump said in a social media post Saturday, before Assad’s fall was confirmed: 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, &amp; THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria, including U.S. forces working with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State group.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-overthrow-world-reaction-7caf6eca9a5f3af01e0801d434076232	2024-12-08T08:07:26-08:00	
Analysis: Collapse of Syria's Assad is a blow to Iran's 'Axis of Resistance'	MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) — For Iran’s theocratic government, it keeps getting worse. Its decadeslong strategy of building an 'Axis of Resistance' supporting militant groups and proxies around the region is falling apart. First came the crushing Israeli campaign in Gaza triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Iranian-backed Hamas. That war spawned another in Lebanon, where Israel has mauled Iran’s most powerful ally, Hezbollah, even as Israel has launched successful airstrikes openly inside of Iran for the first time. And now Iran’s longtime stalwart ally and client in Syria, President Bashar Assad, is gone. As dawn broke Sunday, rebel forces completed a lightning offensive by seizing the ancient capital of Damascus and tearing down symbols of more than 50 years of Assad's rule over the Mideast crossroads. Ali Akbar Velayati, a key adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, once called Assad and Syria 'the golden ring of the resistance chain in the region.' 'Without the Syrian government, this chain will break and the resistance against Israel and its supporters will be weakened.' That break in the chain is literal. Syria was an important geographical link that allowed Iran to move weapons and other supplies to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Its loss now further weakens Hezbollah, whose powerful arsenal in southern Lebanon had put Iranian influence directly on the border of its nemesis Israel. 'Iran’s deterrence thinking is really shattered by events in Gaza, by events in Lebanon and definitely by developments in Syria,' a United Arab Emirates senior diplomat Anwar Gargash said at the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ Manama Dialogue in Bahrain. Iran still holds the card of its nuclear program. Though it denies that intention, it can use the potential for building a weapons capability to cast a shadow of influence in the region. 'Iran remains a critical regional player,' Gargash said. 'We should use this moment to connect and speak about what’s next in my opinion.' It’s a dramatic reversal in Iran’s regional might Only a few years ago, the Islamic Republic loomed ascendant across the wider Middle East. Its 'Axis of Resistance' was at a zenith. Hezbollah in Lebanon stood up against Israel. Assad appeared to have weathered an Arab Spring uprising-turned-civil war. Iraqi insurgents killed U.S. troops with Iranian-designed roadside bombs. Yemen’s Houthi rebels fought a Saudi-led coalition to a stalemate. Syria, at the crossroads, played a vital role. Early in Syria’s civil war, when it appeared Assad might be overthrown, Iran and its ally, Hezbollah, rushed fighters to support him — in the name of defending Shiite shrines in Syria. Russia later joined with a scorched earth campaign of airstrikes. The campaign won back territory, even as Syria remained divided into zones of government and insurgent control. But the speed of Assad’s collapse the past week showed just how reliant he was on support from Iran and Russia – which at the crucial moment didn’t come. Russia remains mired years after launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. For Iran, international sanctions over its advancing nuclear program have ground down its economy. For Israel, breaking Iran’s regional network has been a major goal, though it is wary over jihadi fighters among the insurgents who toppled Assad. Israel on Sunday moved troops into a demilitarized buffer zone with Syria by the Israel-held Golan Heights in what it called a temporary security measure. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Assad's fall a 'historic day,' saying it was 'the direct result of our forceful action against Hezbollah and Iran, Assad’s main supporters.' Iran’s theocratic rulers long touted their regional network to Iranians as a show of their country’s strength, and its crumbling could raise repercussions at home — though there is no immediate sign of their hold weakening. Anger over the tens of billions of dollars Iran is believed to have spent propping up Assad was a rallying cry in rounds of nationwide anti-government protests that have broken out over recent years, most recently in 2022. Iran could respond by revving up its nuclear program The loss of Syria does not mean the end of Iran’s ability to project power in the Mideast. The Houthi rebels continue to launch attacks on Israel and on ships moving through the Red Sea — though the tempo of their attacks have again fallen without a clear explanation from their leadership. Iran also maintains its nuclear program. While insisting it enriches uranium for peaceful purposes, Western intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency say Iran had an organized nuclear weapons program until 2003. The head of the IAEA also warned Friday that Iran is poised to 'quite dramatically' increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium as it has started cascades of advanced centrifuges. 'If Iran would develop nuclear weapons, that would be a great blow to the international nonproliferation regime,' said Thanos Dokos. Greece’s national security adviser, in Bahrain. There remains a risk of wider attacks in the region, particularly on oil infrastructure. An attack in 2019 initially claimed by the Houthis but later assessed by experts to have been carried out by Iran temporarily halved Saudi Arabia’s production of oil. 'If, as a result of escalation, there are attacks against the energy infrastructure of Iran or Saudi Arabia, that would be bad news for the global oil supply,' Dokos warned. Whatever happens next, Iran will need to make the decision weighing the problems it faces at both home and abroad. 'Whereas stability is a difficult commodity to export, instability can travel very fast, which is why stability in the Middle East is very important for all of us,' Dokos said. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — Jon Gambrell, the news director for the Gulf and Iran for The Associated Press, has reported from each of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Iran and other locations across the Mideast and wider world since joining the AP in 2006. ___ The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation.

South Korea's democracy held after a 6-hour power play. What does it say for democracies elsewhere?	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — In an era of rising authoritarianism, at the heels of a six-hour martial law decree that unfolded while many South Koreans slept, something noteworthy happened: Democracy held. The past week in Seoul, officials and academics warn, is what a threat to democracy looks like in 2024. It's a democratically elected president declaring martial law over the nation he leads, asserting sweeping powers to prevent opposition demonstrations, ban political parties and control the media. It's members of the military attempting to block lawmakers from exercising their power to vote on cancelling the power grab. And here's what it took to defeat President Yoon Suk Yeol 's lurch toward government by force: Unified popular support for democracy. Legislators storming the National Assembly past midnight, live-streaming themselves climbing over fences. A politician grabbing at a soldier's rifle and yelling 'Aren't you ashamed?' until he retreated. And finally, decisively, Parliament assembling a quorum and voting unanimously to cancel martial law. It was a victory for a hard-won democracy — and for the idea that checks and balances among branches of government must work to counteract each other's ambitions, as the American founders wrote in the Federalist Papers in 1788. But as the drama played out in Seoul, the scaffolding of democracy rattled around the world. It said something about the rule of law In other countries, the grab for power might have worked. Other would-be authoritarians might have been better prepared than Yoon. In deeply polarized societies — the United States, for example, where Republicans are staunchly loyal to president-elect Donald Trump — there might not have been decisive support from the public or the opposition. The military might have used force. And the members of the legislature might not have voted as one to snuff out the attempted takeover. 'President Yoon's attempt to declare martial law reveals the fragility of the rule of law in divided societies, especially those with governments in which the chief executive cannot be easily dismissed by the legislature,' said Tom Pepinsky, a government professor at Cornell University who studies backsliding among democracies in Southeast Asia. Notably, he said in an email, 'No members of President Yoon’s own party were willing to defend his actions in public.' Nevertheless, Yoon’s surprise attempt to impose martial law revealed both the fragility and resilience of the country’s democratic system. Within three hours of his stunning announcement to impose military rule — claiming the opposition was 'paralyzing' state affairs — 190 lawmakers voted to cancel his actions. In so doing, they demonstrated the strength of the country’s democratic checks and balances. Yoon’s authoritarian push, carried out by hundreds of heavily armed troops with Blackhawk helicopters and armored vehicles sent to the National Assembly, harked back to an era of dictatorial presidents. The country’s democratic transition in the late 1980s came after years of massive protests by millions that eventually overcame violent suppressions by military rulers. Civilian presence was again crucial in shaping the events following Yoon’s late night television announcement on Tuesday. Thousands of people flocked to the National Assembly, shouting slogans for martial law to be lifted and Yoon to step down from power. There were no reports of violent clashes with troops and police officers. 'We restored democracy without having a single casualty this time,' said Seol Dong-hoon, a sociology professor at South Korea’s Jeonbuk National University. It's not that easy to become a dictator It’s virtually impossible for any leader of a democracy to pull off a transition toward martial law without a public willing to support it, or at least tolerate it. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, attracted millions of views as he began live-streaming his journey to the National Assembly, pleading for people to converge on the parliament to help lawmakers get inside. The shaky footage later shows him exiting his car climbing over a fence to get onto the grounds. The vote at the National Assembly was also broadcast live on the YouTube channel of Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik, who also had to scale a fence to get in. Yoon’s sense of crisis clearly wasn’t shared by the public, whose opinions, Seol said, were shaped predominantly by the shocking videos broadcast to their devices. 'Ultimately, democracy is all about moving public opinion,' he said. 'What was most crucial in this case was that everything was broadcast live on smartphones, YouTube and countless other media.' Opposition lawmakers are now pushing to impeach Yoon, saying he failed to meet the constitutional requirement that martial law should only be considered in wartime or a comparable severe crisis — and that he unlawfully deployed troops to the National Assembly. On Saturday, an opposition-led impeachment motion failed after most lawmakers from Yoon’s party boycotted the vote. Yet the president’s troubles persist: The vote’s defeat is expected to intensify nationwide protests and deepen South Korea’s political turmoil, with opposition parties preparing to introduce another impeachment motion when parliament reconvenes on Wednesday. Han Sang-hie, a law professor at Seoul’s Konkuk University, said the martial law debacle highlights what he sees as the most crucial flaw of South Korea’s democracy: that it places too much power in the hands of the president, which is easily abused and often goes unchecked. It's called a ‘self-coup’ Political scientists call what happened in South Korea an 'autogolpe' — a 'self-coup' — defined as one led by incumbent leaders themselves, in which an executive takes or sponsors illegal actions against others in the government. Yoon qualifies because he used troops to try to shut down South Korea's legislature. Self-coups are increasing, with a third of the 46 since 1945 occurring in the past decade, according to a study by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Penn State University. About 80% of self-coups succeed, they reported. In 2021, a power grab by Tunisian President Kais Saied raised similar concerns around the world after the country designed a democracy from scratch and won a Nobel Peace Prize after a largely bloodless revolution. In the United States, some have expresed worry about similar situations arising during the second administration of Donald Trump. He has vowed, after all, to shake some of democracy's pillars. He's mused that he would be justified if he decided to pursue 'the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.' That’s in contrast to the oath of office he took in 2017, and will again next year, to 'preserve, protect and defend the Constitution' as best he can. Nearly half of voters in the Nov. 5 election, which Trump won, said they were 'very concerned' that another Trump presidency would bring the U.S. closer to authoritarianism, according to AP Votecast survey data. Asked before a live audience on Fox News Channel in 2023 to assure Americans that he would not abuse power or use the presidency to seek retribution against anyone, Trump replied, 'except for day one,' when he'll close the border and 'drill, drill, drill.' After that, Trump said, 'I'm not a dictator.' ___ Kellman reported from London.	https://apnews.com/article/coup-yoon-democracy-martial-law-trump-caa2e5c9bbbe59c3af7f3bfab65bdf4b	2024-12-08T06:52:46-08:00

Adam Pemble, AP journalist whose compassionate lens brought stories to life, dies at 52	BERLIN (AP) — Adam Pemble, an Associated Press video journalist who covered some of the biggest global news of the past two decades, from earthquakes and conflicts to political summits and elections, has died. He was 52. Pemble died Thursday in Minneapolis surrounded by friends and family, according to his friend Mike Moe, who helped care for him in the final weeks of his fight against cancer. Known for bringing stories alive with his camera, Pemble epitomized the best of television news traditions, casting a curious and compassionate lens onto the lives of the people and communities whose stories he told. He joined the AP in 2007 in New York before moving to Prague in 2011 to help launch AP’s first cross-format operation combining photography, text stories and video. He enhanced Eastern European news coverage, creating distinctive stories highlighting the region's culture and society. 'Adam was an incredibly talented and passionate journalist and an empathetic storyteller. He had this amazing ability to get anyone to talk to him on camera, which I attribute to the Midwestern charm he embodied throughout his life.' said Sara Gillesby, AP’s Director of Global Video and Pemble’s former manager in New York when he joined the AP. 'He was the best of us.' Pemble was born in Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, in 1972 and grew up in Minneapolis. After graduating with a degree in mass communications from Minnesota State University Moorhead, he started his journalism career in 1997 at KVLY, a television station in Fargo, North Dakota, and later worked at WCCO in Minneapolis. 'He had the skills of the old-school camera people to meet a deadline and turn a beautiful story,' said Arthur Phillips, a cameraman who worked with Pemble at WCCO. 'But he had a calling for greater things.' Moving to New York, Pemble covered some of the biggest stories in the city, including the trial of Bernie Madoff, interviews with former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and with then-real estate developer, now U.S. president-elect, Donald Trump. He went to Haiti to cover the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, where he captured shocking images of devastation. A few weeks later he was in Vancouver, covering the Winter Olympics. With his transfer to Prague, Pemble quickly became the go-to video journalist deployed to the biggest news events in Europe, interviewing government leaders, covering violent protests, the aftermath of terror attacks and numerous national elections across the continent. 'An inquiring mind, a keen eye and a healthy skepticism for those in power who tried to spin away from truth all combined to make Adam’s stories as rich in color as he was in character,' said Sandy MacIntyre, former AP head of global video. 'Time and again he was asked to do the impossible and without fail he delivered the exceptional.' 'But more than all of that, he was the colleague and friend you wanted by your side because if Adam was there we knew we were going to be the winning team.' As civil unrest rocked Ukraine in 2014, Pemble reported from Kyiv and later Donetsk, where he covered the first Russian-backed demonstrations before spending weeks in Crimea during Russia's annexation of the strategic peninsula. His video reports included the last remaining Ukrainian sailors loyal to Kyiv finally abandoning their ship and coming ashore. With the Russian national anthem playing from a car in the background, his final shot showed two distraught sailors heckled as they walked away. Pemble returned to Ukraine following Russia's invasion of the country in 2022. Among his many assignments was filming the exclusive March 2023 AP interview by Executive Editor Julie Pace with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a train shuttled them across Ukraine to cities near some of the fiercest fighting. 'Adam showed up to every assignment with enthusiasm, creativity and commitment to his work and his colleagues. He loved what he did, and so many of us at AP are better for having worked alongside him,' Pace said. When not deployed overseas, Pemble set his camera's gaze on his new home in the Czech Republic, offering insight into the traditions and unique stories of Eastern Europe. From Christmas carp fishing at sunrise to graffiti artists in Prague, to the intimate story of a Slovak priest challenging the celibacy rules of the Catholic Church, he brought his unmistakable style. He worked with a traditional large broadcast camera in an era where many video shooters shifted to smaller, lighter cameras. He always put himself in the right place to let reality unfold like 'an old school analog painter in an often fast and furious digital age,' former AP cameraman Ben Jary recalled. Pemble's interest in visual storytelling led to experimenting with new technologies, including aerial videography. In 2015, he was the first major news agency camera operator to film live drone footage when reporting on the migration crisis in the Balkans. An avid gardener who planted trees and chilis on his rooftop in Prague, he was adventurous in the kitchen and especially proud of his vegan 'meatloaf,' friends said. He loved a seedy dive bar as much as a Michelin restaurant, and foods as varied as charcoal choux pastry with truffle creme and his favorite road trip junk food, Slim Jim’s jerky and Salted Nut Rolls. Pemble’s wit, wisdom, energy and positivity enriched the lives and experiences of those around him, friends and colleagues recalled. 'If someone asked me to see a picture of quiet strength and courage, dignity and grace, and most of all kindness, I would show them a picture of a man for all seasons,' said Dan Huff, a Washington-based AP video journalist, 'I would show them a picture of Adam Pemble.'	https://apnews.com/article/ap-video-journalist-adam-pemble-obituary-prague-a156914f1fa3dcbba712357b0048a0c6	2024-12-08T05:30:15-08:00	
How it happened: Two seismic weeks that toppled Syria's government	LONDON (AP) — Half a century of rule by the Assad family in Syria crumbled with astonishing speed after insurgents burst out of a rebel-held enclave and converged on the capital, Damascus, taking city after city in a matter of days. Opposition forces swept across the country and entered Damascus with little or no resistance as the Syrian army melted away. President Bashar Assad, Syria’s ruler for 24 years — succeeding his father, Hafez Assad — was reported to have fled the country for an undisclosed location. It’s a stunning development in Syria’s devastating 13-year conflict. Anti-government protests in 2011 met with a brutal crackdown, escalating into a civil war that has killed more than half a million people and displaced half of Syria’s prewar population of 23 million. Assad, backed by Iran and Russia, gradually regained control of more than two-thirds of Syria, leaving the rebels with one stronghold in the northwest of the country. And there the conflict remained, largely frozen, for years until late November. Here’s a look at a seismic two weeks for the Middle East. Wednesday, Nov. 27: Rebel offensive begins Armed opposition groups launch a large-scale attack on areas controlled by government forces in northwestern Syria and claim to have wrested control of over 15 villages from government forces in northwestern Aleppo province. The government and its allies respond with airstrikes and shelling in an attempt to halt the insurgent advances. The offensive is led by the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Formerly the Syrian branch of al-Qaida and known as the Nusra Front, HTS later distanced itself from al-Qaida, seeking to market itself as a more moderate group. It is classed as a terrorist group by the United Nations and the U.S. The attack on Aleppo follows weeks of simmering low-level violence, including government attacks on opposition-held areas. Turkey, a main backer of Syrian opposition groups, says the rebels began a limited offensive to stop the attacks, but it expanded as government forces began to retreat. Thursday, Nov. 28: The offensive expands The offensive expands to reach the countryside of Idlib province amid reports government troops are retreating. Friday, Nov. 29: Rebels enter Aleppo The insurgents enter Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, for the first time since they were pushed out in 2016 after a grueling military campaign by Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran. They meet with little resistance. Saturday, Nov. 30: Aleppo falls under insurgent control The rebels say they control Aleppo, raising a flag over the city’s citadel and occupying the international airport. The Syrian armed forces claim to have redeployed troops and equipment in preparation for a counterattack. By evening, the insurgents have seized at least four towns in the central Hama province and claim to have entered the provincial capital. Sunday, Dec. 1: The government fights back The Syrian military launches a counterattack with troops and airstrikes on Idlib and Aleppo. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visits Damascus, telling Assad that Tehran will support the counteroffensive. But Assad receives little, if any, help from his allies. Russia is busy with its war in Ukraine, and Iran has seen its proxies across the region degraded by regular airstrikes. Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up Assad’s forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Monday, Dec. 2-Wednesday, Dec. 4: Fighting rages near Hama The insurgents push south, advancing to within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of Hama, the country’s fourth-largest city and a key crossroads in central Syria, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Damascus. State media reports fierce fighting in the province, and both state media and a U.K.-based observer group say government forces, backed by Russian airstrikes, have recaptured some territory. Turkey urges Assad to hold talks with the opposition. Thursday, Dec. 5: Insurgents capture Hama After several days of fighting the rebels sweep into Hama. Dozens of jubilant fighters are seen firing into the air in celebration in Assi Square, the site of massive anti-government protests in the early days of the uprising in 2011. The Syrian army says it has redeployed to positions outside the city to protect civilians. Friday, Dec. 6: Rebels advance on Homs Rapidly advancing now, the rebels seize two towns on the outskirts of Homs, Syria’s third-largest city. About 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Hama, Homs is the gateway to Damascus and the location of one of Syria’s two state-owned oil refineries. Capturing it would cut the link between Damascus, Assad’s seat of power, and the coastal region where he enjoys wide support. The government denies reports that its military has withdrawn from the city. Top diplomats from countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Iran and Russia, hold talks on Syria in the Qatari capital, Doha. Saturday, Dec. 7: Homs falls and Assad’s grip weakens Opposition forces take Homs after government forces abandon it. The insurgents say they have encircled Damascus and are carrying out the 'final stage' of their offensive. The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, seeks urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition,' as Syrian state media denies Assad has fled the country. Sunday, Dec. 8: Assad is toppled Syrian state television airs a video statement by a group of men saying that President Bashar Assad has been overthrown and all prisoners have been set free. Russian officials and Iranian state TV say Assad has left Syria; his whereabouts are unknown. Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali says the government is ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-ousted-rebel-offensive-timeline-8c54a8b97803d4b10cde53b97227128e	2024-12-08T05:26:33-08:00	
Syria latest: Syrians celebrate Bashar Assad's fall as his whereabouts remain unknown	Crowds gathered in Syria's Damascus on Sunday to celebrate the fall of Bashar Assad’s government with chants, prayers and the occasional gunfire after opposition fighters entered the capital following a stunning advance. Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Syrian opposition war monitor, said Assad took a flight from Damascus and left early Sunday. There was no immediate official statement from the Syrian government and Assad's whereabouts remain unknown. It was the first time opposition forces had reached Damascus since 2018 when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege. The night before, opposition forces had taken the central city of Homs, Syria’s third largest, as government forces abandoned it. The rapidly developing events have shaken the region. Lebanon said it was closing all its land border crossings with Syria except for one that links Beirut with Damascus. Jordan closed a border crossing with Syria, too. ___ Here's the Latest: Many Jordanian people welcome the fall of Assad's regime AMMAN, Jordan — The vast majority of the Jordanian people are welcoming the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime and the success of the Syrian revolution. 'There is no doubt that I felt overwhelming joy at the fall of the Assad regime,' said Badi Al-Rafaia, Engineer, union activist and member of the Islamic Action Front. 'There is no doubt that we are happy with what happened in Syria, happy with the success of the revolution, happy with the Syrian people getting rid of an oppressor and criminal who treated the Syrian people and made the Syrian state a failed state.' Al-Rafaia said that Jordan is benefiting from what happened in Syria, and 'we hope that Jordan will help the revolution succeed and not work against it.' Amman resident Muhab al-Majali said the fall of the Assad regime is 'The end of every unjust and tyrannical rule, and more than that, it mortgaged the country and its people to the Iranians, who abandoned it in minutes... I believe that the future is beautiful and prosperous for the Syrians.' The International Committee of the Red Cross calls for safe humanitarian access and protection of civilians in Syria BERLIN — The International Committee of the Red Cross is calling for safe humanitarian access and protection of civilians in Syria after the fall of Bashir Assad’s government. 'Our teams in Syria, including in Damascus, have been closely monitoring the fast-evolving security and humanitarian situation in coordination with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent,' the ICRC’s head of delegation in Syria, Stephan Sakalian, said in a written statement Sunday. The ICRC is 'responding wherever possible, with further efforts underway, as hundreds of thousands of people need care and humanitarian assistance,' he said. Sakalian called 'on all parties to urgently enable safe and unhindered access for medical and humanitarian workers to reach those in need, to protect civilians, and to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law.' Iraqi government supports efforts seeking to open a dialogue for Syria's future BAGHDAD — The Iraqi government said in a statement Sunday that it 'supports all international and regional efforts seeking to open a dialogue' for Syria 'leading to the adoption of a pluralistic constitution that preserves the human and civil rights of Syrians, and supports cultural, ethnic and religious diversity.' The statement from government spokesperson Bassem al-Awadi, said that Iraq understands 'the necessity of respecting the free will of all Syrians, and stresses that the security of Syria, the unity of its territories, and the preservation of its independence are of utmost importance, not only for Iraq but also for its connection to the security and stability of the region.' It cautioned against 'interfering in Syria’s internal affairs, or supporting one party for the benefit of another.' Iraq, which has a close relationship with Iran - once a strong ally of former Syrian President Bashar Assad - has taken in some 2,000 Syrian army soldiers who fled the country amid the advance of armed opposition groups. Yemen's leader welcomes the fall of Syria's government CAIRO — The head of Yemen’s internationally recognized government welcomed the fall of the government of President Bashar Assad of Syria. 'It’s a historic moment,' Rashad al-Alimi, who chairs the ruling presidential council, wrote on X platform of Assad’s downfall. 'It’s time for the Iranian regime to stop meddling in Yemen, respect its sovereignty and identity.' Al-Alimi, who is backed by Saudi Arabia, was referring to Iran’s support of Houthi rebels who are at war with Yemen’s internationally recognized government for a decade. Families wander through the presidential palace in Damascus, taking pictures DAMASCUS — Families wandered through the high-ceilinged halls of the presidential palace in Damascus on Sunday, along with some armed men. Some paused to take family portraits or selfies on the few remaining couches against the backdrop of mosaiced walls, while others walked out with chairs and other items under their arms. On the massive parking lot out front, cars drove in circles honking ecstatically. In central Damascus’ Umayyad Square, drivers passing by also honked jubilantly, while young men piled onto a tank abandoned in the square. But for some the celebration was bittersweet. 'I am very happy, but this happiness will not be completed until I can see my son out of the prison and know where is he is,' said Damascus resident Bassam Masr. 'I have been searching for him for two hours - he has been detained for 13 years.' Iran, which had closely backed Assad, says Syrians should decide country’s future TEHRAN, Iran — Iran says the Syrian people should decide their country’s future 'without destructive, coercive foreign intervention.' The Foreign Ministry statement issued Sunday marked Iran’s first official reaction to the overthrow of President Bashar Assad, who it had strongly backed through nearly 14 years of civil war. Assad’s government was a close ally of Iran that served as a crucial conduit between it and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. The rebels who toppled Assad view Iran as a hostile foreign influence, and the abandoned Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked as they entered the city. The Foreign Ministry statement said Iran supports Syria’s unity and national sovereignty, and hopes to see 'the end of military conflicts, the prevention of terrorist activities and the start of a national dialogue' with the participation of all groups. 'It is expected that the wise and farsighted relations of the two nations will continue based on mutual ties and interests,' the statement said. Netanyahu says Israeli forces have seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights after Syrian unrest TEL AVIV, Israel – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israeli forces have seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement with Syria. He spoke from an overlook near the border between Syria and the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, after Syrian rebels tore through the country and dramatically ended Assad’s rule on Sunday morning. Netanyahu said the 50-year-old agreement had collapsed and that Syrian troops had abandoned their positions, necessitating the Israeli takeover as a 'temporary defensive position.' Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it. The international community, except for the United States, views it as occupied Syrian territory. Satellite images analyzed by the Associated Press show that as early as September, Israel began construction of what could possibly be a new road right along the so-called Alpha Line that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria. The United Nations confirmed that Israeli troops entered the demilitarized zone during the work. The United Nations maintains a peacekeeping force in the demilitarized zone called the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, or UNDOF, with around 1,100 peacekeepers from Fiji, India, Kazakhstan, Nepal, and Uruguay. After the 1973 Mideast war, the U.N. Secretary Council voted to create UNDOF to patrol a roughly 400 square kilometer (155 square mile) demilitarized zone and maintain the peace there. Syrians cross over from Lebanon, facing an uncertain future but hopeful for change MASNAA, Lebanon — At Lebanon’s Masnaa crossing into Syria, the mood was festive Sunday with some local Lebanese residents handing out congratulatory sweets to Syrians lined up to return to their country. Sami Abdel-Latif, a refugee from Hama who was heading to Syria to join his wife and four children, said while the future in Syria is still uncertain, 'anything is better than Bashar.' He said he expected some chaos initially but that eventually the situation would settle down. 'Look at Aleppo now,' he said, referring to the first major city taken over by opposition forces more than a week ago, where life has continued more or less as normal. Abdel-Latif, a construction worker, said he is also hoping that there will now be plentiful work in Syria to rebuild. Malak Matar, who was preparing to return to Damascus, said, 'This is a feeling we’ve been waiting 14 years for. 'You feel yourself psychologically free - you can express yourself,' he said. 'The country is free and the barriers have been broken down.' Now, he said, 'Syrians have to create a state that is well-organized and take care of their country. It’s a new phase.' Egyptians express mixed feelings over collapse of Assad's government CAIRO — Egyptians expressed mixed feelings following the downfall of Syria's Bashar Assad. Many welcomed Assad’s ouster after decades of repression under his rule and that of his father Hafez Assad. Others, however, expressed concerns about the future of Syria, mostly given the extremist past of rebel commanders, especially Abu Mohammed al-Golani who leads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, labeled a terrorist by the United States. 'It’s good news for Syrians,' Adel Salah, a retired school teacher, said while following a news TV channel in a Cairo coffee shop. 'But there is a big question: the future of the country.' Saeed Sawy, an engineer, painted a rather grim picture. He said it’s likely that these rebel groups, with their differences and competing alliances, will engage in infighting over the country’s future. 'We saw this happen before. We saw this in Libya, in Tunisia, in Yemen and Sudan. People rejoice over the fall of tyrants, then they disagree and fight, and a civil war starts,' he said. EU top diplomat welcomes Bashar Assad's ouster BRUSSELS — The European Union’s top diplomat welcomed the fall of Bashar Assad and said that the collapse of his rule underlines how weak his supporters in Moscow and Tehran have become. 'The end of Assad’s dictatorship is a positive and long-awaited development,' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas posted on X. 'Our priority is to ensure security in the region. I will work with all the constructive partners, in Syria and the region,' said Kallas, who took over as the 27-nation bloc’s top diplomat last week. German Chancellor calls for speedy return of order in Syria BERLIN — Reacting to the fall of Bashir Assad’s government, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday that 'what matters now is that law and order are quickly restored in Syria.' 'The Syrian people have experienced appalling suffering,' the chancellor said in an emailed statement. 'The end of Assad’s rule over Syria is therefore good news.' He stressed that 'all religious communities, all minorities must enjoy protection now and in the future.' 'We will judge the future rulers by whether they make it possible for all Syrians to live in dignity and self-determination, defend Syria’s sovereignty against malicious interference by third parties and live in peace with their neighbors,' Scholz added. Airstrikes reported in the area of the Mezzeh military airport DAMASCUS, Syria — An Associated Press journalist in Damascus reported airstrikes in the area of the Mezzeh military airport, southwest of the capital Sunday. The airport has previously been targeted in Israeli airstrikes, but it was not immediately clear who launched Sunday's strike. The Israeli military refused to comment on the airport strike. Israel often does not publicly claim responsibility for attacks in Syria. On Saturday and Sunday, the Israeli military sent additional troops to the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights to bolster Israel’s presence along the border between Israel and Syria. Agricultural areas along the border were declared closed military zones and some schools shifted to online classes in anticipation of unrest. China hopes for stability soon in Syria BEIJING — China said it was closely monitoring the situation in Syria and that it hoped stability would return as soon as possible, according to a statement published Sunday on the Foreign Ministry’s website. Beijing said it has been helping Chinese nationals who wish to leave Syria to do so in a safe manner and that it remained in contact with those still in the country. 'We urge relevant parties in Syria to ensure the safety and security of the Chinese institutions and personnel in Syria,' the statement read. 'The Chinese Embassy is still up and running and carrying out its duty in Syria. We will continue to make every possible assistance to Chinese nationals in need.' Opposition forces announce curfew in Damascus BEIRUT — The command of the Syrian armed opposition says it will impose Sunday a curfew in Damascus, starting at 4 p.m. local time till 5 a.m. on Monday. The Military Operations Administration, which posted the decision on Telegram, did not give a reason for the curfew. Russia claims Assad left Syria after giving instructions to transfer power peacefully MOSCOW — Russia’s Foreign Ministry claimed Sunday that Bashar Assad had left Syria after negotiations with rebel groups, and gave 'instructions' to 'transfer power peacefully.' In a post on the Telegram messaging app on Sunday, the ministry said Moscow had not directly participated in these talks. It also said it has been following the 'dramatic events' in Syria 'with extreme concern.' It also said Russian troops stationed in Syria have been put on high alert and that as of early afternoon Sunday, there was 'no serious threat' to the security of Russia’s military bases there. Russia has waged a military campaign in Syria since September 2015, teaming up with Iran to allow Assad’s government to fight armed opposition groups and reclaim control over most of the country. While Russia now concentrates the bulk of its military resources in Ukraine, it has maintained a military foothold in Syria and keeps troops at its bases there. Turkey-backed forces are about to wrest control of city from a U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led force ANKARA, Turkey — Turkish security officials said Sunday that Turkey-backed opposition forces were close to wresting control of the city of Manbij from a U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led force. The opposition group, known as the Syrian National Army, SNA, was now in control of 80% of Manbij, after pushing back against the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units, the YPG, the officials said. They provided the information on condition of anonymity due to regulations. Last week, the Turkish-backed force similarly expelled YPG fighters from the city of Tal Rifaat. The Syrian Kurdish militia group is a key U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria. Turkey however, considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization due to its link to the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has led a decades-long insurgency in Turkey. Turkey has conducted several incursions into Syria since 2016 to push the YPG away from its borders with Syria. France welcomes the fall of Bashar Assad PARIS — The French Foreign Affairs ministry said France 'welcomes' the fall of Bashar Assad’s government 'after more than 13 years of violent repression against its own people.' The ministry said in a statement: 'The Syrian people have suffered too much. Bashar Assad has bled dry country, emptied of a large part of its people who, if not forced into exile, have been massacred, tortured and bombarded with chemical weapons by the regime and its allies.' France also called for a peaceful political transition that respects the diversity of the Syrian people and protects civilians and minorities and on its international partners to help the Syrian people move towards 'reconciliation and reconstruction,' saying France is ready to 'play its full part' in the process. UN envoy for Syria expresses hope but warns of immense challenges DOHA, Qatar — The U.N. envoy for Syria says the ouster of President Bashar Assad has created an opportunity to address the country’s deep problems and create a brighter future after years of conflict. But he says 'immense' challenges remain. Geir Pederson told reporters that the changes in Syria now raise hope for millions of refugees, internally displaced, political prisoners and families whose loved ones have disappeared. 'Today we look forward to the cautious hope for the opening of a new time for the peace, reconciliation, dignity and inclusion of all Syrians,' he said. He said the U.N. was closely monitoring the situation on the ground and urging all groups to avoid violence, protect civilians and respect human rights. 'Let me stress that there must be a collective effort to secure peace and dignity for all, and that I stand ready to support the Syrian people in their journey toward a stable and inclusive future, decided and shaped by the Syrian people themselves,' Pederson said at the Doha Summit. He said he did not know where Assad has fled to and declined to say whether the former president should be prosecuted for war crimes. Pederson said international efforts should focus now on a stable and peaceful transition before addressing deeper questions like justice for Assad. Turkish foreign minister calls on world to help stabilize Syria BEIRUT — Hakan Fidan said Sunday that 'Syria has reached a stage where the Syrian people will shape the future of their own country,' calling on the international community to support Syrians. Fidan is attending the Qatari diplomatic forum that started late Saturday and is hosting eight countries with an interest in Syria, including the U.S. and Iran. 'The new administration must be established in an orderly manner. The principle of inclusiveness must never be compromised,' the Turkish foreign minister told reporters. 'There must never be a desire for revenge. It is time to unite and reconstruct the country.' When asked where Bashar Assad was, he said: 'I cannot say for sure.' Hakan Fidan, adding, 'he is somewhere, but I cannot comment on that' and that he was 'probably outside of Syria.' Fidan, who on Saturday met with his counterparts from Russia and Iran, the main backers of the Assad regime, said regional and global powers should try 'to act with prudence and calm and to refrain from steps that could further destabilize the region.' Turkey has been in contact with Syrian opposition factions to ensure terrorist groups do not take advantage of the situation, Fidan added, referring to the Islamic State group and Kurdish militants. He also stressed that any chemical weapon stockpiles should be secured.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-israel-hamas-war-gaza-lebanon-82ceb102928e842154d91201b16cf2ab	2024-12-08T05:07:02-08:00	
Trump calls for 'immediate ceasefire' in Ukraine after meeting Zelenskyy in Paris	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, shortly after a meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders, claiming Kyiv 'would like to make a deal' to end the more than 1,000-day war. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Moscow and Kyiv have both lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a war that 'should never have started.' 'There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed,' he said, as he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to act to bring the fighting to an end. Trump’s remarks came after a meeting Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, that Zelenskyy later described as 'constructive'. Speaking to reporters later that day, Zelenskyy insisted that any peace deal 'should be just' for Ukrainians, 'so that Russia and Putin or any other aggressors will not have the opportunity to return.' In a separate social media update Sunday, Zelenskyy asserted that Kyiv has so far lost 43,000 soldiers since Moscow's all-out invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, while a further 370,000 have been wounded. Both Russia and Ukraine have been reluctant to publish official casualty figures, but Western officials have said that the past few months of grinding positional warfare in eastern Ukraine have meant record losses for both sides, with tens of thousands killed and wounded each month.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-ceasefire-e00a18db202ef74b38e009bb2a5381cf	2024-12-08T03:02:22-08:00	
Who is Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of the insurgency that toppled Syria's Assad?	BEIRUT (AP) — Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the militant leader whose stunning insurgency toppled Syria’s President Bashar Assad, has spent years working to remake his public image, renouncing longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicting himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. In recent days, the insurgency even dropped his nom de guerre and began referring to him by his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa. The extent of that transformation from jihadi extremist to would-be state builder is now put to the test. Insurgents control capital Damascus, Assad has fled into hiding, and for the first time after 50 years of his family’s iron hand, it is an open question how Syria will be governed. Syria is home to multiple ethnic and religious communities, often pitted against each other by Assad’s state and years of war. Many of them fear the possibility Sunni Islamist extremists will take over. The country is also fragmented among disparate armed factions, and foreign powers from Russia and Iran to the United States, Turkey and Israel all have their hands in the mix. The 42-year-old al-Golani -- labeled a terrorist by the United States -- has not appeared publicly since Damascus fell early Sunday. But he and his insurgent force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS – many of whose fighters are jihadis -- stand to be a major player. For years, al-Golani worked to consolidate power, while bottled up in the province of Idlib in Syria’s northwest corner as Assad’s Iranian- and Russian-backed rule over much of the country appeared solid. He maneuvered among extremist organizations while eliminating competitors and former allies. He sought to polish the image of his de-facto 'salvation government' that has been running Idlib to win over international governments and reassure Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities. And he built ties with various tribes and other groups. Along the way, al-Golani shed his garb as a hard-line Islamist guerrilla and put on suits for press interviews, talking of building state institutions and decentralizing power to reflect Syria’s diversity. 'Syria deserves a governing system that is institutional, no one where a single ruler makes arbitrary decisions,' he said in an interview with CNN last week, offering the possibility HTS would eventually be dissolved after Assad falls. 'Don’t judge by words, but by actions,' he said. Al-Golani’s beginnings in Iraq Al-Golani’s ties to al-Qaida stretch back to 2003, when he joined extremists battling U.S. troops in Iraq. The Syrian native was detained by the U.S. military but remained in Iraq. During that time, al-Qaida usurped like-minded groups and formed the extremist Islamic State of Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In 2011, a popular uprising against Syria’s Assad triggered a brutal government crackdown and led to all-out war. Al-Golani’s prominence grew when al-Baghdadi sent him to Syria to establish a branch of al-Qaida called the Nusra Front. The United States labeled the new group as a terrorist organization. That designation still remains in place and the U.S. government has put a $10 million bounty on him. The Nusra Front and the Syrian conflict As Syria’s civil war intensified in 2013, so did al-Golani’s ambitions. He defied al-Baghdadi’s calls to dissolve the Nusra Front and merge it with al-Qaida’s operation in Iraq, to form the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Al-Golani nonetheless pledged his allegiance to al-Qaida, which later disassociated itself from ISIS. The Nusra Front battled ISIS and eliminated much of its competition among the Syrian armed opposition to Assad. In his first interview in 2014, al-Golani kept his face covered, telling a reporter for Qatari network Al-Jazeera that he rejected political talks in Geneva to end the conflict. He said his goal was to see Syria ruled under Islamic law and made clear that there was no room for the country’s Alawite, Shiite, Druze and Christian minorities. Consolidating power and rebranding In 2016, al-Golani revealed his face to the public for the first time in a video message that announced his group was renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham -– the Syria Conquest Front -- and cutting its ties to al-Qaida. 'This new organization has no affiliation to any external entity,' he said in the video, filmed wearing military garb and a turban. The move paved the way for al-Golani to assert full control over fracturing militant groups. A year later, his alliance rebranded again as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham -– meaning Organization for Liberating Syria -- as the groups merged, consolidating al-Golani’s power in northwest Syria’s Idlib province. HTS later clashed with independent Islamist militants who opposed the merger, further emboldening al-Golani and his group as the leading power in northwestern Syria, able to rule with an iron fist. With his power consolidated, al-Golani set in motion a transformation that few could have imagined. Replacing his military garb with shirt and trousers, he began calling for religious tolerance and pluralism. He appealed to the Druze community in Idlib, which the Nusra Front had previously targeted, and visited the families of Kurds who were killed by Turkish-backed militias. In 2021, al-Golani had his first interview with an American journalist on PBS. Wearing a blazer, with his short hair gelled back, the now more soft-spoken HTS leader said that his group posed no threat to the West and that sanctions imposed against it were unjust. 'Yes, we have criticized Western policies,' he said. 'But to wage a war against the United States or Europe from Syria, that’s not true. We didn’t say we wanted to fight.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-insurgents-algolani-hts-aab4c8894238904a4e351076726499fb	2024-12-08T02:46:31-08:00	
Romania's far-right presidential candidate denounces canceled vote at closed polling station	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania’s defiant far-right presidential candidate, Calin Georgescu, on Sunday stood outside a closed polling station to denounce a top court’s unprecedented decision to annul the first round of the vote in which he emerged as the frontrunner. The Constitutional Court on Friday canceled the election after a trove of declassified intelligence alleged Russia organized a sprawling campaign across social media to promote Georgescu. 'Today is Constitution Day and there is nothing constitutional in Romania anymore. I am here in the name of democracy,' Georgescu, 62, told media in Mogosoaia, outside Bucharest. 'By canceling democracy, our very freedom is canceled.' The court cited the illegal use of digital technologies including artificial intelligence, as well as undeclared sources of funding. Without naming Georgescu, the court said one candidate received 'preferential treatment' on social media platforms, distorting voters’ expressed will. Despite being a huge outsider who declared zero campaign spending, Georgescu topped the polls in the first round on Nov. 24, and was due on Sunday to face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a runoff. Thirteen candidates ran in the first round of the presidential race in the European Union and NATO member country, the aftermath of which was gripped by myriad controversies including a recount of the vote ordered by the same court. New dates will be set to rerun the presidential vote from scratch. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said in a statement marking Constitution Day on Sunday that 'we find ourselves in a moment of profound responsibility toward the values ​​that characterize us as a nation.' 'The Romanian Constitution defines the framework within which the state and political life operate, serving as a shield against threats to democracy,' he said. 'In turbulent times, state institutions are called upon to act with calm, wisdom and respect for the law, the Constitution and democracy.' George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, told reporters outside a closed polling station in Bucharest on Sunday that the annulment amounted to an attack against democracy, saying Iohannis should 'take a step back and respect the Constitution, not mock it.' 'It is Constitution Day. It is a day of significance for Romanians. It is a day when Romanians should have gone to vote freely,' he said, adding that 'blood was shed for this 35 years ago,' referring to Romania’s revolution in December 1989 that overthrew communism. After Georgescu unexpectedly topped the polls in the first round, his success left many political observers wondering how most local surveys had placed him behind at least five other candidates before the vote. Many observers attributed his success to his TikTok account, which now has 6.2 million likes and 565,000 followers. But some experts suspected Georgescu’s online following was artificially inflated, while Romania’s top security body alleged he was given preferential treatment by TikTok over other candidates. On Saturday, Romanian prosecutors conducted raids at three properties in the central city of Brasov linked to Bogdan Peschir, who is suspected of illegally financing a campaign to promote Georgescu. The raids were based on suspicions of voter corruption, money laundering and cyber fraud, prosecutors said. The secret services alleged that Peschir paid $381,000 (361,000 euros) to TikTok users to promote Georgescu content on the Chinese-owned platform. Intelligence authorities said information they obtained 'revealed an aggressive promotion campaign' to increase and accelerate Georgescu’s popularity. There is no clear link between Peschir and alleged Russian interference. Russia denies meddling in Romania. On Friday, Georgescu's would-be opponent Lasconi also strongly condemned the court’s decision to annul the elections, saying it was 'illegal, immoral, and crushes the very essence of democracy' and that the second round should have gone forward.	https://apnews.com/article/georgescu-romania-elections-9e64a5420df7314f07d34644b5cbeaa9	2024-12-08T01:37:02-08:00	
Ghana's ex-President John Mahama is set to return after rival concedes election	ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — Ghana’s former President John Dramani Mahama is set to return to office in the West African nation’s presidential election after the ruling party candidate, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, on Sunday conceded defeat and voters vented anger at the government’s handling of the economy. Ahead of the official announcement, Bawumia told reporters that he respects the decision of Ghanaians to vote for change. 'I’ve just called His Excellency John Mahama to congratulate him as president-elect of the Republic of Ghana,' he said at his residence in the capital, Accra. Previously president of Ghana between July 2012 and January 2017, Mahama, 65, acknowledged the call from the ruling party candidate in a post on the X platform, describing his victory as 'emphatic.' He had promised to 'reset' the country on various fronts during a campaign that prioritized the economy and largely appealed to young Ghanaians who saw the vote as a way out of the country’s economic crisis. Celebrations broke out among the supporters of the opposition candidate in parts of the country, including the capital city. Wearing the opposition party's white, green, red and black colors, women and young people danced to music and trumpet blasts on the streets and at the party's national headquarters The election for both the president and members of parliament was held against the backdrop of the country’s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation and was seen as a litmus test for democracy in a region shaken by extremist violence and coups. West Africa's regional bloc of ECOWAS said the election was generally peaceful, a continuing trend in Ghana. Bawumia was running as the flagbearer of the ruling New Patriotic Party, or NPP, which has struggled to resolve the economic crisis under outgoing President Nana Akufo-Addo. Mahama's National Democratic Congress also won the majority in parliament, he said. Mahama's win is viewed as following the latest trend of elections around the world, favoring opposition parties against incumbents, from the United States to European countries — such as Britain and France — as well as South Africa. The former president is 'the only person' who can fix the ailing economy in Ghana, one of West Africa's economic powerhouses, said Jude Agbemava, a policy analyst who voted for him. Like in most other elections in countries where the incumbent lost, the vote in Ghana was about the people making their disaffection known against a government that has lost goodwill, said Seidu Alidu, head of the department of political science at Ghana's University of Legon. 'I think it has to do with the economy, which is largely a bread and butter issue for every Ghanaian,' said Alidu. 'When the people elect you, they require you to do certain things for them. But it was also about the style of governance (because) even in other countries facing economic challenges, governments were being honest with the people, telling them what the reality is, and the steps they have taken to manage it,' he added. —— Asadu reported from Abuja, Nigeria.	https://apnews.com/article/ghana-bawumia-mahama-election-e2d8fafcb85af36fb625480b24ea9535	2024-12-08T01:00:20-08:00	
Syrian government falls to fast-moving rebels, ending 50 years of iron rule by the Assad family	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The Syrian government collapsed early Sunday, falling to a lightning rebel offensive that seized control of the capital of Damascus and sent crowds into the streets to celebrate the end of the Assad family's 50 years of iron rule. Syrian state television aired a video statement by a group of men saying that President Bashar Assad had been overthrown and all prisoners had been set free. The man who read the statement said the opposition group, known as the Operations Room to Conquer Damascus, called on all rebel fighters and citizens to preserve the institutions of 'the free Syrian state.' The statement emerged hours after the head of a Syrian opposition war monitor said Assad had left the country for an undisclosed location, fleeing ahead of insurgents who said they had entered Damascus following a remarkably swift advance across the country. Many of the capital’s residents were in disbelief at the speed at which Assad lost his hold on the country after nearly 14 years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced half the country's prewar population of 23 million and drew in several foreign powers. Celebrations erupt across the capital As daylight broke over Damascus, crowds gathered to pray in the city’s mosques and to celebrate in the squares, chanting 'God is great.' People also chanted anti-Assad slogans and honked car horns. Teen boys picked up weapons that had apparently been discarded by security forces and fired them in the air. Revelers filled Umayyad Square in the city center, where the Defense Ministry is located. Men fired celebratory gunshots into the air and some waved the three-starred Syrian flag that predates the Assad government and was adopted by the revolutionaries. A few kilometers (miles) away, Syrians stormed the presidential palace, tearing up portraits of the toppled president. Soldiers and police officers left their posts and fled, and looters broke into the Defense Ministry. Videos from Damascus showed families wandering into the presidential palace, with some emerging carrying stacks of plates and other household items. 'I did not sleep last night, and I refused to sleep until I heard the news of his fall,' said Mohammed Amer Al-Oulabi, 44, who works in the electricity sector. 'From Idlib to Damascus, it only took them (the opposition forces) a few days, thank God. May God bless them, the heroic lions who made us proud.' Syria’s al-Watan newspaper, which was historically pro-government, wrote: 'We are facing a new page for Syria. We thank God for not shedding more blood. We believe and trust that Syria will be for all Syrians.' The newspaper added that media workers should not be blamed for publishing government statements in the past. 'We only carried out the instructions and published the news they sent us,' it said. 'It quickly became clear now that it was false.' A statement from the Alawite sect — to which Assad belongs and which has formed the core of his base — called on young Syrians to be 'calm, rational and prudent and not to be dragged into what tears apart the unity of our country.' Assad's whereabouts are unknown Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said in a video statement that the government was ready to 'extend its hand' to the opposition and turn its functions over to a transitional government. He later told Saudi television network Al Arabiya that he does not know where Assad and the defense minister are. He said he lost communication with Assad late Saturday. Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The Associated Press that Assad took a flight Sunday from Damascus. A senior diplomat from the United Arab Emirates, which had sought to rehabilitate Assad's image and has welcomed high-profile exiles in recent years, declined to comment on his whereabouts when asked by reporters at a conference in Bahrain. Anwar Gargash said Assad's destination at this point is a 'footnote in history,' comparing it to the long exile of German Kaiser Wilhelm II after World War I. Assad has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war, including a 2013 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of the capital. There was no immediate comment from Iran, which had been Assad’s staunchest supporter. The Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked after apparently having been abandoned. AP footage showed broken windows and documents scattered in the entryway. Entry into Damascus caps lightning advance Opposition forces had not reached Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege. The night before, opposition forces took the central city of Homs, Syria’s third largest, as government forces abandoned it. The city stands at an important intersection between Damascus, the capital, and Syria’s coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus — the Syrian leader’s base of support and home to a Russian strategic naval base. The rebels had already seized the cities of Aleppo and Hama, as well as large parts of the south, in a fast-moving offensive that began Nov. 27. The advances in the past week were by far the largest in recent years by opposition factions, led by a group that has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. In their push to overthrow Assad’s government, the insurgents, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, have met little resistance from the Syrian army. Calls for an orderly transition as it remains unclear what comes next HTS set up a 'salvation government' in 2017 to administer a large region in northwestern Syria under its control. In recent years, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the group’s image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance. 'Golani has made history and sparked hope among millions of Syrians,' said Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and an expert on Syrian groups. 'But he and the rebels now face a formidable challenge ahead. One can only hope they rise to the occasion.' The U.N.’s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called Saturday for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose country is Assad’s chief international backer, said he feels 'sorry for the Syrian people.' The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key regional mediator, hosted an emergency meeting of foreign ministers and top officials from eight countries with interests in Syria late Saturday. The participants included Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Turkey. Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman and an adviser to the prime minister, told reporters that they agreed on the need 'to engage all parties on the ground,' including the HTS, and that the main concern is 'stability and safe transition.' The Israeli military said Sunday it has deployed forces in a demilitarized buffer zone along its northern frontier with Syria following the rebel offensive there. The military, which said it also sent troops to 'other places necessary for its defense,' said the deployment was meant to provide security for residents of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war and the international community, except for the United States, views it as occupied. ___ Associated Press writers Bassem Mroue, Sarah El Deeb and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut, Samar Kassaballi, Omar Sanadiki and Ghaith Alsayed in Damascus, Syria, Jon Gambrell in Manama, Bahrain, Josef Federman in Doha, Qatar, and Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-sweida-daraa-homs-hts-qatar-816e538565d1ae47e016b5765b044d31	2024-12-07T22:23:26-08:00	
Europe's economy needs help. Political chaos in France and Germany means it may be slower in coming	BRUSSELS (AP) — Even before the French and German governments collapsed, Europe’s economy had enough difficulties. Tepid growth and lagging competitiveness versus the U.S. and China. An auto industry that's struggling. Where to find billions for defense against Russia? And now Donald Trump threatening tariffs. Solutions will be harder to find while the two countries that make up almost half of the eurozone economy remain stuck in political paralysis well into 2025. Where once there was the so-called French-German axis to push Europe ahead, now there’s a vacuum. French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned Thursday after losing a vote of confidence, and while President Emmanuel Macron will appoint a successor, the new head of government will lack a majority. Elections are not constitutionally permitted until at least June. Germany's coalition led by Social Democratic Chancellor Olaf Scholz with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats fractured in November, triggering an early election on Feb. 23. Talks to form a new government could last into April. At least Germany's likely new chancellor, conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz, appears open to loosening constitutional restrictions on borrowing to enable pro-growth spending and investment, said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director Europe at Eurasia Group. France, however, could be facing 'complete paralysis on the economic question,' Rahman said. 'It's highly unlikely they're going to get a political equilibrium that has a mandate to implement a credible fiscal course correction.' 'And that's obviously a problem for Europe because it means the great potential of the European economy is not what it otherwise should be, because you don't have France and Germany firing on all cylinders,' he said. Then there's Europe's lagging business environment, dissected by former European Central Bank head Mario Draghi in a report that contains recommendations such as common borrowing to support public investment; EU-wide industrial policy; and integrating financial markets to help startups raise capital. Yet 'nothing can move in Europe without Franco-German alignment,' Rahman said. Meanwhile, Europe's auto industry has sought a review of tough EU emissions standards in 2025 instead of 2026, saying slackening demand for electric cars means they won't be able to avoid heavy fines and that the money would be better used to develop new electric vehicles. Anne-Laure Delatte, a French economist and head of research at the National Center for Scientific Research, said financial markets remain cautious but are not overly alarmed by France’s political instability. But economic weakness in France and Germany could have broader implications for the European Union. 'This could either weaken Europe’s position globally or shift power and influence to other European countries like the Netherlands or Spain, which are performing well at the moment,' she said. France is expected to see growth of 1.1% this year and 0.8% next year, while Germany’s economy is expected to shrink 0.1% this year, the second consecutive year of contraction, and rebound modestly with 0.7% next year. Germany faces headwinds from a shortage of skilled labor, excessive bureaucracy and higher energy prices, and efforts to address those issues have been stalled by squabbling in Scholz’s coalition. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU’s executive arm, is equipped with serious powers, especially on trade, a key EU authority delegated to Brussels by member countries. But there’s only so much von der Leyen can do without political backing from the two biggest member countries, whose national budgets are bigger than the EU's. The most urgent matter may be how to respond to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20. European officials are trying to defuse a potential trade conflict involving new U.S. tariffs or import taxes on European goods that would seriously ding the continent’s export-focused economy. Europe could decide not to retaliate to any U.S. tariffs, thus avoiding a mutually destructive tit-for-tat cycle. The bloc could also commit to buying U.S. liquefied natural gas to mollify Trump, or spend billions more on defense for Ukraine to answer his complaint that European countries don't meet NATO commitments on defense spending. Europe is seeing only modest growth as consumers pummeled by inflation remain cautious about spending. The economy is expected to expand 0.8% this year and 1.3% next year for the 20 EU member countries that use the euro currency, according to the European Commission. While the direct impact on growth is small, the political logjam means Europe is missing an important opportunity to engage Trump, said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank. 'It would be ideal if Europe — at the moment when Trump is not yet in office — would prepare a big offer for Trump, such as: We spend significantly more on defense, if on trade and on Ukraine you don’t disappoint us. This is unfortunately not happening.' 'The risk is that Trump on trade might be tougher on us than otherwise because Germany and France are missing in action,' he said. Von der Leyen can offer to get countries to purchase more U.S. natural gas and remind Trump that the EU could retaliate, but 'the offer that Europe can make to Trump is small, rather than a big offer where there would be German and French money behind it.' The EU commission estimates that as much as 500 billion euros ($528 billion) will be needed over the next decade to help meet the bloc’s security needs. Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius has indicated common defense bonds could raise that enormous sum. But moving ahead without Germany, the bloc's biggest member, is hard to imagine. The big issues such as defense and competitiveness 'require the fiscal and parliamentary resources of the biggest member states and the question is whether Germany and France are in a position to enable that at the European level,' said Rahman. 'I think the answer is probably yes, but I feel a bit less certain than I would have had Germany and France not had this very difficult political time.' ___ McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.

The spiritual heart of Paris awakens: Notre Dame hosts first Mass since 2019 fire	PARIS (AP) — Notre Dame Cathedral on Sunday will host its first Mass since the catastrophic fire of 2019, a moment that transcends religious significance to become a powerful symbol of Paris’ resilience. For Catholics, it marks the revival of the city’s spiritual heart, a place where faith has been nurtured for centuries. For the world, it signals the rebirth of one of world heritage's most famous landmarks. The event is both solemn and historic. Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will preside over the morning Mass, including consecrating a new bronze altar. This liturgy, attended by French President Emmanuel Macron, clergy, dignitaries and guests, is closed to the general public. Nearly 170 bishops from France and around the world are taking part in this celebration, along with one priest from each of the parishes in the Paris diocese and one priest from each of the seven Eastern-rite Catholic churches, accompanied by worshippers from these communities. It is a milestone in Notre Dame’s journey from ruin to resurrection — a process defined by extraordinary craftsmanship, nearly $1 billion in global donations and an unyielding determination to rebuild what seemed lost. Later on Sunday, an evening Mass will welcome members of the public who secured reservations last week. The Associated Press learned that tickets for this service were claimed within 25 minutes, underscoring Notre Dame’s enduring ability to inspire awe, devotion, and curiosity. Public viewing areas along the Seine are expected to draw thousands more who wish to witness this historic moment from afar. What's more extraordinary is that this is taking place in a country with a strong emphasis on secularism and a low rate of church attendance. A sacred space reborn Sunday’s Masses follow Saturday evening’s ceremonial reopening in which Archbishop Ulrich symbolically reopened the cathedral’s massive wooden doors by striking them three times with a crosier crafted from charred beams salvaged from the fire. As the doors swung open, choirs filled the cathedral with song and the cathedral’s great organ — silent since the fire — resounded with majestic melodies. Inside, the restoration reveals a cathedral transformed with now-gleaming limestone walls cleaned of centuries of grime. The restored stained-glass windows project dazzling patterns of color across the nave. 'No one alive has seen the cathedral like this,' said the Rev. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, Notre Dame’s rector. 'It is more than restored — it is reborn.' Sunday morning’s liturgy will consecrate the new altar, a pivotal moment in Notre Dame’s return to full liturgical life. The altar houses relics of five saints tied to Paris, including St. Catherine Labouré and St. Charles de Foucauld, continuing a centuries-old tradition of embedding sacred artifacts at the heart of worship spaces. The consecration, involving holy water, chrism oil, incense and prayer, transforms the altar into a sacred centerpiece of the cathedral. A moment of unity The reopening of Notre Dame is more than a religious milestone, it is a moment of cultural and national unity. Macron, who vowed to restore the cathedral within five years after the fire, attended Saturday’s ceremonies and called the project 'a jolt of hope' for France, a nation often divided by political crises. The Sunday Masses underscore Notre Dame’s dual role as a place of worship and a symbol of communal resilience. They also ensure that members of the broader Catholic community can partake in the cathedral’s spiritual revival. 'This was not just about restoring a building. It was about restoring the heart of the nation,' Dumas said. Challenges overcome The path to restoration has been fraught with challenges. Lead contamination forced work to pause, and the COVID-19 pandemic added delays. Yet the project, overseen by architect Philippe Villeneuve, has been hailed as a triumph of human ingenuity and collective resolve. Cutting-edge fire prevention systems, including thermal cameras and a misting system, have been installed to safeguard the cathedral’s future. Villeneuve described the effort as 'restoring not just a building but the soul of a nation,' emphasizing the personal and national significance of the work. A sacred future and ‘octave’ With its spire once again piercing the Parisian sky, Notre Dame is poised to reclaim its role as a global beacon of faith and art. The cathedral, which previously welcomed 12 million annual visitors, is expected to draw 15 million in its new chapter. This monumental revival is not confined to a single day. Ulrich has announced an 'octave' of celebrations—eight days of special religious services, each with its own theme, running through Dec. 15. These daily liturgies, open to diverse groups from local parishioners to international pilgrims, emphasize Notre Dame’s role as a unifying spiritual hub.	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-1st-mass-fire-restoration-273a44fbce8465561e558e1029457eda	2024-12-07T20:46:48-08:00	
Reindeer' volunteers bring holiday magic to Ukrainian children living on the frontlines	IZIUM, Ukraine (AP) — Hopes for victory, a swift end to the war and prayers for their loved ones' survival or return from Russian captivity are among the wishes scattered throughout letters sent to a volunteer group by Ukrainian children living in frontline areas. While the volunteers, who are named reindeer after the magical beasts that pull Santa’s sleigh, cannot fulfill many of these dreams, they strive to deliver on the simpler ones, such as requests for power banks to help families endure outages, bicycles, books, and even pets. Every winter, the volunteers travel to heavily damaged cities to deliver gifts and ensure that, despite the war, Ukrainian children can celebrate the holiday season just like their peers around the world. This year, the group received 2,310 letters, according to project manager Inna Achkasova from the NGO Ukrainian Frontiers, who launched the St. Nicholas’ Reindeers initiative in 2015. The children’s wishes are published on the project’s website. Donors affectionately known as magicians then choose a letter and buy the requested gift to make that child's dreams come true. The reindeer then deliver those gifts. 'Children are those who have no choice whatsoever. No one asks them whether they want to stay or leave,' says project psychologist Kateryna Shutalova. 'What happens to them is never their choice. And this makes them the most vulnerable.' But every child gets only one childhood, even if it’s shaped by war. That’s why, in their letters, the horrors that have impacted their lives coexist with wishes similar to those of children everywhere. 'My father is in captivity, and I live with my mother and brother,' one boy wrote in his letter. He continued: 'I love playing football and practice it professionally. I want a leather football.' Volunteers sift through all the letters, enduring the tragic stories of each child, to sort and deliver the gifts correctly. Among the writers are children who have lost loved ones to shelling, endured Russian occupation, seen their homes destroyed, have parents serving on the frontlines, or were forced to flee to escape the war. 'What struck me wasn’t their wishes but how deeply children feel the need to tell their stories,' Shutalova says. Wearing reindeer antlers, the volunteers set out on their journey on Dec. 6, when Ukraine celebrates St. Nicholas Day. Their journey is expected to last until mid-January. On a frosty morning in Kharkiv, covered by the season’s first snow, a team of volunteers departs in two buses filled with gifts, headed for the formerly Russian-occupied city of Izium, around 55 kilometers (35 miles) from the frontline. At first, when the celebration has started, the children observe cautiously, their expressions somber, but that mood doesn't last. With each activity, they became more cheerful and engaged. One of them is 9-year-old Alina Soboleva, who remains detached despite the volunteers’ efforts. She watches the festivities unfold with a quiet gaze. Her grandmother, Svitlana Lokotosh, explains that Alina has been withdrawn since witnessing the deaths of her mother and other grandmother in a shelling in the courtyard of their home. Alina had been watching through the window as her mother spoke on the phone. When the shell struck, a fragment hit her mother in the neck. Her grandmother rushed outside to help and was killed by another shell. In her letter, Alina asked for two pet mice. She said it was her dream. 'Our only wish is for peace and quiet,' says Lokotosh, who took Alina in after her mother’s death. 'So the children don’t have to be afraid.' Shutalova explains that parents often find it hard to talk to their children about the war. They’re either afraid, lack the emotional resources, or are overwhelmed by their feelings. 'But for children to process what they’ve been through, they need to talk, play, and express those emotions,' she says. At the celebration, parents stand against the walls, smiling as their children laugh and play despite having endured so much at such a young age. Among them is Anna Bolharska, a 32-year-old mother of two. Her father-in-law was killed and her brother-in-law was injured during the occupation. In the spring of 2022, she and her children fled Izium amid relentless shelling, only returning after Ukrainian forces liberated the city in September that year. 'I don’t like to remember those times. We try to move forward because dwelling on it is too hard mentally,' Bolharska says. 'We try not to remind the children and to keep them distracted.' Her 9-year-old daughter, Myroslava Bolharska, dreams of becoming a veterinarian. In her letter, she asked for a guitar. 'During the war it seems everyone’s dreams have changed — to wish for the war to end,' she wrote. The reindeers' winter journey will take them to over 40 towns in the coming weeks. They hope to realize many dreams and bring joy to the kids, even though some of their wishes are impossible to fulfill. 'Some children wrote in their letters that they want their childhood back,' project co-founder Inna Achkasova says, adding that the reindeer volunteers aim to ensure that every child feels seen, heard and loved. ___ Associated Press journalist Hanna Arhirova contributed to this report in Kyiv, Ukraine. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-children-55edecb85450421ba69eda70c17ed307	2024-12-07T20:13:05-08:00	
The fall of Bashar Assad after 14 years of war in Syria brings to an end a decades-long dynasty	BEIRUT (AP) — The fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government Sunday brought to a dramatic close his nearly 14-year struggle to hold onto power as his country fragmented amid a brutal civil war that became a proxy battlefield for regional and international powers. Assad’s downfall came as a stark contrast to his first months as Syria’s unlikely president in 2000, when many hoped he would be a young reformer after three decades of his father’s iron grip. Only 34 years old, the Western-educated ophthalmologist was a rather geeky tech-savvy fan of computers with a gentle demeanor. But when faced with protests against his rule that erupted in March 2011, Assad turned to the brutal tactics of his father in an attempt to crush them. As the uprising hemorrhaged into an outright civil war, he unleashed his military to blast opposition-held cities, with support from allies Iran and Russia. International rights groups and prosecutors alleged widespread use of torture and extrajudicial executions in Syria's government-run detention centers. The Syrian war has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country’s pre-war population of 23 million. As the uprising spiraled into a civil war, millions of Syrians fled across the borders into Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon and on to Europe. His departure brings an end to the Assad family rule, spanning just under 54 years. With no clear successor, it throws the country into further uncertainty. Until recently, it seemed that Assad was almost out of the woods. The long-running conflict had settled along frozen conflict lines in recent years, with Assad's government regaining control of most of Syria's territory while the northwest remained under the control of opposition groups and the northeast under Kurdish control. While Damascus remained under crippling Western sanctions, neighboring countries had begun to resign themselves to Assad's continued hold on power. The Arab League reinstated Syria's membership last year, and Saudi Arabia in May announced the appointment of its first ambassador to Syria since severing ties with Damascus 12 years earlier. However, the geopolitical tide turned quickly with a surprise offensive launched by opposition groups based in northwest Syria in late November. Government forces quickly collapsed, while Assad's allies, preoccupied by other conflicts — including Russia's war in Ukraine and the yearlong wars between Israel and the Iran-backed militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas — appeared reluctant to forcefully intervene. Assad's whereabouts were not clear Sunday, amid reports he had left the country as insurgents took control of the Syrian capital. He came to power in 2000 by a twist of fate. His father had been cultivating Bashar’s oldest brother Basil as his successor, but in 1994 Basil was killed in a car crash in Damascus. Bashar was brought home from his ophthalmology practice in London, put through military training and elevated to the rank of colonel to establish his credentials so he could one day rule. When Hafez Assad died in 2000, parliament quickly lowered the presidential age requirement from 40 to 34. Bashar’s elevation was sealed by a nationwide referendum, in which he was the only candidate. Hafez, a lifelong military man, ruled the country for nearly 30 years during which he set up a Soviet-style centralized economy and kept such a stifling hand over dissent that Syrians feared even to joke about politics to their friends. He pursued a secular ideology that sought to bury sectarian differences under Arab nationalism and the image of heroic resistance to Israel. He formed an alliance with the Shiite clerical leadership in Iran, sealed Syrian domination over Lebanon and set up a network of Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups. Bashar initially seemed completely unlike his strongman father. Tall and lanky with a slight lisp, he had a quiet, gentle demeanor. His only official position before becoming president was head of the Syrian Computer Society. His wife, Asma al-Akhras, whom he married several months after taking office, was attractive, stylish and British-born. The young couple, who eventually had three children, seemed to shun trappings of power. They lived in an apartment in the upscale Abu Rummaneh district of Damascus, as opposed to a palatial mansion like other Arab leaders. Initially upon coming to office, Assad freed political prisoners and allowed more open discourse. In the 'Damascus Spring,' salons for intellectuals emerged where Syrians could discuss art, culture and politics to a degree impossible under his father. But after 1,000 intellectuals signed a public petition calling for multiparty democracy and greater freedoms in 2001 and others tried to form a political party, the salons were snuffed out by the feared secret police who jailed dozens of activists. Instead of a political opening, Assad turned to economic reforms. He slowly lifted economic restrictions, let in foreign banks, threw the doors open to imports and empowered the private sector. Damascus and other cities long mired in drabness saw a flourishing of shopping malls, new restaurants and consumer goods. Tourism swelled. Abroad, he stuck to the line his father had set, based on the alliance with Iran and a policy of insisting on a full return of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, although in practice Assad never militarily confronted Israel. In 2005, he suffered a heavy blow with the loss of Syria’s decades-old control over neighboring Lebanon after the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri. With many Lebanese accusing Damascus of being behind the slaying, Syria was forced to withdraw its troops from the country and a pro-American government came into power. At the same time, the Arab world became split into two camps - one of U.S.-allied, Sunni-led countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, the other Syria and Shiite-led Iran with their ties to Hezbollah and Palestinian militants. Throughout, Assad relied for largely on the same power base at home as his father: his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam comprising around 10 percent of the population. Many of the positions in his government went to younger generations of the same families that had worked for his father. Drawn in as well were the new middle class created by his reforms, including prominent Sunni merchant families. Assad also turned to his own family. His younger brother Maher headed the elite Presidential Guard and would lead the crackdown against the uprising. Their sister Bushra was a strong voice in his inner circle, along with her husband Deputy Defense Minister Assef Shawkat, until he was killed in a 2012 bombing. Bashar’s cousin, Rami Makhlouf, became the country’s biggest businessman, heading a financial empire before the two had a falling out that led to Makhlouf being pushed aside. Assad also increasingly entrusted key roles to his wife, Asma, before she announced in May that she was undergoing treatment for leukemia and stepped out of the limelight. When protests erupted in Tunisa and Egypt, eventually toppling their rulers, Assad dismissed the possibility of the same occurring in his country, insisting his regime was more in tune with its people. After the Arab Spring wave did move to Syria, his security forces staged a brutal crackdown while Assad consistently denied he was facing a popular revolt, instead blaming 'foreign-backed terrorists' trying to destabilize his regime. His rhetoric struck a chord with many in Syria’s minority groups - including Christians, Druze and Shiites - as well as some Sunnis who feared the prospect of rule by Sunni extremists even more than they disliked Assad’s authoritarian rule. Ironically, on Feb. 26, 2001, two days after the fall of Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak to protesters and just before the wave of Arab Spring protests swept into Syria — in an email released by Wikileaks as part of a cache in 2012 — Assad e-mailed a joke he’d run across mocking the Egyptian leader’s stubborn refusal to step down. 'NEW WORD ADDED TO DICTIONARY: Mubarak (verb): To stick something, or to glue something. ... Mubarak (adjective): slow to learn or understand,' it read.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-bashar-assad-war-1468a97ff95bb782f5933856d99c9a8d	2024-12-07T20:11:00-08:00	
Taiwan reports 14 Chinese warships and 4 balloons near the island	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China sent 14 warships, seven military aircraft and four balloons near Taiwan between Saturday and Sunday, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry, as Beijing ramps up pressure on the island it claims as its own. China’s military activities come amid speculation Beijing might organize military drills around the island in response to Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te’s recent visit to Pacific allies, including U.S. stops in Hawaii and Guam. China claims Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy of 23 million people, as its own territory, and bristles at other countries’ formal exchanges with Taiwan. The United States, like most countries, doesn’t recognize Taiwan as a country but is its main unofficial backer and sells it arms. The Chinese government has pledged to annex Taiwan, through military force if necessary, and sends ships and military planes near the island almost daily. The 14 warships, seven military planes and four balloons were reported over 24 hours between 6 a.m. on Saturday and 6 a.m. on Sunday, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. The ministry said six of the aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial demarcation zone between Taiwan and China. One of the balloons brushed over the island’s northern tip, according to the ministry. Lai on Friday called on China to refrain from threats and said Beijing’s military exercises 'will not be able to win the respect' of neighboring countries. Lai’s first overseas trip since taking office in May included visits to the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau, three of the 12 countries that have diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The rest of the world, including the U.S., has official ties with China. Lai’s stops in Hawaii and Guam — from where he had phone calls with U.S. Congress leaders — angered China, which opposes U.S. arms sales and military assistance to Taiwan. There was widespread speculation China might organize war games around Taiwan in response to the visit, though it was unclear when they might start. In October, China held drills around Taiwan involving a record one-day total of 153 aircraft, 14 navy vessels and 12 Chinese government ships in response to a Lai speech in which he rejected Beijing’s claims over Taiwan. Beijing has labeled Lai a separatist and refuses to speak to him.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-balloons-navy-ships-aircraft-fb944dbf5350400a4371380885c028b3	2024-12-07T19:22:10-08:00	
Hemingway look-alikes visit Cuba and some of the late writer's favorite places	HAVANA (AP) — Ernest Hemingway has returned to Cuba... in a way. Eighteen white-bearded men who resemble the late U.S. author arrived in Havana to visit some of his favorite places when he lived on the island decades ago. The members of the Hemingway Look-alike Society on Saturday visited the author’s favorite bar in Havana, 'El Floridita,' where the music immediately picked up, and tourists and locals gathered around to take photos. Earlier, they went to the San Francisco de Paula municipality and Finca Vigia, a former home to Hemingway that is now a museum. There, they played baseball with children. 'That is the reason for our visit: the kids and their families,' said Joe Maxy, from Tennessee, who is one of the bearded men honoring the author of 'The Old Man and the Sea.' The visit comes as Cuba and the United States are in the midst of tense relations. Washington maintains sanctions on the islands, and things are unlikely to change as Donald Trump prepares to assume the presidency in January. After former President Barack Obama lifted some restrictions in 2017, Trump largely shut down U.S. cooperation with Cuba and hit the country with new sanctions. The U.S. generally prohibits Americans from traveling to Cuba for tourism, although it gives some permits. The look-alikes arrived in Havana on Friday when they took part in a ceremony at the Hemingway marina in honor of Diana Nyad, the first swimmer to cross the Gulf of Mexico from Cuba to Florida, and they will leave the island on Sunday. Hemingway lived in Cuba from 1939 to 1960.	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-hemingway-author-havana-lookalike-1c6e7a08bc45edd216810bead3cecd6b	2024-12-07T18:51:38-08:00	
South Korean prosecutors detain ex-defense chief over martial law imposition, reports say	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean prosecutors on Sunday detained a former defense minister who allegedly recommended last week’s brief but stunning martial law imposition to President Yoon Suk Yeol, making him the first figure detained over the case, news reports said. The reported development came a day after Yoon avoided an opposition-led bid to impeach him in parliament, with most ruling party lawmakers boycotting a floor vote to prevent the two-thirds majority needed to suspend his presidential powers. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party said it will prepare a new impeachment motion against Yoon. On Sunday, ex-Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun voluntarily appeared at a Seoul prosecutors’ office, where he had his mobile phone confiscated and was detained, Yonhap news agency reported. Other South Korean media carried similar reports, saying Kim was moved to a Seoul detention center. The reports said police were searching Kim's former office and residence on Sunday. Repeated calls to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office and the National Police Agency were unanswered. An official at the detention facility in eastern Seoul hung up the phone when The Associated Press called. Yoon accepted Kim’s resignation offer on Thursday after opposition parties submitted a separate impeachment motion against him. Kim is a central figure in Yoon’s martial law enforcement, which led to special forces troops encircling the National Assembly building and army helicopters hovering over it. The military withdrew after the parliament unanimously voted to overturn Yoon’s decree, forcing his Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Wednesday. Park Se-hyun, chief of the Seoul High Prosecutors Office, said in a televised statement that the prosecution was investigating the martial law incident with a 62-member team, including both public and military prosecutors, and pledged a thorough probe that would 'leave no suspicions.' In Kim’s impeachment motion document, the Democratic Party and other opposition parties accused him of proposing martial law to Yoon. Ruling People Power Party leader Han Dong-hun made a similar comment on Kim’s role. Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho told parliament that Kim Yong Hyun ordered the deployment of troops to the National Assembly. The Democratic Party called Yoon’s martial law imposition 'unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or a coup.' It has filed complaints with police against at least nine people, including Yoon and Kim, over the alleged rebellion. In a statement distributed by the Defense Ministry on Wednesday, Kim said that 'all troops who performed duties related to martial law were acting on my instructions, and all responsibility lies with me.' Prosecutor General Shim Woo Jung told reporters on Thursday the prosecution plans to investigate the rebellion charges against Yoon following complaints filed by the opposition. While the president mostly has immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. It wasn’t immediately clear how the prosecution plans to proceed with an investigation into Yoon. The Defense Ministry said it has suspended three top military commanders over their alleged involvement in the martial law imposition. They were among those facing the opposition-raised rebellion allegations. Han said Sunday the ruling party will try to make sure that investigations of those involved in the martial law imposition would be conducted in a transparent manner. But the Democratic Party said authorities should immediately arrest Yoon and all others implicated in the case. On Saturday, Yoon issued an apology over the martial law decree, saying he won’t shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration and promising not to make another attempt to impose it. He said would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country’s political turmoil, 'including matters related to my term in office.' Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid scandals involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a 'den of criminals' bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.' The declaration of martial law was the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea. The turmoil has paralyzed South Korean politics and sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners like the U.S. and Japan. The scrapping of Yoon's impeachment motion is expected to intensify protests calling for his ouster and deepen political chaos in South Korea, with a survey suggesting a majority of South Koreans support the president’s impeachment. Yoon’s martial law declaration drew criticism from the ruling party, but it is determined to oppose Yoon’s impeachment apparently because it fears losing the presidency to liberals. In a joint address with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Sunday, Han, the ruling party chief, said the PPP will work with the government to chart out Yoon’s early and orderly exit from office in a way that minimizes confusion, but he didn't say when that would happen. The ruling party chief claimed Yoon will not be involved in state affairs, including foreign policy, but it wasn’t immediately clear whether that would align with the constitution. Han Duck-soo said the government will work with the ruling party on state affairs but didn't make any comments that supported Han Dong-hun's remarks on Yoon's early exit or his exclusion from state affairs. Yoon's presidential office didn't immediately respond. The Democratic Party criticized Han Dong-hun’s comments, saying that the exclusion of an incumbent president from state affairs isn’t supported by the constitution. Kim Min-seok, head of a party task force on the martial law case, said that Yoon's immediate impeachment is the only way to resolve the turmoil. He said Han Dong-hun, who holds no government post, has no constitutional rights to be involved in handling state affairs.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-defense-minister-5bb4ed3108a9c7fb0ff1d01df924bf0b	2024-12-07T17:19:04-08:00

Opposition fighters are at Damascus' gates. Who are they and what now?	Opposition fighters are closing in on Syria’s capital in a swiftly developing crisis that has taken much of the world by surprise. Syria's army has abandoned key cities with little resistance. Nervous residents in Damascus describe security forces on the streets. The state news agency has been forced to deny rumors that President Bashar Assad has left the country. Who are these opposition fighters? If they enter Damascus after taking some of Syria’s largest cities, what then? Here’s a look at the stunning reversal of fortune for Assad and his government in just the past 10 days, and what might lie ahead as Syria’s 13-year civil war reignites. The aim? Overthrow the government This is the first time that opposition forces have reached the outskirts of the Syrian capital since 2018, when the country’s troops recaptured the area following a yearslong siege. The approaching fighters are led by the most powerful insurgent group in Syria, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, along with an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Both have been entrenched in the northwest. They launched the shock offensive on Nov. 27 with gunmen capturing Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, and the central city of Hama, the fourth largest. The HTS has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. But the group said in recent years it cut ties with al-Qaida, and experts say HTS has sought to remake itself in recent years by focusing on promoting civilian government in their territory as well as military action. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday from Syria that the aim of the offensive is to overthrow Assad’s government. Possible rifts ahead The HTS and Syrian National Army have been allies at times and rivals at times, and their aims might diverge. The Turkish-backed militias also have an interest in creating a buffer zone near the Turkish border to keep away Kurdish militants at odds with Ankara. Turkey has been a main backer of the fighters seeking to overthrow Assad but more recently has urged reconciliation, and Turkish officials have strongly rejected claims of any involvement in the current offensive. Whether the HTS and the Syrian National Army will work together if they succeed in overthrowing Assad or turn on each other again is a major question. Others take advantage While the flash offensive against Syria’s government began in the north, armed opposition groups have also mobilized elsewhere. The southern areas of Sweida and Daraa have both been taken locally. Sweida is the heartland of Syria’s Druze religious minority and had been the site of regular anti-government protests even after Assad seemingly consolidated his control over the area. Daraa is a Sunni Muslim area that was widely seen as the cradle of the uprising against Assad’s rule that erupted in 2011. Daraa was recaptured by Syrian government troops in 2018, but rebels remained in some areas. In recent years, Daraa was in a state of uneasy quiet under a Russian-mediated ceasefire deal. And much of Syria's east is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led group backed by the United States that in the past has clashed with most other armed groups in the country. Syria's government now has control of only three of 14 provincial capitals: Damascus, Latakia and Tartus. What’s next? Much depends on Assad’s next moves and his forces' will to fight the rebels. A commander with the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, posted on the Telegram messaging app that opposition forces have started carrying out the 'final stage' of their offensive by encircling Damascus. And Syrian troops withdrew Saturday from much of the central city of Homs, Syria's third largest, according to a pro-government outlet and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. If that city is captured, the link would be cut between Damascus, Assad’s seat of power, and the coastal region where he enjoys wide support. 'Homs to the coastal cities will be a very huge red line politically and socially. Politically, if this line is crossed, then we are talking about the end of the entire Syria, the one that we knew in the past,' said a Damascus resident, Anas Joudeh. Assad appears to be largely on his own as allies Russia and Iran are distracted by other conflicts and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah has been weakened by its war with Israel, now under a fragile ceasefire. The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, seeks urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an 'orderly political transition,' saying the situation is changing by the minute. He met with foreign ministers and senior diplomats from eight key countries including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran on the sidelines of the Doha Summit.

Nobel Literature Prize winner Han Kang talks about how writing connects her to readers	STOCKHOLM (AP) — South Korean author Han Kang, this year’s winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, spoke passionately on Saturday about the process of writing and her evolution as a writer — all the way back to when she was 8 years old. Han, the first Asian woman and the first South Korean writer to win the Nobel literature prize, was delivering her Nobel lecture in Stockholm, the Swedish capital. She described in a soft-spoken voice how in January she found an old shoe box containing several several diaries dating back to her childhood. Among the stack of journals, she found a poem about love she had written. 'The lines penned by my eight-year-old self were suitably innocent and unpolished,' she said. Han was awarded for her novels, including 'The Vegetarian' and 'Human Acts,' that explore the pain of being human and the scars of Korea’s turbulent history. She is known for her experimental and often disturbing stories that incorporate the brutal moments of modern South Korea. The Nobel Committee praised Han 'for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life.' The author spoke Saturday about how she involves all of her senses in the creation of some of her best known works. 'When I write, I use my body,' she said. 'I use all the sensory details of seeing, of listening, of smelling, of tasting, of experiencing tenderness and warmth and cold and pain, of noticing my heart racing and my body needing food and water, of walking and running, of feeling the wind and rain and snow on my skin, of holding hands.' In her lecture she expressed gratitude at those moments when she senses that she was able to transmit those 'vivid sensations' to her readers. 'In these moments I experience ... the thread of language that connects us, how my questions are relating with readers through that electric, living thing,' Han said as she finished her lecture. 'I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all those who have connected with me through that thread, as well as to all those who may come to do so.' Han delivered her speech in Korean, but a translation into English and Swedish was posted on the Nobel Prize's website. There will be a ceremony and banquet for her and the other laureates on Tuesday Nov. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death.	https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-literature-han-kang-lecture-4737e87ea19c791da046236de9736335	2024-12-07T08:44:30-08:00	
How 'Mufasa' rose with Aaron Pierre and Blue Ivy's voices along with new Lin-Manuel Miranda music	SAN DIEGO (AP) — When Aaron Pierre was cast as Mufasa, the weight of following in the late James Earl Jones' legendary footsteps was enough to rattle any actor. But instead of letting the pressure roar too loudly, he harnessed his nerves to breathe fresh life into his young lion character. 'I had a lot of nerves and I actually think those nerves served me because that is what the adolescent version of that lion is,' Pierre said in an interview Friday at the San Diego Safari Park about his leading role in 'Mufasa: The Lion King.' He took the reins as the new voice of Mufasa after Jones played the iconic King Mufasa in both the 1994 and 2019 versions of Disney's 'The Lion King.' Here are some details and insights about 'Mufasa' ahead of its release in theaters on Dec. 20. First, a tribute to James Earl Jones Jones’ voice isn’t heard in the movie, but it opens with a brief tribute to the beloved actor, who died in September. Pierre had hoped to meet Jones for the first time, but didn’t get the chance. Now, he’s determined to honor his idol by building on his character’s legacy. 'I imagine that an individual experiencing those things might have moments of not being sure and I wasn’t sure about myself,' he said. 'Aaron wasn’t sure about Aaron going into this, I tried to channel those emotions as opposed to being something that prohibited me as something that propelled me forward. I gave it my best. I hope that I was able to serve James Earl Jones and honor James Earl Jones and the character.' Mufasa’s heart-wrenching origin story The live-action prequel offers a fresh exploration into Mufasa's origin. After the events in the 2019 film, Rafiki takes on the role of a storytelling sage, weaving the untold tale of Mufasa for Kiara — the spirited granddaughter of Mufasa and the daughter of Simba and Nala. The duo Timon and Pumbaa stick around for Rafiki’s flashback. Rafiki reveals that Mufasa’s cubhood wasn’t all royal ease and sunlit horizons. After a heart-wrenching tragedy of being separated from his parents, young Mufasa finds himself lost and alone. 'He’s been separated from his family. He’s an orphan. He’s been ostracized, he’s been dismissed. He’s been degraded,' said Pierre, the British actor who's starred in the 'Genius: MLK/X' series and the Netflix action hit 'Rebel Ridge.' Mufasa was a stray until fate led him to Taka, the compassionate heir of a different pride. Taka, with his fierce yet nurturing mother, offer the displaced cub a new beginning in their pride. Over the years, Mufasa and Taka’s bond grows from camaraderie to brotherhood. But their loyalty is put to the ultimate test during a journey that uncovers Mufasa’s true origins and rightful kingdom as well as the reasons behind Taka becoming Scar. 'There was a bit of Taka resting on the privilege that he was supposed to be afforded,' said Kelvin Harrison Jr., who plays Taka. He drew some inspiration from Jeremy Irons, who voiced the villainous Scar in the 1994 original. 'There’s a little bit of ‘Well, it seems like I need to command attention,'' continued Harrison, who starred in 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' and 'Waves.' 'It seems like the only way to win over a pride of anything is to assert dominance. That was Taka’s version of that, which ended up being a staple as Scar.' Beyonce’s daughter Blue Ivy makes her feature film debut Beyoncé might have a small role in 'Mufasa,' but her daughter Blue Ivy Carter is the family's shining star in the film. The eldest daughter of Beyoncé and Jay-Z makes her feature film debut, lending her voice as Kiara, the daughter of Simba and Nala, who is portrayed by her superstar mother. 'She came into this prepared,' said director Barry Jenkins, who heard Blue Ivy's narration on the audio book of Oscar winner Matthew Cherry's 'Hair Love.' He said the 12-year-old phenom displayed some skills that could not be ignored. 'She was the main character and this whole movie starts with just voices,' Jenkins said. 'They’re doing almost like a radio play and hearing that quality in her voice, I thought, ‘Oh, I think that’s my character,’' he continued. 'Then she auditioned and it was clear that she is my character.' While recording for Kiara's character, Jenkins said Blue Ivy, who won a Grammy for co-writing her mom’s 2019 hit 'Brown Skin Girl,' was a pro. 'I don’t know Blue Ivy’s life, but I imagine she grows up a little bit different than everyone else,' he said. 'I think because of that she’s grown up and so she had all these wells of understanding, experience, emotional knowledge that she brought to the character. She was awesome.' Jenkins likens the Kiara character to the many children who will see the movie. In the film, she eagerly listens to John Kani's Rafiki tell her grandfather's origin story while Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) accompany them in a cave. 'They get to see themselves in that character and she’s learning the story about Mufasa,' Jenkins said. 'She’s learning how he went through the same trials and tribulations, the same growth as she is.' Blue Ivy did not record her vocals with the three cast members, but Rogen applauded her skills. 'She was great,' he said. 'I could have sworn we were in that cave with her.' Lin-Manuel Miranda’s secret ingredient When Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote new songs for the film, he often leaned on the famous Billie Jean King quote: 'Pressure is a privilege.' Miranda was up for the challenge to leave his own imprint on the storied franchise much like his predecessors. He said there are seven new songs on the soundtrack, which will be released Dec. 13. 'I was emboldened by the fact that there’s the ’94 original which is like an immortal classic,' said Miranda, the 'Hamilton' creator and Grammy, Emmy and Tony winner. 'But there’s also the Broadway musical and there’s also Beyoncé‘s album ‘The Lion King: The Gift,' which I think expanded the musical vocabulary of what can be a ‘Lion King’ song. So I felt a lot of space to create because I felt like ‘Lion King’ is practically a genre of music and there was room to play and find new stuff within it.' Miranda said his 'secret ingredient' was Lebo M, who's known for his opening vocals on the classic melody 'Circle of Life.' He said his lyrics were inspired by the script. 'His harmonies, the choral arrangements he created for the Broadway musical and for the show, I think were so important to the success of the music of these movies,' Miranda said. 'I think it was exciting for him to work on new songs.'	https://apnews.com/article/musfasa-lion-king-aaron-pierre-blue-ivy-d900717873cb2fe7daa23de278fc3422	2024-12-07T08:08:05-08:00	
Pope Francis presides over ceremony for new cardinals with wide bruise on his chin	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis was seen with a significant bruise on his chin Saturday, but presided over a ceremony to install new cardinals without apparent problems. A Vatican spokesman said later Saturday that the bruise was caused by a contusion on Friday morning, when Francis hit a night stand with his chin. The pontiff, who turns 88 later this month, appeared slightly fatigued, but carried on as normal with the scheduled ceremony to create 21 new cardinals in St. Peter's Basilica. Francis has suffered several health problems in recent years and now uses a wheelchair due to knee and back pain. In 2017, while on a trip to Colombia, Francis sported a black eye after he hit his head on a support bar when his popemobile stopped short.	https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-bruise-chin-health-cardinals-consistory-a4329e36f9e36809511f0b461155b396	2024-12-07T07:46:07-08:00	
The Latest: The famed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris reopens to great fanfare	PARIS (AP) — Notre Dame is reopening its doors for the first time since a fire in 2019 nearly destroyed Paris' beloved 12th-century cathedral. World leaders — including President-elect Donald Trump, America’s first lady Jill Biden, Britain’s Prince William and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — gathered Saturday among more than 2,500 guests to celebrate the restoration of the landmark widely considered to be a pinnacle of French architectural heritage. Saturday's events started with Archbishop Laurent Ulrich symbolically reopening Notre Dame’s grand wooden doors with three resounding knocks. Following the 2019 fire, nearly $1 billion in donations poured in from around the world, a tribute to its worldwide appeal. For more of AP’s coverage on Notre Dame, visit https://apnews.com/hub/notre-dame-cathedral ___ Here's the latest: Macron welcomes Trump to Paris with presidential pomp, includes him in talks with Zelenskyy French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Donald Trump to Paris on Saturday with a full a dose of presidential pomp as the two held a hastily arranged meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy before the grand reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. The once and future American president was warmly embraced by Macron upon arriving at the Elysee Palace. 'It’s a great honor for French people to welcome you five years later,' Macron told Trump. 'Welcome back again.' Trump said it was a 'very great honor' to be there, while hinting at challenges ahead. 'It certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now. And we’ll be talking about that.' An actual red carpet was rolled out for Trump as Macron bestowed the kind of full diplomatic welcome that France offers sitting American presidents, complete with trumpets blaring and members of the Republican Guard in full uniform. It was a clear sign that even though Trump doesn’t take office until Jan. 20, 2025, Macron and other European leaders are already working to win his favor and treating him as America’s representative on the world stage. President Joe Biden declined an invitation to attend the Notre Dame ceremony, marking five years after a devastating fire, and first lady Jill Biden was the official U.S. representative. The White House cited a scheduling conflict. Macron and leaders across Europe are trying to persuade the president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion. Macron’s office said the war, along with conflicts in the Mideast, would be discussed. Great organ of Notre Dame fills reborn cathedral with awesome sound With a first deep rumble like a grumbling giant, the great organ of Notre Dame has awakened from its more than 5-year silence, its awesome sound once again filling the reborn cathedral. Archbishop Laurent Ulrich roused it from its long sleep, intoning the words 'wake up, organ, sacred instrument.' To which the gargantuan organ, perched high above the congregation, responded with a low rumble, like a dragon clearing its throat. Then, the four organists who took turns formulating improvised responses to the archbishop’s prompts literally pulled out the stops and let rip. Eight times, the archbishop addressed the instrument. Eight times, it responded with a symphony of notes and sounds — as though rediscovering and relearning the joy and power from its nearly 8,000 pipes. Macron praises the bravery of fire fighters Macron praised the bravery of fire fighters and recalled how, at 10:47 p.m. on the night of April 15, 2019, the first message came through saying that the inferno was being beaten. 'Notre Dame of Paris was saved. Disfigured but saved,' he said. Moving onto the rebuilding effort, he detailed the toil of the more than 2,000 workers and artisans who worked to a 5-year reconstruction deadline set by Macron. 'We decided to rebuild Notre Dame of Paris even more beautiful than before.' Macron delivered the entire speech in French despite the multinational mix of VIP guests. At the end, Trump and Macron shook hands. Macron expresses ‘gratitude’ to those who saved, helped and rebuilt Notre Dame Cathedral French President Emmanuel Macron expressed 'gratitude' Saturday to those who saved, helped and rebuilt Notre Dame Cathedral. 'I stand before you ... to express the gratitude of the French nation,' Macron said at the reopening ceremony. 'Tonight, the bells of Notre Dame are ringing again. And in a moment, the organ will awaken,' sending the 'music of hope' to Parisians, France and the world. Macron spoke in front of more than 2,500 guests invited to celebrate the restoration of Paris’ 12th-century cathedral which was nearly destroyed by a fire in 2019. They included world leaders like President-elect Donald Trump, U.S. first lady Jill Biden, Britain’s Prince William and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Guests give standing ovation after short film documenting the rebuilding efforts Notre Dame echoed to the sound of a sustained standing ovation after the showing of a short movie that documented the gargantuan rebuilding effort by thousands of workers who labored — and ultimately met — a 5-year deadline set by French President Emmanuel Macron in the aftermath of the blaze. Outside, the word 'MERCI' — thank you — was projected against the cathedral’s iconic western facade in multiple languages. The movie showed the terrible wounds left by the inferno — the gaping holes torn into its vaulted ceilings and the burned roof. But that was followed by images of all types of artisans, many using traditional hand-craft techniques, who collectively restored Notre Dame to look better now than ever. 'We went from night to light,' said one of the workers in the movie. Notre Dame's largest bell, the 13-ton Emmanuel, rings out The congregation inside the huge cathedral was ghostly quiet as its largest bell, the 13-ton Emmanuel, rang out into the Paris night, signaling the start of the ceremony. Inside, Elon Musk gazed up at the renovated vaulted ceilings. Jill Biden was the last VIP welcomed outside by President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, before Archbishop Laurent Ulrich then took over. 'Brothers and sisters, let us enter now into Notre Dame,' he said as he stood outside, before its closed doors. 'It is she who accompanies us on our path to peace.' He then banged on the door three times with the base of his crosier, or bishop’s cross. Inside, the choir erupted into song, the crystalline voices filing what — until recently — had been a building site. Three times, Ulrich appealed to the cathedral to open its doors. Three times, the choir responded in song. He then pushed open the heavy door: Notre Dame’s rebirth was underway. Archibishop Laurent Ulrich knocks three times on Notre Dame's doors, officially marking cathedral's reopening With three resounding knocks on its doors by Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich, wielding a staff carved from fire-scorched beams, the cathedral roared back to life Saturday evening. For the first time since a devastating 2019 blaze, the towering Gothic masterpiece reopened for worship, its rebirth marked by song, prayer, and awe beneath its soaring arches. While the ceremony was initially planned to begin on the forecourt, unusually fierce December winds whipping across the central Paris island, flanked by the River Seine, forced all events inside. Yet the occasion lost none of its splendor. Inside the luminous nave, choirs are singing psalms, and the cathedral’s mighty organ, silent for nearly five years, is thundering to life in a triumphant interplay of melodies. The evening’s celebration, being attended by more than 2,500 guests and dignitaries, including President-elect Donald Trump, U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, Britain’s Prince William, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, underscores Notre Dame’s enduring role as both a spiritual and cultural beacon. Groups gather in Paris to protest Trump A small group of American expats gathered near Notre Dame Cathedral on Saturday to protest the presence of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at the reopening ceremony. Organized under the banner 'Paris Against Trump,' the group criticized French President Emmanuel Macron for inviting Trump but chose not to organize a large demonstration to avoid disrupting the event. 'We find this a bit shameful and sad that Trump is invited here, especially since he has gone against everything the Church stands for,' said Ehlyr O’Rourke, 34, a spokesperson for the association. 'We don’t understand why a criminal, a sex offender, a felon can actually be invited in here.' Later in the day, thousands marched through Paris, denouncing Trump’s visit and expressing support for Palestine. Organized by left-wing parties, unions, and pro-Palestinian groups, the demonstration featured Palestinian flags, keffiyehs, and chants calling for Palestinian resistance, President Macron’s impeachment, and criticizing Trump’s alleged complicity in Middle East conflicts. 'We are protesting every week to support Palestine, but what’s special today is the arrival of Donald Trump,' said Nadia Messai, one of the protesters in the crowd. 'Trump has been supporting Israel, much like the United States has been since the beginning of the creation of this rogue state that is occupying Palestine illegally.' Cathedral's renovation chief hopes the reopening is a moment of unity Philippe Jost, Notre Dame cathedral renovation chief, said the reopening is an opportunity for unity as so many divisions remain in the world. 'We hope it will be a great moment of unity for the French people, for guests from all over the world and for spectators from all over the world,' he said. 'Notre Dame de Paris unites. There are so many divisive factors. An event like this must unite, must help concord and peace to grow throughout the world.' Notre Dame's rector emphasizes the importance of the separation of church and state rector of Notre Dame and chief of the reconstruction project: (credit to Mark Carlson) Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, the Notre Dame rector called the reopening an important moment that has been awaited a long time. 'Notre Dame de Paris is the very sign of the presence of a soul in the heart of our city. It’s important for Parisians, it’s important for Catholics, it’s important for the French and for the whole world,' he said. 'In general, the sphere of politics doesn’t enter the sphere of the religious, and shouldn’t. In the same way, the religious sphere doesn’t enter politics,' he added. 'The Archbishop of Paris invited the President of the Republic to speak inside the cathedral as a sign of the unity that could be seen in the reconstruction. The archbishop allowed him to speak inside because the weather conditions did not allow him to speak outside.' Guests file into Notre Dame Cathedral for the ceremonies Guests gradually filing the cathedral for the evening reopening ceremonies are reveling at the renovated interiors, with many whipping out cell phones to take souvenir photos. 'It’s a sense of perfection,' said François Le Page, who works for the Notre Dame foundation that raised nearly half of the nearly 900 million euros of donations. He last set foot in the cathedral in 2021, on a visit 'It’s night and day,' said Rev. Andriy Morkvas, a Ukrainian pastor who leads the The Cathedral of Saint Volodymyr the Great church in Paris’ St. Germain des Pres said it had been 10 years since he last stepped foot inside Notre Dame. 'God is very powerful, he can change things.' He expressed hope that the cathedral could help bring peace to his country and he drew heart from the expected attendance of Ukraine’s president. 'I hope Notre Dame and Mary will help us resolve this conflict,' he said. French government security agents are helping to ensure Trump's safety alongside the Secret Service Outside the Elysee Palace, the official residence of the French president, dozens of members of the French Republican Guard stood by awaiting Donald Trump’s arrival. Trump was in Paris on Saturday for his first international trip as president-elect, ready to join world leaders celebrating the renovation of Notre Dame Cathedral and meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s Prince William. More than 20 French government security agents have been helping ensure Trump’s safety alongside the Secret Service, according to French national police. A special French police van was providing anti-drone protection for Trump’s convoy. Security was tighter than usual outside the U.S. Embassy and other sites around Paris for the Notre Dame reopening, where dozens of international VIPs were expected. Macron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made a point of cultivating a relationship since the Republican defeated Democrat Kamala Harris last month. But Macron’s office nonetheless played down the significance of the invitation, saying other politicians not now in office had been invited as well. Trump was invited as president-elect of a 'friendly nation,' Macron’s office said, adding, 'This is in no way exceptional, we’ve done it before.' Notre Dame in numbers Perhaps not surprisingly for such a big cathedral, some of the numbers that help tell the story of Notre Dame’s reopening are on the very big side, too. The bell that will sound to signal the start of the service weighs 13 tons, making it the cathedral’s largest. It has a name - Emmanuel – given to it by King Louis XIV after it was cast in 1683. It rings in F sharp. Inside, 42,000 square meters of stonework were cleaned during the renovation — an area equivalent to roughly six soccer pitches. The first stone of Notre Dame was laid in 1163. The thunderous great organ of Notre Dame that will be heard in public at Saturday’s service for the first time since April 15, 2019, has 7,952 pipes — the largest as broad as a human torso; the smallest no larger than a pen. The renovated giant console that controls the instrument has five keyboards of 56 notes each, foot pedals for 30 notes, and 115 stops. Unseen, above the congregation and the repaired vaulted ceilings, is a framework of beams holding up the roof and spire – so dense and intricate that it’s nicknamed 'the forest.' Some 2,000 oak trees were felled to rebuild it. Trump to meet with Macron ahead of the reopening ceremonies President-elect Donald Trump is to meet Saturday with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee presidential palace ahead of the reopening ceremony for Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. This is Trump’s first foreign trip since the election. Macron’s office said both leaders will discuss global crisis, including wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine as well as French-American bilateral relations. Macron is scheduled to have a meeting with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy right after his meeting with Trump. Notre Dame celebrations comes as Macron’s presidency now faces its gravest crisis after the government’s collapse this week in a historic no-confidence vote that toppled Prime Minister Michel Barnier. Devout Catholics say the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening will ‘nourish us’ For devout Catholics Patricia and Cyrille Brenner, waiting in the cold outside Notre Dame for its reopening service that they weren’t invited to was the place to be. The couple traveled by night train from Cannes on the French Riviera – famous for its movie festival – to be among the onlookers Saturday hoping for some of the 40,000 spots set aside for the public on the banks of the River Seine facing the cathedral. They bought their train tickets six months ago. 'I’m from Cannes. It’s a bit like the festival. You have to be there to experience it,' said Patricia, 65. 'It’s a pilgrimage for us.' Cyrille, 66, said they were the only members of their parish to make the long trip. 'We like to be at the heart of things and, as Christians, it will nourish us,' he said. While Cyrille said they’d felt 'distress, sadness' when Notre Dame burned, they both also noted how sacred relics, statues and the golden cross on the altar – almost miraculously – survived the inferno. They both marveled at the renovation works that have not only eradicated nearly all traces of the fire inside but made it more resplendent than ever. Some visitors hope talks on the sidelines will be good for Ukraine Andrey Alexeev, a Ukrainian among onlookers gathering for the reopening of Notre Dame, hopes U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy can meet and talk on the ceremony’s sidelines. Their host, French President Emmanuel Macron, was meeting with both leaders before they attend the reopening service for the cathedral. Alexeev was hoping Trump and Zelenskyy would meet, too. 'I hope that meeting can change something in a good way for Ukraine,' he said. 'It’s good that Zelenskyy has a chance to speak with Trump and Macron. At least it’s an opportunity for Ukraine.' Alexeev, who lives in Poland, was visiting Paris with his mother, Olha, who travelled from Ukraine. They were hoping for two of the 40,000 places that were set aside for the public in fenced-off areas on the banks of the River Seine, facing the cathedral. Alexeev said he’s agnostic but that it felt important for him to be as close to the ceremonies as possible. By coincidence, his sister was visiting Paris when Notre Dame burned on April 15, 2019. 'It’s one of the greatest places not only in Europe but also the whole world,' he said. Such an occasion 'happens once in 1,000 years, I think. So we are part of history.' What to expect Saturday’s events will blend solemn religious tradition with an official presidential speech and cultural grandeur. French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte will welcome the dozens of heads of state and government. Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will then take over — with a rite to symbolically reopen Notre Dame’s doors, kicking off the ceremonies at 7 p.m. The ceremony that was to have been held outside will then unfold inside, with a film retracing the renovations, music and a speech by Macron. Ulrich will then take over again, with a rite to reawaken Notre Dame’s organ and the rest of the religious service scheduled to last about 55 minutes. Notre Dame reopening falls victim to bad weather PARIS — After more than 5 years of renovation, the reopening of Notre Dame — like the Paris Olympics before it — has fallen victim to bad weather. Forecasted strong winds have upended the running order of the reopening ceremonies on Saturday evening, and forced the whole thing indoors. The original plan was for an initial outdoor state ceremony led by President Emmanuel Macron, after which Archbishop Laurent Ulrich was to have taken over, leading rites and a religious service inside the cathedral. Those plans would have emphasized France’s carefully policed divide between state and church. But expected stormy winds prompted the Paris diocese and Macron’s office to telescope the ceremonies together, now all to be held inside the cathedral. It’s the second time this year that weather has intervened in significant moments for Paris. Rains drenched the July 26 opening ceremony of the Summer Games, dampening the show and the spirits of some spectators.	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-paris-latest-e50813cf016f08607c20ab115bc4b153	2024-12-07T05:12:28-08:00	
La Scala's gala premiere is a Verdi opera with a reputation for bringing bad luck	MILAN (AP) — Milan’s storied Teatro alla Scala presents Giuseppe Verdi’s 'La Forza del Destino' for its gala season premiere Saturday for the first time in 59 years, seeking to shake the opera's reputation for bringing bad luck. The premiere is a highlight of the Milan cultural calendar, attracting top figures from the world of politics, business and the arts, although this year, both President Sergio Mattarella and Premier Giorgia Meloni have chosen instead to attend ceremonies marking the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Russian soprano Anna Netrebk o sings the role of Leonora to American tenor Brian Jagde's Don Alvaro. Jagde was brought in on short notice to substitute for German tenor Jonas Kaufmann, who dropped out for family reasons. It is Jagde’s fourth time singing the role of Don Alvaro this year alone, and his third La Scala performance — he was previously twice brought in as a substitute alongside Netrebko in 'Turandot.' Netrebko called the score of 'La Forza del Destino' a 'masterpiece,' but confessed that she could not identify with her character, Leonora, ’’as a woman of the 21st century.' 'If you are looking at the story, it is basically nonsense, sorry,' she told a recent press conference. 'If we are being serious and trying to follow the story, and try to understand, especially the character of Leonora, hunted by fear, guilt, desperation, and in the end what did she find?' The opera is an ill-fated love story between Don Alvaro and Leonora set against the background of a world on the brink of apocalypse, which has resonance in current global turbulence. There was also a pro-Palestinian protest in the center of Milan just ahead of the VIP arrivals at La Scala. Unions also traditionally protest the lavish event in the piazza opposite the opera house. Verdi’s opera has been long dogged by superstition that it brings bad luck, so much so that some in Italy will not say the full title aloud. It’s a reputation that the staging director of the La Scala production hopes to shake once and for all. 'We will be the catalyzers of good luck,’’ Leo Muscato told Corriere della Sera, adding that every production has its 'accidents.'	https://apnews.com/article/italy-la-scala-gala-season-premiere-58870d7d530c711a68f87a350fbcdeb4	2024-12-07T05:08:38-08:00	
Storm Darragh batters UK and Ireland, leaving 1 dead and hundreds of thousands without power	LONDON (AP) — A man died and hundreds of thousands of people in Britain and Ireland were left without power Saturday as high winds and heavy rain battered the region. Gusts of up to 93 miles per hour were recorded as officials sent a rare emergency alert by phone to about 3 million households in Wales and southwest England early Saturday. The official alert, which came with a loud siren-like sound, warned people to stay indoors and was sent to every compatible mobile phone in the areas impacted by Storm Darragh. In northwest England, a man in his 40s died when a tree fell onto his van while he was driving on a highway near Preston, about 36 miles (58 kilometers) north of Manchester. On Friday the U.K.'s weather forecasters, the Met Office, issued a red weather warning — the most serious type. Thousands of homes, many in Northern Ireland, Wales and western England, were left without power overnight. Major highways and bridges across the country were closed because of strong winds, and multiple train services were suspended. In Ireland, almost 400,000 homes, farms or businesses were without power as a result of the storm. Some flights at Dublin Airport were cancelled.	https://apnews.com/article/storm-darragh-britain-ireland-wind-rain-wales-f9d74be4f3516eea499033aaf0f4f0d1	2024-12-07T04:43:18-08:00	
Analysis: At dueling Mideast forums, officials ask what will happen when Donald Trump takes office	MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) — At glittering ballrooms in the Mideast this weekend, discussions of the wars and chaos gripping the region gave way to one central question: What's going to happen when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month? Summits in both Bahrain and Qatar, neighboring Persian Gulf autocracies with a long history of a brothers' rivalry, saw Trump discussed in open sessions, hushed chatter and pull-aside meetings among politicians, diplomats and uniformed military officers. The reasons for the conversations are many. Chief among them is the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, with over 44,000 Palestinians killed, and the tenuous ceasefire holding in Lebanon. Israel's conduct in the wars, sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage, enraged the wider Arab world. President Joe Biden's tight embrace of Israel in the time since has alienated many. Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal, a prominent royal who led the kingdom's intelligence service for more than two decades and served as ambassador to the U.S. and Britain, referred directly to Trump's own online messages about the wars. 'Friendly countries in the region are hoping that Mr. Trump pursues what he started before — to bring PEACE with capital letters to the Middle East,' the prince told the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Manama Dialogue in Bahrain. 'The Gulf countries, including my country, Saudi Arabia, are willing to walk with you, Mr. President, to achieve this noble order. It is time for America under your presidency to change the course of this troubled region.' Prince Turki underlined the standard Saudi call for a peace that requires a two-state solution for the decadeslong Israeli-Palestinian crisis to end, with a Palestinian capital in east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip and the West Bank based on 1967 borders fully under Palestinian control. But Trump in 2020 in his first term unveiled a peace plan that sided heavily with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-line nationalist vision for the region and pushed aside many of the Palestinians’ core demands. Biden's administration, meanwhile, made no headway on the conflict prior to the Hamas attack. Barbara A. Leaf, the top Mideast official at the U.S. State Department, described the Hamas assault as having 'plunged the region into renewed conflict' in brief remarks at a side event in Bahrain. At the Doha Forum in Qatar, Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide referred to the Mideast before the Oct. 7 attack as 'not a stable, lasting situation — it was like a minefield.' Despite that, Trump's experience reaching diplomatic recognition deals for Israel with both Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates might make a larger Mideast peace deal possible, Barth Eide said. 'I think the message now from this region is that that is perfectly doable. There might actually be a major deal, but it has to happen with Palestine,' he said. 'It’s not one conflict, but there is a root conflict that connects to all of them, which is the absence of a solution to the Palestinian question.' That extends all the way to Yemen, where the Houthi rebels who have held the country's capital for over a decade now have gained acclaim in the Arab world for their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the wars. Trump listed the Houthis as a foreign terrorist group, something rescinded by the Biden administration over their assessment it halted needed aid from getting into Yemen. 'I think in Yemen the upcoming Trump administration is most likely implement heavy sanctions,' said analyst Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert. 'That may push the Houthis to retaliate. ... The idea that (sanctions) alone will pressure the Houthis to commit to peace and cease fire in the Red Sea — I don't think that will happen.' Then there's Iran's nuclear program, which the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Friday in Bahrain was poised to 'quite dramatically' increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium. Yet Iranian officials and the public have been openly musing whether Trump might strike a deal with Iran — even as he was the one who unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that saw it get sanctions relief in exchange for greatly limiting its program. And finally, there's the Gulf states themselves. Some attendees at the two summits discussed their flight plans for trying to attend both. That would have been impossible during the yearslong Qatar crisis, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE cut ties and boycott Qatar from 2017 until January 2021. The crisis began after Trump's first foreign trip as president to Saudi Arabia. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — Jon Gambrell, the news director for the Gulf and Iran for The Associated Press, has reported from each of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Iran and other locations across the Mideast and wider world since joining the AP in 2006. ___ The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation.

6 Pakistani security personnel killed in a checkpoint attack	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Armed men killed six Pakistani security personnel and wounded seven in a checkpoint attack in the country’s northwest, a police official said Saturday. The assault happened in Kurram district, where fierce sectarian fighting has killed at least 130 people during the past few weeks. A ceasefire between the area’s Sunni and Shiite communities is holding and Saturday’s incident is not connected to the recent clashes. Local official Saleem Khan said armed men attacked a Frontier Corps checkpoint in Bagam, 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Peshawar city. The wounded were taken to a military hospital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Also Saturday, an intelligence official said an operation against the Pakistani Taliban in Tank district had killed 20 militants in the past 24 hours. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. Among the dead is a commander, the official said. The militants who were killed were involved in attacks on security forces, extortion and the targeted killings of civilians, the official said. Kurram and Tank are both in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-kurram-checkpoint-attack-taliban-e784f6cd506841decc0b8367ad4bb03f	2024-12-07T02:50:25-08:00	
Syrian troops withdraw from the south of the country as they rush to defend Homs	BEIRUT (AP) — The Syrian army withdrew from much of southern Syria on Saturday, leaving more areas of the country, including two provincial capitals, under the control of opposition fighters, the military and an opposition war monitor said. The redeployment away from the provinces of Daraa and Sweida came as Syria’s military sent large numbers of reinforcements to defend the key central city of Homs, Syria’s third largest, as insurgents approached its outskirts. The rapid advances by insurgents is a stunning reversal of fortunes for Syria's President Bashar Assad, who appears to be largely on his own, with erstwhile allies preoccupied with other conflicts. His chief international backer, Russia, is busy with its war in Ukraine, and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up his forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran, meanwhile, has seen its proxies across the region degraded by Israeli regular airstrikes. Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Syria war monitor, reported Saturday that Iran’s military advisers have started leaving Syria. He added that Iran-backed fighters in eastern Syria, mainly from Afghanistan and Pakistan, have withdrawn into central Syria. The shock offensive began Nov. 27 led by the jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, during which gunmen captured the northern city of Aleppo, Syria’s largest, and the central city of Hama, the country’s fourth largest city. The group has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday from Syria that the aim of the offensive is to overthrow Assad’s government. The Britain-based Observatory said Syrian troops have withdrawn from much of the two southern provinces and are sending reinforcements to Homs, where a battle is looming. If the insurgents capture Homs, they would cut the link between Damascus, Assad’s seat of power, and the coastal region where the president enjoys wide support. The Syrian army said in a statement Saturday that it has carried out redeployment and repositioning in Sweida and Daraa after its checkpoints came under attack by 'terrorists.' The army said it is setting up a 'strong and coherent defensive and security belt in the area,' apparently to defend Damascus from the south. Since Syria’s conflict broke out in March 2011, the Syrian government has been referring to opposition gunmen as terrorists. In the gas-rich nation of Qatar, the foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkey were scheduled to meet to discuss the situation in Syria. Turkey is a main backer of the rebels seeking to overthrow Assad. Qatar's top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, criticized Assad for failing to take advantage of the lull in fighting in recent years to address the country’s underlying problems. 'Assad didn’t seize this opportunity to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people,' he said. Sheikh Mohammed said he was surprised by how quickly the rebels have advanced and said there is a real threat to Syria’s 'territorial integrity.' He said the war could 'damage and destroy what is left if there is no sense of urgency' to start a political process. After the fall of the cities of Daraa and Sweida early Saturday, Syrian government forces remain in control of five provincial capitals — Damascus, Homs and Quneitra, as well as Latakia and Tartus on the Mediterranean cost. Tartus is home to the only Russian naval base outside the former Soviet Union while Latakia is home to a major Russian air base. On Friday, U.S.-backed fighters of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces captured wide parts of the eastern province of Deir el-Zour that borders Iraq as well as the provincial capital that carries the same name. The capture of areas in Deir el-Zour is a blow to Iran’s influence in the region as the area is the gateway to the corridor linking the Mediterranean to Iran, a supply line for Iran-backed fighters, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah. With the capture of a main border crossing with Iraq by the SDF and after opposition fighters took control of the Naseeb border crossing to Jordan in southern Syria, the Syrian government's only gateway to the outside world is the Masnaa border crossing with Lebanon. ____ Associated Press writers Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria and Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-sweida-daraa-homs-hts-qatar-7f65823bbf0a7bd331109e8dff419430	2024-12-07T02:08:16-08:00	
Ukraine confirms second Danish delivery of F-16s as Zelenskyy seeks support in Paris	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Denmark has delivered a second batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday as he traveled to Paris to meet with top politicians and dignitaries. In a message on Telegram, Zelenskyy praised Denmark and lamented a lack of dedication from other allies. 'The first batch of planes provided by the Danes are already shooting down Russian missiles: rescuing our people and our infrastructure. Now our air shield is reinforced even further,' he said. 'If all partners were so determined, we would have been able to make Russian terror impossible.' The announcement comes as Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region marks a day of mourning for 10 people killed in a Russian attack on Friday. A further 24 people, including two children, were injured when a missile struck a local service station, said regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov. Another three people were killed in a strike on the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih Friday, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. Addressing the attacks, Zelenskyy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not seek 'real peace.' Putin 'only seeks the ability to treat any country this way, with bombs, missiles, and all other forms of violence,' Zelenskyy said. 'Only through strength can we resist this. And only through strength can real peace be established.' Zelenskyy is due to meet other world leaders Saturday, including French President Emmanuel Macron, at an event in Paris celebrating the renovation of Notre Dame Cathedral after a devastating fire in 2019. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is among those expected to be in attendance, with European leaders keen to cultivate the incoming leader's favor to persuade him to maintain support for Ukraine against Russia’s three-year invasion. It’s not clear whether Trump will meet Zelenskyy. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-f16-denmark-86c2d6631869cc8f5217482e22bf52d8	2024-12-07T01:48:06-08:00	
An explosion has caused several injuries and damaged apartments in a Dutch city	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — An explosion and fire rocked a neighborhood in the Dutch city of The Hague early Saturday, destroying several apartments and injuring multiple people, according to authorities. The cause of the disaster is unclear, but police said they are looking for a car seen leaving the scene. Emergency authorities said four people have been rescued from the rubble and taken to the hospital, but could not say how many people may still be under the rubble. Local media reported that one of those hospitalized was a child. A line of ambulances could be seen waiting nearby in anticipation of more victims. The spokesperson for the local hospital said that they were on standby to deal with injuries. Residents of the northeastern neighborhood of Mariahoeve in The Hague heard a huge bang and screams before dawn. One woman told local media that she thought an earthquake had happened. Dutch authorities deployed a specialized urban search and rescue team to the scene, with four dogs trained to find victims. The team was previously used during the devastating earthquake in Turkey in 2023. Prime Minister Dick Schoof said in a statement he was shocked by the images of the disaster. 'My thoughts go out to the victims, all other people involved and the emergency services who are now working on the scene,' he said. The Dutch royal family expressed similar sentiments. 'Our thoughts are with those affected in The Hague after the explosion and fire this morning,'' including those 'who are afraid of the fate of their loved ones,' King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-hague-explosion-54f06b68677dcfda4ee7af75deed4947	2024-12-07T00:50:14-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes continue in Gaza and neighbors close their borders with Syria	Palestinian officials say at least 29 people were killed, including four medical staff, when Israeli strikes pummeled the area around one of the last remaining hospitals in northern Gaza. Elsewhere in the region, Lebanon said it is closing all its land border crossings with Syria except for a main one that links Beirut with the Syrian capital, Damascus. Jordan also closed a border crossing with Syria because of the security situation on the Syrian side. Syrian insurgents have entered the central towns of Rastan and Talbiseh, just north of the central city of Homs, bringing them closer to Syria’s third largest city. A day earlier, jihadi-led opposition fighters captured the central city of Hama, Syria’s fourth largest. Israel's war against Hamas has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel in October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Israel’s blistering retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,600 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the Latest: Syrian army withdraws from much of southern Syria BEIRUT — The Syrian army withdrew from much of southern Syria on Saturday, leaving more areas of the country, including two provincial capitals, under the control of opposition fighters, the military and an opposition war monitor said. The redeployment away from the provinces of Daraa and Sweida came as Syria’s military sent large numbers of reinforcements to defend the key central city of Homs, Syria’s third largest, as insurgents approached its outskirts.

Iran, meanwhile, has seen its proxies across the region degraded by Israeli regular airstrikes. Israel kills Palestinian man who attacked security forces at border crossing JERUSALEM — Israeli security forces killed a Palestinian man after he attacked them at a border crossing in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Saturday morning, police said. The man shot firecrackers at security forces at the checkpoint and threatened them with a knife, the police statement said. The man wore a t-shirt emblazoned with a symbol of the Islamic State militant group, according to an Associated Press reporter Israeli fire has killed at least 700 Palestinians in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war began last year, Palestinian health officials said. In that time, Palestinian militants have launched a number of attacks on soldiers at checkpoints and within Israel. Qatari prime minister sees movement in Gaza ceasefire negotiations DOHA, Qatar — The prime minister of Qatar says he has seen new momentum in Gaza ceasefire efforts since the U.S. presidential election, with the incoming Trump administration seeking an end to the conflict before it takes office. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, a key mediator in the ceasefire efforts, declined to give specifics of the negotiations but told an international conference in Doha that the gaps between the sides are not large. Qatar, which has served as a mediator throughout the 14-month war, suspended its efforts last month in frustration over the lack of progress. But Sheikh Mohammed said his government has re-engaged in recent days after determining a new willingness by both parties to reach a deal. ’We have sensed after the election that the momentum is coming back,' he told the Doha Forum on Saturday. He said has been in touch with both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration and found that while there are some differences in approach, both are committed to the same goal of ending the war. ’We have seen a lot of encouragement from the incoming administration in order to achieve a deal, even before the president comes to the office,' Sheikh Mohammed said. He declined to discuss details, saying he wanted to 'protect the process,' but expressed hope for a deal 'as soon as possible.' ’If you look at the gaps and the disagreements, they are not something substantial that really affects the agreement,' he said. Israeli strikes kill at least 29 at hard-hit Gaza hospital CAIRO — At least 29 people were killed, including four medical staff, when Israeli strikes pummeled the area around one of the last remaining hospitals in northern Gaza, Palestinian officials said. The situation in and around the Kamal Adwan hospital is 'catastrophic,' according to Dr. Hussam Abu Safia, the director of the hospital. The dead included five children and five women, according to the hospital casualty list, which was obtained by The Associated Press. Friday’s strikes also wounded 55 people including six children and the five women, according to the hospital. Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya is one of the few hospitals still partially operating in the Gaza’s northernmost province, where Israeli forces are pressing an offensive that has almost completely sealed off the area from humanitarian aid for two months. Israel’s military denied that its forces had struck the hospital or operated inside it. The army said that in the past few weeks, 'coordinated efforts with international organizations have been underway in order to transfer patients, companions, and medical staff to other hospitals.' An Indonesian medical team which had been assisting in Kamal Adwan for the past week was forced to evacuate on foot after the area was surrounded by Israeli soldiers, according to a statement from the team. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the medical team’s expulsion. Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization representative in the Palestinian territories, said an Israeli tank approached the hospital at around 4 a.m. Friday. Although no official Israeli evacuation order was issued, 'people started to climb the wall to escape, and this panic attracted IDF (Israeli) fire,' he said. He spoke by video from Gaza to journalists in Geneva. Kamal Adwan Hospital has been struck multiple times over the past two months since Israel launched a fierce military operation in northern Gaza against Hamas militants. In October, Israeli forces raided the hospital, saying that militants were sheltering inside and arrested a number of people, including some staff. Hospital officials denied the claim. Saudi Arabia calls for and end to Gaza war and attacks Israel's actions MANAMA, Bahrain — Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister has reiterated the kingdom’s call for an end to the war in the Gaza Strip. Prince Faisal bin Farhan described Israel as acting with 'impunity and is getting away without punishment' in its war on Hamas there. The prince said that any permanent solution requires a two-state solution, with the Palestinians having east Jerusalem as their capital. After the speech, Prince Turki al-Faisal, a prominent royal in the kingdom who led Saudi intelligence for more than two decades and served as ambassador to the U.S. and Britain, took the stage. He harshly criticized Israel’s conduct in the wars. 'Israel has become an apartheid, colonial and genocidal state,' Prince Turki said. 'It is about time for the world to address that issue and take the necessary steps to bring those who are thus charged by the International Criminal Court to justice.' Israeli officials could not be immediately reached for comment on Prince Turki’s remarks. The Saudis spoke at the International Institute for Security Studies’ Manama Dialogue in Bahrain.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-lebanon-news-7-december-2024-53419e23991cfc14a7857c82f49eb26f	2024-12-06T23:25:49-08:00	
Notre Dame reopens its doors to Macron and other world leaders in a rare symbol of unity	PARIS (AP) — France's iconic Notre Dame Cathedral is formally reopening its doors on Saturday for the first time since a devastating fire nearly destroyed the 861-year-old landmark in 2019. The restoration, a spectacular achievement in just five years for a structure that took nearly two centuries to build, is seen as a moment of triumph for French President Emmanuel Macron, who championed the ambitious timeline — and a welcome respite from his domestic political woes. Under the luminous stained glass, many world leaders, dignitaries, and worshippers will gather in the evening to mark the occasion — a rare moment of unity against the backdrop of global divisions and conflicts. President-elect Donald Trump, America's first lady Jill Biden, Britain's Prince William and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are among 1,500 guests attending the reopening celebration under Notre Dame’s soaring Gothic arches, led by Archbishop Laurent Ulrich. Because of strong winds forecast for Saturday evening in Paris, the French presidential palace and the Paris diocese said Friday the entire opening ceremony will be held inside Notre Dame, instead of starting from the cathedral’s forecourt as initially planned. A sign of hope Notre Dame’s rector, Rev. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, says the cathedral is 'more than just a French monument' and a beloved treasure of world's cultural heritage. 'The cathedral is a magnificent symbol of unity,' the rector said. 'A sign of hope, because what seemed impossible has become possible.' Saturday’s events will blend solemn religious tradition with an official presidential speech and cultural grandeur, starting with Ulrich symbolically reopening Notre Dame’s grand wooden doors. Tapping them three times with a staff crafted from charred wood salvaged from the cathedral’s fire-ravaged roof, he will declare the cathedral open for worship once more. Huguette Euphrasie’s 79-year-old mother, Marie-Yolande, is battling cancer. So as she stared intently up at Notre Dame’s towers, the daughter appealed Saturday to the cathedral for help, with a prayer on the day of the monument’s reopening. 'It has huge spiritual value for me,' Euphrasie said, gathering with people from around the world to watch the reopening from screens on nearby riverbanks. 'It's very moving.' Solemn rituals Psalms, prayers, and hymns will fill the cavernous space as the cathedral’s thunderous organ, silenced since the fire, is reawakened. The 8,000-pipe instrument, painstakingly restored and cleaned of toxic lead dust, will respond to the archbishop’s invocation, with four organists performing an improvised interplay of melodies. Later in the evening, a star-studded concert will take center stage inside the cathedral and pay tribute to its resurrection and to those who labored to restore it, offering a universal message of harmony. Pianist Lang Lang, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and soprano Pretty Yende are among the world-famous artists slated to perform. On Sunday, Ulrich will lead the inaugural Mass and consecrate the cathedral’s new altar, designed by contemporary artist Guillaume Bardet to replace the one crushed beneath the flaming spire in the blaze. Unity in times of global challenges The reopening of Notre Dame comes at a time of profound global unrest, with wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East. For Catholics, Notre Dame's rector said the cathedral 'carries the enveloping presence of the Virgin Mary, a maternal and embracing presence.'' 'It is a magnificent symbol of unity,' Dumas said. The range of dignitaries coming to Paris from Africa to the Mideast and the U.S. underline the cathedral's significance as a symbol of shared heritage and peace. Macron's political woes The celebration is expected to give a much-needed boost to embattled Macron, whose prime minister was ousted this week, plunging the nation’s political scene into more turmoil. The French president, who has called Notre Dame's reopening 'a jolt of hope,' will address the gathering. He had hoped the occasion would briefly silence his critics and showcase France’s unity and resilience under his leadership, and the achievement of restoring Notre Dame in just five years — a timeline that had seemed improbable to many. Macron's presidency now faces its gravest crisis after the government's collapse this week in a historic no-confidence vote that toppled Prime Minister Michel Barnier. The vote followed months of political gridlock after snap elections. Calls are now growing louder from opposition forces for Macron to resign. But he vowed Thursday to remain in office until the end of his term in 2027, and said he'll name a new prime minister within days. As France struggles with economic woes and social unrest, Notre Dame's rebirth celebrations form a stark contrast to the crisis. Security is tight for this global event Security will be high through the weekend, echoing measures taken during the Paris Olympics earlier this year. The Île de la Cité — the small island in the River Seine that is home to Notre Dame and the historic heart of Paris— is closed to tourists and non-residents. Police vans and barriers blocked cobblestoned streets in a large perimeter around the island, while soldiers in thick body armor and sniffer dogs patrolled embankments. A special security detail is following Trump. Public viewing areas along the Seine’s southern bank will accommodate 40,000 spectators, who can follow the celebrations on large screens. For many, Notre Dame’s rebirth is not just a French achievement but a global one — after the reopening, the cathedral is set to welcome 15 million visitors annually, up from 12 million before the fire. Following the 2019 fire, nearly $1 billion in donations quickly poured in from around the world, testifying to Notre Dame's universal appeal. Among those who traveled from afar for the reopening was Canadian Noelle Alexandria. 'It’s not the first time she (Notre Dame) has been nearly in ruin, and every time it’s happened, she’s always managed to bounce back. Not many of us could really say that we would do the same, be able to keep coming back no matter what tragedy strike us. But she has,' Alexandria said. ___ John Leicester and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through The AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Pope creates 21 cardinals, many of them reformers in their own right, to carry out his reform plans	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis is installing 21 new cardinals, many of whom are key figures in his reform agenda: A Dominican preacher who acted as the spiritual father for Francis' recent gathering of bishops, a Neapolitan 'street priest' like himself, and a Peruvian bishop who has strongly backed his crackdown on abuse. Francis’ 10th consistory to create new princes of the church is also the biggest infusion of voting-age cardinals in his 11-year pontificate, further cementing his imprint on the group of men who will one day elect his successor. With Saturday's additions, Francis will have created 110 of the 140 cardinals under 80, thus eligible to vote in a conclave. This consistory also brings the number of voting-age cardinals well over the 120-man limit set by St. John Paul II. But 13 existing cardinals will turn 80 next year, bringing the numbers back down. This consistory is notable too because the 21 men being elevated aren’t the same ones Francis named Oct. 6 when he announced an unusual December consistory. One of Francis’ original picks, Indonesian Bishop Paskalis Bruno Syukur, the bishop of Bogor, asked not to be made a cardinal 'because of his desire to grow more in his life as a priest,' the Vatican said. Francis quickly substituted him with the Naples archbishop, Domenico Battaglia, known for his pastoral work in the slums and rough parts of Naples. Which country gets the most new cardinals? Battaglia is one of five Italians getting the red hat, keeping the once-dominant Italian presence in the College of Cardinals strong. Turin is getting a cardinal in its archbishop, Roberto Repole, as is Rome: Baldassare Reina, who on the same day Francis announced he was becoming a cardinal also learned that Francis had promoted him to be his top administrator for the diocese of Rome. Francis, who is technically bishop of Rome, has been conducting a years-long reorganization of the Rome diocese and its pontifical universities. Reina – who is also grand chancellor of the pre-eminent Pontifical Lateran University – will be expected to execute the reform. Another Italian is the oldest cardinal: Angelo Acerbi, a 99-year-old retired Vatican diplomat. He is the only one among the 21 new cardinals to be older than 80 and thus ineligible to vote in a conclave. Francis' picks on Saturday also include the youngest cardinal: the 44-year-old head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Melbourne, Australia, Mykola Bychok. Yet another Italian is one of two Vatican priests who do jobs in the Holy See that don’t usually carry the red hat: Fabio Baggio is undersecretary in the Vatican development office. Francis also decided to make a cardinal out of George Jacob Koovakad, the priest who organizes the pope’s foreign travels. Other picks have high-profile roles in Francis’ reforms. The archbishop of Lima, Peru, Carlos Gustavo Castillo Mattasoglio, made headlines recently because of an extraordinary essay he penned for El Pais newspaper in which he called for the suppression of an influential Peruvian Catholic movement, the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, which also has a presence in the U.S. Castillo called the group a 'failed experiment' of the church in Latin America, one of several conservative, right-wing movements that cropped up in the 1970s and 1980s as a counterweight to the more left-leaning liberation theology. 'My hypothesis is that the Sodalitium obeys a political project,' Castillo wrote. 'It is the resurrection of fascism in Latin America, artfully using the church by means of sectarian methods.' Francis has recently expelled the Sodalitium's founder and several top members following a Vatican investigation. What are the geographic breakdowns? Castillo is one of five new Latin American cardinals named by history’s first Latin American pope. They include the archbishop of Santiago del Estero, Argentina, Vicente Bokalic Iglic; the archbishop of Porto Alegre, Brazil, Jaime Spengler; the archbishop of Santiago, Chile, Fernando Natalio Chomali Garib and the archbishop of Guayaquil, Ecuador, Luis Gerardo Cabrera Herrera. Francis has long sought to broaden the geographic diversity of the College of Cardinals to show the universality of the church, particularly where it is growing. Asia got two new cardinals: Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi, the archbishop of Tokyo; and Pablo Virgilio Sinogco David, the bishop of Kalookan, Philippines. Africa also got two new cardinals: the archbishop of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Ignace Bessi Dogbo, and the bishop of Algiers, Algeria, Jean-Paul Vesco. 'There hasn’t been an African pope, but it’s a possibility in the church,' Dogbo said in an interview on the eve of his installation. 'And I think that this eventuality — which is not necessarily a demand — if this eventuality were to arise, the universal church would have to be ready to take it on.' Francis also tapped the archbishop of Tehran, Iran, Dominique Joseph Mathieu, the bishop of Belgrade, Serbia, Ladislav Nemet, while the lone North American cardinal named is the archbishop of Toronto, Frank Leo. The Lithuanian-born cardinal-elect, Rolandas Makrickas, has a special job in this pontificate: As the archpriest of the St. Mary Major basilica, he hosts Francis every time the pope returns from a foreign trip, since the pope likes to pray before an icon of the Madonna in the church. Additionally, Makrickas oversaw a recent financial reform of the basilica and would have been involved in identifying the future final resting place for Francis, since the Argentine pope has said he will be buried there. The pope's preacher Perhaps the most familiar new cardinal to anyone who has been following Francis’ reform agenda is the Dominican Timothy Radcliff, the spiritual father of the just-concluded synod, or gathering of bishops. The years-long process aimed to make the church more inclusive and responsive to the needs of rank-and-file Catholics, especially women. A British theologian, the white-robed Radcliffe often provided clarifying, if not humorous interventions during the weeks-long debate and retreats. At one point he set off a mini-firestorm by suggesting that external financial pressures influenced African bishops to reject Francis' permission to allow blessings for gay couples. He later said he just meant that the African Catholic Church is under pressure from other well-financed faiths. As the synod was winding down, he offered some valuable perspective. 'Often we can have no idea as to how God’s providence is at work in our lives. We do what we believe to be right and the rest is in the hands of the Lord,' he told the gathering. 'This is just one synod. There will be others. We do not have to do everything, just try to take the next step.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

100-year-old Pearl Harbor survivor recalls confusion and chaos during Japanese bombing 83 years ago	PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) — Bob Fernandez thought he'd go dancing and see the world when he joined the U.S. Navy as a 17-year-old high school student in August 1941. Four months later he found himself shaking from explosions and passing ammunition to artillery crews so his ship's guns could return fire on Japanese planes bombing Pearl Harbor, a Navy base in Hawaii. 'When those things go off like that, we didn’t know what’s what,' said Fernandez, who is now 100. 'We didn’t even know we were in a war.' Two survivors of the bombing — each 100 or older — are planning to return to Pearl Harbor on Saturday to observe the 83rd anniversary of the attack that thrust the U.S. into World War II. They will join active-duty troops, veterans and members of the public for a remembrance ceremony hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service. Fernandez was initially planning to join them but had to cancel because of health issues. The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle. The remains of more than 900 Arizona crew members are still entombed on the submerged vessel. A moment of silence will be held at 7:54 a.m., the same time the attack began eight decades ago. Aircraft in missing man formation are due to fly overhead to break the silence. Dozens of survivors once joined the annual remembrance but attendance has declined as survivors have aged. Today there are only 16 still living, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Military historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated there were some 87,000 military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack. Many laud Pearl Harbor survivors as heroes, but Fernandez doesn't view himself that way. 'I’m not a hero. I’m just nothing but an ammunition passer,' he told The Associated Press in a phone interview from California, where he now lives with his nephew in Lodi. Fernandez was working as a mess cook on his ship, the USS Curtiss, the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, and planned to go dancing that night at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Waikiki. He brought sailors coffee and food as he waited tables during breakfast. Then they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane with the red ball insignia painted on Japanese aircraft fly by. Fernandez rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing 5-inch (12.7-centimeter), 38-caliber shells so they could begin passing them to the ship's guns. He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire up above. 'I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on,' Fernandez said. The ship's guns hit a Japanese plane that crashed into one of its cranes. Shortly after, its guns hit a dive bomber which then slammed into the ship and exploded below deck, setting the hangar and main decks on fire, according to the Navy History and Heritage Command. Fernandez's ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured. 'We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn’t do nothing,' Fernandez said. 'But we never know what’s going to happen in a war.' After the attack, Fernandez had to sweep up debris. That night, he stood guard with a rifle to make sure no one tried to come aboard. When it came time to rest, he fell asleep next to where the ship’s dead were lying. He only realized that when a fellow sailor woke him up and told him. After the war, Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014. His oldest son is now 82 and lives in Arizona. Two other sons and a stepdaughter have died. He has traveled to Hawaii three times to participate in the Pearl Harbor remembrance. This year would have been his fourth trip. Fernandez still enjoys music and goes dancing at a nearby restaurant once a week if he can. His favorite tune is Frank Sinatra’s rendition of 'All of Me,' a song his nephew Joe Guthrie said he still knows by heart. 'The ladies flock to him like moths to a flame,' Guthrie said. ___ Associated Press journalist Terry Chea contributed to this report from Lodi, California.	https://apnews.com/article/pearl-harbor-attack-anniversary-hawaii-97e21f0b36f969bf0c5b3a8bb2641694	2024-12-06T20:05:10-08:00	
Trump is traveling to Paris for Notre Dame Cathedral's reopening celebration, will meet with Macron	PARIS (AP) — Donald Trump is off on his first international trip as president-elect, ready to join world leaders and dignitaries in Paris for a Saturday celebration of the renovation of Notre Dame Cathedral after a devastating fire in 2019. Trump wrote when he accepted the invitation earlier this week that French President Emmanuel Macron had done 'a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!' Macron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made a point of cultivating a relationship with the president-elect since he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris last month. But his office nonetheless played down the significance of the invitation, saying that other politicians who do not currently hold office had been invited as well. Trump was invited as president-elect of a 'friendly nation,' Macron's office said, adding, 'This is in no way exceptional, we’ve done it before.' President Joe Biden was invited as well but will not attend. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre cited a scheduling conflict and said the U.S. would instead be represented by first lady Jill Biden. Trump and the U.S. first lady last encountered one another shortly after the election, when he visited the White House for the traditional meeting between outgoing and incoming presidents. Trump's visit to France comes as Macron and other European leaders are trying to cultivate the president-elect's favor and persuade him to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s three-year invasion. Ahead of the Notre Dame event, Macron will be meeting with Trump and then separately with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the French president’s office said. Relations between France and the U.S. during Trump’s first term began warmly enough but grew increasingly strained over time. Macron was the guest of honor at Trump’s first state dinner, and Trump traveled to France several times. But the relationship suffered after Macron criticized Trump for questioning the need for NATO and raising doubts about America’s commitment to the mutual-defense pact. On the campaign trail this year, Trump often mocked Macron, imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep tariffs on wine and champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France tried to tax American companies. But Macron was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Trump last month after the election. 'Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump,' Macron posted on X early on the morning after the election. 'Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.' Trump was president in 2019 when a massive fire engulfed Notre Dame, collapsing its spire and threatening to destroy one of the world’s greatest architectural treasures, known for its mesmerizing stained glass. 'So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris,' he wrote on what was then Twitter, offering his advice to the city. 'Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!' he wrote. French officials appeared to respond shortly after, noting that 'All means' were being used to extinguish the flames, 'except for water-bombing aircrafts which, if used, could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral.' Last weekend, Trump announced that he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France. ______ Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Alone and broke against a renewed insurgency, is Assad's rule at risk of collapse?	BEIRUT (AP) — The last time Syrian President Bashar Assad was in serious trouble was 10 years ago, at the height of the country’s civil war, when his forces lost control over parts of the largest city, Aleppo, and his opponents were closing in on the capital, Damascus. Back then, he was rescued by his chief international backer, Russia, and longtime regional ally Iran, which along with Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah militia helped Assad's forces retake Aleppo, tipping the war firmly in his favor. Now, as insurgents pursue a shock offensive that quickly captured not just Aleppo, but the key city of Hama and a string of other towns across the country’s northwest, the Syrian leader appears to be largely on his own. Russia is preoccupied with its war in Ukraine, and Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of its fighters to shore up Assad’s forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran, meanwhile, has seen its proxies across the region degraded by Israeli airstrikes. Moreover, Syrian troops are exhausted and hollowed out by 13 years of war and economic crises, with little will left to fight. So will Assad's rule collapse in the near future? 'The coming days and weeks will be critical in determining whether the rebel offensive poses an existential threat to the Assad regime or whether the regime manages to regain its footing and push back on recent rebel gains,' said Mona Yacoubian, an analyst with the United States Institute for Peace. 'While weakened and distracted, Assad’s allies are unlikely to simply cave to the rebels’ offensive,' she wrote in an analysis. Not out of the woods Until recently, it seemed that Syria’s president was almost out of the woods. He never really won the long-running civil war, and large parts of the country were still outside his control. But after 13 years of conflict, it appeared that the worst was over, and that the world was ready to forget. Once viewed as a regional pariah, Assad saw Arab countries warming up to him again, renewing ties and reinstating Syria’s membership in the Arab League. Earlier this year, Italy also decided to reopen its embassy in Damascus after a decade of strained relations. In the aftermath of one of the world's largest humanitarian crises, aid groups and international donors in Syria began pivoting toward spending more on the country's recovery than on emergency assistance, providing a lifeline for Syrians and restoring basic services. But then the sudden offensive launched by insurgents on Nov. 27 reignited the war and caught everyone off guard with its scope and speed. It also left Syria’s neighbors anxious, wary that violence and refugees could spill across borders and worried about the growing influence of Islamist groups, a major concern for most of Syria’s Arab neighbors. Geopolitical shifts Analysts say a confluence of geopolitical developments beginning with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, followed by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that started on Oct. 7, 2023, helped create the opportunity for Assad’s opponents to pounce. As the rebels advanced this past week, Syrian forces appeared to melt away, putting up no resistance, with several reports of defection. Russian forces carried out occasional airstrikes. Hezbollah’s leader in Lebanon said the group will continue to support Syria, but made no mention of sending fighters again. 'The rebel assault underscores the precarious nature of regime control in Syria,' Yacoubian wrote. 'Its sudden eruption and the speed with which rebel groups managed to overtake Aleppo ... expose the complex dynamics that reside just below the surface in Syria and can transform superficial calm into major conflict.' Aron Lund, a Syria expert with Century International, a New York-based think tank and a researcher with the Swedish Defense Research Agency, said the developments in Syria are a geopolitical disaster for Russia and Iran. 'They too were surely surprised by what happened, and they have all sorts of resource constraints,' including Russia's war in Ukraine and Hezbollah's losses in Lebanon and Syria. Exhausted and broken While the country’s conflict lines have been largely stalemated since 2020, Syria’s economic woes have only multiplied in the past few years. The imposition of U.S. sanctions, a banking crisis in neighboring Lebanon and an earthquake last year contributed to the fact that almost all Syrians face extreme financial hardship. That has caused state institutions and salaries to wither. 'If you can’t pay your soldiers a living wage, then maybe you can’t expect them to stay and fight when thousands of Islamists storm' their cities, Lund said. 'It is just an exhausted, broken and dysfunctional regime' to start with. Part of the insurgents’ attempt to reassert their grip on Aleppo, the city where they were ousted in 2016 after a grueling military campaign, was to issue a call to government soldiers and security agencies to defect, granting them what they called 'protection cards,' which offer some sort of amnesty and assurances that they won’t be hunted down. The spokesman for the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, said more than 1,600 soldiers have applied for the cards over two days in Aleppo city. Hundreds of defectors lined up outside city police stations Thursday to register their details with the insurgents. Hossam al-Bakr, 33, originally from Hama who served in Damascus and defected four years earlier to Aleppo, said he came to 'settle his position' and get a new ID. The laminated card handed out to each defector was titled the 'defection card.' It showed the name, ID number and place of service of each defector. It is issued by 'The general command: Military Operations room.' On Thursday, Maj. Mohamed Ghoneim, who was in charge of registering the defectors, said more than 1,000 soldiers or police officers came to register. Some who were in possession of their official guns handed them over, he added. 'There are thousands who want to apply,' he said. Charles Lister, a longtime Syria expert, said while most of the international community has written off the conflict as either frozen or finished, the armed opposition has never given up and has been training for such a scenario for years. A rag tag group of militias, plagued by infighting and rivalry, spent years preparing and organizing, propelled by a dream to regain control of territory from Assad. 'The regime has been more vulnerable over the last year or two than it has perhaps been throughout the entirety of the conflict,' Lister said. 'And it has gotten used to the idea that if it can wait things out, it will ultimately prove to be the victor.' ___ Karam contributed reporting from London.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-civil-war-assad-insurgents-55921ce70395892d2955eb1654e5a8c1	2024-12-06T20:04:03-08:00	
Hospital founded by Spanish conqueror persists 500 years later in Mexico's capital	MEXICO CITY (AP) — In Mexico City’s bustling historic center, the Hospital de Jesus covers most of a city block. Its faded unassuming yellow facade, characteristic of the middle of the last century, obscures the medical center within founded 500 years ago by Spanish conqueror Hernán Cortés. Entering between street-level shoe stores, visitors find the oldest continuously operating hospital in the Americas. Stone arches lead to expansive patios filled with lush vegetation. The hospital was founded to treat the conquering Spanish, then later opened to the local Indigenous inhabitants to ensure a healthy workforce. Today it provides 24/7 emergency care, as well as affordable access to medical specialists for current residents of what was at the time of its founding the center of the Aztec empire. 'You can feel the Mexican heritage here,' said Dr. Pedro Álvarez Sánchez. 'For 500 years, the hospital has never closed its doors.' On Nov. 8, 1519, Cortés and his soldiers entered Tenochtitlan, the Aztec name for the capital, and met Aztec emperor Moctezuma in a place known as Huitzilan, just in front of the present-day hospital. Cortés had conquered the city by 1521, and to honor that original encounter, he founded the hospital in 1524. The meeting of Cortés and Moctezuma is depicted in a floor-to-ceiling tile mural beside one of the central patios. The main temple of Tenochtitlan — only a few blocks from the hospital — sits in the background. The union of two suns represents the meeting of two cultures. Cortés is buried in a small church adjacent to the hospital. Descendants of him and Moctezuma met here in 2019 to mark the anniversary of that initial encounter. Around the world, only a handful of hospitals can boast such longevity. For example, St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London founded in 1123 and Bellevue Hospital in New York City founded in 1736 also continue to provide full medical services. Much of the hospital has remained intact thanks to a board of trustees founded in the 16th century. Over the years, countless doctors have quietly worked to conserve the hospital’s mission of affordable care and to preserve the building’s unique architectural features. 'We want to ensure that this hospital continues to provide quality medical attention to patients,' said Dr. Octaviano Rosalez Serafín, 71, president of the hospital’s board of trustees. 'We want to continue the tradition of care the hospital has had for years.' Celia Chávez Escamilla, 56, arrived at the hospital at dawn recently for an appointment with her dermatologist. 'Here they take good care of us,' said Chávez. 'The prices here are accessible. If you go somewhere else it’s too expensive.' Her consultation was just 400 pesos or under $20. Escamilla was accompanied by her daughter Myriam Rafael Sanchez, 26, who was fascinated by the medical center. 'I’ve seen (the hospital) a lot in movies and TV shows,' she said excitedly. 'We have all of Mexico’s history around us.' The hospital didn’t always serve the entire public, according to Sandra Elena Guevara Flores, an anthropologist focusing on medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Guevara said the hospital was not open to the Indigenous population initially, but only to the Spanish who had recently arrived in the Americas. However, as epidemics began to spread, the hospital opened its doors to more patients. 'It was a strategy by the Spanish governors in the new Spain to treat the whole population,' said Guevara. 'It (was) so the servants and the whole labor system wouldn’t die.' Early Spanish doctors at the hospital often used native Mexican herbs to cure their patients. 'It’s said that traditional Galenic Hippocratic medicine was used in the hospital, but really it was Indigenous medicine,' said Guevara. 'They (Indigenous peoples) would share their knowledge.' The Spanish imprint can be seen in the hospital’s architecture, said Hugo Antonio Arciniega Ávila, a historian and archaeological expert from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The hospital, like some other colonial structures in Mexico City, is ‘encapsulated’ inside a newer building from the 1950s. Because the Spanish built low stone structures on huge lots with massive stone walls, people who wanted to build newer facilities a century or two later would often just build over, around or among the colonial-era structures. Sometimes they would incorporate the old masonry walls into the new building, either for preservation reasons or because it was cheaper to use them than to tear them down. So from the street, there is often no sign that behind a Victorian or functionalist facade, there is a partially preserved Spanish structure within. The hospital was built in the form of a T, with two large patios and a grand staircase devised by Spanish architect Claudio de Arciniega in the 16th century. The design provided constant ventilation and sunshine to patients. The architect also included a chapel on each of the two original floors. 'The architecture of this hospital is fascinating,' said Arciniega about the intentional layout of religious spaces and access to open air. 'If you cure the soul, you can cure the body – it’s the same way the doctors thought.' For the 67-year-old Álvarez, who has worked at the hospital for nearly 50 years and also serves as the board of trustees’ treasurer, the center has been a constant in his life. He began working at the hospital as a lab assistant at age 18. 'A lot of people ask me, why do you keep working at the Hospital de Jesus?' he said. 'I tell them because I love it.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-moctezuma-hernan-cortes-hospital-dadf563137d82f5ae5c9534aa3e216b4	2024-12-06T19:01:01-08:00	
South Korean president apologizes, saying he won't shirk responsibility for attempt at martial law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s president apologized Saturday for public anxiety caused by his short-lived attempt to impose martial law earlier this week hours ahead of a parliamentary vote on impeaching him. Yoon said in a brief televised address Saturday morning he won’t shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration and promised not to make another attempt to impose it. He said he would leave it to his conservative political party to chart a course through the country's political turmoil, 'including matters related to my term in office.' South Korean lawmakers are set to vote later Saturday on impeaching President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, as protests grew nationwide calling for his removal. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the motion submitted by opposition lawmakers would get the two-thirds majority required for Yoon to be impeached. But it appeared more likely after the leader of Yoon’s own party on Friday called for suspending his constitutional powers, describing him as unfit to hold the office and capable of taking more extreme action, including renewed attempts to impose martial law. Impeaching Yoon would require support from 200 of the National Assembly’s 300 members. The opposition parties that jointly brought the impeachment motion have 192 seats combined. That means they would need at least eight votes from Yoon’s People Power Party. On Wednesday, 18 members of the PPP joined a vote that unanimously canceled martial law 190-0 less than three hours after Yoon declared the measure on television, calling the opposition-controlled parliament a 'den of criminals' bogging down state affairs. The vote took place as hundreds of heavily-armed troops encircled the National Assembly in an attempt to disrupt the vote and possibly to detain key politicians. Parliament said Saturday that it would meet at 5 p.m. It will first vote on a bill appointing a special prosecutor to investigate influence peddling allegations surrounding Yoon's wife, and then on impeaching Yoon. The turmoil resulting from Yoon’s bizarre and poorly-thought-out stunt has paralyzed South Korean politics and sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners, including neighboring Japan and Seoul’s top ally the United States, as one of the strongest democracies in Asia faces a political crisis that could unseat its leader. Opposition lawmakers claim that Yoon’s martial law declaration amounted to a self-coup and drafted the impeachment motion around rebellion charges. The PPP decided to oppose impeachment at a lawmakers' meeting, despite pleas by its leader Han Dong-hun, who isn’t a lawmaker and has no vote. Following a party meeting on Friday, Han stressed the need to suspend Yoon’s presidential duties and power swiftly, saying he 'could potentially put the Republic of Korea and its citizens in great danger.' Han said he had received intelligence that during the brief period of martial law Yoon ordered the country’s defense counterintelligence commander to arrest and detain unspecified key politicians based on accusations of 'anti-state activities.' Hong Jang-won, first deputy director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, later told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing that Yoon called after imposing martial law and ordered him to help the defense counterintelligence unit to detain key politicians. The targeted politicians included Han, opposition leader Lee Jae-myung and National Assembly speaker Woo Won Shik, according to Kim Byung-kee, one of the lawmakers who attended the meeting. The Defense Ministry said it had suspended the defense counterintelligence commander, Yeo In-hyung, who Han alleged had received orders from Yoon to detain the politicians. The ministry also suspended Lee Jin-woo, commander of the capital defense command, and Kwak Jong-geun, commander of the special warfare command, over their involvement in enforcing martial law. Former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who has been accused of recommending Yoon to enforce martial law, has been placed under a travel ban and faces an investigation by prosecutors over rebellion charges. Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho, who became acting defense minister after Yoon accepted Kim Yong Hyun’s resignation on Thursday, has testified to parliament that it was Kim Yong Hyun who ordered troops to be deployed to the National Assembly after Yoon imposed martial law.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-politics-yoon-martial-law-impeachment-3f2a9190bf5cec83b49e2c6ad5cf5379	2024-12-06T15:39:47-08:00	
TikTok is inching closer to a potential ban in the US. So what's next?	TikTok's future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge to a law that requires the social media platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January. A panel of three judges on The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the law withstood constitutional scrutiny, rebuffing arguments from the two companies that the statute violated their rights and the rights of TikTok users in the U.S. The government has said it wants ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its stakes. But if it doesn't and the platform goes away, it would have a seismic impact on the lives of content creators who rely on the platform for income as well as users who use it for entertainment and connection. Here are some details on the ruling and what could happen next: What does the ruling say? In their lawsuit, TikTok and ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, had challenged the law on various fronts, arguing in part that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and was an unconstitutional bill of attainder that unfairly targeted the two companies. But the court sided with attorneys for the Justice Department who said that the government was attempting to address national security concerns and the way in which it chose to do so did not violate the constitution. The Justice Department has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say that Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread, or suppress, information. However, the U.S. hasn't publicly provided examples of that happening. The appeals court ruling, written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said the law was 'carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary.' The judges also rejected the claim that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, Ginsburg wrote the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to 'suppress content or require a certain mix of content' on TikTok. What happens next? TikTok and ByteDance are expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether the court will take up the case. TikTok indicated in a statement on Friday the two companies are preparing to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has 'an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech.' 'We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,' a company spokesperson said. Alan Morrison, a professor at The George Washington University Law School, said he expects the Supreme Court to take up the case because of the novelty of the issues raised in the lawsuit. If that happens, attorneys for the two companies still have to convince the court to grant them an emergency stay that will prevent the government from enforcing the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline stipulated in the law, Morrison said. Such a move could drag out the process until the Justices make a ruling. Tiffany Cianci, a TikTok content creator who has supported the platform, said she was not shocked about the outcome of the court's ruling on Friday because lower courts typically defer to the executive branch on these types of cases. She believes the company will have a stronger case at the Supreme Court. 'I believe that the next stages are more likely to produce a victory for TikTokers and for TikTok as a whole,' Cianci said. What about Trump? Another wild card is President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the recent presidential campaign that he is now against such action. The Trump transition team has not offered details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to 'save TikTok.' But spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month that he plans to 'deliver' on his campaign promises. After Trump takes office on Jan. 20th, it would fall on his Justice Department to enforce the law and punish any potential violators. Penalties would apply to any app stores that would violate a prohibition on TikTok and to internet hosting services which would be barred from supporting it. Some have speculated that Trump could ask his Justice Department to abstain from enforcing the law. But tech companies like Apple and Google, which offer TikTok's app on their app stores, would then have to trust that the administration would not come after them for any violations. Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said enforcement discretion — or executive orders — can not override existing law, leaving Trump with 'limited room for unilateral action.' There are other things Trump could potentially do. It's possible he could invoke provisions of the law that allow the president to determine whether a sale or a similar transaction frees TikTok from 'foreign adversary' control. Another option is to urge Congress to repeal the law. But that too would require support from congressional Republicans who have overwhelmingly supported the prospect of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company. In a statement issued Friday, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said he was 'optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok' and allow its continued use in the United States. Is anyone trying to buy TikTok? ByteDance has said it won't sell TikTok. And even if it wanted to, a sale of the proprietary algorithm that powers TikTok is likely to get blocked under Chinese export controls that the country issued in 2020. That means if TikTok is sold without the algorithm, its likely that the buyer would only purchase a shell of the platform that doesn't contain the technology that made the app a cultural powerhouse. Still, some investors, including Trump’s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in buying it. This week, a spokesperson for McCourt’s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. The spokesperson did not disclose the identity of the participants.	https://apnews.com/article/bytedance-tiktok-ban-court-trump-2f8c86057073f9412ddb7e5b3a427e0a	2024-12-06T13:47:12-08:00	
Mother of Austin Tice, journalist missing in Syria, says new information proves her son is alive	WASHINGTON (AP) — The mother of Austin Tice, an American journalist missing in Syria for more than a decade, said Friday that she was confident her son was alive, citing information she said had come from a 'significant source' that she did not identify but said had been vetted by the U.S. government and treated as credible. 'He is being cared for and he is well — we do know that,' Debra Tice said. Tice's mother and other relatives spoke at an event Friday following a White House meeting with national security officials that unfolded amid ongoing turmoil in Syria, as insurgent fighters who have already captured the northern city of Aleppo, the country's largest, are pressing their march against President Bashar Assad's forces. 'The news we're hearing from the Middle East is the kind of thing that can unsettle a mom,' Debra Tice said, later adding, 'When I think about war, I never have a happy moment.' Austin Tice's sister, Naomi, said she asked officials whether there was a way to leverage the unrest to help secure Austin's freedom. 'We were basically just told that we need to wait and see how it pans out' — a response she said may have been 'understandable' but was 'beyond frustrating.' Tice's father, Marc, echoed that sentiment, noting that meetings this week with White House and State Department officials had devolved into finger-pointing and frustration. 'We have seen what real commitment looks like. We've seen it in Russia. We've seen it in China, we've seen in Venezuela, we see it in Gaza,' he said, referring to places where hostages have been released in recent months. 'And we've yet to see it for us.' He, too, declined to speak about the information pointing to his son being alive but said, 'We are confident that this information is fresh. It indicated as late as earlier this year that Austin is alive and being cared for. And we do hope to make as much of this public as we can.' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed Friday that the Tice family had met with Biden administration national security adviser Jake Sullivan, but said she didn't know specifics of what was said. 'Austin Tice's family, I can't even imagine what they're going through,' she said. Tice, who is from Houston and whose work had been published by The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and other outlets, disappeared in August 2012 at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus. A video released weeks later showed him blindfolded and held by armed men and saying, 'Oh, Jesus.' He has not been heard from since. Syria has publicly denied that it was holding him. In the final months of the Trump administration, two U.S. officials — the government’s top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens, and Kash Patel, now Trump's pick to lead the FBI — made a secret visit to Damascus to seek information on Tice and other Americans who have disappeared in Syria. It was the highest-level talk in years between the U.S. and Assad's government, though Syrian officials offered no meaningful information on Tice.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-austin-tice-washington-hostage-58e79b5bcb117cac5674b27ff66d5d69	2024-12-06T11:59:59-08:00	
Mexico study's surprising finding: Killer heat hit harder for the young than the elderly	A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50. For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older. The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50. Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits. The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team. 'We found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,' study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. 'As the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.' Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study. 'People of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,' said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team. 'Heat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,' Romanello said in an email. Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said. Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity. Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don’t reach that level. Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher. Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said. Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did. Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said. 'There is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,' Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover. Younger people often have a sense of invulnerability to weather extremes and do things that increase their risk, such as play sports in high heat, Cavazos said. 'High humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating – which is how our body primarily stays cool,' said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was not part of the study team. 'So someone young and healthy working outside in heat and high humidity can reach a point where the body can no longer cool itself safely – causing a deadly form of heat injury called heat stroke.' ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Closely-watched international climate case in the Hague wraps up its first week of testimony	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A closely-watched international climate case that could yield guidance for governments around the world wrapped its first week of arguments before the top court of the United Nations in The Hague Friday. The case, though not binding, is expected to spell out what countries are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact. The push for the International Court of Justice to hear this case comes — like much of the call to address climate change — from island nations who are losing territory and fear they could disappear under rising seas. The U.N. General Assembly asked the court last year for an opinion on 'the obligations of States in respect of climate change.' 'The stakes could not be higher. The survival of my people and so many others is on the line,' Arnold Kiel Loughman, attorney general of the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Hague-based court. For years his country has spearheaded calls for reductions of the greenhouse gases that are causing sea ice to melt and oceans to expand, making the seas rise. Vanuatu led this push for international legal intervention as well. Fifteen judges from around the world must now answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments when their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? With 99 participating countries, it is the largest case in the court’s history. Countries including Vanuatu, Chile and the Philippines want countries like the United States, China and Russia to reduce their emissions and provide financial help to alleviate the devastating impact of climate change that they feel endangers their very existence. 'This is a crisis of survival. It is also a crisis of equity. Fiji contributes 0.004 percent of global emissions but our people bear the brunt of climate impacts. In climate-vulnerable nations, marginalized groups ⎯ women, children and the poor ⎯ are disproportionately affected,' Luke Daunivalu, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said. The South Pacific island nation spoke directly after the United States and Russia, both of whom are major petroleum-producing states and staunchly opposed to the court mandating emissions reductions. Instead, what the United States and other major greenhouse gas emitters want the court to do is defer to the landmark Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to keep global warming to a 1.5 degree C (2.7 F) limit. The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees C (2.3 F) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Between 1990 and 2020, sea levels rose by a global average of 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) and parts of the South Pacific have seen significantly more. 'States designed this international legal framework to address the uniquely complex collective action problem posed by anthropogenic global warming, and it embodies the clearest, most specific and the most current expression of states’ consent to be bound by international law in respect of climate change,' Margaret Taylor said on behalf of the United States, referring to the Paris Agreement. The U.S. also pushed back on an idea proposed by several countries that developed countries have a great obligation to reduce emissions and pay reparations because they have been contributing to the problem for a much longer time. 'A state cannot have international responsibility for acts that take place prior to the date on which its international legal obligation came into existence,' Taylor said. What small states like Vanuatu are hoping for does push the norms of international law. Historically, all countries are held to the same standard. Every country that is a party to the 1948 Genocide Convention, for example, has the exact same obligation to 'punish and prevent' genocide. 'What I have heard is a concerted effort by major polluters seeking to avoid their responsibilities,' Joie Chowdhury, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, told The Associated Press. She said the conduct of major polluters responsible for the climate crisis and its catastrophic consequences is unlawful under multiple international laws. Alongside the hearings, environmental groups held a series of events to promote climate justice. On Sunday, ahead of the hearing, Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change — who first developed the idea of requesting an advisory opinion — together with World Youth for Climate Justice held an afternoon of speeches, music and discussions. Kjelld Kroon, a climate activist who is involved in a lawsuit against the Dutch state for failing to protect his Caribbean island homeland of Bonaire, watched several days of the proceedings and said he wasn’t surprised that rich countries were opposed to more legal obligations. 'This is how a lot of powerful countries in the Global North extract from the Global South,' he told the AP. But Kroon said he found the presentations by many developing states powerful and said they gave him hope. Any decision by the court would be unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. 'If I look at history, I am skeptical,' Kroon said. 'But if I look towards the future, I am a little bit positive.'	https://apnews.com/article/climate-international-court-justice-a7449cb84e5bc555ddee909a1967719e	2024-12-06T09:53:00-08:00	
US opens investigation into Spain's reported port denials of cargo ships carrying arms to Israel	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States has opened an investigation into whether NATO ally Spain has been denying port entry to cargo vessels reportedly transporting U.S. weapons to Israel. The Federal Maritime Commission, an independent body charged with monitoring and evaluating conditions that may affect shipping and U.S. international trade, said it had opened the probe after receiving information that Spain had refused to allow at least three cargo vessels into its ports. 'The commission is concerned that this apparent policy of denying entry to certain vessels will create conditions unfavorable to shipping in the foreign trade,' it said Thursday in a notice published in the Federal Register. If the investigation determines that Spain has interfered with such commerce, the commission could levy millions of dollars in fines, up to $2.3 million per voyage, it said. The notice said the commission had been informed on Nov. 19 that Spain was denying port entry to ships, including those enrolled in the U.S.-run Maritime Security Program, which is supposed to afford vessels and their owners protection against 'restrictive and discriminatory' licensing because their services are often used by the U.S. military. Two of the three incidents noted by the commission involved vessels run by the Danish shipping giant Maersk in November. The other occurred in May. Spanish authorities did not immediately comment on the November incidents. But in May, Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente said the foreign ministry had denied a request to dock by the Danish-flagged ship Marianne Danica, saying it 'was carrying weapons to Israel.' A day later, on May 17, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told Spain’s state broadcaster RTVE that this was the first ship carrying arms to Israel that had been denied entry. 'We are not going to contribute to any more arms reaching the Middle East,' he said. 'The Middle East needs peace. That is why that this first denial of authorization will start a policy for any boat carrying arms to Israel that wants to dock at a Spanish port.' The refusal to allow the Marianne Danica to dock at the Mediterranean port of Cartegena came just days before Spain, along with Ireland and Norway, recognized a Palestinian state on May 28. Spain stopped its own defense companies from shipping arms to Israel in October 2023.	https://apnews.com/article/us-spain-israel-weapons-shipping-7cb890af47716111445f7726ce19ddb4	2024-12-06T08:59:11-08:00	
Car rams and injures orchestral musicians in Belgrade during a protest over station roof collapse	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — The Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra said four of its musicians were injured Friday in an incident during a weekly 15-minute traffic blockade commemorating the 15 people who died when a concrete canopy collapsed at a railway station in a northern Serbian city last month. The traffic blockades have been held every Friday in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, and other cities and towns since the fall of the concrete construction in Novi Sad on Nov. 1. Hundreds also took part in protests this Friday at various locations throughout the country, standing in silence to commemorate the victims and demanding accountability for their deaths. Some members of the Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra joined a traffic blockade at a pedestrian crossing near their place of work on Friday, a statement said. A man refused to stop and drove his car through the protesters, hurting the musicians, the statement added. Serbian media said police arrested a 67-year-old man from the northern town of Kikinda. The musicians received medical care, reports said. The Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra 'most harshly condemns the act of violence against them (musicians) while they were expressing their personal civic opinion,' the orchestra said. It cancelled a scheduled performance on Friday evening. Serbian university students have joined the protests in recent days, organizing 24-hour blockades at their faculties. Hundreds came out on Friday to halt traffic on busy streets in Belgrade and elsewhere. Rallies in past weeks have occasionally been marred by violent incidents when pro-government supporters showed up and tried to disrupt the protesters blocking traffic. The railway station building in Novi Sad was renovated twice in recent years. Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption and opaque deals resulted in sloppy work and led to the collapse of the canopy. While prosecutors have announced the arrests of 13 people, a Serbian court has since released from detention former government construction minister Goran Vesic. This has fueled widespread skepticism of the ongoing investigation, as the ruling populists control both the police and judiciary.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-protest-belgrade-orchestra-musicians-6180768fac904818cd2b5fd0b8b342d0	2024-12-06T08:44:16-08:00	
Ex-British soldier pleads not guilty to 'Bloody Sunday' murders after judge clears the way for trial	LONDON (AP) — A former British soldier will be tried for the murder of two men killed during the 1972 'Bloody Sunday' disturbances in Londonderry, Northern Ireland’s second-biggest city, after a judge refused to dismiss the charges against him. The veteran, known only as Soldier F, is charged with two counts of murder and five counts of attempted murder stemming from a civil rights march and the rioting that followed it on Jan. 30, 1972. Thirteen people were killed by British Army gunfire that day, the largest number of deaths in a shooting incident during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland known as 'The Troubles.' During a hearing Friday at Belfast Crown Court, Justice Stephen Fowler rejected an application from the ex-soldier’s lawyers to dismiss the charges on the grounds that there wasn’t enough evidence to convict him. Following the ruling, Soldier F pleaded not guilty. The veteran entered his plea from behind a blue floor-to-ceiling curtain after the judge granted a request to shield his identity. The veteran’s lawyers had argued that he would be a 'prized target' for dissident Irish Republicans if his identity were made public. The judge said he expected the trial to take place early next year and scheduled the next hearing in the case for Jan. 24. Soldier F is the only British Army veteran to face trial for the Bloody Sunday killings after years of investigations and aborted efforts to bring charges against the former soldiers. The first government-commissioned inquiry, published less than three months after the deaths, found that the soldiers had only opened fire after they had been fired upon. A second inquiry in 2010 rejected that conclusion, finding that the soldiers violated their rules of engagement and opened fire on people who didn’t pose a threat to them. That cleared the way for the prosecution of Soldier F. Bloody Sunday remains a source of tension in Northern Ireland more than 25 years after the peace agreement that largely ended the Troubles. Families of the victims continue to demand justice for their loved ones, while supporters of army veterans who fought in the conflict complain that they continue to be dogged by investigations and potential charges decades after their service ended. Outside the court, Mickey McKinney, the brother of one of the men killed in 1972, said it was a 'good day' for the victims and their families. 'The events of Bloody Sunday took place 53 years ago next month,' he said. 'It is imperative that the court does not tolerate any more delay and that this trial proceeds as a matter of urgency.'	https://apnews.com/article/britain-bloody-sunday-northern-ireland-troubles-c9261a4cb3a2131be1ec0c49f9637820	2024-12-06T07:45:26-08:00	
TikTok's future uncertain after appeals court rejects its bid to overturn possible US ban	A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in a few short months, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok's petition to overturn the law — which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January — and rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment. 'The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,' said the court's opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. 'Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States.' TikTok and ByteDance — another plaintiff in the lawsuit — are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, though its unclear whether the court will take up the case. 'The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’ right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,' TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement. 'Unfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,' Hughes said. Unless stopped, he argued the statute 'will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.' Though the case is squarely in the court system, its also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a years-long saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China. 'Today’s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday. The U.S. has said it’s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect — a concern mirrored by the European Union on Friday as it scrutinizes the video-sharing app’s role in the Romanian elections. TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn’t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing’s benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government. Friday’s ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republican and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September. In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok’s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three of them denied TikTok’s petition. In the court's ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok's main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to 'suppress content or require a certain mix of content' on TikTok. 'Content on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,' Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion. TikTok’s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators - for which the company is covering legal costs - as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok. 'This is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans’ access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,' said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. 'We hope that the appeals court’s ruling won’t be the last word.' Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court's ruling. 'I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,' said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China. Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said 'it's time for ByteDance to accept' the law. To assuage concerns about the company’s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data. The company has also argued the government’s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient. Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it’s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm - the platform’s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan - would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content. Still, some investors, including Trump’s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok’s U.S. business. This week, a spokesperson for McCourt’s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital.	https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-court-ruling-china-6bfd505295ad44126df0544fc083d6a6	2024-12-06T06:35:41-08:00	
Princess of Wales takes another step in return to public life after chemotherapy with carol service	LONDON (AP) — The Princess of Wales took another step Friday in her return to public life following cancer treatment, in hosting her annual Christmas carol service at Westminster Abbey. Dressed in a festive red coat featuring a large black bow on the collar and black buttons, the princess, often referred to simply as Kate, arrived with her husband Prince William and their three children. They were met by clergy in front of a row of Christmas trees decorated with glittering white lights. Inside the abbey, Kate chatted with members of the congregation and performers, including Gregory Porter. This year’s concert is designed to celebrate the support people give to one another, especially as they struggle through difficult times, a theme that may have particular resonance for the princess after abdominal surgery and chemotherapy forced her to step back from public duties for much of 2024. Kate alluded to this in a letter thanking the 1,600 people invited to attend the event because of their efforts to help others in their communities. 'The Christmas story encourages us to consider the experiences and feelings of others,' Kate wrote. 'It also reflects our own vulnerabilities and reminds us of the importance of giving and receiving empathy, as well as just how much we need each other in spite of our differences.' Kate has hosted the carol service since it began in 2021, celebrating the work of doctors, nurses and emergency workers as Britain returned to normal following the COVID-19 pandemic. The princess wowed the audience, playing the piano to accompany Scottish singer Tom Walker on his song 'For Those Who Can’t Be Here,' inspired by the loss and separation caused by the pandemic. The order of service Friday will also feature a cover image by British artist Charlie Mackesy, who wrote and illustrated 'The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse.’’ The 2019 book highlighted the importance of kindness through the unlikely friendship of the four title characters as they search for the boy’s home. Kate and her husband have been open about the challenges they faced this year as both the princess and King Charles III were diagnosed with cancer. The princess has made only a few public appearances since she underwent abdominal surgery in February and then announced she was undergoing treatment for cancer a few weeks later. Her first post-chemotherapy appearances were geared toward moments of national significance, such as the king’s birthday parade and the annual Remembrance Day ceremonies to honor the nation’s war dead. But earlier this week she helped greet the emir of Qatar during his state visit to Britain, and now she’s returning to her signature event. Charles was sidelined after revealing in February that he was suffering from an undisclosed form of cancer. But while he began returning to public duties at the end of April, Kate needed more time. The carol service will feature performances by singers Porter and Paloma Faith. Prince William, actors Richard E. Grant, Michelle Dockery and Sophie Okonedo, as well as Olympic swimming champion Adam Peaty will give readings linked to the theme of love and empathy. The event will be taped for broadcast on Christmas Eve by the British channel ITV1 and its streaming service ITVX. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/royalty	https://apnews.com/article/princess-kate-carols-christmas-service-mackesy-royal-fb2d9330ac9da508afbd2064d30440b5	2024-12-06T06:32:46-08:00	
Under assault by gangs in Haiti, a Kenyan-led mission fights back	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — An armored vehicle carrying Kenyan police rumbles through Haiti's capital with a shattered window that a high-caliber bullet failed to penetrate, a permanent sign of violence the officers face almost daily in Port-au-Prince. The Kenyans, who were deployed to Haiti earlier this year to help quell gang violence, have faced relentless attacks. On Thursday, gunfire erupted in Port-au-Prince as Kenyan officers repelled heavily armed gangs that run 85% of the city and are fighting to seize full control. The Kenyans, joined by Haitian officers, crouched behind sandbags and a concrete wall at the former offices of the National Police that authorities were forced to abandon in recent years by encroaching gangs. Bullets whizzed by as police kept their heads down low and returned fire. 'The days are numbered for the gangs,' Godfrey Otunge, commander of the United Nations-backed mission led by Kenya, told The Associated Press. 'Either you surrender … or we are coming for you.' Police face a daunting task. More than 4,500 people have been reported killed in Haiti so far this year, and another 2,060 injured, according to the U.N. Gang violence also has displaced an estimated 700,000 people in recent years as gunmen burn and pillage communities in a push to control more territory. A growing number of people have criticized the Kenyan-led mission, noting that police have not seized control of gang strongholds nor arrested any gang leaders. On patrol in their heavily armored vehicle, one of its windows previously damaged by a bullet strike, police returned fire with smoke rising from their automatic weapons. The vehicle lumbered past charred cars, makeshift blockades and the body of a person burned to death, the skull poking through a burned tire. Last week alone, some 42,000 people were left homeless, half of them children, according to UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency. An estimated six million people, including 3.3 million children, will need humanitarian aid next year, the agency said. Gang violence worsened last month as the United States and other countries pushed for a U.N. peacekeeping mission, noting that the current Kenyan-led mission lacks resources and funding.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-violence-kenya-police-united-nations-767d0ca23708d17631b41626a7168429	2024-12-06T05:55:15-08:00	
Where Turkey stands as opposition insurgents advance in neighboring Syria	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — As forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad make swift and significant advances in Syria, Turkey is watching closely for any spillover. Turkey, which shares a 911-kilometer- (566 mile-) long frontier with Syria, has been a main backer of opposition groups aiming to topple Assad since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011. The conflict led to a refugee influx and Turkey now hosts 3 million Syrians. Turkish officials have strongly rejected claims of any involvement in the offensive that is being led by the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham as well as an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Analysts however, believe that the offensive, which appears to be aligned with Turkey’s long-time goals, could not have gone ahead without Ankara's consent. It has allowed Turkey to push back against Kurdish forces in Syria allied to its sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday appeared to blame his Syrian counterpart, Bashar Assad, for the recent developments. 'We had made a call to Assad. We said, ‘Come, let’s meet, let’s determine the future of Syria together.’ Unfortunately, we could not get a positive response from Assad,' Erdogan said. 'These troublesome marches that continue throughout the region are not what we want.' Here’s a look at Turkey’s position, how the flareup could serve the country’s objectives and possible risks ahead: Ties with Syria Turkey has stated its support for Syria’s territorial integrity: the last thing it wants is a Kurdish-controlled autonomous region on it border. Ankara has conducted several incursions into Syria since 2016 with the aim of pushing back the Islamic State group or Kurdish militants and creating a buffer zone along its border, and now controls a stretch of territory in northern Syria. Turkey has called for a reduction of tensions and reconciliation between Syria’s government and the opposition. It has been involved in diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict, including holding talks with Assad’s main supporters, Russia and Iran. Recently Ankara has sought a reconciliation with Assad in order to mitigate the threat to Turkey from Kurdish militias and ensure the safe return of refugees. Assad has rebuffed Turkey’s overtures. Where Turkey stands Turkish officials have strongly rejected claims of involvement in the anti-government offensive, stating opposition to developments that increase instability in the region. 'All statements that claim Turkey provoked or that Turkey supported this are untrue. They are all lies,' said Omer Celik, spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party. 'What we want in Syria is not in any way an increase in violence or clashes.' Analysts say, however, that the rebel offensive would have been impossible without a green light from Turkey. Despite designating HTS as a terrorist organization, Turkey is believed to exert significant influence over the group. Turkish officials say Ankara stalled the offensive for months. Opposition forces finally went ahead with the assault after the Syrian government attacked opposition-held areas, violating agreements between Russia, Iran and Turkey to de-escalate the conflict. The offensive was initially meant to be limited, the officials said, but expanded after Syrian government forces began retreating from their positions. Gonul Tol, director of the U.S.-based Middle East Institutes' Turkish Program, says Ankara does not have full control over HTS, but has provided indirect support, allowing aid trucks to pass to the HTS stronghold of Idlib. The agreement between Turkey, Russia and Iran also helped the group to thrive, Tol said. Risks ahead The offensive could pose several risks to Turkey, including stoking tensions with Syria’s backers, Iran and Russia. Turkey, a NATO member, has sought to balance close relations with both Ukraine and Russia in the face of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of its southern neighbor. Increasing instability in Syria could send a new wave of refugees toward the Turkish border. Tol, who is the author of a book on Turkey and Syria, said that although Russia is preoccupied with the war in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin would be unwilling to see Assad fall. 'I doubt Russia is going to give up on Assad,' Tol said. 'Syria is just too important for Putin.' Alignment of goals The insurgents’ offensive has raised hopes that Turkey may achieve its strategic objectives in Syria, including securing its southern borders and facilitating the safe return of Syrian refugees. Since 2022, Turkey has sought to normalize relations with Syria. However, Assad insists on the withdrawal of Turkish troops from northern Syria, while Turkey maintains it cannot withdraw as long as threats from Kurdish militias persist. Analysts believe the offensive could pressure Assad into reconciliation with Turkey and engaging in negotiations with the Syrian opposition. Additionally, it may allow Turkey to push the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units, the YPG, away from its borders. Despite the YPG’s alliance with the U.S. against the Islamic State group, Turkey views it as a terrorist organization. Recently, another opposition force, the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, expelled the YPG from Tal Rifaat, north of Aleppo. The leader of Turkey’s nationalist party, an Erdogan ally, has called for targeting the Kurdish-held city of Manbij next. There are also hopes that opposition control of Aleppo will encourage refugees to return, with Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya noting that about 40% of Syrian refugees in Turkey are from Aleppo. However, Tol noted that Turkey may not be able to control the HTS as it forges ahead and pursues its own interests. 'The question is, will the HTS listen to Erdogan after having gained so much ground?' she said. Tol added: 'HTS are a wild card. Does Turkey really want a jihadist organization to be running a neighboring country?'	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-syria-insurgents-explainer-kurds-ypg-refugees-f60dc859c7843569124282ea750f1477	2024-12-06T04:37:34-08:00	
Sale of UK's Observer, world's oldest Sunday newspaper and a bastion of liberal values, is agreed	LONDON (AP) — The sale of the Observer, the world's oldest Sunday newspaper and a bastion of liberal values in Britain's media landscape, was approved Friday despite two days of strike action from journalists this week. The Scott Trust, the owner of the Guardian Media Group, which includes the Observer and its sister paper the Guardian, said the sale to Tortoise Media is expected to be signed in the coming days. The Scott Trust said it will invest in Tortoise Media, becoming a key shareholder, and take a seat on both its editorial and commercial boards. Under the terms of the deal, Tortoise will invest 25 million pounds ($32 million) in the Observer, which was founded in 1791 and became part of the Guardian Media Group in 1993, and has committed to continue its Sunday print edition and build up its digital brand. It has also committed to safeguarding journalistic freedom and the editorial independence of the Observer, undertaking to honor the 'liberal values and journalistic standards' of the Scott Trust in its editorial code. Tortoise was launched in 2019 by James Harding, a former editor of the London Times and director of news at the BBC, and the former U.S. ambassador to London, Matthew Barzun. Harding said the Observer name represents 'the best of liberal, pioneering journalism,' and promised readers that 'we will do all we can to live up to its history as a defender of human dignity and to give it a new lease of life as a powerful, progressive voice in the world.' Ole Jacob Sunde, who chairs the Scott Trust, said the Observer needed 'an ally to be sufficiently funded, long-term in nature and respect editorial independence and liberal values.' Journalists at both the Guardian, which publishes print editions between Monday and Saturday and has a deep digital footprint around the world, and the Observer, have protested the sale and went on a 48-hour strike on Wednesday and Thursday. Though the Guardian is clearly the bigger brand, especially in the digital space, the two newspapers had a very close relationship, operating from the same building in London and sharing resources. 'I recognize how unsettling this period has been for Observer staff but we’re confident we have agreed the best possible way forward for the title’s journalists, its readers and the future of both the Observer and the Guardian,' said Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief of Guardian News &amp; Media. Members of the National Union of Journalists from both papers will meet later Friday to consider next steps, its general secretary-elect Laura Davison said. 'The timing of the decision, before the end of two extremely well-supported days of action, is particularly shabby,' she said. Giao Pacey, a partner at media and entertainment law firm Simkins LLP, said the Observer's new leadership will have to be careful in safeguarding the value of the newspaper, which is intrinsically linked to its brand, established over centuries. 'Once the sale is completed, the leadership team will need to strike the right balance between preserving the legacy, culture and integrity of the business while ensuring that it has sufficient resources and support to thrive in a rapidly evolving market,' said Pacey.	https://apnews.com/article/guardian-observer-britain-sale-strikes-tortoise-media-f522a7438dfc52f04aa243da3b253761	2024-12-06T04:37:09-08:00	
Romania's top court annuls first round of presidential vote won by far-right candidate	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — A top Romanian court on Friday annulled the first round of the country's presidential election, days after allegations that Russia ran a coordinated online campaign to promote the far-right outside r who won the first round. The Constitutional Court’s unprecedented decision — which is final — came after President Klaus Iohannis declassified intelligence on Wednesday that alleged Russia ran a sprawling campaign comprising thousands of social media accounts to promote Calin Georgescu across platforms such as TikTok and Telegram. The intelligence files were from the Romanian Intelligence Service, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Special Telecommunication Service and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Despite being an outsider who declared zero campaign spending, Georgescu emerged as the frontrunner on Nov. 24. He was due to face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a runoff on Sunday. A new date will now be set to rerun the vote from scratch. Some 951 voting stations had already opened abroad on Friday for the runoff for Romania's large diaspora but had to be halted. Lasconi strongly condemned the court's decision, saying it was 'illegal, immoral, and crushes the very essence of democracy.' 'We should have moved forward with the vote. We should have respected the will of the Romanian people. Whether we like it or not, from a legal and legitimate standpoint, 9 million Romanian citizens, both in the country and the diaspora, expressed their preference for a particular candidate through their votes. We cannot ignore their will!' she said. 'I know I would have won. And I will win because the Romanian people know I will fight for them, that I will unite them for a better Romania,' she added. 'I will defend our democracy. I will not give up.' She said the issue of Russian interference should have been tackled after the election was completed. Some 9.4 million people — about 52.5% of eligible voters — had cast ballots in the first round. Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said in a statement the annulment was 'the only correct solution' following the intelligence drop which revealed the 'Romanian people’s vote was flagrantly distorted as a result of Russian interference.' 'The presidential elections must be held again,' he said in a post on Facebook. 'At the same time, investigations by the authorities must uncover who is responsible for the massive attempt to influence the outcome of the presidential election.' The same court last week ordered a recount of the first-round votes, which added to the myriad controversies that have engulfed a chaotic election cycle. Following a recount, the court then validated the first-round results on Monday. Many observers have expressed concerns that annulling the vote could trigger civil unrest. George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, said the development was a 'coup d’état in full swing' but urged people not to take to the streets. 'We don’t let ourselves be provoked, this system has to fall democratically,' he said. Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, said the court's decision amounts to a 'crisis mode situation for the Romanian democracy.' 'In light of the information about the external interference, the massive interference in elections, I think this was not normal but predictable, because it’s not normal times at all, Romania is an uncharted territory,' he told The Associated Press. 'The problem is here, do we have the institutions to manage such an interference in the future?' Thirteen candidates ran in the first round presidential vote in this European Union and NATO member country. The president serves a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments. On Dec. 1, Romania also held a parliamentary election which saw pro-Western parties win the most votes, but also a surge of support for far-right nationalists. Before the first round vote, most surveys predicted the top three candidates would be Ciolacu, who came in third place, and Simion or Lasconi in second place. As the surprising results came in with Georgescu on top, and Lasconi narrowly beating Ciolacu, it sent shockwaves through the political establishment and plunged it into turmoil. Georgescu’s surprising success in the presidential race left many political observers wondering how most local surveys were so far off, putting him behind at least five other candidates before the vote. Many observers attributed his success to his TikTok account, which now has 6 million likes and 541,000 followers. But some experts suspect Georgescu’s online following was artificially inflated while Romania’s top security body alleged he was given preferential treatment by TikTok over other candidates. In the intelligence release, the secret services alleged that one TikTok user paid more $381,000 (361,000 euros) to other users to promote Georgescu content. Intelligence authorities said information they obtained 'revealed an aggressive promotion campaign' to increase and accelerate his popularity. Georgescu, when asked by the AP in an interview Wednesday whether he believes the Chinese-owned TikTok poses a threat to democracy, defended social media platforms. 'The most important existing function for promoting free speech and freedom of expression is social media,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/romania-election-president-georgescu-court-585e8f8f3ce7013951f5c7cf4054179b	2024-12-06T04:19:49-08:00	
Thousands march through Greek capital on anniversary of fatal police shooting	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Several thousand people marched through the Greek capital on Friday on the anniversary of a fatal police shooting of a teenager in 2008, and minor violence broke out later as youths attacked police. No injuries or arrests were reported from clashes after the end of the march in Athens. Rioters threw fuel bombs and stones at riot police, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades in the central Exarcheia district where the 2008 shooting occurred. Alexandros Grigoropoulos, a 15-year-old high school student, was fatally shot by a police officer, sparking days of rioting. His death remains a rallying point for annual demonstrations by left-wing and student groups that often turn violent. Despite heavy rainfall in the Greek capital, some 5,000 police officers patrolled the city Friday, focusing on Exarcheia. Police deployed water cannon vehicles, drones and helicopters to monitor the demonstrations and maintained a strong presence near embassies and ministries. Road closures and traffic diversions were imposed for the march, while public transportation was disrupted and two central subway stations were closed for much of the day. A police officer arrested for the shooting of Grigoropoulos was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2010 but was released in 2019 after his sentence was reduced. That decision was upheld at a retrial three years later. A second officer was also convicted as an accomplice and released on parole after serving three years in prison.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-athens-shooting-anniversary-6180bdb61c1fb37a03fdf74be0c4c42c	2024-12-06T01:30:15-08:00	
In the 6-hour mayhem of South Korea's martial law, a woman's act of resistance was a defining moment	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — In the groundswell of fury and defiance that erupted among South Koreans after their president declared martial law, curtailing the country's hard-won freedoms, it was perhaps the iconic moment. As parliamentarians scrambled to get inside the National Assembly building to reverse the emergency measure, a woman in a leather coat confronted one of the soldiers who was trying to stop the lawmakers, grabbed his automatic rifle and tried to tug it away while yelling 'Aren't you ashamed?' As the soldier backed away, he raised the rifle's barrel toward the woman. She pressed on, grabbing it as it was pointed at her chest, still yelling, before he gave up, turned and walked away. Video of the encounter quickly went viral and became a social media rallying cry that helped fuel the six-hour outburst of protest before President Yoon Suk Yeol was forced to rescind the martial law order early Wednesday morning. But the woman in the leather coat, An Gwiryeong, told The Associated Press it was just one of many acts of resistance that cold Tuesday night in Seoul. 'I don't think my actions were that special, in fact, there were many people at the scene that day who were much braver than I was,' the 35-year-old said in an interview Friday in a parliamentary office. 'For example, the citizens who couldn’t enter the National Assembly were outside, blocking the armored vehicles and showing such courage,' she said. 'So I don’t think my actions were particularly special or braver than anyone else’s.' A former television anchor, An left her job at YTN television in 2022 and joined opposition leader Lee Jae-myung's presidential campaign in 2022 as a spokesperson. She was the Democratic Party's candidate for Dobong district in Seoul in the 2024 general election but lost, and is currently a party spokesperson. When Yoon declared martial law late on Tuesday, An, like many South Koreans, watched the 10:29 p.m. national address on television. Shocked at the announcement, she jumped into a taxi and headed for the National Assembly, one of the thousands of people who did the same. While South Korea’s president can declare martial law, which Yoon used to announce bans on anti-government demonstrations and political parties and controls on the media, the constitution allows the National Assembly to vote to end it. Following his announcement, Yoon dispatched police and soldiers to the National Assembly to prevent lawmakers from getting inside to hold a vote, and people like An streamed to the building to make sure that they could. 'When I arrived at the National Assembly, I could hear the sound of helicopters,' she recalled. 'The martial law troops were already in a standoff with the citizens.' She said troops were trying to enter the building, and she joined the growing throng of people trying to hold them back. 'I thought, we have to prevent that,' she said. 'If the entrance here is breached and the martial law troops get inside, they will block the vote, and then not only will the martial law not be lifted, but our country’s democracy will be over. There will be no next time.' That's when she found herself confronting a soldier in full battle gear, grabbed his rifle and tried to wrest it from him. 'At that moment, I thought, 'Is this real?' she recalled. 'I was scared because I’m just a human. But as I said, the thought that we must stop them was stronger than my fear. I didn’t feel it was real because armed soldiers with guns entering the National Assembly? I thought it was ridiculous.' An and the others succeeded, and enough lawmakers, including members of Yoon's own party, were able to get into the main hall of the assembly to form a quorum. Just after 1 a.m. they voted 190-0 to end martial law and the security forces began leaving the area minutes later. At 4:30 a.m. martial law was officially lifted following an emergency meeting of Yoon's Cabinet. But An stayed on at the National Assembly, unconvinced it was all over. 'I didn't know what might happen next,' she said. 'I couldn't let my guard down.' Eventually she did go home, but said it took until Thursday for her to start coming down from the adrenaline-fueled mayhem of that night. 'I've started to feel my body aching a bit as the tension has somewhat eased,' she said. Now, she said warily, it's a matter of seeing whether calls for Yoon's impeachment will be successful. 'I don't think it's over yet,' she said. ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.

Middle East latest: Negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire have resumed, Hamas says	A Hamas official says international mediators have resumed negotiations with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he is hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war is within reach. Ceasefire negotiations were halted last month when Qatar suspended talks with mediators from Egypt and the United States because of frustration over a lack of progress between Israel and Hamas. But Bassem Naim, an official in Hamas’ political bureau, said in Turkey on Thursday that there has been a 'reactivation' of efforts in recent days to end the fighting, release hostages from Gaza and free Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Iran, meanwhile, said Friday it conducted a successful space launch, the latest in a program the West alleges improves its missile technology. The announcement comes as heightened tensions grip the wider Middle East over Israel’s continued war with Hamas and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon. Israel's war against Hamas has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel in October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Israel’s blistering retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the Latest: Iran says it conducted a successful space launch in a program long criticized by the West MANAMA, Bahrain — Iran said Friday it conducted a successful space launch, the latest for its program the West alleges improves Tehran’s ballistic missile technology. Iran conducted the launch using its Simorgh program, a satellite-carrying rocket that had had a series of failed launches, at Iran’s Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province. That’s the site of Iran’s civilian space program. The Simorgh carried what Iran described as an 'orbital propulsion system,' as well as two research systems to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) orbit above the Earth. A system that could change the orbit of a spacecraft would allow Iran to geo-synchronize the orbits of its satellites. Tehran has long sought that ability. Iran also put the payload of the Simorgh at 300 kilograms (660 pounds), heavier than its previous successful launches. There was no immediate independent confirmation the launch was successful. The U.S. military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The announcement comes as heightened tensions grip the wider Middle East over Israel’s continued war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon. Australian leader blames antisemitism for arson that extensively damaged a Melbourne synagogue MELBOURNE, Australia — Arsonists extensively damaged a Melbourne synagogue on Friday in what Australia’s prime minister condemned as an antisemitic attack on Australian values. The blaze in the Adass Israel Synagogue is an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and Hamas last year. Cars and buildings have been vandalized and torched around Australia in protests inspired by the war. A witness who had come to the synagogue to pray saw two masked men spreading a liquid accelerant with brooms inside the building at 4:10 a.m., officials said. About 60 firefighters with 17 fire trucks responded to the blaze, which police said caused extensive damage. Investigators have yet to identify a motive, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese blamed antisemitism. 'This was a shocking incident to be unequivocally condemned. There is no place in Australia for an outrage such as this,' Albanese told reporters. 'To attack a place of worship is an attack on Australian values. To attack a synagogue is an act of antisemitism, is attacking the right that all Australians should have to practice their faith in peace and security,' he added. Hamas official says Gaza ceasefire talks have resumed after weekslong hiatus ISTANBUL — A Hamas official says international mediators have resumed negotiating with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he was hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war was within reach. Ceasefire negotiations were halted last month when Qatar suspended talks with mediators from Egypt and the United States because of frustration over a lack of progress between Israel and Hamas. But there has been a 'reactivation' of efforts in recent days to end the fighting, release hostages from Gaza and free Palestinian prisoners in Israel, according to Bassem Naim, an official in Hamas’ political bureau who spoke with The Associated Press in Turkey on Thursday. Another official familiar with the talks confirmed the return of Qatari mediators. The official spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations with the media. Since the talks broke down, there have been significant shifts in the global and regional landscape. Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, and a ceasefire was declared last week between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Trump is a staunch supporter of Israel, but Naim said he believes the incoming administration could 'affect the situation positively' given that Trump had made halting wars in the region part of his campaign platform. Trump this week called for the release of all hostages held in Gaza by the time he takes office on Jan. 20, saying there would be 'hell to pay' if that doesn’t happen. Attack near US base in eastern Syria may have wounded 3 service members, Pentagon says WASHINGTON -- Three U.S. service members were being evaluated for potential traumatic brain injuries following an attack near a base in eastern Syria this week, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday. Ryder said U.S. Central Command is still evaluating who was behind the attack near Mission Support Site Euphrates, which prompted the U.S. to conduct counter strikes on Tuesday. At the time, the Pentagon said rockets and mortars had landed in the vicinity of the base. The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria to conduct missions to counter the Islamic Stage group. ___ By Lolita Baldor	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-lebanon-news-6-december-2024-59b74360c1b44c99b47e1c6d80118bd1	2024-12-06T00:25:27-08:00	
Syrian insurgents enter 2 central towns, bringing them close to the city of Homs	BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian insurgents entered two central towns early Friday just north of the central city of Homs, bringing them closer Syria’s third largest city, an opposition war monitor and pro-government media both reported. The break into Rastan and Talbiseh came a day after opposition gunmen captured the central city of Hama, Syria’s fourth largest, after the Syrian army said it withdrew to avoid fighting inside the city and spare the lives of civilians. The insurgents, led by the jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, have said that they will march to Homs and Damascus, President Bashar Assad’s seat of power. The city of Homs, parts of which were controlled by insurgents until 2014, is a major intersection point between the capital, Damascus, and Syria’s coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus where Assad enjoys wide support. Homs province is Syria’s largest in size and borders Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. Insurgents are now 5 kilometers (3 miles) away from Homs, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor. 'The battle of Homs is the mother of all battles and will decide who will rule Syria,' said Rami Abdurrahman, the Observatory’s chief. Pro-government Sham FM said the insurgents entered Rastan and Talbiseh without facing any resistance. There was no immediate comment from the Syrian military on whether it has withdrawn from the towns. State news agency SANA quoted an unnamed military official as saying Friday that Syrian and Russian air force are attacking insurgents in Hama province, killing dozens of fighters. After the fall of Hama, opposition activists said that thousands of Homs residents who are loyal to Assad were seen fleeing toward Damascus and the coastal region. Syria’s defense minister said in a televised statement late Thursday that the withdrawal of government forces from Hama was a tactical measure and vowed to gain back lost areas. Gen. Ali Mahmoud Abbas said that the insurgents, whom he described as 'takfiri' or Muslim extremists, are backed by foreign countries. He did not name the countries but appeared to be referring to Turkey, which is a main backer of the opposition, and the United States. 'We are in a good position on the ground,' Abbas said, adding that Thursday’s withdrawal of the Syrian army from Hama was 'a temporary tactical measure and our forces are at the gates of Hama.' His comments were made before the insurgents marched south of Hama, getting close to Homs. The offensive is being led by HTS as well as an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Their sudden capture of the northern city of Aleppo, an ancient business hub, was a stunning prize for Assad’s opponents and reignited the conflict which had been largely stalemated for the past few years. ____ Associated Press writer Albert Aji contributed to this report from Damascus, Syria.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-08d18aa519dd9883eb291f5a534a02f3	2024-12-06T00:15:32-08:00	
Foreign minister says in interview that Russia will use 'all means' to defend its interests	MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s top diplomat said in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson released Friday that Moscow doesn't want a war with the United States but will use 'all means' to defend its interests. Sergey Lavrov argued that while Russia and the U.S. are officially not at war, Washington’s permission for Ukraine to use American longer-range missiles for strikes on Russian territory marked a dangerous escalation. 'It is obvious that the Ukrainians would not be able to do what they’re doing with long-range modern weapons without direct participation of the American servicemen. And this is dangerous, no doubt about this,' he said, adding that the Western belief that Russia's red lines could be 'moved again and again' is 'a very serious mistake.' Lavrov, the world’s longest-serving foreign minister who has been on the job for 20 years, said that a recent Russian strike on Ukraine with a new hypersonic intermediate range ballistic missile called Oreshnik was a signal to the West that Russia is prepared to use all means to achieve its goals in Ukraine. 'The message which we wanted to send by testing in real action this hypersonic system is that we will be ready to do anything to defend our legitimate interests,' he said. 'The United States, and the allies of the United States who also provide these long-range weapons to the Kyiv regime, they must understand that we would be ready to use any means not to allow them to succeed in what they call strategic defeat of Russia.' Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the Nov. 21 attack with Oreshnik as a response to Ukrainian strikes on Russian military facilities in Bryansk and Kursk regions with Western-supplied weapons. He has declared that in the case of new attacks on Russia with Western longer-range weapons, Russia could use Oreshnik to hit the government district in Kyiv. Putin also warned that Russia could use the new missile to strike military facilities of Kyiv’s Western allies that allow Ukraine to use their weapons for attacks on Russian territory. Putin hailed Oreshnik’s capability, saying that its multiple warheads that plunge to a target at 10 times the speed of sound are immune to intercept by any existing air defense systems. Russia’s missile forces chief said that the missile, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, has a range allowing it to reach all of Europe. Lavrov said that Russia has issued a warning to the U.S. about the Oreshnik launch 30 minutes before it happened using an automated system used to exchange such advance notices. He said that 'we hate even to think about war with the United States, which will take nuclear character,' but he warned that any potential exchange of nuclear strikes between Russia and NATO allies in Europe will inevitably escalate into a wider conflict in which the U.S. will be targeted. 'To speak about limited exchange of nuclear strikes is an invitation to disaster, which we don’t want to have,' Lavrov said. Speaking about the Kremlin conditions for a potential peace deal, he reaffirmed Putin’s demand that Ukraine should pull back its forces from the four regions that Russia annexed in September 2022 and renounce its bid to join NATO. He added that any peace agreement must secure the rights of Russian speakers in Ukraine. Asked about his view of Donald Trump, Lavrov described him as 'a very strong person, a person who wants results, who doesn’t like procrastination on anything.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-us-lavrov-carlson-ukraine-war-nuclear-d9bc9c0f7bf889e5babd33a57f4bd025	2024-12-05T23:41:15-08:00	
China's ban on key high-tech materials could have broad impact on industries, economy	BANGKOK (AP) — China has banned exports of key materials used to make a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, radar systems and CT scanners, swiping back at Washington after it expanded export controls to include dozens of Chinese companies that make equipment used to produce advanced computer chips. Both sides say their controls are justified by national security concerns and both accuse the other of 'weaponizing' trade. Analysts say the latest restrictions could have a wide impact on manufacturing in many industries and supply chains. 'Critical mineral security is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech trade war,' Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz of the Center for Strategic International Studies, wrote in a report on Beijing's decision. The full impact will depend partly on whether U.S. industries can compensate for any loss of access to the strategically important materials, equipment and components. Here’s why this could be a tipping point in trade conflict between the two biggest economies, coming at a time when antagonisms already were expected to heat up once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, given his vows to hike tariffs on imports of Chinese-made products. WHAT DID CHINA DO AND WHY? China has banned, in principle, exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and antimony — critical minerals needed to make advanced semiconductors, among many other types of equipment. Beijing also tightened controls on exports of graphite, which is used in EV and grid-storage batteries. China is the largest source for most of these materials and also dominates refining of those materials, which are used both for consumer goods and for military purposes. The limits announced Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. Next on the list of potential bans, experts say: tungsten, magnesium and aluminum alloys. WHAT DID THE US DO AND WHY? The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced its measures after the U.S. government ordered a slew of new measures meant to prevent sales to China of certain types of advanced semiconductors and the tools and software needed to make them. Washington also expanded its 'entity list' of companies facing strict export controls to include 140 more companies, nearly all of them based in China or Chinese-owned. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the revised rules were intended to impair China’s ability to use advanced technologies that 'pose a risk to our national security.' The updated regulations also limit exports to China of high-bandwidth memory chips that are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence. Export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with the 140 companies newly added to the 'entity list,' as well as the dozens of others already on the list. The aim, officials said, is to stop Chinese companies from leveraging U.S. technology to make their own semiconductors. The Biden administration has been expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls while encouraging an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. and other Western countries. Washington also extended the restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor technology to companies in other countries, though it excluded companies in key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands that are thought to have adequate export controls of their own. HOW IMPORTANT ARE THOSE MATERIALS? In a word: very. For the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other producers of advanced technology and components, access to materials with such properties as high conductivity is crucial: gallium and germanium increasingly are used in advanced semiconductors in place of silicon. The materials subject to Chinese export controls are among 50 the United States Geologic Survey has designated as 'critical minerals' — non-fuel minerals essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption. Gallium topped that list. It is needed to make the same high-bandwidth memory chips the U.S. wants to avoid allowing China to access for use in artificial intelligence and defense applications. It's used to make LEDs, lasers and magnets used in many products. Germanium is used for optical fiber and solar panels, among other uses. A USGS study recently estimated the likely total cost to the U.S. economy from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at more than $3 billion. But the situation is complicated. China imposed licensing requirements on exports of both metals in July 2023. It has not exported either to the U.S. this year, according to Chinese customs data. Antimony exports also have plunged. China produces the lion's share of most critical minerals, but there are alternatives. Japan also imports nearly all of its gallium, for example, but it also extracts it by recycling scrap metal. Washington has been moving to tap sources other than China, forming a 'Minerals Security Partnership' with the EU and 15 other countries. President Joe Biden's visit to Africa this week highlighted that effort. Potential supply disruptions also have spurred efforts to tap U.S. deposits of rare earths and other critical materials in southeastern Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, Minnesota and parts of the American Southwest. Germanium has been extracted from zinc mined in Alaska and Tennessee and the U.S. government has a stockpile. The Department of Defense has a recycling program that can extract scrap germanium from night vision lenses and tank turret windows. But China's dominance as a supplier gives it an overwhelming cost advantage, and U.S. resource companies face strong pressures over the potential environmental impact of mines and refineries. WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN NEXT? Since then-President Trump launched a trade war against Beijing that has ramped up over time, China has adopted a relatively constrained and cautious approach in responding to the U.S. limits on access to advanced technology. Much depends on the future course of overall relations. It is unclear if Trump will follow through on his vows to push tariffs sharply higher once he takes office or if such declarations are the opening gambits in future trade negotiations. China hit back with its own tariff hikes, but excluded many items crucial for its own economy. It sanctioned certain companies, especially defense contractors doing business with Taiwan, but refrained from outright bans on exports of vital materials to the U.S. This time may be different. Just after China's Commerce Ministry announced its export ban, various Chinese industry associations including automakers and the China Semiconductor Association issued statements denouncing Washington's moves to curb access to strategically sensitive technologies and declaring that U.S. computer chips are unreliable. Beijing's announcement also extends its ban on exporting Chinese-produced gallium and other critical minerals to the U.S. to apply to all countries, entities and individuals, saying violators will 'be held accountable according to law.'	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-gallium-critical-tech-ban-711fdfcb7c09e0e0e6374192fd2e24fa	2024-12-05T23:24:08-08:00	
American tenor Brian Jagde gets last-minute call to sing in La Scala's gala season premiere	MILAN (AP) — American tenor Brian Jagde was just wrapping up Verdi’s 'La Forza del Destino' in Barcelona last month when he got a last-minute offer to sing the same role in La Scala’s gala season premiere this Saturday, arguably the opera world’s most prestigious gig. Jagde’s appearance as Don Alvaro opposite soprano Anna Netrebko will mark his third performance at Milan’s storied Teatro alla Scala. He appeared twice as a substitute tenor opposite Netrebko, replacing Roberto Alagna in 'Turandot' this summer, and now he will replace Jonas Kaufmann in the coveted season opener. 'I’m happy to be their guy,’’ Jagde told The Associated Press in a phone interview. While it is not unheard of for Americans to sing on La Scala’s opening night, a highlight of the European cultural calendar, it remains a rarity in an opera house where Europeans tend to dominate. Beside Maria Callas last century, American Brian Hymel opened the 2016 season in 'Madame Butterfly' and Lisette Oropesa was cast in 'Lucia di Lammermoor' but sang in a gala concert to an empty theater when the 2020 season premiere was shuttered by the pandemic. In 2008, American tenor Stuart Neill was promoted from understudy to the 'Don Carlo' opening night cast after the headlining tenor made too many dress rehearsal mistakes. Neill received generous applause from the tough La Scala crowd. 'It's definitely one of the things that every artist dreams about,’’ Jagde said. 'I think it is about the artist and meeting the moment at the right time. I think that is more of what it's about than necessarily where they are from.' Jagde said singers are drawn to La Scala's 'rich tradition.' 'Every artist wants to not just perform there, but have great success there,' Jagde said. 'The public is known to be a very devoted fanship — and they can love you or they can hate you. You really want to be embraced by that audience specifically.' So far, the reviews from La Scala’s upper balconies of exacting opera fans have been positive on his previous two outings, Jagde said, adding that artists should accept all feedback. 'It’s our job as artists to embrace the fact that we are making people feel something. Whatever they feel is appropriate to them,' he said. Jagde, 45, grew up outside of New York City, and started singing in musicals in high schools and choirs in college, but never gave a thought to the opera. He started studying computer science and business upstate but then a classical music program at Purchase College closer to home grabbed his attention, thinking it might lead him to Broadway. 'I didn’t know at the time that classical voice meant opera,' he said laughing. He got accepted off the waiting list, and quickly fell in love with opera as the purest expression of the unadulterated voice. 'I remember being on stage and experiencing something I had never experienced on stage before, which was a completely acoustic, magical sound,' Jagde said. 'This was completely natural, hearing an orchestra underneath me, and my voice carrying over that. I remember committing full-heartedly (to opera) on stage at the moment.' His college teachers pegged him as a baritone, and he spent eight years doing auditions and artists programs in that range until he realized that 'I was still warming up to high Cs and still had no low notes.' Once he started auditioning as a tenor, the offers started rolling in. He made his principal role debut at the Metropolitan opera in 2021 in the role of Cavaradossi in 'Tosca,' and has sung on such renowned stages as the Paris Opera, the Vienna Staatsoper and Naples' Teatro di San Carlo. During the 2023/24 season, he warmed up his Don Alvaro at the Metropolitan Opera House and London's Royal Opera House. His La Scala debut last spring was as Turiddu in 'Cavalleria rusticana.' La Scala general manager Dominique Meyer said his only consideration in casting an opera is whether a singer 'is up to the role.' Jagde, he said, is among five or six tenors who could sing the Don Alvaro role, 'and he was available.' Jagde finished his Barcelona performances on Nov. 18, and showed up for rehearsals at La Scala the next day. Don Alvaro, he said, is a role, 'that has kind of grown with me, as I have grown as an artist.' Jagde said singing alongside an international opera star like Netrebko for the second time this year will help take some of the jitters out of the gala premiere. 'She is a wonderful colleague. She is a good person to work with, always available to you. She is nothing but smiles and fun,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/la-scala-jagde-season-premiere-a31b6d539097d696b6cb31e7998aafab	2024-12-05T22:36:14-08:00	
Ailing kids wait months for Israeli permission to leave Gaza for treatment. Some die in the meantime	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The 12-year-old Palestinian boy was lying in a hospital bed in central Gaza, wracked with leukemia, malnourished and whimpering in pain despite the morphine doctors were giving him, when Rosalia Bollen, a UNICEF official, said she saw him in late October. Islam al-Rayahen’s family had asked Israeli authorities six times over the past months for permission to evacuate him from Gaza for a desperately needed stem cell transplant, Bollen said. Six times, the request was refused for unexplained security reasons, she said. Islam died three days after she saw him, Bollen said. Thousands of patients in Gaza are waiting for Israeli permission for urgently needed medical evacuation from Gaza for treatment of war wounds or chronic diseases they can’t get after the destruction of much of the territory’s health care system by Israel’s 15-month military campaign. Among them are at least 2,500 children who UNICEF says must be transported immediately. 'They cannot afford to wait. These children will die. They’re dying in waiting and I find it striking that the world is letting that happen,' Bollen said. The Israeli military often takes months to respond to medical evacuation requests, and the number of evacuations has plunged in recent months. In some cases, the military rejects either the patient or, in the case of children, the caregivers accompanying them on vague security grounds or with no explanation. The Israeli decisions appear to be 'arbitrary and are not made on a criteria nor logic,' said Moeen Mahmood, the Jordan country director for Doctors Without Borders. COGAT, the Israeli military agency in charge of humanitarian affairs for Palestinians, said in a statement to The Associated Press that it 'makes every effort to approve the departure of children and their families for medical treatments, subject to a security check.' It did not respond when asked for details about Islam's case. A military official said Israel's internal intelligence service reviews whether the patient or their escort have what he called 'a connection to terrorism,' and if one is found they are refused. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential procedures. Osaid Shaheen, who is nearly 2, now faces having his eyes removed after Israel rejected his evacuation for treatment of cancer in his retinas. The toddler was diagnosed with the cancer in April, after his mother, Sondos Abu Libda, noticed his left eyelid was droopy. The World Health Organization requested his evacuation through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza, but the crossing was shut down in May when Israeli troops took it over in an offensive, Abu Libda said. WHO applied again, this time for Osaid to leave through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Israel, now the only route for evacuees to travel. During the long wait, the cancer spread to the child’s other eye and reached stage 4. In November, Abu Libda was told Osaid was rejected on security grounds with no further explanation. She was stunned, she said. 'I didn’t expect that a child could get a security rejection.' Doctors have given the boy three doses of chemotherapy. But with supplies short in Gaza, they’re struggling to get more. If they can’t, they will have to remove Osaid's eyes or the cancer will spread to other parts of his body, Abu Libda said. 'He’s just a child. How will he live his life without seeing? How will he play? How will he see his future and how will his life turn out?' Abu Libda asked, standing outside the house where her family is sheltering in the Beni Suheil district of southern Gaza. Nearby, little Osaid — who so far still has his sight — toddled around in the rubble of a building destroyed by Israeli forces, smiling as he played with chunks of rubble. When asked about his case, COGAT did not reply. WHO says 14,000 patients of all ages need medical evacuation from Gaza, the territory's Health Ministry puts the number higher, at 22,000, including 7,000 patients in extreme need who could die soon without treatment, according to Mohamed Abu Salmeya, a ministry official in charge of evacuation referrals. Since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, 5,230 patients have been evacuated, said Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson. Since May, when the Rafah crossing shut down, the rate has slowed down, with only 342 patients evacuated, she said, an average of less than two a day. Before the war, when Israeli permission was also necessary, around 100 patients a day were transferred out of Gaza, according to WHO. More than 44,500 Palestinians have been killed and more than 105,000 wounded by Israel’s bombardment and ground offensives, launched in retaliation for Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The casualty toll, by Gaza’s Health Ministry, does not distinguish combatants from civilians — but more than half are women and children. Gaza’s health system has been decimated, with only 17 of the territory’s original 36 hospitals functioning — and those only partially. They struggle with the waves of war wounded on top of patients with other conditions. Carrying out specialized surgeries or treatments in Gaza is difficult or impossible, with equipment destroyed, some specialist doctors killed or arrested and medical supplies limited. Gaza’s only dedicated cancer hospital was seized by Israeli troops early in the war, heavily damaged and has been shut down. Doctors without Borders said in August, it sought to evacuate 32 children along with their caregivers, but only six were allowed to leave. In November, it applied for eight others, including a 2-year-old with leg amputations, but Israeli authorities blocked evacuation, it said The military official said five of the eight requests in November were approved but the caregivers trying to travel with the children were rejected on security grounds. The official said Doctors Without Borders would have to resubmit the requests with alternate escorts. The official didn't say why the other three children weren't approved. The rejected caregivers were the children's mothers and grandmothers, said Mahmood, the Doctor's Without Borders official, who said no explanation was given for the security concern. Children long waiting for permission face dire consequences if they don’t get treatment. Nima al-Askari said doctors told her that 4-year-old Qusay could become paralyzed if her son doesn’t get surgery in the next two or three months for a heart defect that constricts his aorta. 'Should I wait until my son becomes paralyzed?' al-Askari said. 'Everyone is telling me to wait until he gets evacuated. ... This is my only son. I can’t see him in a wheelchair.' Asma Saed said she has been waiting for three months to hear whether her 2-year-old son, Al-Hassan, can travel for treatment for kidney failure. In the meantime, they are living in a squalid tent camp in Khan Younis, with little clean water or food. She said her son doesn’t sleep, screaming all night. 'I wish I could see him like any child in the world who can move, walk, and play,' she said. 'He’s a child, he can’t express his pain.' ___ Khaled reported from Cairo.

Iran says it conducted a successful space launch in a program long criticized by West	MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) — Iran said Friday it conducted a successful space launch, the latest for its program the West alleges improves Tehran’s ballistic missile program. Iran conducted the launch using its Simorgh program, a satellite-carrying rocket that had had a series of failed launches, at Iran's Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province. That's the site of Iran's civilian space program. The Simorgh carried what Iran described as an 'orbital propulsion system,' as well as two research systems to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) orbit above the Earth. The system could allow Iran to change the orbit of a spacecraft, something Tehran long has wanted to have geo-synchronized orbits for its satellites. Iran also put the payload of the Simorgh at 300 kilograms (660 pounds), heavier than its previous successful launches. There was no immediate independent confirmation the launch was successful. The U.S. military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The announcement comes as heightened tensions grip the wider Middle East over Israel’s continued war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon. The United States has previously said Iran’s satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran’s ballistic missile program expired in October 2023. 'Iran’s work on space-launch vehicles — including its Simorgh — probably would shorten the timeline to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, if it decided to develop one, because the systems use similar technologies,' a U.S. intelligence community report released in July said. Under Iran’s relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. The late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a protégé of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May. Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who has been signaling he wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions, has yet to offer strategy when it comes to Iran's ambitions in space. The Simorgh launch represented the first for his administration from the country's civil space program. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard conducted a successful launch in its parallel program in September. Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for 'several' nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003. ___ Associated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-space-launch-mideast-tensions-26b332d54d39173db8524b006848b6c8	2024-12-05T21:18:32-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian stocks are mixed after Wall Street falls ahead of key US jobs report	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks were mixed Friday after Wall Street retreated from record highs as investors awaited a U.S. jobs report due later in the day. U.S. futures were lower and oil prices were little changed. This week’s highlight for markets will be Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. government, which will show how many people employers hired and fired last month. A report on Thursday said the number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits rose last week but remains at historically healthy levels. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.8% to 39,091.17. The U.S. dollar rose to 150.14 Japanese yen from 150.10 yen. Chinese stocks rallied. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.6% to 19,873.90 and the Shanghai Composite index surged 1% to 3,402.80. Markets are watching for the outcome of an annual economic policy meeting scheduled for next week. Analysts said policymakers might lean toward caution as they brace for President-elect Donald Trump's moves on tariffs and trade. South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.6% to 2,428.16. On Friday, South Korea’s ruling party chief showed support for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law and then revoked that earlier this week. Yoon is facing calls to resign and be investigated and may be impeached. Thousands of protesters have marched in the streets and thousands of autoworkers and other members of the Korean Metal Workers’ Union, one of the country’s biggest umbrella labor groups, began partial strikes Thursday to protest against Yoon. The union said its members will begin indefinite strikes starting on Wednesday if Yoon does not leave office by then. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 lost 0.6% to 8,420.90. Bitcoin briefly burst above $103,000 on Thursday before pulling back after exceeding $100,000 for the first time following President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of financier Paul Atkins, who’s seen as a crypto advocate, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin was trading at 98,093.07 early Friday, according to CoinDesk. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.2% to 6,075.11 but it's still set to close out one of its best years of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% to 44,765.71, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% from its own record set the day before to close at 19,700.26. Solid consumer spending is a key reason the U.S. economy has avoided a recession that had seemed inevitable after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to crush inflation. But shoppers are now contending with still-high prices and a slowing job market. Expectations are high that the Fed will cut its main interest rate again when it meets before Christmas. The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September, hoping to offer more support for the job market. Also Thursday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.17% from 4.18% late Wednesday. In other dealings Friday, benchmark U.S. crude lost 14 cents to $68.16 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was down 18 cents at $72.03 a barrel. The euro inched down to $1.0570 from $1.05895 after French President Emmanuel Macron announced Thursday local time that he plans to stay in office until the end of his term and to name a new prime minister within days. This comes after far-right and left-wing lawmakers approved a no-confidence motion due to budget disputes, forcing Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet to resign.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-jobs-china-bitcoin-f066b9725ca1eaf8de1fa700555920e4	2024-12-05T20:15:40-08:00	
Notre Dame's reopening will begin with an archbishop's knock on the doors. Here's what comes next	PARIS (AP) — The reopening this weekend of Notre Dame is a succession of ceremonies to breathe life back into the iconic cathedral and celebrate the recovery from its devastating fire in 2019. High points will be the ritualized reopening of the cathedral's massive doors, the reawakening of its thunderous organ and the celebration of the first Mass. For both France and the Catholic Church, the televised and tightly scripted ceremonies will be an opportunity to display can-do resilience and global influence. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and dozens of heads of state and government accepted invites from French President Emmanuel Macron. The Catholic faithful are so eager to worship again inside Notre Dame that tickets for the first week of Masses were snapped up in 25 minutes, the cathedral's rector says. During part one of Notre Dame's rebirth on Saturday evening, Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will lead more than 1,500 guests through a reopening service. Part two, on Sunday, is an inaugural Mass, with special rites to consecrate the main altar. Open, great doors On Saturday, Ulrich will first reopen Notre Dame's great doors — by tapping them with his crosier, or bishop's staff. The staff was created for the occasion by designer Sylvain Dubuisson. The wood — bearing visible black traces from the blaze — was made with pieces of the cathedral roof that collapsed in the inferno, Dubuisson told The Associated Press. In response to the archbishop's door-knocks, the cathedral will erupt into song, its choirs once again filling the cavernous spaces. That back-and-forth will happen three times. The doors will then open so guests can stream inside past their sculptures of biblical figures. Reawakening the great organ The voice of Notre Dame's great organ hasn't been heard in public since the blaze coated the nearly 8,000 pipes with toxic dust released when the lead roofing burned. After the door-opening rites, Ulrich will reawaken the giant instrument. He'll address it directly with a series of eight incantations, starting with 'Awaken, organ, sacred instrument: Sing the praise of God.' That prompt will launch a conversation with the organ, with four organists (Olivier Latry, Vincent Dubois, Thibault Fajoles and Thierry Escaich) taking turns to play its responses. They'll be perched high above the congregation, seated at the newly renovated giant console that controls the instrument — through five keyboards of 56 notes each, foot pedals for 30 notes, and 115 stops. Off-the-cuff responses Latry says he and the other organists will improvise their responses to the archbishop's prompts — depending on their own and the congregation's mood. 'Since it's improvisation, you really need to feel the moment,' Latry told AP. 'When I am there, I will know what I am going to do. Before that, I simply have a few ideas but the ideas are not fully formed — because they will change depending on the atmosphere, the lighting, the people who'll be down below, their reaction.' The organ has a vast palette of sounds to play with. The deepest of its 7,952 pipes are as large as a human torso, producing a low rumbling sound. The smallest are no larger than a pen. The painstaking re-tuning of the organ — after it was dismantled, cleaned and put back together — took around six months, with tuners working at night so they could tweak the notes in silence. Billionaires and poor Parisians among the guests Before the fire, efforts to fund renovations of the nearly 900-year-old cathedral had been struggling. But that changed with the blaze. 'We had an outpouring of support,' says fund-raising committee member Michel Picaud. 'I received 400 donations an hour, so my smartphone completely crashed.' In all, 340,000 people from more than 150 countries donated 846 million euros (US$364 million), the public body in charge of Notre Dame's restauration says. The support testifies to global affection for the monument that transcends frontiers and faiths. 'It’s something which belongs to everybody,' Picaud told AP. The nonprofit he leads, Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, has raised $57 million from 50,000 international donors, most of them Americans. 'It’s not only a Parisian cathedral or monument,' he said. 'All over the world, I think, people have the feeling that this is part of their — I would say — heritage.' At the reopening, billionaire donors from France and beyond will rub shoulders with other guests far less fortunate. They'll include 'the poorest among Parisians, all those who are helped by charitable associations and who will be several hundred inside the cathedral,' Rev. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, Notre Dame's rector, told AP. Primped for the occasion Although construction work continues outside, the restored interiors look more magnificent than they have for generations. The limestone walls are creamy and luminous, cleaned of years of accumulated grime. Vaulted ceilings that collapsed have been repaired. The archbishop and other members have new garments, from a designer who has also dressed Beyoncé, Rihanna and others. The cathedral also has new furniture, including a new altar to replace one crushed when the flaming spire collapsed. The rector says 'no one alive has seen the cathedral' as it looks now. 'The blondness of the stone, the brilliance of the paintings, the light through the stained glass windows, all the artworks, all the paintings, that were cleaned, the statues that were restored,' he said. 'All of that did not exist before the fire.' ___ AP journalists Thomas Adamson and Alex Turnbull contributed to this report. ___ For more of AP’s coverage on Notre Dame, visit https://apnews.com/hub/notre-dame-cathedral	https://apnews.com/article/france-paris-notre-dame-trump-macron-religion-fire-e76aee3fdb9d391943e7955424d330cc	2024-12-05T20:09:01-08:00	
Russia's LGBTQ+ community is living in fear following new laws and court rulings, activists say	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Gela Gogishvili and Haoyang Xu led a happy life as a gay couple in Russia, even as President Vladimir Putin’s government took an increasingly anti-LGBTQ+ stance. Their social media posts and videos drew thousands of followers, and they were greeted by them sometimes on the streets in Kazan, in Russia's Tatarstan region, where Gogishvili was a pharmacist and Xu, from China, studied international relations at a university. But the online threats began after the Kremlin in December 2022 expanded its ban of 'propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations' from minors to adults, effectively outlawing any public endorsement of LGBTQ+ activities. Then came the complaints about them to authorities. They were detained in 2023 and accused of spreading 'LGBT propaganda' among minors. Gogishvili was given a hefty fine, while Xu was put in a detention center for migrants to await deportation. They eventually fled abroad separately. Now reunited in France, where they’re seeking asylum, they look with concern at Russia, where new, even harsher anti-LGBTQ+ measures have been adopted. Just over a year ago, Russia’s Supreme Court effectively outlawed any LGBTQ+ activism in a ruling that designated 'the international LGBT movement' as extremist. The move exposed anyone in the community or connected to it to criminal prosecution and prison, ushering in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. 'I’m scared for the queer community in Russia that remains in the country,' Gogishvili told The Associated Press. Linking LGBTQ+ rights to the war in Ukraine That community in Russia has been under legal and public pressure for over a decade but especially since the Kremlin sent troops to Ukraine in 2022. Putin has argued that the war is a proxy battle with the West, which he says aims to destroy Russia and its 'traditional family values' by pushing for LGBTQ+ rights. Putin insists Russia isn't discriminating against LGBTQ+ people, but he also decries 'perversions that lead to degradation and extinction.' Parliament Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin last year called gender transitioning 'pure satanism' and 'diabolical policy' that should stay in the U.S. Any public representation of gay and transgender people is banned. Gender-affirming medical care and changing one’s gender in official documents are prohibited. With the Supreme Court's ruling in November 2023, anyone involved with the LGBTQ+ community could be imprisoned for up to six years. As a result, many left the country. But others remain -– and find themselves in a community pushed into the shadows, marginalized even further and dogged by fear of repression. 'Six years, it's not a joke,' Olga Baranova, head of the Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives, said in an interview from outside Russia. ''What is worth me going to prison for six years?' Every person who's doing something right now (in LGBTQ+ activism in Russia) has to answer this question these days.' Targeting nightclubs, rainbow flags and gay tourism Just days after the Supreme Court ruling, the LGBTQ+ community was rattled by news of police raiding gay bars, nightclubs and venues that hosted drag shows in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities. Last spring, the first criminal case on charges of involvement with the 'LGBT movement' extremist group was lodged against the owner and the staff of a bar in the southwestern city of Orenburg that held drag performances. A handful of similar cases came elsewhere. Charges have been launched for displaying symbols such as a rainbow flag — even though many of those accused had nothing to do with the LGBTQ+ community, said human rights lawyer Max Olenichev. More raids of bars and nightclubs were reported in Moscow last month, almost exactly a year since the Supreme Court ruling. State media quoted law enforcement as saying they targeted those spreading 'LGBT propaganda.' One man arrested for allegedly running a travel agency for gay customers faces charges of organizing activities of an extremist organization. Independent news outlet Mediazona reported that Andrei Kotov rejected the charges and said in court that law enforcement officers beat him and administered electric shocks during the arrest, even though he didn’t resist. On Nov. 23, Putin signed into law a bill banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender-affirming care is legal. He also approved legislation outlawing the spread of material that encourages people not to have children. 'All this, in general, speaks more about the desire of the authorities to create some kind of atmosphere of fear. It's not repressions, it's terror,' said Vladimir, an LGBTQ+ rights advocate in Russia who like many interviewed by AP asked to be identified only by a first name out of security concerns. Ikar, a fellow activist and transgender man, described the actions by authorities as 'an attempt to intimidate ... to make people lose their social connections, stay silent, stay home.' Going underground, online or abroad Vladimir and Ikar belong to an underground LGBTQ+ rights group that offers legal aid and holds offline events without fanfare. Activists thoroughly verify identities of anyone seeking its help. The group is seeing a growing number of cases related to violence against LGBTQ+ people, Vladimir said. Some regional organizations have shut down completely; others operate openly, but in a drastically different way. The Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives moved its community-building efforts into a sprawling online network of chats and Zoom meeting rooms, according to Baranova. 'Our strategy today is to preserve the community in some form and size at least, for the people to just know each other, support each other,' she said. Center T, a prominent trans rights group, closed its Moscow shelter after visits from police and opened one in Yerevan, Armenia, said group leader Yan Dvorkin. Center T helps emigres as well as those still in Russia to find doctors and medical care, trying to resolve crises and still be a part of a community, if only online. Anna, a 25-year-old transgender woman in Moscow, said being part of the community provided the courage to transition. 'I can’t imagine what it’s like for new people, who are only opening up the possibility for themselves,' she said. Anna transitioned and came out to her family and friends last year, after the ban on gender-affirming care was enacted. The ban and other repressive laws and rulings hit the already-vulnerable transgender community hard, Dvorkin said. Finding a job has become more difficult, both for those who haven’t changed their gender marker in documents and those who have, he said. Access to gender-affirming medical care is a major issue, with doctors wary of working with transgender people and with many turning to shoddy underground medications. Violence against transgender people has spiked, as has harassment and discrimination, Dvorkin said. 'Nowadays, you can intimidate people — blackmail them — by (saying) that ‘I will report you and you will go to prison for extremism,’' the activist said. Those who stay in Russia, despite the risks Anna considers herself lucky and 'privileged.' She has a well-paying job, can afford a doctor advising her from abroad on hormonal therapy, and can get the medicine in Moscow. She wouldn't elaborate on how and where she gets it, so authorities 'don’t pull the plug.' But she said she hasn’t come out to her colleagues for fear of losing her job, and she is sometimes harassed on the street because of her appearance. Her identity documents can't be changed under the ban. She says she has a support network of friends and doesn’t want to leave Russia, even though she’s acutely aware of the risks. 'I somehow have managed to adapt,' she said. 'I know how to live here.' Yulia, another transgender woman, also vowed to stay, describing it as sort of a mission to show that 'people like me are not necessarily weak, are not necessarily useless.' In her mid-40s, Yulia has a family and children, a successful career in a male-dominated industry, and the respect and acceptance from her colleagues and friends. For her, 'it’s about normalizing' being trans, she said. How much 'normalizing' is possible in the current climate and the years ahead is still an open question. The ban on 'propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations' forces print, TV and movie censorship of LGBTQ+ relations. In a recent example, two Russian streaming services cut a transgender character from the 1990 drama series 'Twin Peaks.' At the same time, there is abundant official rhetoric from politicians, the Russian Orthodox clergy and media figures condemning LGBTQ+ people. Many like Gela Gogishvili, the gay man who fled Russia last year, worry about the next generation of LGBTQ+ people. He said he's 'even more scared for those who are born there and are currently growing up -– from their childhood years onwards, they will be taught that (being queer) is bad.' 'Like it was with me,' Gogishvili adds. 'I couldn’t accept myself until I was 20 years old.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-lgbtq-crackdown-putin-moscow-aef5650c6fdadbe1ac13e0d0b9f93f3b	2024-12-05T20:04:06-08:00	
Belarus seeks to copy neighboring Russia’s repressive LGBTQ+ policies, activists say	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — As police raided the home of a gay couple in the Belarusian capital of Minsk and brutally beat them, the officers didn't hide that the crackdown was aligned to similar moves in neighboring Russia. The students, Andrei and Sasha, said security forces demanded that they unlock their smartphones and surrender the names of 'gays in Minsk and Moscow.' 'They slammed our heads against the door frame, threatened to report us to the university and said that this was just the beginning,' said Andrei, 20, who like other gay and transgender Belarusians interviewed by The Associated Press insisted on being identified only by his first name because of safety concerns. 'They wanted to expose an ‘underground network’ of gay people in Belarus, following the example of Russia,' he said of the autumn raid. 'They openly told us that if it is banned in Russia, then it should be banned in Belarus too.' Belarus decriminalized homosexuality in 1994 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but the deeply conservative country under authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko doesn’t recognize same-sex marriages, and there are no laws protecting LGBTQ+ rights. Russian President Vladimir Putin adopted repressive laws curtailing LGBTQ+ rights in recent years, and close ally Belarus is poised to follow suit, proposing legislation to ban 'gay propaganda.' While still to be defined in Belarus, the Russian version bans any endorsement of LGBTQ+ activities and nontraditional sexual relations. But even before the measure is drafted, life has gotten worse for the LGBTQ+ community in Belarus, rights advocates say. They say 32 people were detained and beaten in seven cities in the last three months, including 10 transgender or nonbinary individuals and activists. Some were released after questioning, fined and allowed to emigrate, they say, while several remain in custody, facing charges of 'disseminating pornography' and up to four years in prison. More people probably have been detained but might be afraid to contact advocates, according to LGBTQ+ rights group TG House Belarus. Lukashenko 'uses repressions against the LGBTQ+ community in order to gain some kind of praise from Russian authorities and shore up support among conservative residents of Belarus,' said the group's coordinator, Alisa Sarmant. 'To a large extent, it’s a carbon copy of what is happening in Russia, but in Belarus all these discriminatory practices take on uglier and harsher forms,' Sarmant said. Moscow has close ties with Minsk, using Belarusian territory as a springboard for the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Last year, the Russian Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism, designating 'the international LGBT movement' as an extremist group. 'We will also need to take similar measures,' said Natalya Kochanova, Lukashenko’s closest adviser and speaker of the upper chamber of parliament. 'We have family values, traditions we pass from generation to generation -– traditions of family, Orthodox Christianity,' she said, echoing the Kremlin line. After Russia banned gender transitioning last year, transgender individuals in Belarus began having problems, even though the procedures are not forbidden. According to Sarmant, the government this year rejected over 80% of those seeking official authorization for gender-affirming procedures and changing their gender marker in official documents. By comparison, 10%-15% were rejected in 2020, she said. Among other issues, she lists 'catastrophic shortages' of hormonal treatments, humiliating medical procedures and prosecutions on political grounds. LGBTQ+ activists participated in mass protests that engulfed Belarus in 2020 after Lukashenko won a sixth term in an election the opposition and the West criticized as rigged. Authorities responded with a brutal crackdown, arresting about 65,000 people over the next four years. There are about 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski. Many imprisoned opposition leaders and activists have spent more than a year in complete isolation, without medical assistance. As the crackdown widens, LGBTQ+ people are leaving Belarus, seeking asylum abroad. Tania, a 39-year-old transgender woman, told AP she was arrested twice for following opposition sites that were outlawed as extremist and for supporting Ukraine, adding that she was beaten and subjected to electric shocks in custody. She eventually fled the country. During the final raid of her apartment, security forces broke her tooth and two ribs, jailed her for 12 days and ordered her to repent on camera, she said. 'Abuse behind bars continued day and night,' she said. 'I was humiliated. They tried to shove the taser into my rectum or put it against my genitals. ... In a country where terror reigns, you either agree with the government's line, or have little chance of surviving without access to hormonal treatment.' Marat, a 37-year-old transgender man, told AP that authorities demanded last year that he detransition and change his documents to restore the gender marker he was assigned at birth. By that time, he said he had 'pumped-up muscles and had grown a beard.' 'I couldn't believe that the doctors are demanding to bring everything back to the way it was and this absurdity is happening in the 21st century,' he said, adding that he tried to contest it but eventually fled to France with his four children. Lukashenko, who has run Belarus with an iron first for three decades, has publicly mocked homosexuals. After Germany's openly gay foreign minister in 2012 called him 'the last dictator in Europe,' Lukashenko replied, 'Better to be a dictator than gay.' All independent LGBTQ+ groups have been shut down in Belarus, security forces regularly raid Minsk nightclubs where underground parties are held, and advocates say the KGB blackmails members of the community into cooperating. 'Intimidation, arrests and blackmail have been used in Belarus for years to create a so-called ‘LGBTQ+ database’ and declare an entire social group dangerous,' said Pavel Sapelka of the Viasna Center, the country’s most prominent rights group. In April, the Culture Ministry expanded its definition of pornography to include 'nontraditional relations,' meaning anyone possessing such material can face criminal prosecution and up to four years in prison. 'Belarus must abolish these outrageous amendments and stop the cynical persecution of LGBTQ+ people,' said Anastasiia Kruope, assistant researcher for Europe and Central Asia with Human Rights Watch. Rights advocates say LGBTQ+ people in Belarus continue to face stigmatization in society, noting a high suicide rate in the community. 'The state’s policy has a particularly strong impact on young LGBT+ people, who have been living for four years in the conditions of an artificially created ‘sterile’ space, a Russian agenda and the constant broadcast of hate speech,' according to a report last month by the rights group Justice Initiative. The legislation being prepared ahead of next month's presidential election seeks to punish anyone promoting 'nontraditional sexual relations, gender change (or) pedophilia.' TG House Belarus began a petition drive against the legislation, collecting 33,000 signatures. Sarmant suggests the recent raids were 'revenge for this campaign in order for everyone to hide, get scared, and — best of all -– keep silent.' Andrei and Sasha, whose home was raided, said if the bill becomes law, they would leave Minsk rather than 'wait for a prison term.'	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-lgbtq-crackdown-russia-putin-lukashenko-a46db4f815ff563a49a09b96ab408630	2024-12-05T19:30:20-08:00	
Trump names former Sen. David Perdue of Georgia to be ambassador to China	WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday he has selected former Sen. David Perdue of Georgia to serve as his ambassador to China, leaning on a former business executive turned politician to serve as the administration's envoy to America's most potent economic and military adversary. Trump said in a social media post that Perdue 'brings valuable expertise to help build our relationship with China.' Perdue lost his Senate seat to Democrat Jon Ossoff four years ago and ran unsuccessfully in a 2022 primary against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Perdue pushed Trump’s debunked lies about electoral fraud during his failed bid for Georgia governor. During his time in the Senate, Perdue was labeled as 'anti-China' in a 2019 Chinese think tank report. The former Georgia lawmaker advocated that the U.S. needed to build a more robust naval force to cope with threats, including from China. Before launching his political career, Perdue held a string of top executive positions, including at Sara Lee, Reebok and Dollar General. Economic tensions will be a big part of the U.S.-China picture for the new administration. Trump has threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The Chinese Embassy in Washington cautioned earlier this week that there will be losers on all sides if there is a trade war. 'China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature,' embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu posted on X. 'No one will win a trade war or a #tariff war.' He added that China had taken steps in the last year to help stem drug trafficking. The embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening about Perdue's nomination. It is unclear whether Trump will actually go through with the threats or if he is using them as a negotiating tactic. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent U.S. Census data. Perdue, if confirmed, will have to negotiate a difficult set of issues that goes beyond trade. Washington and Beijing have long had deep differences on the support China has given to Russia during its war in Ukraine, human rights issues, technology and Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a meeting with outgoing President Joe Biden last month that Beijing stood 'ready to work with a new U.S. administration.' But Xi also warned that a stable China-U.S. relationship was critical not only to the two nations but to the 'future and destiny of humanity.' 'Make the wise choice,' Xi cautioned during his November meeting with Biden on the sidelines of an international summit in Peru. 'Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other.' Trump’s relationship with Xi started out well during his first term before becoming strained over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump seems particularly focused on using tariffs as a pressure point on Xi, even threatening he would use tariffs as a cudgel to pressure Beijing to crack down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl in Mexico that is illegally sold in the United States. A second Trump administration is expected to test U.S.-China relations even more than the Republican’s first term, when the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion in Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020, the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A couple years later, a research group showed that China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised. Ahead of Trump's return to power, many American companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year. Trump also filled out more of his immigration team Thursday, as he promises mass deportations and border crackdowns. He said he’s nominating former Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott to head U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Scott, a career official, was appointed head of the border agency in January 2020 and enthusiastically embraced then-President Trump’s policies, particularly on building a U.S.-Mexico border wall. He was forced out by the Biden administration. Trump also said he’d nominate Caleb Vitello as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that, among other things, arrests migrants in the U.S. illegally. Vitello is a career ICE official with more than 23 years in the agency and most recently has been the assistant director for the office of firearms and tactical programs. The president-elect named the head of the Border Patrol Union, Brandon Judd, as ambassador to Chile. Judd has been a longtime supporter of Trump’s, appearing with him during his visits to the U.S.-Mexico border, though he notably supported a Senate immigration bill championed by Biden that Trump sank in part because he didn’t want to give Democrats an election-year win on the issue. — AP writer Didi Tang contributed reporting.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-transition-administration-c481302fb42d7b6fc9d90dda23b45258	2024-12-05T17:57:22-08:00

Australian leader blames antisemitism for arson that extensively damaged a Melbourne synagogue	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Arsonists extensively damaged a Melbourne synagogue on Friday in what Australia’s prime minister condemned as an antisemitic attack on Australian values. The blaze in the Adass Israel Synagogue is an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and Hamas last year. Cars and buildings have been vandalized and torched around Australia in protests inspired by the war. A witness who had come to the synagogue to pray saw two masked men spreading a liquid accelerant with brooms inside the building at 4:10 a.m., officials said. About 60 firefighters with 17 fire trucks responded to the blaze, which police said caused extensive damage. Investigators have yet to identify a motive, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese blamed antisemitism. 'This was a shocking incident to be unequivocally condemned. There is no place in Australia for an outrage such as this,' Albanese told reporters. 'To attack a place of worship is an attack on Australian values. To attack a synagogue is an act of antisemitism, is attacking the right that all Australians should have to practice their faith in peace and security,' he added. Israel’s Ambassador to Australia Amir Maimon noted that dozens of pro-Palestinian activists staged a three-hour protest outside The Great Synagogue in downtown Sydney on Wednesday, demanding sanctions against Israel. Worshippers were prevented from leaving the synagogue during the demonstration. 'We are talking about the values you expect Australians to follow, not my own values. And for me it’s clear that everyone should have the right to worship his own religion, own beliefs, as long as they also respect others,' Maimon said. A religious leader at the torched mosque, Rabbi Gabi Kaltmann, described the arsonists as 'thugs.' 'Tonight is the Sabbath. We must all go and find a sense of calmness, comradery and community by gathering for the Sabbath tonight and praying together as one community,' Klatmann told reporters outside the synagogue. Federal law in January banned the Nazi salute and the public display of Nazi symbols in response to growing antisemitism. The government appointed special envoys this year to combat antisemitism and Islamophobia in the community. The Jewish envoy, Jillian Segal, a Sydney lawyer and business executive, said the Jewish community in Australia was 'feeling ever more rattled by what is going on.' 'I'm very concerned. Here is one major escalation in terms of burning synagogues which has resonance as to what happened during the Holocaust,' Segal said. Victoria state Premier Jacinta Allan noted in a statement that the synagogue was 'built by Holocaust survivors.' Many of the synagogue's original worshippers were post-World War II immigrants from Hungary. Allan offered 100,000 Australian dollars ($64,300) to help repair the synagogue and said there would be an increased police presence in the area. 'Every available resource will be deployed to find these criminals who tried to tear a community apart,' Allan said. 'We stand against antisemitism now and forever,' she added. Daniel Aghion, president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said the broader Australian community needed to condemn the arson attack. 'I've been getting phone calls this morning from the Hindu community, from other people, from good people who are prepared to stand up and that's my message for this morning to Australia, to the good people of Australia,' Aghion told reporters. 'Don't leave the Jewish people behind. Don't isolate us. Don't leave us exposed to the risk of attacks upon our religious institutions, our communal institutions. Stand with us. Stand against this hate. And stand against this kind of horrendous attack which should not occur on Australian soil,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-arsonists-melbourne-synagogue-antisemitism-d6452045beaac39bd11a97a8fe851d37	2024-12-05T16:35:50-08:00	
South Korea's governing party head supports suspending Yoon's powers, making impeachment more likely	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s governing party chief expressed support Friday for suspending the constitutional powers of President Yoon Suk Yeol for imposing martial law this week, in a bombshell reversal that makes Yoon’s impeachment more likely. Opposition parties are pushing for a parliamentary vote on Yoon’s impeachment on Saturday, calling his short-lived martial law declaration an 'unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or coup.' But they need support from some members of the president’s People Power Party to get the two-thirds majority required to pass the impeachment motion. The turmoil resulting from Yoon’s nighttime martial law decree has frozen South Korean politics and caused worry among neighbors, including fellow democracy Japan, and Seoul’s top ally, the United States, as one of the strongest democracies in Asia faces a political crisis that could unseat its leader. During a party meeting, PPP leader Han Dong-hun stressed the need to suspend Yoon’s presidential duties and power swiftly, saying he poses a 'significant risk of extreme actions, like reattempting to impose martial law, which could potentially put the Republic of Korea and its citizens in great danger.' Han said he had received intelligence that Yoon had ordered the country’s defense counterintelligence commander to arrest and detain unspecified key politicians based on accusations of 'anti-state activities' during the brief period martial law was in force. 'It’s my judgment that an immediate suspension of President Yoon Suk Yeol’s official duties is necessary to protect the Republic of Korea and its people,' Han said. In a closed-door briefing to lawmakers, Hong Jang-won, first deputy director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, said Yoon called him on the phone after imposing martial law and read out a long list of politicians he wanted detained. They included Han, opposition leader Lee Jae-myung and National Assembly speaker Woo Won Shik, said Kim Byung-kee, one of the lawmakers who attended the meeting. Kim said Hong told lawmakers he ignored Yoon’s orders. Speaking to reporters at the National Assembly, the spy agency’s director, Cho Taeyong, questioned Hong’s account. Cho said such an order would have come to him, rather than Hong, and that he never received any orders from Yoon to detain politicians. Han earlier said he would work to defeat the impeachment motion even though he criticized Yoon’s martial law declaration as 'unconstitutional.' Han said there was a need to 'prevent damage to citizens and supporters caused by unprepared chaos.' Thousands of protesters have marched in the streets Seoul since Wednesday, calling for Yoon to resign and be investigated. Thousands of autoworkers and other members of the Korean Metal Workers’ Union, one of the country’s biggest umbrella labor groups, have started hourly strikes since Thursday to protest Yoon. The union said its members will start on indefinite strikes beginning on Dec. 11 if Yoon was still in office then. Impeaching Yoon would require support from 200 of the National Assembly’s 300 members. The opposition parties who jointly brought the impeachment motion have 192 seats combined. PPP has 108 lawmakers. In a televised statement, South Korean Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho promised the ministry’s 'active cooperation' with an investigation by prosecutors into the military’s role in Yoon’s martial law enforcement. He said military prosecutors will also be involved in the probe. He denied media speculation that Yoon and his military confidantes might consider imposing martial law a second time. 'Even if there’s a demand to enforce martial law, the Ministry of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff will absolutely not accept it,' Kim said. Kim became the acting defense minister after Yoon’s office on Thursday accepted the resignation of Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who has been hit with a travel ban and faces an investigation over his role in Yoon’s imposition of martial law. Opposition parties and Han allege that it was Kim Yong Hyun who recommended that Yoon take the step. During a parliamentary hearing on Thursday, Kim Seon Ho said Kim Yong Hyun also ordered troops to be deployed to the National Assembly after Yoon imposed martial law. Han was previously regarded as a close associate of Yoon as they spent years working together as prosecutors and he served as Yoon’s first justice minister. But after Han entered party politics and became PPP leader, their ties soured badly as they differed over how to handle scandals involving Yoon and his wife. Han leads a minority faction within the ruling party, and 18 lawmakers in his faction voted with opposition lawmakers to overturn Yoon’s martial law decree. Martial law ultimately lasted about six hours, after the quick overrule by the National Assembly forced Yoon’s Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Wednesday. If Yoon is impeached, he would be suspended until the Constitutional Court rules on whether to remove him from office or restore his presidential power. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s No. 2 official, would take over presidential responsibilities. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung said in a televised speech Friday that it was crucial to suspend Yoon as 'quickly as possible.' Lee said Yoon’s martial law enforcement amounted to 'rebellion and also a self-coup.' He said Yoon’s move caused serious damage to the country’s image and paralyzed foreign policy, pointing to criticism from the Biden administration and foreign leaders canceling their visits to South Korea. Yoon has made no immediate response to Han’s comments. He hasn’t made public appearances since he made a televised announcement that his martial law decree was lifted. Prosecutor General Shim Woo Jung told reporters Friday that the prosecution plans to investigate rebellion charges against Yoon following complaints filed by the opposition. While the president mostly enjoys immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. It wasn’t immediately clear how the prosecution plans to proceed with an investigation on Yoon. Democratic Party spokesperson Jo Seoung-lae said Friday the party is considering filing a legal complaint against PPP floor leader Choo Kyung-ho, whom they accuse of attempting to facilitate Yoon’s martial law enforcement. Choo, a Yoon loyalist, had asked party lawmakers to convene at the party’s headquarters rather than the National Assembly after martial law began. That meant fewer lawmakers were present for parliament’s crucial vote on lifting martial law. The Biden administration, which has worked closely with Yoon’s government while strengthening trilateral security cooperation with Japan to counter North Korean threats and regional instability, has expressed deep concern about Yoon’s actions. In a telephone conversation with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken welcomed the lifting of martial law following the parliamentary vote and conveyed his confidence in South Korea’s democratic resilience, the State Department said. A U.S. defense official said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has canceled a planned visit to South Korea, determining that it would not be an appropriate time. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss travel planning not usually made public, said the Pentagon consulted with Austin’s counterparts in South Korea about the decision. Austin is leaving for California on Friday to speak at the Reagan National Defense Forum, and will then travel on to Japan. ___ Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Canada expands list of firearms outlawed and proposes to donate guns to Ukraine	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Canada said Thursday it is outlawing another 324 firearm varieties — guns the public safety minister said belong on the battlefield, not in the hands of hunters or sport shooters. Ottawa also said it is working with the government of Ukraine to see how the guns can be donated to support the fight against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The move follows the May 2020 ban of 1,500 makes and models of firearms, a number that grew to more than 2,000 by November of this year as new variants were identified. The latest restriction, announced Thursday by Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, follows expressions of concern from gun-control advocates that many assault-style firearms were not included in the 2020 ban. 'This means these firearms can no longer be used,' LeBlanc said. Defense Minister Bill Blair said Canada approached Ukrainian authorities, who expressed interest in some of the guns. 'Every bit of assistance we can offer to the Ukrainians is one step toward their victory,' Blair said. The federal government says it is working with provinces, territories and police on a planned buyback of prohibited weapons from individual owners. Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada, but the newly announced measures come on the eve of the 35th anniversary of the École Polytechnique in Montreal, where a gunman killed 14 women before killing himself. The Ruger Mini-14 used by the gunman, Marc Lepine, was among the weapons included in the 2020 ban. Nathalie Provost, a survivor who was wounded in the attack, said Thursday she was targeted for being a woman studying engineering. 'These are just killing weapons, war weapons, military weapons, so I'm proud we are doing something,' Provost said. Canada has had far fewer mass shootings than the U.S. in part because of a lack of easy access to guns, though the U.S. population also is far larger than Canada’s.

Dwarfed by China in shipbuilding, US looks to build its defense base to fend off war	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. severely lags behind China in shipbuilding capacity, lawmakers and experts have warned, as the Biden administration tries to build up the country's ability to develop and produce weapons and other defense supplies to fend off war. Speaking at a congressional hearing Thursday, Rep. John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said the country lacks the capacity to 'deter and win a fight' with China and called for action. 'Bold policy changes and significant resources are now needed to restore deterrence and prevent a fight' with China, Moolenaar said. China’s navy is already the world’s largest, and its shipbuilding capacity, estimated to be 230 times larger, dwarfs that of the U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democratic member of the committee, told Fox News last week that 'for every one oceangoing vessel that we can produce, China can produce 359 in one single year.' The U.S. government has come to see China as its 'pacing challenge,' and officials have warned that Beijing is pursuing the largest peacetime military buildup in history, raising concerns about how the U.S. would respond and ensure victory in case of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific, where tensions are high in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Krishnamoorthi on Thursday warned that a weak military industrial base could invite aggression and argued that strengthening it is necessary to avoid war with China. 'History tells us we need a healthy defense industrial base now to deter aggression and make sure the world’s dictators think again before dragging the U.S. and the world into yet another disastrous conflict,' Krishnamoorthi said. National security adviser Jake Sullivan called it a 'generational project' to fix the problem after the American shipbuilding industry had its 'bottom fell out' in the early 1980s. 'Part of it is we don't have the backbone of a healthy commercial shipbuilding base to rest our naval shipbuilding on top of,' Sullivan said Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum in Washington. 'And that's part of the fragility of what we're contending with and why this is going to be such a generational project to fix.' The challenge in shipbuilding has been 'especially immense,' stemming from the hollowing-out of the U.S. manufacturing base where its workforce shrank and suppliers left, Sullivan said. And it is part of the broader problem of a weakened U.S. military industrial base, as manifested in the weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, Sullivan said, when Kyiv in eight weeks 'burned through a year's worth of U.S. 155-millimeter artillery production.' 'Decades of underinvestments and consolidation had seriously eroded our defense industrial base, and there was no way around it,' Sullivan said. The head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Samuel Paparo, warned last month that the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East were eating away at critical U.S. weapons stockpiles and could hamper the military’s ability to respond to China should a conflict arise. He said providing or selling billions of dollars worth of air defenses to both Ukraine and Israel were hampering U.S. ability to respond to threats in the Indo-Pacific. 'It’s now eating into stocks, and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he told an audience at the Brookings Institution in Washington on Nov . 19. Several researchers at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said China’s rapid military buildup could allow the country to prevail over the U.S., especially in case of a prolonged conflict. 'China’s massive shipbuilding industry would provide a strategic advantage in a war that stretches beyond a few weeks, allowing it to repair damaged vessels or construct replacements much faster than the United States,' the researchers wrote in June. On Thursday, the congressional panel heard suggestions from experts who said it would take time to rebuild the defense industrial base, but for quicker fixes, the U.S. could innovate to make low-cost and autonomous systems and tap resources of its allies. 'We need to look at co-production of whether it's munitions in Australia or shipbuilding in Korea,' said William Greenwalt, a non-resident senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank American Enterprise Institute. 'We need to get numbers as fast as we can,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-shipbuilding-us-defense-base-2a24238bdbf255bac821145d7b299d8d	2024-12-05T13:57:36-08:00	
Stowaway who boarded New York-to-Paris flight claims she sought asylum in France	NEW YORK (AP) — A Russian woman with permanent U.S. residency who was returned to the United States after authorities said she snuck on board a flight from New York to Paris made her first appearance in court Thursday, claiming she has been abused. Svetlana Dali, wearing jeans, seemed agitated as she spoke through a Russian interpreter to her attorney during a brief appearance before a Brooklyn magistrate judge. Her lawyer, Michael Schneider, said she claims she was poisoned after arriving in Paris and then was returned to the United States despite requesting asylum there. She also claimed through Schneider that her treatment at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn amounted to torture after she was placed in a 'very cold' room where she felt sick and eventually lost consciousness. 'She believes if she's staying at the MDC, her life will be in danger,' Schneider said. When he told Magistrate Judge Robert M. Levy that she was requesting a spectrometer be used to test her blood and determine if she had been poisoned, the judge responded that he's 'not sure' the device was in the jail's commissary. She will be housed in the federal lockup a second night after lawyers agreed to postpone a bail hearing until Friday so enough information could be gathered to create a bail package. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Theodora said the government's chief concern was that Dali was a risk of flight. She did not protest when Schneider said the single federal stowaway charge she faced was a 'minor charge' comparable to being arrested for jumping a turnstyle to enter the city's subway system. A criminal complaint filed in Brooklyn federal court said Dali admitted to an FBI agent who interviewed her when she returned to Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday that she flew to Paris as a stowaway on a Delta Air Lines flight on Nov. 26. The complaint said airport surveillance footage showed that she was initially rebuffed by a Transportation Security Administration official because she lacked a boarding pass when she first tried to enter Kennedy's Terminal 4. Five minutes later, she successfully accessed the security screening machines without a boarding pass by entering a special lane for airline employees at the same time that a large Air Europa flight crew walked through, the complaint said. It said she got onto the Delta flight without presenting a boarding pass as airline agents who were helping other ticketed passengers board failed to stop her or ask her to present a boarding pass. Once on the flight but before it landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport, Delta employees realized she was not authorized to be on the plane and asked for her boarding pass, which she could not provide, the complaint said. When the plane landed in Paris early on Nov. 27, French law enforcement met her at the gate and detained her before she entered customs, it said. During her interview with U.S. law enforcement, Dali was shown images from airport security showing her bypassing TSA officials and Delta employees. The complaint said she confirmed the images were of her and 'also stated that she knew her conduct was illegal.' In a statement, Delta Air Lines thanked French and U.S. authorities for their assistance and said a review had concluded that its security infrastructure was 'sound and that deviation from standard procedures is the root cause of this event.' It added: 'We are thoroughly addressing this matter and will continue to work closely with our regulators, law enforcement and other relevant stakeholders. Nothing is of greater importance than safety and security.'	https://apnews.com/article/paris-stowaway-svetlana-dali-acbec8eff4a215cc29e93e642ef51767	2024-12-05T13:54:50-08:00	
El Salvador's president is triumphant after his bet on bitcoin comes true	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — As bitcoin reached historic highs, surpassing $100,000 for the first tim e, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele was triumphant on Thursday about his big bet on the cryptocurrency. The adoption of bitcoin — which has been legal tender in the Central American nation since 2021 — never quite matched the president’s enthusiasm, but the value of the government’s reported investment now stands at more than $600 million. Bitcoin has rallied mightily since Donald Trump’s election victory last month, exceeding the $100,000 mark on Wednesday night, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Just two years ago, bitcoin’s volatile value fell below $17,000. Bitcoin fell back below the $100,000 by Thursday afternoon, sitting just above $99,000 by 3 p.m. E.T. Bukele on Thursday blamed his beleaguered political opposition for causing many Salvadorans to miss out on the bonanza. There were street protests when the Congress made bitcoin legal tender in June 2021, though that move was not the only motivation for the protesters. The tiny Central American country has long used the dollar as currency, but Bukele promised bitcoin would provide new opportunities for El Salvador’s unbanked and cut out money transfer services from the remittances Salvadorans abroad send home. The government offered $30 in bitcoin to those who signed up for digital wallets. Many did so, but quickly cashed out the cryptocurrency. 'It’s important to emphasize that not only did the opposition err resoundingly with bitcoin, but rather, differently from other issues (where they have also been wrong), this time their opposition affected many,' Bukele wrote on Facebook. Bukele drew an 'impressive' comment from Elon Musk on the social media platform X Thursday. El Salvador’s former Central Bank President Carlos Acevedo pointed out on Thursday that while there has been a gain, it remains an unrealized one until the government’s bitcoin is sold. That said, he credited Bukele’s administration with doing well on the bitcoin move, especially in light of Trump’s election. Acevedo said 'the markets’ optimism that a Trump administration will be friendly with the markets and particularly with bitcoin' explained its sustained rally over the past month. But the cryptocurrency’s volatility was a persistent risk, he said. 'The average Salvadoran doesn’t use bitcoin, but obviously there are Salvadorans with economic resources who even before had already invested in bitcoin, but it is a small group,' Acevedo said. Esteban Escamilla, a worker in a clothing store in Santa Tecla, outside the capital San Salvador, said he had cashed out the original $30 of bitcoin offered in 2021. 'I don’t use bitcoin because I don’t have (money) to invest and speculate with, but I know it has gone up a lot,' he said, recognizing that he would have more money now if he had kept it in bitcoin. Josefa Torres, 45, said as she was doing her grocery shopping that she didn’t have any bitcoin either. 'I took out the money and used it for household expenses,' she said. At the conclusion of meetings between the International Monetary Fund and El Salvador’s government in August, the IMF issued a statement that mentioned the country’s bitcoin holdings. 'While many of the risks have not yet materialized, there is joint recognition that further efforts are needed to enhance transparency and mitigate potential fiscal and financial stability risks from the Bitcoin project,' the IMf said.	https://apnews.com/article/bitcoin-elsalvador-bukele-musk-trump-5be81d375da5bbce883008b0799c0c1a	2024-12-05T13:17:57-08:00	
Exiled Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof's definition of home is shifting	NEW YORK (AP) — Shortly before he was to be flogged and imprisoned for eight years, Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran. His weekslong journey would take him from Tehran, through rural Iranian villages, on foot across a mountainous borderland and ultimately to Hamburg, Germany. As arduous and dangerous as the trip was, Rasoulof’s travels had an added wrinkle: He was trying to finish a movie at the same time. A week after arriving in Germany, Rasoulof would premiere his film, 'The Seed of the Sacred Fig' at the Cannes Film Festival in France. As he fled, Rasoulof was preoccupied with the movie’s edit, which was being carried out in Germany. 'I remember when I was sitting in the car that was driving me to the border,' Rasoulof says. 'I had my laptop and I was taking notes and sending them to my editor. The two friends who were taking me kept saying, ‘Put that thing away for a second.’' In Cannes, 'The Seed of the Sacred Fig' won a special jury prize and Rasoulof was celebrated with a 13-minute standing ovation. The movie has since been hailed as one of the best of the year, and arguably its most daring. Rasoulof made 'Sacred Fig' clandestinely in Iran, directing scenes from a separate location to avoid raising suspicions. (The opening titles read: 'When there is no way, a way must be made.') Its story — a devastating family drama set during the 2022 protests that engulfed Iran — would surely only add to Rasoulof’s prison sentence. So after all of this, how is he feeling? When he recently met with The Associated Press for an interview, Rasoulof shrugged. 'Ordinary,' he says. Rasoulof, 52, has a more gentle, bemused presence than some of his films would suggest. But how could Rasoulof, after what he’s lived through this year, feel anything like ordinary? 'I still haven’t grasped the meaning of exile,' he explains. 'I think it will take some time. The feeling of that void has not hit me yet, and I think it may never come.' Rasoulof has been busy traveling from film festival to film festival. In September, he and his 24-year-old daughter attended the Telluride festival in Colorado. Many more such stops were to come. Since fleeing Iran, Rasoulof has effectively been immersed in the world he’s long known: cinema. 'Maybe I am living in the world of cinema, and maybe that’s why things are so familiar,' he agrees. 'Maybe that’s why I don’t feel I’m in exile.' 'The Seed of the Sacred Fig,' currently playing in theaters, is the Oscar submission from Rasoulof’s adoptive home, Germany. He’s settled in with his family, grateful for how the country has welcomed him. Speaking through an interpreter, Rasoulof grants that he’ll probably always mentally have a bag packed, ready to return to Iran should the chance ever come. But what 'home' constitutes has changed for him. 'I might be able to change this concept of home for myself,' he says. 'I walk on the streets here and I see people of different colors and forms from all over the place, and they all call this place home. So there’s always the chance that one can build something new.' How oppressive politics can infiltrate the home is central to 'The Seed of the Sacred Fig.' It concerns a family of four: Iman (Missagh Zareh), a lawyer newly appointed to the Revolutionary Court in Tehran; his wife, Najmeh (Soheila Golestani) and their two daughters, Rezvan (Mahsa Rostami) and Sana (Setareh Maleki). Iman is proud of his high position, but, when the government crackdown on protesters following the death of Mahsa Amini accelerates, his daughters are increasingly at odds with him. After Iman's gun goes missing, his wife and daughters turn into suspects. 'The Seed of the Sacred Fig,' populated with real cellphone videos from the protests, plays out as an excruciating microcosm of Iranian society. 'It wasn’t like I put those videos in. They just came in,' says Rasoulof. 'The reality is that it was through those videos I realized what happened. When the Woman, Life, Freedom movement occurred, I was in prison.' Rasoulof has spent several spells in Tehran’s Evin Prison. In 2010, he was arrested on set for filming without a permit. In 2022, he was jailed for seven months after pursuing the release of another of Iran’s most prominent filmmakers, Jafar Panahi. Panahi, who secretly made the film 'No Bears,' was only released in 2023 after commencing a hunger strike. 'My windows at home opened to the hills that have the Evin prison in them,' says Rasoulof. 'I knew behind those walls many of my friends were sitting.' Rasoulof, inspired by the courage of the younger generation, resolved to pour the same spirit into 'The Seed of the Sacred Fig.' Although it wasn’t until Rasoulof’s appeal of his sentence failed that he resolved to flee, he grants that deciding to make 'Sacred Fig' essentially sealed his fate. 'Making this film was part of that decision,' he says. 'Although I had made up my mind earlier, because it was such a bitter decision, I was denying it and delaying it, waiting for a miracle to allow me to stay.' 'I would open the fridge to make sure there was nothing there that would go bad,' he adds. 'It was a strange circumstance.' For the film's actors and crew members, signing up for the movie meant also becoming co-conspirators. Everyone knew the risks. And, like Rasoulof, many of them have since left Iran. Rostami and Maleki also now live in Germany. Asked if his collaborators are all currently safe, Rasoulof responds: 'No one is safe from the Islamic Republic.' In his new life, Rasoulof is experiencing freedoms he never had in Iran. His films, for example, are widely available outside his native country but not in Iran. His prize-winning 2020 drama 'There Is No Evil,' about capital punishment in Iran, is banned — though, ironically, Rasoulof’s prison guards enjoyed watching it with him from a flash drive. 'I haven’t seen many of my films on a big screen, especially my last film,' he says. 'I really want to see ‘There Is No Evil’ on a big screen. A festival in Portugal has promised to take me to see my own film.' The name of Rasoulof’s film comes from his memory of an ancient fig tree he once visited on an island in the south of Iran. It’s a tree that, with apparent metaphorical meaning for the Iranian government, spreads its seeds onto other trees, killing them and growing in their place. Rasoulof pulls out his phone to share a photo of his apartment in Tehran. Outside a large window, you can see the walls of Evin running along a craggy hillside. Inside are many houseplants. 'This is my home,' he says. 'I have a lot of plants. I really miss my plants. I have a neighbor who takes care of them for me. I actually have a fig tree at home.'	https://apnews.com/article/seed-of-sacred-fig-mohammad-rasoulof-iran-603b808fb953ca9cf23dcde46189b89f	2024-12-05T12:43:33-08:00	
Quake prompts brief tsunami warning on the West Coast. Here's what to know about tsunamis	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The powerful earthquake that struck in Northern California on Thursday prompted a brief tsunami warning affecting about 5 million people along a stretch of the West Coast — from Northern California to Oregon — before being canceled. Here are some things to know about tsunamis: What is a tsunami? A tsunami, a word that comes from the Japanese characters for harbor and wave, is a series of extremely long waves caused by the sudden displacement of the ocean, according to the National Weather Service. 'Most tsunamis, and the largest, result from earthquakes on reverse faults. These tsunami-generating earthquakes originate mainly in subduction zones, where tectonic plates collide and one is forced under the other,' the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. If this is large enough and closer to the ocean floor, the energy from the earthquake can cause the ocean floor to suddenly rise or fall. 'This sudden vertical displacement of the ocean floor is what typically sets a tsunami in motion,' NOAA said. 'Tsunamis radiate outward in all directions from the point of origin and can move across entire ocean basins,' the service says. When the waves reach land, they can cause coastal flooding, and the powerful currents can last several hours or days. The weather service calls a tsunami as 'one of the most powerful and destructive natural forces.' How often to they happen? Tsunamis that cause damage or death near earthquakes occur about two times a year, according to the Global Historical Tsunami Database. A tsunami racing across an ocean and causing damage or deaths more than 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) away happens about twice a decade. Where do they occur? Tsunamis can occur in any ocean, sea or large body of water. But certain areas are prone to tsunamis because of their proximity to the source and other factors, such as depth and the shape of the ocean floor. The database says between 1900 and 2015, there were 754 confirmed events. Of those, 78% were in the Pacific Ocean. According to the database, Japan has had the most tsunamis since 1900, followed by Russia and Indonesia. A magnitude 9.2 temblor, the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded globally, caused widespread damage in the Anchorage area in 1964 and killed 131 people, including some in Oregon and California by the ensuing tsunami. Most destructive tsunamis In 2004, a magnitude 9.1 earthquake occurred off Sumatra, an Indonesian island in the Indian Ocean. It generated a tsunami that was as high as 167 feet (51 meters), causing an estimated 230,000 deaths. Another magnitude 9.1 earthquake struck in Japan in 2011, creating a tsunami with waves reaching 127 feet (39 meters). The tsunami caused about 18,000 deaths and prompted a nuclear power plant accident.	https://apnews.com/article/california-tsunami-what-to-know-37a08ee0cc122c88864de7e4ca5fc2af	2024-12-05T11:48:47-08:00	
Why the rebel capture of Syria's Hama, a city with a dark history, matters	BEIRUT (AP) — One of the darkest moments in the modern history of the Arab world happened more than four decades ago, when then-Syrian President Hafez Assad launched what came to be known as the Hama Massacre. From 10,000 to 40,000 people were killed or disappeared in the government attack on the central Syrian city that began on Feb. 2, 1982, and lasted for nearly a month, turning it to ruins. The memory of the government assault and the monthlong siege on the city, which at the time was a stronghold of Syria’s Muslim Brotherhood, remains visceral in Syrian and Arab minds. Now Islamist insurgents have captured the city, tearing down a poster of Hafez Assad’s son, President Bashar Assad, in a moment many Syrians have awaited for over 40 years. The moment carried great symbolism in Syria’s long-running war, which began 13 years ago but many say is rooted in Hama. A dark history Hama, Syria’s fourth-largest city, is known for its quaint waterwheels, a landmark attraction along the banks of the Orontes River. But in the early 1980s, its name became synonymous with death. For years, the city was the scene of Muslim Brotherhood-led anti-government attacks that targeted military officers, state institutions and ruling party offices. In February 1982, government forces under Hafez Assad launched an assault. Within a matter of days, government warplanes destroyed most of the city, opening the way for ground troops. Hafez Assad’s brother, Rifaat, led the artillery unit that shelled the city, earning him the nickname the 'Butcher of Hama.' This year, Rifaat Assad was indicted in Switzerland for war crimes and crimes against humanity in connection with Hama. An international arrest warrant was issued for him three years earlier. The massacre created hatred that fanned the flames of another uprising against his son years later. The epicenter of protests In 2011, Hama and surrounding towns became the epicenter of some of the biggest protests against Bashar Assad, which started in 2011 amid a wave of Arab uprisings. The protests and widespread popular resentment forced government security forces to withdraw from the city briefly in June 2012, leaving the opposition in control and fueling a sense of liberation in a place that had once been pounded by Syrian warplanes. Residents at that time painted walls around the city in red, threw red paint on the waterwheels to symbolize the Hama massacre and tried to organize local administration. About 800,000 people lived there at the start of the uprising. 'Erhal ya Bashar,' a protest chant that means 'Come on, leave, Bashar' was popularized in the Hama protests. But government forces returned in August of that year, with a brutal assault that caused mass casualties in the first 24 hours. The leader of the chants was later killed, his throat slit by government forces. Aron Lund, a longtime Syria expert at Century International, a New York-based think tank, said Hama has obvious symbolic value because of the history of the massacre. He described it as a 'huge event in Syrian history and really formative for the opposition and the Islamist opposition in particular,' which commemorate it each year. It was also formative for the regime, because many of the current military leaders were young at the time. 'When 2011 rolled around, they all realized that, you know, we all remember, you all remember Hama. So there’s no there’s no compromising here,' Lund said. In a video message Thursday, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the de facto leader of the Syrian insurgency, announced that fighters had reached Hama 'to clean the wound that has bled for 40 years.' One of the opposition fighters' first moves was to free prisoners held in the city's central prison. The city's strategic importance Hama is a major intersection in Syria that links the country’s center with the north as well as the east and west. It is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital, Damascus, Assad’s seat of power. Hama province also borders the coastal province of Latakia, a main base of popular support for Assad. The region is predominantly Sunni Muslim but also has a minority from the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, to which Assad’s family belongs. Hama’s fall would have been a massive development in its own right, Lund said. But coming after the fall of Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, and after government forces had time to prepare defense lines, the government's defeat 'will absolutely encourage Assad’s enemies and discourage his supporters.' Next stop for the insurgents is Homs, which analysts say would be a game-changer if it falls into rebel hands. Lund said Homs is also where Damascus connects to the coast, where Assad has his base and his village of origin, and home to a Russian naval base. 'Should the rebels be able to seize Homs, which they now have a shot at doing after seizing Hama, then they could theoretically have grabbed' three of Syria's largest cities and severed the capital, he said.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-aleppo-hama-massacre-assad-799f37fd2608532a253cccb48df4e613	2024-12-05T11:26:31-08:00	
Hamas official says Gaza ceasefire talks have resumed after weekslong hiatus	ISTANBUL (AP) — A Hamas official said Thursday that international mediators have resumed negotiating with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he was hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war was within reach. Ceasefire negotiations were halted last month when Qatar suspended talks with mediators from Egypt and the United States because of frustration over a lack of progress between Israel and Hamas. But there has been a 'reactivation' of efforts in recent days to end the fighting, release hostages from Gaza and free Palestinian prisoners in Israel, according to Bassem Naim, an official in Hamas’ political bureau who spoke with The Associated Press in Turkey. Another official familiar with the talks confirmed the return of Qatari mediators. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations with the media. Since the talks broke down, there have been significant shifts in the global and regional landscape. Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, and a ceasefire was declared last week between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Trump is a staunch supporter of Israel, but Naim said he believes the incoming administration could 'affect the situation positively' given that Trump had made halting wars in the region part of his campaign platform. Trump this week called for the release of all hostages held in Gaza by the time he takes office on Jan. 20, saying there would be 'hell to pay' if that doesn't happen. Previous rounds of negotiations focused on variations of a proposal calling for a multiphased ceasefire — beginning with a preliminary six-week halt in fighting during which female, elderly and sick hostages would be freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. During that time, Israel would pull back some forces, and displaced Palestinians would be allowed to return home. The sides would also begin talks on the next phase that would include the full withdrawal of Israeli forces, the release of remaining hostages and the terms of a permanent end to the war. A third, final phase would focus on reconstruction. Naim said that no 'solid, well-formed' new ceasefire proposal has yet been presented to Hamas. And even though ceasefire talks have broken down on multiple occasions throughout the war, he added: 'I think it is not a big challenge to reach a deal … if there are intentions on the other side.' Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Israel’s blistering retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, whose count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. In the negotiations to end the conflict, the two sides have been at odds on some major points, including whether any halt in the fighting would be permanent or temporary and whether Israeli forces would withdraw from all of the enclave, and on what timetable. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain a long-term military presence in the territory and vowed to dismantle Hamas' military capabilities and ensure that the militant group never governs again. Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff met separately in recent weeks with Netanyahu and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani to discuss Gaza ceasefire talks, according to a U.S. official who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to comment publicly. In an interview with British broadcaster Sky News on Wednesday, the Qatari prime minister said officials in his country are aiming to reach a ceasefire before president-elect Trump takes office. Naim said Hamas is sticking to the core demands it has held to during previous rounds of negotiations, including a permanent ceasefire, total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, and the right of internally displaced Palestinians in Gaza to return to their homes. But he also said the Palestinian militant group is 'ready to show flexibility' on implementation, including on the timeline for withdrawal of Israeli forces from key parts of Gaza. A previous round of talks in August reached an impasse in part because Israel demanded that it after any ceasefire it should maintain a military presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strategic strip along the enclave’s border with Egypt, and in the Netzarim corrider that cuts from east to west across the territory's midsection. 'There can be a discussion about these points, but at the end, Israel has to withdraw totally from the Philadelphi corridor, and the Rafah border (with Egypt) has to be opened immediately,' Naim said. Naim said Palestinian factions were also making progress in deciding who would rule Gaza politically after the war. He confirmed that Hamas and its rival Fatah — which dominates the Western-backed Palestinian Authority — have reached an agreement in principle on forming a temporary committee of Palestinian technocrats that would govern Gaza in the immediate aftermath of the war. Under this arrangement, Hamas would give up its political rule of the enclave, but not lay down its arms. 'Originally we are a Palestinian national liberation movement. We are not a movement to govern,' he said. 'When it comes to the military wing ... as long as we are people under occupation, we have all the right to resist this occupation by all means, including armed resistance. Israel says it will never let Hamas rule Gaza again, and is demanding the group disarm. Hamas political official Khalil al-Hayya had previously told AP that if an independent Palestinian state were established along 1967 borders, the group would lay down its arms. Naim said that remains the group’s position. 'Resistance, including armed resistance, is a tool,' he said. 'It is not a goal in itself.' ___ Associated Press writers Josef Federman in Jerusalem, and Aamer Madhani in Washington, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-geasefire-negotiations-qatar-d09bb192b298adb3fa76d0e819721fdf	2024-12-05T10:33:12-08:00	
The Latest: French President Macron will name a new prime minister 'in coming days'	PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron came out fighting Thursday in his first comments following the resignation of ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier, a day after a historic no-confidence vote at the National Assembly left France without a functioning government. Macron said he will serve as president 'until the end' of his five-year term scheduled in 2027. He also said he would name a new prime minister within days, but gave no hints who that might be. Macron laid blame at the door of his opponents on the far right for bringing down the government of Michel Barnier. He said they chose 'Not to do but to undo.' 'They chose disorder,' he said. The president said the far right and the far left had united in what he called 'an anti-Republican front' and stressed: 'I won’t shoulder other people’s irresponsibility.' The National Assembly ousted Barnier by 331 votes, making him the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history. Macron faces pressure to quickly name a new leader capable of navigating a fractured parliament, where no party holds a majority. Here is the the Latest: Macron warns that France cannot afford stasis Macron noted that France’s constitution prevents a new round of legislative elections so soon after the last ones, meaning the country is stuck with the current National Assembly until next July at the earliest. That reality means lawmakers have a duty 'to work together, at the service of France and the French.' 'The world, Europe, are moving ahead, and we need a government that can take decisions,' Macron said. 'We cannot allow ourselves neither division nor immobility. That is why I will name a prime minister in the coming days.' French president acknowledges his own role in chaos now shaking France While critical of his political opponents, Macron also acknowledged his own role in the chaos now shaking French politics and alarming financial markets. He revisited his decision in June to dissolve parliament. That precipitated the crisis, leading to new legislative elections that produced the now hung parliament, divided between three minority blocs that don’t have enough seats to govern alone and are proving largely incapable of working together – except to bring down Barnier. 'I do recognize that this decision wasn’t understood. Many people criticized me for it. I know many continue to criticize me for it. It’s a fact. And it’s my responsibility.' Macron tears into lawmakers who backed the no-confidence vote Macron tore into lawmakers who backed the no-confidence vote that forced Barnier’s resignation, accusing them of pursuing their own political interests. He noted that the vote came with the end of year holidays just around the corner. 'Why did lawmakers act this way? They’re not thinking of you, of your lives, your difficulties,' he said. 'They’re thinking of just one thing: the presidential election – to prepare it, to provoke it, to precipitate it.' But Macron said he’d see out the 30 months still left in his second and last term as president. Macron lays blame on political opponents for bringing down the government of Michel Barnier In his address, Macron came out fighting, laying blame at the door of his opponents on the far right for bringing down the government of Michel Barnier. He said they chose 'Not to do but to undo.' 'They chose disorder,' he said. The president said the far right and the far left had united in what he called 'an anti-Republican front' and stressed: 'I won’t shoulder other people’s irresponsibility.' He said he’d name a new prime minister within days but gave no hints who that might be. Macron vows to stay in office Macron, in his address Thursday, vowed to stay in office until his term expires in 2027. Macron still holds extensive powers for France on the international stage despite weakened powers at home French President Emmanuel Macron faces the challenge to pick a prime minister capable of leading a minority government in a parliament where no party holds a majority. The prime minister is accountable to the parliament, leads the government and introduces bills – to the risk of being ousted via a no-confidence motion. Macron previously ruled out choosing the nominee of the left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, because it includes the hard-left France Unbowed party. French media have reported a shortlist of centrist candidates who might appeal to both sides of the political spectrum. With no majority in parliament, the president is weakened at home, but still holds some extensive powers over foreign policy, European affairs and defense and is in charge of negotiating and ratifying international treaties. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the country’s armed forces and holds the nuclear codes. French President Emmanuel Macron was elected in 2017, before being reelected in 2022 for a five-year term. Teachers' protests take new tone linking demands to the political crisis A planned protest by teachers against education budget cuts took on a new tone Thursday, as demonstrators in Paris linked their demands to the political crisis sparked by the collapse of Barnier. 'Macron démission!' ('Quit Macron!') read a sign held by Dylan Quenon, 28, a PE teacher at a middle school in Aubervilliers, just north of Paris. Quenon said President Emmanuel Macron bears responsibility for what he described as the dismantling of public services. 'He is the one responsible for our dismay, after all he is the one in charge,' Quenon said. 'The only way for this to change is to have him out of office.' Quenon cited examples of budget constraints in his school, where teachers are limited in making photocopies to save paper and wait months for basic sports equipment like pinnies and balls. The protest, which drew thousands of people, featured chants targeting Macron, Barnier, and their now-defunct budget bill. Demonstrators sang: 'Macron, Barnier et leur budget, et hop tout ça à la poubelle' ('Macron, Barnier, and their budget, throw it all in the trash'). Protesters also expressed little optimism that Macron’s next appointee would reverse course. 'I’m glad this government is falling, but it could possibly lead to something even worse,' said Élise De La Gorce, a 33-year-old philosophy teacher in Stains, north of Paris. 'Given the way the previous government was appointed, I don’t have an ounce of hope that Macron could make the right choice for me.' What will happen to the French government’s budget? France is at no risk of a government shutdown that in the United States would disrupt many services and squeeze federal employees. An outgoing government could present a special law to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year’s rules. It would also be able to decide on renewing spending by decree in order to pay civil servants, pensions and other key government expenses. However, this would suspend any potential tax hike — like one initially expected on big companies — and freeze any new spending. In particular, an additional 3.3 billion euro ($3.5 billion) package for the French military was planned as the country supports Ukraine in its war against Russia. Later, a new government could present its own budget proposals at parliament. There’s pressure on Macron to appoint a new PM swiftly Macron faces the critical task of naming a replacement capable of leading a minority government in a parliament where no party holds a majority. Yaël Braun-Pivet, president of the National Assembly and a member of Macron’s party, urged the president to move quickly. 'I recommend he decide rapidly on a new prime minister,' Braun-Pivet said Thursday on France Inter radio. 'There must not be any political hesitation. We need a leader who can speak to everyone and work to pass a new budget bill.' The process may prove challenging. Macron’s administration has yet to confirm any names, though French media have reported a shortlist of centrist candidates who might appeal to both sides of the political spectrum. Why is the National Assembly so volatile? Following the June-July parliamentary elections, the National Assembly, France’s powerful lower house of parliament, is divided into three major blocs: a left-wing coalition known as the New Popular Front, Macron’s centrist allies, and the far-right National Rally party. None won an outright majority. In September, Macron asked Barnier, a conservative, to form a government dominated by Republicans and centrists — implicitly relying on the far right’s goodwill to be able to stay in power. However, in the days before his ousting, far-right leader Marine Le Pen accused Barnier of ignoring her demands and the left-wing coalition denounced an 'austerity budget' and criticized 'the absence of dialogue and disregard for parliamentary work.' What did Barnier say after being voted out? 'I can tell you that it will remain an honor for me to have served France and the French with dignity,' Barnier said in his final speech before the vote. 'This no-confidence motion … will make everything more serious and more difficult. That’s what I’m sure of,' he said. How was Barnier ousted? France’s far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined together Wednesday in a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes. It was the first successful no-confidence vote since 1962. The National Assembly, the lower house of France’s parliament, approved the motion by 331 votes. A minimum of 288 were needed. Who is Michel Barnier, the ousted former prime minister? Barnier, 73, was the oldest of the 26 prime ministers who have served modern France’s Fifth Republic. He replaced the youngest, Gabriel Attal, who was 34 when he was appointed. He is a career politician with humble roots in France’s Alpine region of Haute-Savoie. He was the European Union’s chief negotiator in the difficult talks with Britain over its departure from the bloc. He also has the shortest tenure of any prime minister. When will Macron speak? French President Emmanuel Macron’s speech is scheduled to address the nation in less than an hour and a half. He is expected to address France’s economic challenges while setting a course for the future government.	https://apnews.com/article/emmanuel-macron-france-government-collapse-b78c1f78b0a793f94f2f65da55589e3c	2024-12-05T09:09:20-08:00	
Sierra Leone begins nationwide rollout of Ebola vaccine a decade after deadly outbreak	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) — Authorities in Sierra Leone on Thursday started a nationwide rollout of the single-dose Ebola vaccine, the first such campaign in West Africa where a deadly outbreak 10 years ago resulted in the death of thousands. The 2014 Ebola outbreak – the deadliest in history – was primarily in West Africa but affected Sierra Leone the most, with nearly 4,000 deaths out of the more than 11,000 recorded globally. The country also lost 7% of its healthcare workforce to the outbreak. The nationwide vaccine campaign, implemented by the government in partnership with the global vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization and the United Nations children’s agency, will target 20,000 frontline workers across the country, officials said. 'This is an investment in the safety of our people and a healthier Sierra Leone,' Health Minister Dr. Austin Demby said. There had been no approved vaccine at the time of the 2014 outbreak that recorded up to 28,000 cases, starting in Guinea before spreading across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia, the other two countries affected the most. Three years have passed since the last case was recorded in Guinea, although officials have spoken of remaining threats in endemic regions. Among those killed by the disease during the 2014 outbreak were nine relatives of Hassan Kamara, a resident of Freetown. Of the 11 people he was living with at the time, only he and his baby daughter survived. 'They died in front of me,' he said. 'I feel bad sometimes speaking about this because of what I went through.' Thursday’s campaign, which launched in the capital, Freetown, was welcomed by health workers. Collins Thomas, a community health worker in Freetown, remembers losing many colleagues in 2014 as they managed patients during the outbreak in Freetown. 'It was scary, because we knew nothing about the disease and learned along the line. With this vaccine, we know we are protected,' Thomas said. Gavi chief executive Dr. Sania Nishtar said the organization is 'incredibly proud' of how its support for timely and equitable access to vaccines has helped save lives and protect communities. 'To have the first nationwide preventive vaccination campaign take place in the country most deeply impacted by the 2014 outbreak makes this historic milestone even more meaningful,' he said. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Germany hands over Australian ancestral remains held by museums for over 100 years	BERLIN (AP) — Five sets of ancestral remains from Australia that had been in German museum collections since the 19th century were handed back at a ceremony Thursday that a community representative described as a sad but 'very joyful' moment. The restitution is part of ongoing efforts by German museums and authorities to return human remains and cultural artifacts that were taken during colonial times. In this case, three sets of remains that had been in Berlin since 1880 were handed over along with two other sets of remains held in the northwestern German city of Oldenburg. They were received by four representatives of the Ugar Island community, part of the Torres Strait Islands off the northeastern tip of Australia. 'These ancestral remains were never meant to be here,' said Hermann Parzinger, the head of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which oversees Berlin's state museums. 'They're here because, during the colonial era and beyond, Europeans presumed to make other peoples and cultures the subject, or more often object, of their research — appropriating artifacts from cultures outside Europe on a scale that is almost unimaginable today and even desecrating the burial places of those communities in the process,' he said. Around the turn of the 20th century, he added, Berlin museums set up a network of scientists, travelers, traders and others who sent back cultural items from around the world, and 'in racing to compete with the other major European museums, they all too often disregarded the humanity and dignity of the peoples they encountered.' The restitution of the remains from Berlin's Ethnological Museum and the State Museum for Nature and Man in Oldenburg means that 162 sets of ancestral remains have now been returned to Australia from Germany, and about 1,700 from around the world, said Natasha Smith, Australia's ambassador to Germany. She said the returns are 'an extremely high priority' for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the government. 'It's sad, but it's a very joyful moment,' Ugar Island representative Rocky Stephen said at the ceremony honoring the ancestors. 'This is a process of healing that's going to happen when they return back to us.' 'No matter (if) it was nearly a 40-hour journey to travel here, because it's been 144 years they have been missed back at their home,' he said. Berlin's museums now aim to do 'everything we can to make the repatriation possible' of remains whose countries and communities of origin can be identified and want to bring them home, Parzinger said. More broadly, governments and museums in Europe and North America have increasingly sought to resolve ownership disputes over objects looted during colonial times. In 2022, for example, Germany and Nigeria signed an agreement paving the way for the return of hundreds of artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes taken from Africa by a British colonial expedition more than 120 years ago. ___ Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-australia-ancestral-remains-restitution-654e87306101b3c3a5e91b3dcd678d7c	2024-12-05T04:53:14-08:00	
US first lady Jill Biden in the capital of the United Arab Emirates on last solo foreign trip	ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. first lady Jill Biden toured the capital of the United Arab Emirates on Thursday as part of her final solo foreign tour. Biden, 73, arrived in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday night after stopping in Italy and visiting her ancestral home of Gesso in Sicily. The UAE, an autocratically ruled federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, has been a key U.S. ally in the region and hosts thousands of American troops. The country's Jebel Ali port in Dubai also is the U.S. Navy's busiest port of call outside of the U.S. The UAE also is a major buyer of Boeing Co. aircraft for its long-haul airlines Emirates and Etihad, and has been focused on winning American support for its push into artificial intelligence. On Thursday Biden traveled to the Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi and Qasr Al Hosn, a historic site. She was expected to speak at a summit later in the day. Biden has come to the country previously. In March 2016, she accompanied her husband, then the vice president in the last year of the Obama administration, on a trip to the Emirates. This trip comes after President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden over federal crimes after previously pledging that he wouldn't. The president dodged questions about the pardon while he was on a trip to Angola. For her part, Jill Biden on Monday said: 'Of course I support the pardon of my son.' Biden will travel next to nearby Qatar. After that she'll fly to Paris and join President-elect Donald Trump and other dignitaries in Paris to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral. She'll then return to Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/jill-biden-uae-trip-a5718b9c3ec4cb85136b4ff801b6da47	2024-12-05T03:35:06-08:00	
After Trump's win, Russian disinformation aims to drive a wedge between the US and Ukraine	WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Joe Biden uses his final days in office to boost Ukraine's defenses, Russia is playing a different game: spreading disinformation aimed at eroding U.S. support for Ukraine before Donald Trump's return to the White House next month. Since the U.S. election on Nov. 5, the Kremlin has used state-run media and its networks of fake news sites and social media accounts to push divisive narratives about the war and America's Republican president-elect. Analysts say the content, translated into English for American audiences, is intended to turn sentiment against Ukraine at a pivotal time, with the hope of reducing U.S. military assistance and ensuring a Russian victory. Recent examples include fake videos supposedly showing Ukrainian soldiers burning effigies of Trump or his supporters. One clip depicts soldiers saying Trump must not be allowed to take office and should 'never be president again.' Multiple researchers have debunked the video, noting telltale signs of digital manipulation. A different video claims to show Ukrainian soldiers firing at a mannequin wearing a red 'Make America Great Again' hat and a Trump campaign shirt. That video was analyzed and determined to be fake by private analysts and Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, a government agency that tracks Kremlin propaganda. Other versions — just as fake — depict Ukrainian soldiers burning Trump's books or calling him a coward. In the weeks after the election, the clips spread far beyond Ukraine and Russia, circulating among Trump supporters and believers in QAnon, the conspiracy theory that claims Trump is fighting a war against a Satanic cabal of powerful world leaders. It's part of Russia's continued push to divide Americans over the nearly 3-year war in Ukraine and paint Ukrainians as unreliable, dishonest allies, according to analysts who have tracked Russian disinformation and propaganda since the war began. By discouraging American support for Ukraine, the Kremlin is hoping to cut off the most vital source of military assistance that has kept Ukrainian hopes alive since Russia invaded in February 2022. Early in the war, Russian propagandists portrayed Ukrainian leaders as corrupt and self-serving. Russian state media claimed Ukraine’s leaders held Nazi sympathies — even though President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish — or were involved in clandestine bioweapons research that Moscow sought to tie to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each false claim was used to justify Russia’s invasion. 'It’s planted by the Russians, this idea that ‘Ukraine is so corrupt it shouldn’t even be a state, and we are the right people to be running this place,’' said Rupert Smith, a retired British general and former NATO deputy supreme commander who now leads a Brussels-based consulting firm called Solvo Partners. 'Now this is being used as an excuse for not supporting Ukraine.' The fake video claiming to show Ukrainian soldiers firing on the Trump mannequin spread on platforms such as X, Telegram and YouTube, getting an early boost from pro-Kremlin news sites before migrating to ones popular with Americans, according to an analysis by researchers at NewsGuard, a firm that tracks disinformation. Some versions of the video were created long before the election but were passed off as more recent. Within days, the video was receiving hundreds of thousands of views and had been translated into several languages besides Russian and English, including German, Chinese and Polish, NewsGuard found. According to U.S. intelligence, Russia sought to support Trump in the presidential election, believing he would reduce American backing for Ukraine and perhaps the NATO alliance. The incoming president has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, criticized U.S. military aid to Ukraine and NATO and promised to end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory now occupied by Russia. In response to questions about Russia’s role in spreading disinformation about Ukraine, a spokesperson for the Russian Embassy in Washington referred to past statements rejecting any involvement. In the time it has left, the Biden administration has urged Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and has stepped upweapons shipments while forgiving billions in loans provided to Kyiv. So far, the White House has pushed more than $56 billion in security assistance to Ukraine and expects to send billions more before Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, 2025. It’s easy to understand Russia’s motives in trying to cut off that supply of aid, said Joshua Tucker, a New York University professor and Russia expert who studies online disinformation. What’s harder to gauge, he said, is the effectiveness of Russian disinformation, especially on social media platforms already crowded with false, bizarre and debunked claims. One reason that Russia may persist with disinformation targeting Americans is the relative ease and affordability of such operations compared with diplomatic or military alternatives. Russia likely sees disinformation as part of a long-term effort to undermine America's global leadership by dividing its people and undermining support for its institutions, Tucker said. Whether the topic is immigration, the government, the U.S. economy or the war in Ukraine, he said, the goal remains the same and goes beyond one election cycle or one candidate. 'I think what they were really hoping for is a contested result with lots of people out in the streets, arguing the election wasn’t legitimate,' Tucker said. If they couldn't have that, however, Russia's disinformation agencies will keep pushing narratives that they believe will inflame Americans and boost their chances in Ukraine, Tucker said.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-biden-disinformation-335ed5bf57996b66bc387497a7efdbb9	2024-12-05T03:33:59-08:00	
Senior UK commander warns of 'Third nuclear age'	LONDON (AP) — The head of Britain’s armed forces has warned that the world stands at the cusp of a 'third nuclear age,’’ defined by multiple simultaneous challenges and weakened safeguards that kept previous threats in check. Admiral Tony Radakin, chief of the defense staff, said Britain needs to recognize the seriousness of the threats it faces, even if there is only a remote chance of Russia launching a direct nuclear attack on the U.K. or its NATO allies. While the Cold War saw two superpowers held at bay by nuclear deterrence and the past three decades were characterized by international efforts to restrict the spread of nuclear weapons, the current era is 'altogether more complex,' Radakin said Wednesday in a speech to the Royal United Services Institute. 'We are at the dawn of a third nuclear age…’’ he said. 'It is defined by multiple and concurrent dilemmas, proliferating nuclear and disruptive technologies and the almost total absence of the security architectures that went before.' Challenges faced by the West include Russia’s threat to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, China’s drive to build up its nuclear stockpiles, Iran’s failure to cooperate with international efforts to limit its nuclear program, and 'erratic behavior' by North Korea, Radakin said. All of this comes against a backdrop of increasing cyber-attacks, sabotage and disinformation campaigns aimed at destabilizing Western countries. He described the deployment of North Korean soldiers alongside Russian forces on Ukraine’s border as the year’s 'most extraordinary development,’’ and warned that further deployments were possible. The annual lecture by the chief of Britain’s defense staff is a tradition at RUSI, one of the country’s foremost think tanks on military and strategic issues. Radakin used the lecture to make the case for continued reforms in the British military so the U.K. is prepared to respond to the changing international landscape. That includes maintaining Britain’s nuclear deterrent, which is 'the one part of our inventory of which Russia is most aware and has more impact on Putin than anything else,' he said. Britain keeps at least one submarine armed with nuclear missiles at sea at all times so that it can respond in the event of a nuclear attack. The U.K. government is currently conducting a strategic defense review to determine how its armed forces should be staffed and equipped to confront the new challenges. The results are due to be published in the first half of next year.	https://apnews.com/article/admiral-radakin-defense-nukes-76f37aa34ceafffd6a9895d23547320b	2024-12-05T03:23:33-08:00	
Indonesia arrests a Chinese man wanted by Beijing over money laundering charges	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian authorities have arrested a Chinese man sought by Beijing for allegedly helping transfer and laundering almost $18 million from a criminal online gambling group in China, officials said Thursday. Yan Zhenxing was detained Monday by immigration officers at a cross-border ferry terminal on Batam island, next to Singapore. Yuldi Yusman, the Director of Immigration Supervision and Enforcement, said Yan was arrested following an Interpol red notice for him. The notices request law enforcement agencies worldwide to detain or arrest a suspect wanted by a specific country. Yusman said Yan, a permanent resident of Singapore, was arriving in Batam for holiday with his family when he was detained. Indonesian authorities brought the suspect, wearing a detainee’s orange shirt and a facemask, to a news conference Thursday in the capital of Jakarta. The suspect did not make any statements and was not asked any questions. Yusman said that Yan was named as a suspect by police in China’s Inner Mongolia region who allege he was involved in transfering and laundering more than 130 million Chinese Yuan ($17.8 million) from a criminal online gambling group. He said Yan was handed to Indonesia's National Central Bureau Interpol in Jakarta on Thursday and a decision to deport or to extradite him to China will take some time. The arrest came just two months after immigration officers on the tourist island of Bali arrested a Chinese suspect sought by Beijing who allegedly helped to run investment scams that brought in over $14 billion from clients in China. 'We are committed to protecting Indonesia’s territory from the arrival of foreign nationals who are not useful and threaten national stability,' Yusman said. Indonesia, an archipelago nation on the crossroads between Asia and the South Pacific, is attractive to local, regional and global organized crime because of its geographical location. Last month, authorities in Bali arrested Hector Aldwin Pantollana, a Filipino fugitive accused of helping scam over $67 million out of clients in the Philippines. Another Filipino, Alice Guo, a fugitive former mayor accused of having links to Chinese criminal syndicates, was arrested near Jakarta in September. She has since been deported to the Philippines. In June, Chaowalit Thongduang, one of Thailand’s most wanted fugitives, was escorted back to Thailand on a Thai air force plane after being arrested in Bali following months on the run over allegations he was involved in several killings and drug trafficking. ___ Associated Press writers Niniek Karmini and Edna Tarigan in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-china-money-laundering-online-gambling-fugitive-a80c29c2b9d3ec5768547ebb8dc9ae42	2024-12-05T03:15:53-08:00	
France's Macron vows to stay in office till end of term, says he'll name a new prime minister soon	PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron vowed Thursday to stay in office until the end of his term, due in 2027, and announced that he will name a new prime minister within days in efforts to overcome the political deadlock following the resignation of ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier. Macron came out fighting a day after a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes at the National Assembly left France without a functioning government. He laid blame at the door of his opponents on the far right for bringing down Barnier's government. 'They chose disorder,' he said. The president said the far right and the far left had united in what he called 'an anti-Republican front' and stressed: 'I won’t shoulder other people’s irresponsibility.' He said he’d name a new prime minister within days but gave no hints as to who that might be. Earlier in the day, Macron 'took note' of Barnier’s resignation after just three months in office — the shortest tenure of any prime minister in modern French history. Macron acknowledges his own responsibility While critical of his political opponents, Macron also acknowledged what he described as his own responsibility in the chaos now shaking French politics and alarming financial markets. He revisited his decision in June to dissolve parliament. That precipitated the crisis, leading to legislative elections that produced the now hung parliament, divided between three minority blocs that do not have enough seats to govern alone. 'I do recognize that this decision wasn’t understood. Many criticized me for it,' Macron said. However, he argued, 'I believe it was necessary' to let French voters speak. The next priority is to pass a budget law Macron said the new prime minister 'will be charged with forming a government of general interest.' He confirmed that a special law will be presented by mid-December to enable the state to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year’s rules, and avoid a shutdown. 'Public services will be operational, businesses will be able to work,' he said. The new government will then prepare a budget law for 2025, which will allow France to invest as planned in its military, its justice and police — and also to support struggling farmers, Macron said. How to achieve ‘the impossible’ Along with its own domestic political and financial difficulties — not least France’s ballooning levels of debt — Macron noted that the country faces multiple international challenges, citing the wars in Ukraine and Middle East. He looked back at the Paris Olympics in July-August and ahead to the reopening this weekend of Notre Dame Cathedral, arguing that France can emerge from this latest political crisis if it sets its mind on it. 'It’s proof that we know how to do great things, that we know how to achieve the impossible,' he said. 'Twice this year, the world has admired us for this,' he said, referring to the hosting of the Olympics and the restoration of Notre Dame. 'Well, for the nation, we must do same thing.' Pressure to act swiftly Macron faces the critical task of naming a replacement for Barnier capable of leading a minority government in a parliament where no party holds a majority. Yaël Braun-Pivet, president of the National Assembly and a member of Macron’s party, urged the president to move quickly. 'I recommend he decide rapidly on a new prime minister,' Braun-Pivet said Thursday on France Inter radio. 'There must not be any political hesitation. We need a leader who can speak to everyone and work to pass a new budget bill.' The process may prove challenging. French media have reported a shortlist of centrist candidates who might appeal to both sides of the political spectrum. Calls for Macron to step down The no-confidence vote has galvanized opposition leaders, with some explicitly calling for Macron’s resignation. 'I believe that stability requires the departure of the President of the Republic,' Manuel Bompard, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, said on BFM TV Wednesday night. Far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, whose party holds the most seats in the Assembly, stopped short of calling for Macron’s resignation but warned that 'the pressure on the President of the Republic will get stronger and stronger.' The French constitution does not call for a president to resign after his government was ousted by the National Assembly. It also says that new legislative elections cannot be held until at least July, creating a potential stalemate for policymakers. Economic uncertainty looms The political instability has heightened concerns about France’s economy, particularly its debt, which could rise to 7% of GDP next year without significant reforms. Analysts say that Barnier's government downfall could push up French interest rates, digging the debt even further. Rating agency Moody’s warned late Wednesday that the government’s fall 'reduces the likelihood of consolidating public finances' and worsens the political gridlock. Teachers' protest takes a political tone A planned protest by teachers against budget cuts in education took on a new tone Thursday, as demonstrators in Paris linked their demands to the political crisis. 'Macron quit!' read a sign held by Dylan Quenon, a 28-year-old teacher at a middle school in Aubervilliers, just north of Paris. Quenon said Macron bears responsibility for what he described as the dismantling of public services such as schools. 'The only way for this to change is to have him out of office,' he said. Protesters expressed little hope that Macron’s next appointee would reverse course. 'I’m glad this government is falling, but it could possibly lead to something even worse,' said Élise De La Gorce, a 33-year-old teacher in Stains, north of Paris.	https://apnews.com/article/france-macron-government-collapse-24681982fc526ffdafd57e53773ef855	2024-12-05T02:50:03-08:00	
OPEC+ oil alliance faces stagnant prices for crude while US drivers enjoy cheaper gasoline	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Members of the OPEC + alliance of oil exporting countries will decide Thursday whether to put off plans to pump more crude amid sluggish demand and competing production from non-allied countries -- factors that could keep oil prices stagnant into next year. Key beneficiaries of that would be U.S. motorists, who have seen gasoline prices fall to their lowest in 2 1/2 years to near $3 a gallon. OPEC+, which includes Saudi Arabia as the dominant member of the OPEC producers' cartel, and Russia as the leading non-OPEC member in the 23-country alliance, is holding an online meeting over whether to put off production increases that are scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. Eight OPEC+ members planned to start increasing production from Jan. 1 by gradually restoring 2.2 million barrels per day in previous production cuts. Analysts now say the group could postpone production increases for another three months as it monitors demand. Oil prices have been slack due to weaker than expected demand from China as well as increased production from countries like Brazil and Argentina that aren't in OPEC+. Oil analysts have been busy reducing their estimates for demand for next year, meaning that OPEC+ could remain in a bind well into 2025. The Saudis need oil revenue to carry out Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s ambitious plans to diversify his country’s economy, including the development of Neom, a $500 billion futuristic city in the desert. For Russia, oil export revenues are a key pillar of state finances and funding for the war against Ukraine. Holding back production risks losing market share. Yet increasing production and sales could lower prices in a global economy that analysts say is already well supplied with oil. U.S. oil has been stuck around $70 per barrel and traded at $68.92 on Thursday ahead of the meeting, down from $80 in August. International benchmark Brent crude traded at $72.66 per barrel, down from around $80 in July. One result of those slack prices is that U.S. average pump prices for gasoline fell to $3.03 a gallon this week, the lowest since May, 2021 and well down from their record peak of $5.02 from June, 2022, according to motoring club AAA. Thirty-one U.S. states now have average gas prices below $3 a gallon. U.S. oil price levels of $70 or less 'are great for consumers,' said AAA spokesman Andrew Gross. Crude oil makes up about half the price of a gallon of gasoline, making crude the key factor on top of distribution costs and taxes. Motorists in Europe see far smaller fluctuations because taxes make up a much bigger chunk of the cost. OPEC has cut its forecast for 2025 demand growth to 1.54 million barrels per day, from 1.85 million barrels per day in July. That is at the high end of estimates compared to those from the International Energy Agency at 990,000 barrels per day, U.S. Energy Information Administration at 1.22 million and energy intelligence firm Rystad Energy at 1.1 million. Analysts at Commerzbank foresee Brent prices averaging $75 per barrel in the first quarter of next year and $80 for the remaining three quarters. In the United States, Donald Trump’s return to the White House will likely lead to more fossil fuel production. Not only has the President-elect campaigned on more drilling, but his Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent has put together an economic plan with the goal of increasing domestic oil production by the equivalent of 3 million barrels a day. Bessent has indicated that the additional oil production would reduce inflationary pressures for U.S. consumers. But the Trump team has not fully outlined why oil producers would ramp up supplies and lower prices to levels that could hurt their profits. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1960, by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. It has since expanded to 12 member countries. In 2016, largely in response to dramatically falling oil prices due to U.S. shale oil output, OPEC signed an agreement with 10 other oil-producing countries to create OPEC+. —- Josh Boak contributed from Washington DC.	https://apnews.com/article/opec-oil-gas-prices-energy-7e3a7a4b86e966ba9b609e23825e4ccc	2024-12-05T02:07:49-08:00	
Who is the South Korean leader who tried to impose martial law?	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Decades of achievement led Yoon Suk Yeol to the pinnacle of political power in South Korea, but his legacy may now boil down to a single, baffling decision to send out troops under martial law over vague claims that one of Asia's leading democracies was under threat. Was there any clue in Yoon's background that this was coming? Yoon, a staunch conservative and longtime prosecutor, went from political novice to president of South Korea in 2022, ending five years of liberal rule that saw failed efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis and a slackening economy. But his time in office has been marked by near-constant friction with an opposition-controlled parliament, threats of annihilation from North Korea and a series of scandals involving him and and his wife. Observers say he has long taken criticism personally and relies on the advice of hardcore loyalists, and that he makes impulsive decisions. As he faces impeachment by parliament, no one thing explains his attempt to shut down the mechanisms of a democratic nation over his still unexplained claim that 'anti-state forces' were acting under the influence of North Korea. But there are strands in Yoon's background, and especially in the intense acrimony with the liberal opposition and his hardline standoff with North Korea, that help illuminate what could turn out to be the defining moment of his presidency. A turbulent rise to top prosecutor Despite his 2 1/2 years as president, Yoon's career has been overwhelmingly about the law, not politics. Yoon, 63, was born in Seoul to two professors, and went to prestigious Seoul National University, where he studied law. A major moment, according to Yoon, happened in 1980 when he played the role of a judge in a mock trial of then-dictator Chun Doo-hwan, who had staged a military coup the previous year, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. In the aftermath, Yoon had to flee to the countryside as Chun’s military extended martial law and placed troops and armored vehicles at the university. Yoon returned to the capital and eventually began a career as a state prosecutor that would last nearly three decades, building an image as strong-minded and uncompromising. Prone to confrontation But he has also faced criticism that his personality was unsuited to high-level leadership. 'President Yoon isn’t well-prepared, and he does things off the cuff,' Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership, said. 'He also tends to express his emotions too directly. The things that he likes and dislikes are easy to see, and he tends to handle things with a small group of his own people, not the majority of people.' During a parliament audit in 2013, Yoon, then a senior prosecutor, said he was under pressure from his boss, who said he opposed Yoon's investigation into an allegation that the country’s spy agency had conducted an illicit online campaign to help conservative President Park Geun-hye win the previous year’s election. At the time, he famously said, 'I’m not loyal to (high-level) people.' He was demoted, but after Park’s government was toppled over a separate corruption scandal in 2017, then President Moon Jae-in made Yoon head of a Seoul prosecution office, which investigated Park and other conservative leaders. Moon later named Yoon the nation’s top prosecutor. A neophyte in politics Yoon only joined party politics about a year before he won the presidency, abandoning the liberal Moon after an impasse over a probe of Moon's allies. Moon’s supporters said he was trying to thwart Moon’s prosecution reforms and elevate his own political standing. The 2022 presidential race was Yoon’s first election campaign. Yoon beat his rival, liberal firebrand Lee Jae-myung, by less than 1 percentage point in South Korea’s most closely fought presidential election. Their campaign was one of the nastiest in recent memory. Yoon compared Lee’s party to 'Hitler' and 'Mussolini.' Lee’s allies called Yoon 'a beast' and 'dictator' and derided his wife’s alleged plastic surgery. Domestic political strife Yoon's time as president has been dominated by frustration and acrimony, much stemming from his narrow victory and his party's failure to win control of parliament. The liberal opposition's control of parliament will continue until he leaves office in 2027 after its resounding parliamentary election wins earlier this year. Gridlock in parliament has led to an increasingly tense political discourse. When Yoon declared the state of emergency, he said a goal was to eliminate 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces' that he said were plotting rebellion, in an apparent reference to the opposition Democratic Party. During Tuesday’s martial law announcement, Yoon highlighted his rivals’ repeated attempts to impeach his top officials and their bid to curtail key parts of next year’s budget bill as major reasons for his declaration. Claims of corruption have also battered his approval ratings. Last month, Yoon denied wrongdoing in an influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife. Spy camera footage in a separate scandal also purportedly shows the first lady, Kim Keon Hee, accepting a luxury bag as a gift from a pastor. Choi said he thinks Yoon likely planned the 'clumsy martial law' edict to divert public attention away from the scandals. 'Whether he will be politically dead or not, he tried to massively shake up the political world,' Choi said. 'But he failed. He likely believed there was no other option.' North Korea has lashed out at his hard line If political squabbles and scandal have set the tenor of Yoon's domestic presidency, its foreign policy has been characterized by a bitter standoff with North Korea. Yoon early on in his presidency promised 'an audacious plan' to improve the North’s economy if it abandoned its nuclear weapons. But things turned sour quickly, as North Korea ramped up its weapons tests and threats to attack the South. By last year North Korea was calling Yoon 'a guy with a trash-like brain' and 'a diplomatic idiot.' And for months now, North Korea has taken that trash theme literally, sending thousands of balloons filled with garbage over the border, including some that made it to the presidential compound in Seoul at least twice. Yoon's mention of North Korea as a domestic destabilizing force reminded some of an earlier South Korea, which until the late 1980s was ruled by a series of strongmen who repeatedly invoked the threat from the North to justify effort to suppress domestic dissidents and political opponents. ___ Klug reported from Tokyo.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-president-impeachment-53d787e9f04d32615e83aade47412174	2024-12-05T01:46:08-08:00	
Notre Dame’s resurrection: Its chief architect on rebuilding France’s 'heart' in 5 years	PARIS (AP) — The day after the inferno struck Notre Dame on April 15, 2019, Philippe Villeneuve walked despondently into the remains of his cathedral. Smoke choked the spring air, the spire lay in rubble, and charred beams littered the nave. 'We had lost the framework, the roof, the spire, and three sections of the vault,' Villeneuve, its chief architect since 2013, said. Yet just hours earlier, President Emmanuel Macron had issued an extraordinary decree: Notre Dame would rise again — in just five years. 'There was one sole (problem),' Villeneuve said in an interview with The Associated Press, 'the deadline.' It felt impossible. Yet as Villeneuve stepped through the wreckage with doubts in his mind, he was caught by surprise. Terrifying as it was to see the charred remains of the 861-year-old Gothic treasure, a beacon of hope emerged. 'All the stained-glass windows were spared, the great organ, the furniture, the paintings -— everything was intact,' he realized. 'It was doable.' A historic restoration Macron’s decree became the driving force behind the most prominent restoration in modern French history. The announcement sparked unprecedented global support, with donations quickly nearing $1 billion. Yet, other obstacles came in waves. First, the fire’s immediate aftermath brought a lead contamination crisis that halted work for a month, and woke the world up to the dangers of lead dust. Then came the pandemic, forcing workers off site. Weather, too, seemed to conspire, with heavy rains delaying the removal of the scorched scaffolding that had fused into a skeletal reminder of the disaster. But Villeneuve persisted, working with his team on what he called the 'presidential building site' to redefine what was possible under extraordinary conditions. He lobbied for the final reopening date to be delayed from April of this year to align with Dec. 8 — a Catholic holy day celebrating Mary’s conception without sin — a symbolic choice that felt both achievable and sacred. His irreverent sense of humor — delivered amid expletives, and with a childlike grin that belies his 61 years and his silver hair — seems to have carried him through the relentless five years of work. But as the reopening fast approaches, Villeneuve confessed his lingering anxiety. 'I’m not calm — not at all. I’m completely stressed out,' he said. 'This was not just about restoring a building. This was about restoring the heart of France.' More beautiful than ever There were positives. The fire badly scarred the cathedral but also revealed its hidden brilliance — with many who glimpsed the restored interiors last week saying they are more majestic than before the catastrophe. 'It’s horrible to say (of the fire), but every cloud has a silver lining,' Villeneuve said, smiling. 'The stone is luminous now. It almost glows.' The intense heat and falling debris left behind a film of toxic lead dust, requiring meticulous cleaning of every surface. Sculptures, walls and organ pipes were painstakingly stripped of grime and soot, exposing a brightness unseen for centuries. Strolling through the medieval wooden beams of the reconstructed framework, so complicated it is known as the 'forest,' or beneath the newly restored spire, Villeneuve felt the work was so seamless it seemed as if the inferno might never have happened, he said. 'That’s success,' Villeneuve said. 'If I can make (cathedral visitors) doubt there was ever a fire, then I’ve erased the horror.' Inked devotion While his restoration adhered faithfully to the historical designs of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, Villeneuve found a deeply personal way to mark his connection to Notre Dame. He knew he could not leave his name etched into the stone, so he chose to get a long, bold tattoo running down his forearm, calling himself 'Rock and Roll' for it. It depicts Viollet-le-Duc’s original spire — the one that collapsed in the fire — not the newly restored version crowned with the golden phoenix cum rooster. Complementing it is another tattoo over his chest, inspired by the cathedral’s stained glass, forming a rosary design. 'This wasn’t about me,' he said, 'but I’ve left my mark in my own way.' Viollet-le-Duc’s 19th-century spire, a meticulous recreation of a medieval aesthetic, remains at the heart of the restoration. 'He was a genius,' Villeneuve said of the architect. 'My role was to ensure that vision endured.' Lingering mystery of the fire While Notre Dame’s restoration has proceeded with remarkable precision, one question still looms over Villeneuve: the cause of the fire, a frustrating investigation into one of the biggest mysteries in France in living memory. Despite extensive efforts, money and interest, authorities have still not identified the blaze’s origin. Initial theories suggested an electrical short circuit, possibly linked to ongoing renovation work, but no definitive cause has been established. The lingering uncertainty still troubles Villeneuve as the cathedral nears its reopening. It’s personal, particularly as he was in charge when the fire broke out. 'It’s something that haunts you. Not the responsibility for the fire — I know very well that I bear no personal responsibility for it,' he said. 'At least, I think so.' 'But it annoys me not to know.' In the wake of the disaster, lessons have been learned, and steps taken to ensure Notre Dame’s protection in the future. Villeneuve and his team have installed cutting-edge fire safety systems in the cathedral to prevent a similar catastrophe. The attic, now divided into three fire compartments—choir, transept, and nave—features advanced thermal cameras, smoke detectors, and a revolutionary water-misting system. Unlike traditional sprinklers, this system releases a fine mist of water droplets designed to extinguish flames while minimizing damage to the fragile wood and stone. 'The mist saturates the air, reducing oxygen levels to smother fires without harming the wood or stone,' Villeneuve explained. 'These are the most advanced fire safety systems in any French cathedral. We had to learn from what happened. We owe it to the future.' Triumph of Notre Dame Standing on the banks of the Seine, Notre Dame’s spire once again reaching into the Parisian sky, Villeneuve allowed himself a moment of quiet pride as he took questions and compliments from passersby — enjoying his new 'celebrity' status. For Villeneuve, the journey — his life's work, shortly before he retires — has been as personal as it was monumental. 'The cathedral burned, she collapsed, and I collapsed the same day,' he said, speaking of the monument in visceral, human terms. 'I gradually got back up as she got back up. As the scars began closing, I felt better. Now I feel ready to leave the hospital.' He suggested that the nation’s wounds are also healing as the reopening approaches. With 15 million visitors expected per year — 3 million more than before the fire — Villeneuve’s work continues to resonate, both in stone and spirit. ___ For more of AP’s coverage on Notre Dame, visit https://apnews.com/hub/notre-dame-cathedral	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-architect-interview-restoration-f78fa349d4275f93a97fe1d2c5c82e29	2024-12-05T01:42:35-08:00	
European satellites launched to create artificial solar eclipses in a tech demo	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A pair of European satellites rocketed into orbit Thursday on the first mission to create artificial solar eclipses through fancy formation flying in space. Each fake eclipse should last six hours once operations begin next year. That's considerably longer than the few minutes of totality offered by a natural eclipse here on Earth, allowing for prolonged study of the sun's corona, or outer atmosphere. The launch took place from India. 'We are a very happy science team here' in India, the European Space Agency's mission scientist Joe Zender said via email. Billed as a tech demo, the two satellites will separate in a month or so and fly 492 feet (150 meters) apart once reaching their destination high above Earth, lining up with the sun so that one spacecraft casts a shadow on the other. This will require extreme precision, within just one millimeter, equivalent to a fingernail's thickness, according to the European Space Agency. To maintain their position, the satellites will rely on GPS, star trackers, lasers and radio links, flying autonomously. Each cube-shaped spacecraft is less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) across. The shadow-casting satellite holds a disk to block the sun from the telescope on the other satellite. This disk will mimic the moon in a natural total solar eclipse, with the darkened satellite posing as Earth. 'This has a huge scientific relevance' in addition to testing high-precision formation flying,' said the European Space Agency’s technology and engineering director Dietmar Pilz. Scientists need the glaring face of the sun completely blocked in order to scrutinize the wispy crown-like corona encircling it, getting an especially good look close to the solar rim on this mission. They're particularly interested to learn why the corona is hotter than the surface of the sun, and also want to better understand coronal mass ejections, eruptions of billions of tons of plasma with magnetic fields out into space. The resulting geomagnetic storms can disrupt power and communication on Earth and in orbit. Such outbursts can also produce stunning auroras in unexpected places. With a lopsided orbit stretching from 370 miles (600 kilometers) to 37,000 miles (60,000 kilometers) away, the satellites will take nearly 20 hours to circle the world. Six of those hours — at the farther end of certain orbits — will be spent generating an eclipse. Other orbits will be strictly for formation flying experiments, according to the European Space Agency. The first eclipse results should be available in March, following checkout of both craft. Zender said eclipses will be created at least twice a week, with six hours of totality each time for corona observations. The frequency will depend on solar activity, he noted, and prove a boon for scientists who now must travel across the world for a mere three to five minutes of totality during the occasional eclipse. The $210 million mission, dubbed Proba-3, is aiming for at least 1,000 hours of 'on demand' totality during its two-year operation. Once their job is done, both satellites will gradually drop lower until they burn up in the atmosphere, likely within five years. Liftoff was delayed a day by a last-minute issue with the backup propulsion system of one of the satellites, crucial for precision formation flying. The European Space Agency said engineers relied on a computer software fix. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Syrian army says it has withdrawn from the city of Hama after insurgents broke through its defenses	BEIRUT (AP) — The Syrian army says it has withdrawn from the central city of Hama after insurgents broke through its defenses, in another setback for President Bashar Assad. The announcement Thursday came hours after opposition fighters said they had entered the city and were marching toward the center. The Syrian army said it redeployed from Hama and took positions outside the city to protect the lives of civilians. The capture of Hamas, Syria’s fourth largest city, is another blow for Assad days after insurgents captured much of the northern city of Aleppo, the country’s largest city. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian insurgents said they entered parts of the central city of Hama on Thursday after three days of intense clashes with government forces on its outskirts, part of an ongoing offensive in which they also seized Syria's largest city of Aleppo. Syrian state media confirmed violent clashes between government forces and opposition gunmen on the eastern edges of Hama city but denied that the insurgents had breached it. Hama is one of the few cities that remained under full government control during Syria's conflict, which broke out in March 2011 following a popular uprising. Its capture would be a major setback for President Bashar Assad. The offensive is being led by the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham as well as an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Their sudden capture of the northern city of Aleppo, an ancient business hub, was a stunning prize for Assad's opponents and reignited the conflict which had been largely stalemated for the past few years. Aleppo's takeover marked the first opposition attack on the city since 2016, when a brutal Russian air campaign retook it for Assad after rebel forces had initially seized it. Intervention by Russia, Iran and Iranian-allied Hezbollah and other militant groups has allowed Assad to remain in power. The latest flare-up in Syria’s long civil war comes as Assad’s main regional and international backers are preoccupied with their own wars. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced by the renewed fighting, which began with the surprise opposition offensive Nov. 27. The insurgents claimed on their Military Operations Department channel on the Telegram app Thursday that they have entered Hama and are marching toward its center. 'Our forces are taking positions inside the city of Hama,' the channel quoted a local commander identified as Maj. Hassan Abdul-Ghani as saying. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said gunmen have entered parts of the city, mainly the neighborhoods of Sawaaeq and Zahiriyeh to the northwest. It added that gunmen are also on the edge of the northwestern neighborhood of Kazo. 'If Hama falls, it means that the beginning of the regime’s fall has started,' the Observatory’s chief, Rami Abdurrahman, told The Associated Press. Hama is a major intersection point in Syria that links that country’s center with the north as well the east and the west. It is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital, Damascus, Assad’s seat of power. Hama province also borders the coastal province of Latakia, a main base of popular support for Assad. The city's name is synonymous with the 1982 massacre of Hama, one of the most notorious in the modern Middle East, when security forces under Assad's late father, Hafez Assad, killed thousands to crush a Muslim Brotherhood uprising.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-aleppo-hama-hts-russia-0189297bbdc76eee67cb4fdc62136bef	2024-12-05T01:08:51-08:00	
Philippine police checking reports that a kidnapped American has died after being shot	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine police officials said Thursday they are checking reports that a kidnapped American died after being shot twice while resisting his Oct. 17 abduction by gunmen in the country’s south. Elliot Onil Eastman, 26, from Vermont, was shot twice with an M16 rifle while trying to fight off his four kidnappers, who posed as police officers, in the coastal town of Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province, police said. The kidnappers dragged him to a motorboat and sped off, according to earlier police reports. A massive search for Eastman and his abductors led to the arrest of a number of suspects, but he has not been found. Three suspects were killed in a gunbattle with police in the south last month. Regional police spokesperson Lt. Col. Ramoncelio Sawan said investigators received information from a relative of one of the suspects that Eastman died due to gunshot wounds in the thigh and abdomen while being taken away by his abductors. The kidnappers decided to throw his body into the sea after he died, the relative said. The information about Eastman’s death was later corroborated by a key suspect in the kidnapping who was arrested recently, and his sworn statement has been submitted to government prosecutors, Sawan said. Criminal complaints of kidnapping have been filed against several suspects, he said. 'We are constrained to believe that he has died. All of the information that we have points to that,' Sawan said. But he added that without the victim's body, 'we’re still leaving a little bit of hope that it may not be the case' and police would continue their investigation. Philippine police have informed Eastman’s Filipino wife and the U.S. Embassy in Manila about his reported death, Sawan said. The embassy said it's aware of the police report and is coordinating with Philippine authorities, but did not comment further due to privacy considerations. Eastman traveled out of the Philippines and returned to Sibuco to attend his wife's graduation when he was kidnapped. He had been posting Facebook videos of his life in Sibuco, a poor, remote coastal town, where the suspects spotted him, police earlier said. They said the suspects appeared to be common criminals who did not belong to any Muslim rebel groups which have been accused of ransom kidnappings in the past. Security problems have long hounded the southern Philippines, the homeland of a Muslim minority in the largely Roman Catholic nation. The southern third of the Philippines has bountiful resources but has long been hamstrung by poverty, insurgencies and outlaws. A 2014 peace agreement between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest of several Muslim separatist groups, has considerably eased widespread fighting in the south. Relentless military offensives have weakened smaller armed groups such as the Abu Sayyaf, reducing kidnappings, bombings and other violence. The Abu Sayyaf has targeted Americans and other Western tourists and missionaries, most of whom were freed after ransoms were paid. A few were killed, including American Guillermo Sobero, who was beheaded on the southern island of Basilan, and a U.S. missionary, Martin Burnham, who was killed while Philippine army forces were trying to rescue him and his wife, Gracia Burnham, in 2002 in a rainforest near Sibuco.	https://apnews.com/article/kidnapped-american-elliot-onil-eastman-sibuco-southern-philippines-d75607aa99d778f91a3a3ef85581518b	2024-12-04T23:38:37-08:00	
UK leader Starmer will outline his 'Plan for Change.' Just don't call it a relaunch	LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is trying to change the narrative on his five-month-old government after plummeting approval ratings, business anxiety over tax hikes and protesting farmers clogging London streets. Conservative opposition leader Kemi Badenoch calls it an 'emergency reset' by a floundering administration. But Starmer’s office says the 'Plan for Change' speech the prime minister will deliver on Thursday is not a relaunch or about-face, but 'the next phase' in his government plan, intended to persuade voters that the government is making their lives better. Starmer’s center-left Labour Party was elected in Jul — ending 14 years of Conservative government — on a promise to get Britain’s sluggish economy growing and restore frayed public services such as the state-funded National Health Service. But it has been criticized, including by Labour supporters, for failing to show people how their lives will improve any time soon. The speech will set out 'milestones' for measuring progress on economic growth, clean energy, reforming childcare and education, bolstering the NHS and cutting crime. It includes a pledge of 13,000 more neighborhood police officers within five years. Starmer's office said he will say that 'hard-working Brits ... reasonably want a stable economy, their country to be safe, their borders secure, more cash in their pocket, safer streets in their town, opportunities for their children, secure British energy in their home, and an NHS that is there when they need it.' The government hopes to reverse a slew of negative headlines over its economic decisions — taken, it says, because the previous Conservative government left a 22 billion pound ($28 billion) 'black hole' in the public finances. Spending cuts have included removing from millions of retirees a payment that helps cover winter heating costs – a move that sat awkwardly with revelations that Starmer had accepted clothes and other freebies at a time when millions of people are struggling with the cost of living The government’s first budget in late October included billions in new money for the health system, but also hiked a tax paid by employers, to the alarm of many businesses, and imposed inheritance tax on farmers for the first time in decades. Thousands of farmers thronged the streets around Parliament in November to protest a levy they say will ruin many family farms. The government says three-quarters of farms won’t have to pay inheritance tax under the new rules. Starmer also lost a member of his Cabinet last week, when Transport Secretary Louise Haigh resigned over an old fraud conviction involving a cell phone she’d reported stolen. The bad news has sent Starmer’s poll ratings plunging deep into negative territory – though the opposition Conservatives are no more popular. Starmer has had more success abroad, where he is trying to reset Britain’s relations with its European neighbors following years of acrimony over Brexit. But efforts to move closer to the bloc risk angering incoming President Donald Trump, who is hostile to the EU and has threatened to impose tariffs on European goods, Members of Starmer’s government have been strongly critical of Trump in the past, but the Labour government has worked to build ties with the president-elect. Before the U.S. election, Starmer flew to New York for dinner with the then-Republican presidential candidate. 'When President Trump graciously hosted me for dinner in Trump Tower, I told him that we will invest more deeply than ever in this transatlantic bond with our American friends in the years to come,' Starmer said in a foreign-policy speech on Monday. Starmer rejected the idea 'that we must choose between our allies, that somehow we’re with either America or Europe.' 'The national interest demands that we work with both,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/keir-starmer-speech-change-plan-755ebc69711bd31ac9b94293c623e14a	2024-12-04T20:19:37-08:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street quiet after hitting another record, bitcoin surges above $100,000	U.S. markets were quiet early Thursday following another record rally on Wall Street, while bitcoin surged above $100,000 for the first time. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were each down less than 0.1% before the bell. Bitcoin powered above $100,000 late Wednesday, U.S. time, after President-elect Donald Trump chose crypto advocate Paul Atkins as his nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from $69,374 on Nov. 5, Election Day. Early Thursday, it was trading at $102,826, according to CoinDesk. In equities trading early Thursday, discount retailer Five Below jumped more than 14% after the Philadelphia company trounced Wall Street's third-quarter sales and profit forecasts. It's quite the turnaround from July, when Five Below slashed guidance and announced that its CEO and President Joel Anderson had stepped down amid languishing sales. Dollar General, another discount retailer, gained close to 2% in premarket after it topped sales projections but missed on Wall Street’s per-share profit targets. Fashion retailer American Eagle fell 13.7% after it beat profit targets but disappointed investors with tepid guidance and warnings of potentially sluggish sales during non-peak periods lacking a major holiday. Elsewhere, in Europe at midday France's CAC 40 ticked up just 0.1% in early trading after the country's far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined together to vote on a no-confidence motion prompted by budget disputes that will force Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet to resign. Germany's DAX rose 0.3% while Britain's FTSE 100 was unchanged. In Asian trading, South Korea's Kospi fell 0.9% to 2,441.85, extending a 1.4% decline the day before as President Yoon Suk Yeol was facing possible impeachment after he suddenly declared martial law on Tuesday night. He revoked the martial law declaration six hours later. Yoon accepted his defense minister's resignation Thursday as opposition parties moved to impeach them both. The main opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted a joint motion to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over his martial law declaration. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.3% to finish at 39,395.60, while Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.2% to 8,474.90. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.9% to 19,560.44. The Shanghai Composite gained 0.1% to 3,368.86. Taiwan's Taiex gained nearly 0.1%, while the Sensex in India was up 0.9%. This week’s highlight for Wall Street will be Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. government, which will show how many people employers hired and fired last month. Expectations are brewing that the Fed will cut its main interest rate again when it meets in two weeks. The Fed began easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high in September, hoping to offer more support for the job market. The central bank had appeared set to continue cutting rates into next year, but the election of Donald Trump has scrambled Wall Street’s expectations somewhat. Trump’s preference for higher tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, which could alter the Fed’s plans. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 24 cents to $68.78 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also rose 24 cents, to $72.55 a barrel. The OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries will decide Thursday whether to put off plans to pump more crude amid sluggish demand and competing production from non-allied countries -- factors that could keep oil prices stagnant into next year. Key beneficiaries of that would be U.S. motorists, who have seen gasoline prices fall to their lowest in 2 1/2 years to near $3 a gallon. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 150.43 Japanese yen from 150.62 yen. The euro cost $1.0534, inching up from $1.0510.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-fed-rates-bitcoin-88d737ab0669b10c06ab39386ed30a74	2024-12-04T19:20:33-08:00	
South Korea's Yoon replaces defense chief as parliament is poised to vote on his impeachment	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's president accepted the resignation of his defense minister Thursday as opposition parties moved to impeach both men over the stunning yet short-lived imposition of martial law that brought armed troops into Seoul streets. The main opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted a joint motion to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over his martial law declaration the previous night. Martial law lasted about six hours, as the National Assembly quickly voted to overrule the president, forcing his Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Wednesday. On Thursday, Yoon replaced Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun with Choi Byung Hyuk, a retired four-star general who is South Korea’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Yoon's office said. It didn't provide any further comments by Yoon. He hasn't made any public appearances since he announced in a televised address that his government was lifting the martial law declaration. The opposition parties earlier submitted a separate motion to impeach Kim, alleging he recommended Yoon impose martial law. On Wednesday, Kim offered to resign and apologized for causing disruption and concern to the public. Kim said 'all troops who performed duties related to martial law were acting on my instructions, and all responsibility lies with me,' according to the Defense Ministry. The impeachment motion on Yoon was introduced at a parliamentary plenary session early Thursday, meaning it can be put to a vote between Friday and Sunday. By law, the motion will be scrapped if it isn’t voted within 72 hours of its parliamentary introduction. Opposition parties can submit a new impeachment motion if the current one is scrapped or voted down, according to National Assembly officials. Prospects for Yoon’s impeachment isn’t clear as Yoon’s ruling conservative People Power Party decided Thursday to oppose the motion’s passage. Choo Kyung-ho, the floor leader of the PPP, told reporters that his party would hold another meeting to determine how to oppose the motion’s passage. Observers say PPP members could simply boycott a floor vote or cast ballots against the motion. Impeaching him would require support from two-thirds of the single-chamber National Assembly, or 200 of its 300 members. The opposition parties together have 192 seats and they need additional votes from the PPP. Some experts earlier said the motion will likely be passed through parliament as 18 PPP lawmakers, who belong to an anti-Yoon faction in the party, already voted down Yoon’s martial law decree together with opposition lawmakers. But speaking to reporters Thursday, PPP leader Han Dong-hun, head of the anti-Yoon faction, said he would work to ensure that the impeachment motion doesn't pass though he remains critical of Yoon’s action, which he described as 'unconstitutional.' Han said that there is a need to 'prevent damage to citizens and supporters caused by unprepared chaos.' Experts say rival factions in PPP could unite not to repeat their traumatic experiences following the 2016 impeachment of scandal-ridden conservative President Park Geun-hye, which happened after some lawmakers at her own party voted to impeach her. Park was eventually removed from office and arrested in 2017, and the liberals easily won the presidency in a by-election as conservatives remained in disarray. If Yoon is impeached, he will be deprived of his constitutional powers until the Constitutional Court rules. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who holds the No. 2 position in the South Korean government, would take over presidential responsibilities. The impeachment motion on Yoon accuses him of attempting a 'self-coup' by mobilizing the military. It also says Yoon's declaration failed to meet the constitutional requirements that such steps should only be considered in severe crisis situations. The motion also argues that his move to declare a suspension of political party activities and deploy troops in an attempt to seal the National Assembly amounted to rebellion. Yoon’s martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, harkened back to South Korea’s past military-backed governments when authorities occasionally proclaimed martial law and other decrees that allowed them to station soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or at public places such as schools to prevent anti-government demonstrations. Until Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, such scenes of military intervention had not been seen since South Korea achieved a democracy in the late 1980s. After Yoon’s declaration, troops carrying full battle gear, including assault rifles, tried to keep protesters away from the National Assembly as military helicopters flew overhead and landed nearby. It wasn’t clear how the 190 lawmakers were able to enter a parliamentary hall to vote down Yoon’s martial law decree. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung and National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik were seen climbing over walls. As troops and police officers blocked some from entering, they didn’t aggressively restrain or use force against others.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-impeachment-8e1ffc82990d6bdce8d80dffc3815f62	2024-12-04T16:50:27-08:00

An emergency management bureau's statement said the collapse occurred at about 11 p.m. on Wednesday at the construction site of a section of the Shenzhen-Jiangmen Railway in Bao’an district. Residents living nearby have been evacuated. An investigation into the cause was underway. State broadcaster CCTV reported some roads were closed during the operation.	https://apnews.com/article/china-construction-site-collapse-people-missing-5eb4bbf5bcb68e10a58ec27c5e6e5189	2024-12-04T16:50:22-08:00	
Weather hampers a search for 3 American and Canadian climbers missing on New Zealand's highest peak	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand authorities have 'grave concerns' for three mountain climbers from the U.S. and Canada who are missing after a planned ascent of the country’s highest peak, Aoraki, as efforts to find them stalled for a third day amid bad weather. Strong winds meant an aerial search for the men could not resume as anticipated on Thursday, Police Area Commander Inspector Vicki Walker said in a statement. The Americans — Kurt Blair, 56, from Colorado and Carlos Romero, 50, of California — are certified alpine guides, according to the website of the nonprofit American Mountain Guides Association. New Zealand authorities have not named the Canadian climber at the request of his family. The men flew to a hut partway up the mountain on Saturday to begin their ascent and were reported missing on Monday when they did not arrive to meet their prearranged transport after the climb. Searchers hours later found several climbing-related items believed to belong to the men, but no sign of them, police said. The search for the men stalled on Tuesday and Wednesday due to deteriorating weather conditions on Aoraki, also known as Mount Cook, with heavy rain and snow forecast. Walker earlier hoped efforts would resume Thursday but said conditions on the day were unsafe. Aoraki is 3,724 meters (12,218 feet) high and is part of the Southern Alps, the scenic and icy mountain range that runs the length of New Zealand’s South Island. A settlement of the same name at its base is a destination for domestic and foreign tourists. The peak is popular among experienced climbers. Its terrain is technically difficult due to crevasses, avalanche risk, changeable weather and glacier movement. More than 240 deaths have been recorded on the mountain and in the surrounding national park since the start of the 20th century.	https://apnews.com/article/climbers-zealand-aoraki-mountain-cook-blair-romero-8ba5efdf58a090a7aae9f2b877089ba6	2024-12-04T15:35:38-08:00	
Amnesty International says genocide is occurring in Gaza, an accusation Israel rejects	CAIRO (AP) — Amnesty International accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip during its war with Hamas, saying it has sought to deliberately destroy Palestinians by mounting deadly attacks, demolishing vital infrastructure and preventing the delivery of food, medicine and other aid. The human rights group released a report Thursday in the Middle East that said such actions could not be justified by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, which ignited the war, or the presence of militants in civilian areas. Amnesty said the United States and other allies of Israel could be complicit in genocide, and called on them to halt arms shipments. 'Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now,' Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said in the report. Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has adamantly rejected genocide allegations against it as an antisemitic 'blood libel.' It is challenging such allegations at the International Court of Justice, and it has rejected the International Criminal Court's accusations that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister committed war crimes in Gaza. 'The deplorable and fanatical organization Amnesty International has once again produced a fabricated report that is entirely false and based on lies,' Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Israel accused Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate Israel, of carrying out a genocidal massacre in the attack that triggered the war, and said it is defending itself in accordance with international law. Amnesty says Palestinians face a ‘slow, calculated death’ Amnesty's report adds an influential voice to a growing list of players that have accused Israel of committing genocide — which would put it in the company of some of the deadliest conflicts of the past 80 years, including Cambodia, Sudan and Rwanda. The accusations have largely come from human rights groups and allies of the Palestinians. But last month, Pope Francis called for an investigation to determine if Israeli actions amounted to genocide, and Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who has signaled readiness to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, accused it of committing genocide. Israel says it is at war with Hamas, not the people of Gaza. And key allies, including the U.S. and Germany, have also pushed back against the genocide allegations. But Amnesty accused Israel of violating the 1951 Genocide Convention through acts it says are intended to bring about the physical destruction of Gaza's Palestinian population by exposing them to 'a slow, calculated death.' Amnesty said it analyzed the overall pattern of Israel’s conduct in Gaza between Oct. 7, 2023 and early July. It noted that there is no casualty threshold in proving the international crime of genocide, which is defined by the United Nations as acts intended to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. To establish intent, Amnesty said it reviewed over 100 statements by Israeli government and military officials and others since the start of the war that 'dehumanized Palestinians, called for or justified genocidal acts or other crimes against them.' Israeli officials have previously said that such statements were taken out of context or referred to their stated goal of destroying Hamas, not Palestinian civilians. Israel says it goes to great lengths to protect civilians and comply with international law -- including ordering civilians to evacuate areas ahead of airstrikes and ground offensives. It also says it has facilitated the deliveries of large quantities of food and humanitarian supplies -- a claim that is disputed by the U.N. and aid organizations working inside Gaza. On Sunday, a former top Israeli general and defense minister accused the government of ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza, where the army has sealed off the towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and the Jabaliya refugee camp and allowed almost no humanitarian aid to enter. Amnesty said it found that Israel 'deliberately inflicted conditions of life on Palestinians in Gaza intended to lead, over time, to their destruction.' Those actions included the destruction of homes, farms, hospitals and water facilities; mass evacuation orders; and the restriction of humanitarian aid and other essential services. It also analyzed 15 airstrikes from the start of the war until April that killed at least 334 civilians, including 141 children, and wounded hundreds of other people. It said it found no evidence that any of the strikes were directed at military objectives. It said one of the strikes destroyed the Abdelal family home in the southern city of Rafah on April 20, killing three generations of Palestinians, including 16 children, while they were sleeping. An Associated Press investigation identified at least 60 families in which at least 25 members had been killed. Amnesty has previously angered Israel by joining other major rights groups in accusing it of the international crime of apartheid, saying that for decades it has systematically denied Palestinians basic rights in the territories under its control. Israel has also denied those allegations. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas, lack of aid on UN Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants fight in dense, residential areas and have built tunnels and other militant infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques. It blames the lack of humanitarian aid on United Nations agencies, accusing them of not delivering hundreds of truckloads of aid that have been allowed in. The U.N. says it is often too dangerous to retrieve and deliver the aid. It blames Israel as the occupying power for the breakdown of law and order — which has enabled armed groups to steal aid convoys — while also accusing it of heavily restricting movement within the territory. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage, including children and older adults. Some 100 captives are still held inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has killed more than 44,500 people, according to Gaza health officials, whose count doesn’t distinguish between civilians and fighters, though they say more than half the dead are women and children. The offensive is among the deadliest and most destructive since World War II, and has destroyed vast areas of the besieged coastal territory. It has displaced some 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people have crammed into squalid tent camps with little in the way of food, water or toilets. Aid groups say the population is at risk of disease and malnutrition, especially as winter sets in. Experts have warned of famine in northern Gaza, which Israel has almost completely sealed off since launching a major military operation there in early October. Hamas militants have repeatedly regrouped there and in other areas, and the group has faced no major internal challenge to its rule. Amnesty says the US needs to press for an end to the war The United States, which has provided crucial military aid to Israel and shielded it from international criticism, has repeatedly appealed to Israel to facilitate more aid, with limited results. The Biden administration said in May that Israel’s use of U.S.-provided weapons in Gaza at times likely violated international humanitarian law but that the evidence was incomplete. Callamard urged the United States, Germany and other countries supplying arms to Israel to pressure Netanyahu to end the war. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-rights-amnesty-genocide-19aa8fb76f7271942e73d5d7a42434e0	2024-12-04T15:03:00-08:00	
Japan's famous sake joins UNESCO's cultural heritage list, a boost to brewers and enthusiasts	LUQUE, Paraguay (AP) — Sake is perhaps more Japanese than the world-famous sushi. It's brewed in centuries-old mountaintop warehouses, savored in the country’s pub-like izakayas, poured during weddings and served slightly chilled for special toasts. The smooth rice wine that plays a crucial role in Japan's culinary traditions was enshrined on Wednesday by UNESCO on its list of the 'intangible cultural heritage of humanity.' At a meeting in Luque, Paraguay, members of UNESCO’s committee for safeguarding humanity's cultural heritage voted to recognize 45 cultural practices and products around the world, including Brazilian white cheese, Caribbean cassava bread and Palestinian olive oil soap. Unlike UNESCO’s World Heritage List, which includes sites considered important to humanity like the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, the Intangible Cultural Heritage designation names products and practices of different cultures that are deserving of recognition. A Japanese delegation welcomed the announcement in Luque. 'Sake is considered a divine gift and is essential for social and cultural events in Japan,' Kano Takehiro, the Japanese ambassador to UNESCO, told The Associated Press. The basic ingredients of sake are few: rice, water, yeast and koji, a rice mold, which breaks down the starches into fermentable sugars like malting does in beer production. The whole two-monthlong process of steaming, stirring, fermenting and pressing can be grueling. The rice — which wields tremendous marketing power as part of Japan's broader cultural identity — is key to the alcoholic brew. For a product to be categorized Japanese sake, the rice must be Japanese. The UNESCO recognition, the delegation said, captured more than the craft knowledge of making high-quality sake. It also honored a tradition dating back some 1,000 years — sake makes a cameo in Japan’s famous 11th century novel, 'The Tale of Genji,' as the drink of choice in the refined Heian court. Now, officials hope to restore sake's image as Japan's premier alcoholic drink even as the younger drinkers in the country switch to imported wine or domestic beer and whiskey. 'It means a lot to Japan and to the Japanese,' Takehiro said of the UNESCO designation. 'This will help to renew interest in traditional sake elaboration.' Also, Japanese breweries have expressed hope that the listing could give a little lift to the country's export economy as the popularity of sake booms around the world and in the United States amid heightened interest in Japanese cuisine. Sake exports, mostly to the U.S. and China, now rake in over $265 million a year, according to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association, a trade group. Japan's delegation appeared ready to celebrate on Wednesday — in classic Japanese style. After the announcement, Takehiro raised a cypress box full of sake to toast the alcoholic brew and cultural rite.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-sake-unesco-world-heritage-intangible-cultural-ffb84ba291342e62bf0e588729538351	2024-12-04T13:24:02-08:00	
Canadian police say stabbing suspect shot dead by police in Vancouver	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — A stabbing suspect is dead after being shot by police in a convenience store in the Canadian city of Vancouver, police said. Vancouver police said the suspect died in hospital Wednesday after being shot and two people suffered injuries that are not thought to be life threatening. Vancouver Police Constable Tania Visintin said one person was stabbed in the hand and another person has facial injuries, but she didn't how how the second person was injured. Witnesses say a man stole liquor and a knife from a restaurant then used the weapon across the street to stab people in a 7-Eleven store. 'One of the kitchen guys came out, asked if he could help him, and the guy grabbed the knife and asked him if he wanted to die,' said Kylie Noel, who was working at the Original Joe’s restaurant at Robson and Hamilton streets in downtown Vancouver on Wednesday. Her co-worker then told her to call police. Video later captured by Mainul Islam, a student and part-time food delivery worker, shows police pointing their guns over the counter of the 7-Eleven, shouting at someone to 'move over,' then firing at least 10 times. Islam said he had been picking up a food order when he saw a 'homeless guy' trying to steal cigarettes behind the counter. He said staff were trying to stop the man. 'And he just brought out his knife from his pocket, and he tried to stab … the guy, but he ran away, and then he went to stab that lady. Maybe he already stabbed that lady in the back, I saw blood, but she was OK.' He said the police were there within minutes and 'just shot this guy.' Noel said that before the shooting, a man came into Original Joe’s and stood by the restaurant’s door, opened a laptop computer and 'demanded a glass of water.' Noel said she refused, and went back to tell kitchen staff that the man was refusing to leave. She said he had left by the time other workers came out, but Noel then saw him outside with a bottle of alcohol she believed was stolen from the restaurant, which she later confirmed by watching security camera footage. When Noel returned to the restaurant’s main floor, the man was again behind the bar, and Noel ran back down to tell her colleagues in the kitchen. She said that was when the man grabbed the knife and threatened Noel’s co-worker. In Islam’s video of the shooting, a stun gun held by an officer appears to have already been fired, with the wires trailing over the counter inside the convenience store. 'Move over, right now. Move over,' one officer shouts at the unseen suspect before gunfire is heard..	https://apnews.com/article/vancouver-stabbing-suspect-shot-b6b40aac2c186e58a7ccf6197fd504b2	2024-12-04T12:06:22-08:00	
Israeli strikes on a Gaza tent camp kill at least 21 people, hospital says	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes tore through a tent camp for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza on Wednesday, sparking fires and killing at least 21 people, according to the head of a nearby hospital, in the latest assault on a sprawling tent city that Israel designated a humanitarian safe zone but has repeatedly targeted. The Israeli military said it struck senior Hamas militants 'involved in terrorist activities' in the area, without providing additional details, and said it took precautions to minimize harm to civilians. The strike on the Muwasi tent camp was one of several deadly assaults across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday. An Israeli attack in central Gaza killed at least 10 more people, including four children, according to Palestinian medics. Israel’s devastating war in Gaza, launched after Hamas’ October 2023 attack, shows no signs of ending after nearly 14 months. Hamas is still holding dozens of Israeli hostages, and most of Gaza’s population has been displaced and is reliant on international food aid to survive. Israel is also pressing a major offensive in the isolated north, where experts say Palestinians might be experiencing famine. The Biden administration has pledged to make a new push for a Gaza ceasefire now that there's a truce in Lebanon between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah, ending more than a year of cross-border fighting. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump demanded this week the release of hostages held by Hamas before he is sworn into office in January. Wednesday's strike in Muwasi — a desolate area with few public services that holds hundreds of thousands of displaced people — wounded at least 28 people, according to Atif al-Hout, the director of Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. An Associated Press journalist at the hospital counted at least 15 bodies, but said reaching a precise number was difficult because many of the dead were dismembered, some without heads or badly burned. In the morgue, an infant's blackened hand and face peeked out from beneath a heavy blanket used to transport bodies to the hospital. 'It was like doomsday,' said a wounded woman, Iman Jumaa, who held back tears as she described how the strike killed her father, her brothers and her brothers' children. Videos and photos of the strike shared widely on social media showed flames and a column of black smoke rising into the night sky, as well as twisted metal tent frames and shredded fabric. Palestinian men searched through the still-burning wreckage, shouting, 'Over here guys!' Further away, civilians stood at a distance, observing the destruction. The military said the strikes had set off secondary blasts, indicating explosives present in the area had detonated. It was not possible to independently confirm the Israeli claims, and the strikes could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp. Shortly after the strike, Al-Awda Hospital said two people had been killed and 38 wounded in an attack on a residential block in the Nuseirat refugee camp. The military had no immediate comment on the strike, but said earlier strikes in central Gaza had hit 'terrorist targets.' Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths, saying the militants often operate in residential areas and are known to position tunnels, rocket launchers and other infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques. Previous Israeli strikes on tent camps in Gaza have drawn widespread international outrage, such as when a wounded student’s last moments were caught on video as he burned to death in a tent outside a hospital. In northern Gaza, dozens of Palestinian families said Israel's expanding offensive had forcibly displaced them from schools-turned-shelters. Associated Press footage showed people on the road Wednesday leaving Beit Lahia, many crowded onto donkey carts with their belongings in their arms. Others walked on foot. 'This morning a quadcopter (drone) detonated four bombs at the school. There were people injured, human remains — we left with nothing,' said Sadeia al-Rahel. The 57-year-old said her family has been eating grass, leaves, and animal feed for two months due to the lack of food aid in the north. The amount of aid entering Gaza plunged in October, and hunger is widespread across the territory, even in central Gaza where aid groups have more access. Humanitarian organizations say Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order make it difficult to deliver assistance. Israel has said it is working to increase the flow of aid. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and around 250 people were abducted. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. On Wednesday, Israel said its forces recovered the body of a hostage who was captured alive during the Oct. 7 attack. Israel believes Itay Svirsky was killed by his captors. The families of hostages held in Gaza have grown increasingly concerned that their loved ones are at risk so long as the war continues. Israel’s military released on Wednesday the findings of a probe into the circumstances behind the deaths of six hostages whose bodies were recovered in August, determining they were probably shot by their captors after a nearby Israeli strike in February. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.

A major power plant fails in Cuba, plunging the island into darkness — again	HAVANA (AP) — A new, widespread power outage plunged Cuba into darkness on Wednesday after one of the island’s major power plants failed, leaving millions without electricity and forcing authorities to suspend classes and work activities indefinitely. The Electric Union, the state-run power company, attributed the incident to the shutdown of the Antonio Guiteras Thermoelectric Plant in Matanzas province, east of Havana. The blackout, which occurred shortly after 2 a.m., affected the entire nation, the company said on X. As of Wednesday morning, power began to be restored gradually in some parts of the country, including Havana. Cuba’s Minister of Energy and Mines Vicente de la O said later in a televised address that service would be fully restored by Thursday. On Oct. 18, the island suffered a significant blackout that, added to the passage of Hurricane Oscar two days later, left the island without electricity for several days. Weeks later, Hurricane Rafael’s strong winds triggered another system-wide blackout that left the national energy system disconnected again. Cuba’s power grid has been plagued by frequent outages in recent months, with more than half of the country experiencing power cuts during peak hours. The outages are primarily caused by fuel shortages and aging infrastructure. In many parts of the island, electricity is crucial for cooking and water pumping. The blackouts — caused in part by failures in old thermoelectric plants — are devastating, impacting families, schools and businesses. Cuba gets its power from large thermoelectric plants like Antonio Guiteras and some smaller ones, which run on crude oil. While the island produces about half of its own crude oil, it must import the remainder, which can be difficult — and costly — due to U.S. sanctions. It has historically relied on allies like Venezuela and Russia for cheaper fuel supplies. Cuba has been working on a project to upgrade the island’s electrical grid through the use of alternative power sources. The construction of 31 centers to generate solar energy is under way and expected to be completed next year. Cuba's economic crisis has worsened in recent years, leading to food and fuel shortages, mounting inflation and a loss of purchasing power —and forcing thousands to flee, mainly to the U.S. but also Spain and other Latin American countries. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-blackout-energy-power-outage-3ac7b25f25bc2dfd8cedeac7ba60e877	2024-12-04T08:17:27-08:00	
Austrian court rules that Ukrainian businessman Firtash can't be extradited to the US	VIENNA (AP) — An Austrian court has ruled that Ukrainian businessman Dymitro Firtash can't be extradited to the U.S. in a long-running legal saga that centers on a corruption case related to an alleged plan to pay bribes in India. The Vienna State Court said Tuesday evening it decided on Nov. 7 that extradition isn't permissible, the Austria Press Agency reported. Vienna prosecutors said they would appeal the decision, and have until Dec. 16 to do so. Firtash faces a U.S. indictment accusing him of a conspiracy to pay bribes in India to mine titanium, which is used in jet engines. He denies any wrongdoing. In 2019, a Chicago federal judge rejected a motion to dismiss the indictment against Firtash, who has argued that the U.S. has no jurisdiction over crimes in India. However, the judge ruled that it does, because any scheme would have impacted a Chicago-based company. American aviation company Boeing, based in Chicago, has said it considered business with Firtash but never followed through. It is not accused of any wrongdoing. He was arrested in Austria in 2014 and then freed on 125 million euros ($131 million) bail, kicking off the ongoing legal saga. A Vienna court initially ruled against extradition on the grounds that the indictment was politically motivated. A higher court in February 2017 rejected that reasoning as 'insufficiently substantiated' and ruled that Firtash could be extradited. Austria’s Supreme Court of Justice upheld that ruling in 2019. The country’s justice minister at the time approved the extradition, but a Vienna court judge ruled it could only take place after a decision on a defense call to reopen the case. The Vienna state court ruled against reopening the case in March 2022, but a higher court last year decided to allow the reopening of extradition proceedings, pointing to new evidence.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-dymitro-firtash-court-extradition-chicago-4cd7c4ef23b8ef04a85953ca47b91906	2024-12-04T08:05:01-08:00	
South Korean President Yoon's martial law declaration raises questions over his political future	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — President Yoon Suk Yeol’s stunning martial law declaration lasted just hours, but experts say it raised serious questions about his ability to govern for the remaining 2 1/2 years of his term and whether he will abide by democratic principles. The opposition-controlled parliament overturned the edict, and his rivals on Wednesday took steps to impeach him. One analyst called his action 'political suicide.' Yoon’s political fate may depend on whether a large number of people in coming days take to the streets to push for his ouster. Here's a look at the political firestorm caused by the martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years. Why did Yoon impose martial law? Yoon's declaration of emergency martial law on Tuesday night was accompanied by a pledge to eliminate 'shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces at a single stroke.' He vowed to protect the country from 'falling into the depths of national ruin.' Yoon, a conservative, cited repeated attempts by his liberal rivals in control of parliament to impeach his top officials and curtail key parts of his budget bill for next year. South Korea’s constitution allows a president to impose military rule during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states.' But a president can't maintain martial law if parliament opposes it with a majority vote. That's what happened Wednesday. And it's why Yoon's move has baffled many experts. Yoon’s political fighting with the main opposition Democratic Party is not seen as an emergency requiring military intervention. Experts question why Yoon pushed ahead with the declaration even though the parliament would certainly vote it down. 'Conservatives and even moderates would agree with Yoon’s criticism and his assessment of progressive lawmakers, but his choice of methods in the 21st century is being seen as the wrong move, miscalculation, and even political suicide,' said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. Yoon’s decree resulted in the military deploying troops with assault rifles and police officers to the National Assembly to block its entrance. Even so, 190 of the parliament’s 300 members managed to enter and later vote down Yoon’s martial law edict early Wednesday. Yoon then lifted martial law without any resistance. The sequence of events suggests that his declaration wasn’t carefully or thoroughly planned. 'His advisers should have tried to dissuade him not to do it, and they likely did so. But I think that didn’t work, and Yoon just pressed ahead with his plan,' said Hong Sung Gul, a public administration professor at Seoul’s Kookmin University. 'That shows he isn't capable of governing this country.' What political fate awaits Yoon? The Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, demanded Wednesday that Yoon resign. Together with small opposition parties, it submitted a joint motion on Yoon's impeachment and said they aim for a floor vote as early as Friday. Yoon didn’t comment on the impeachment bid, but he put off his official schedule Wednesday morning. He hasn’t made public appearances since earlier Wednesday, when he announced he was lifting martial law. The opposition parties together hold 192 seats, eight short of the two-thirds needed to impeach Yoon. But Yoon could face trouble from his own camp as 18 legislators from the ruling People Power Party voted to reject his martial law decree. PPP leader Han Dong-hun called his declaration 'unconstitutional.' 'Both his own ruling party and the opposition party want to hold him accountable. For the first time, in a highly polarized country, both sides of the aisle agree that Yoon’s choice in declaring martial law was the wrong move,' Duyeon Kim, the analyst, said. 'It sounds like his own party is opposed to impeachment but still deliberating whether to ask Yoon to leave the party.' South Korean conservatives harbor traumatic memories of the 2016 impeachment of then-President Park Geun-hye, followed by her ouster and arrest the following year. Yoon’s martial law declaration may have killed his chances of fully completing his term through May 2027, said Park Sung-min, head of Seoul-based MIN Consulting, a political consulting firm. His early exit would brighten the presidential prospects for Democratic Party chief Lee Jae-myung, who faces corruption and other court trials that have threatened to derail his career. Surveys show Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, is the favorite to become the next president. If Yoon is impeached, the Constitutional Court would rule on whether to remove him from office. How does the martial law decree affect foreign policy and the economy? The South Korean developments may be troubling for Washington and Tokyo as they try to expand their three-way security cooperation. 'In these crucial times, especially with Donald Trump returning to office and the variety of difficult geopolitical challenges facing the region at the moment, political instability in South Korea is something that neither the United States nor Japan would want,' said Park Won Gon, a professor at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University in Seoul. The White House said the U.S. was 'seriously concerned' by the events in Seoul. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said President Joe Biden’s administration was not notified in advance of the martial law announcement. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said that Tokyo is watching the development with 'exceptional and serious interest.' North Korea hasn't commented. Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University, said that North Korea will probably take a wait-and-see approach. The political instability unleashed by Yoon could also make it more difficult for his government to nurse a decaying economy. South Korea’s currency, the won, dipped to a two-year low against the U.S. dollar but had recovered by early Wednesday, while the benchmark Kospi stock index was trading 1.8% lower. 'There’s a growing sentiment that the president himself has become the greatest risk to the Republic of Korea and that things cannot continue as they are,' Park said. ___ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-impeachment-f9f865c60ef95e57bdd39f2a384a0dc9	2024-12-04T07:09:05-08:00	
Police in Georgia arrest an opposition leader as mass protests continue	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgian police on Wednesday raided the offices of an opposition party and arrested its leader in an apparent attempt to squelch a wave of mass protests triggered by the governing party’s decision to suspend negotiations on joining the European Union. During the past six nights, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital’s central boulevard. More than 300 protesters have been detained since Thursday and over 100 people have been treated for injuries. On Wednesday, the Coalition for Change opposition party said that police raided its offices and detained its leader, Nika Gvaramia. It shared a video showing several officers dragging Gvaramia into a car. Georgian media reported that police also raided the offices of several other opposition groups and non-government organizations. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of the Georgian Dream party said the raids targeted those who encouraged violence during protests in an attempt to topple his government. 'I wouldn’t call this repression; it is more of a preventive measure than repression,' he said. The ruling Georgian Dream retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia’s help and boycotted parliament sessions. Mass opposition protests sparked by the vote gained new momentum after the governing party’s decision on Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili refused to recognize the official election results and contested them in the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal on Tuesday. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to lead the opposition demand for a new parliamentary election. Zourabichvili urged the country's Western partners to respond to Wednesday's wave of police raids of opposition groups by putting 'strong pressure on a ruling party that is driving the country over the cliff!' 'Do not be late!' she wrote on social platform X. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc’s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. It requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The Georgian government’s announcement of the EU accession talks’ suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October’s election as neither free nor fair. On Monday, the EU reiterated its 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country.' Kobakhidze said Tuesday that his government is willing to open EU accession talks if the bloc ends its 'blackmail.'	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-protest-opposition-election-russia-eu-43081aa9c939805ccb1c346c23535157	2024-12-04T06:20:39-08:00	
Controversial presidential front-runner Calin Georgescu wants Romania to be 'self-sufficient power'	IZVORANI, Romania (AP) — Sitting at his desk in an isolated compound north of Bucharest, presidential front-runner and far-right populist Calin Georgescu says Romania’s Western alliances remain secure providing they 'serve the sovereignty of the country and nothing else.' Georgescu unexpectedly topped the polls in the first round of the Romanian presidential vote on Nov. 24, despite being a huge outsider, plunging the European Union and NATO country into unprecedented turmoil. On Sunday, he will face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a final vote. 'I am interested in us being a sovereign and self-sufficient power,' the 62-year-old independent candidate told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 'Freedom and independence come from the ability to finance yourself, not from being financed by others.' His vision for his country’s future lies in a series of Romania-first policies in a push to become self-reliant in areas such as energy, food, and water. Other key issues he wants to address if he wins the presidency, he said, span tackling high poverty rates, organized crime, and drug use in schools. 'Our children are dying from drug use,' he said. 'It’s unimaginable.' Georgescu is also a self-professed Donald Trump supporter and says the incoming U.S. president 'knows what he wants, he loves his people, he put America first, just like I put Romania first ... we have the same ideology.' His success has left Western allies on edge. In the past, Georgescu — who declared zero campaign spending — praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as 'a man who loves his country' and called Ukraine 'an invented state.' Still, he claims not to be pro-Russian. He has also courted controversy for describing Romanian fascist and nationalist leaders from the 1930s and 1940s as national heroes. He denies having any connection to extremist organizations and says the quotes were miss represented. 'I am only for God and my country,' he said. 'Period.' Once a member of Romania’s far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, Georgescu left the party in 2022 after being accused by colleagues of being Russia-friendly and critical of NATO. Romania has played a key role in the U.S.-led military alliance since Russia fully invaded neighboring Ukraine nearly three years ago. Observers wonder how a Georgescu presidency could affect NATO unity. 'NATO is a defensive organization, but as long as it remains defensive, everything is fine,' the presidential hopeful said. 'We will evaluate and see what is to Romania’s advantage … Everything, no matter what, must benefit the Romanian people,' referring to two NATO bases in Romania. On the war in Ukraine, 'it’s a very difficult and grave situation,' he said. 'And my main position is a strategy of peace. Peace with everyone, regardless of who they are.' But Lasconi, his opponent in Sunday’s runoff, has cast Georgescu as a threat to democracy and national security who is not fit for high office. 'Let us be very clear, Calin Georgescu is an open admirer of Vladimir Putin. He is openly against NATO and the European Union,' she said a day after the first vote. 'He is for Romania’s isolation, which he calls neutrality.' She also added that 'without NATO we are at the mercy of Russia.' His past controversial remarks are wide-ranging and often veer in conspiracy, like his questioning of vaccine safety or calling climate change a 'business scam,' or that 'feminism is an absolute mess.' Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania’s environment ministry in the 1990s. Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the United Nations Environment Program. But he remained a little-known entity until just weeks ago. Many observers attributed his success to his TikTok account, which now has 5.8 million likes and 531,000 followers. But some experts suspect Georgescu’s online following was artificially inflated while Romania’s top security body alleged he was given preferential treatment by TikTok over other candidates. Asked whether he believes the Chinese-owned platform TikTok can pose a threat to democracy, he said: 'The most important existing function for promoting free speech and freedom of expression is social media.' In his downtime, he says he enjoys listening to classical composers, such as 19th-century composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is a big fan of the Irish singer Enya. He holds black belts in judo and karate and said he would make sports investment a top priority 'because otherwise, you can’t have a healthy nation.' Romania’s political class, he said, has 'constantly shown an inferiority complex' toward the West and vowed to change the dynamic. 'Everything I do and will do will be from a negotiation standpoint, in the sense that Romania will stand tall and not on its knees,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/romania-georgescu-interview-presidential-election-5a6bcb9c5eb2f33a831939ab48dcbca9	2024-12-04T06:20:36-08:00	
Pakistani troops kill 5 insurgents in a raid on their hideout in restive northwest	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani security forces acting on intelligence raided a militant hideout in restive northwest Pakistan on Wednesday, resulting in a shootout in which five insurgents were killed and two others were wounded, the military said. It issued a statement stating that the raid occurred in Lakki Marwat, a district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The military gave no further details about the slain or injured insurgents. However, previously most such raids were conducted against the Pakistani Taliban, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, who often target security forces. The TTP is outlawed in Pakistan and is a close ally of the Afghan Taliban who control neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan in recent months has witnessed a surge in militant violence, mostly blamed on TTP and other militant groups.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-security-raid-militants-killed-northwest-3de03a47fb1bcfc29cf67830debd2fa0	2024-12-04T06:15:00-08:00	
The end of an Eras tour approaches, marking a bittersweet moment for Taylor Swift fans	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — After more than 150 shows across five continents over nearly two years, the global phenomenon that is Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour is coming to an end. There is no simple way to encapsulate the effects of Swift’s decision to put on a 3 ½-hour concert, showcasing 44 songs representing 10 different 'eras' of her career — a feat she kicked off in March 2023 and will end Sunday in Vancouver, Canada. The tour shattered sales and attendance records and created such an economic boom that even the Federal Reserve took note. But for many who attended the concerts, and the millions more who eagerly watched fan-broadcasted livestreams on their screens, the tour also became a beacon of joy — a chance not only to appreciate Swift's expansive music career, but also celebrate the yearslong journey fans have taken with her. Savoring the time remaining 'Right now we have this special designated time to be together, talk about the show and hang out,' said Tess Bohne, a stay-at-home mom of three turned content creator dedicated to livestreaming Swift’s concerts — by attending herself or coordinating with others to highlight their streams. 'For some, it’s their therapy.' Bohne, who has earned the title among the Swiftie community as the 'livestream queen,' says she often interacts with fans hosting parties to watch an Eras concert live at home with their closest friends. People have also made lasting friendships as they geek out together watching the show from afar. Swift has long been known for leaving Easter eggs for her fans to pinpoint and decipher, a quirk that quickly took on a life of its own during the tour as eagle-eyed devotees began analyzing the possible meaning of her outfits, surprise songs and subtle lyric swaps. The buzz has been so large that multiple mobile apps were launched so fans could guess and track all the various changes. There’s even a game that gives out prizes for correctly predicting various particulars of a show, including what color guitar Swift uses while playing 'Lover.' 'Imagine your favorite sports team,' Bohne said. 'They’re still a team, but they’re not going to play any games for the foreseeable future. That’s going to leave a hole for some folks.' Swift herself appeared to struggle that the end was near while performing at her 100th Eras show in June at Liverpool. 'This is the very first time I’ve ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is gonna end in December,' she said, stressing that 'this tour has really become my entire life.' Late last month, in Toronto, she briefly broke down at the thought of the tour's impending end. A record-breaking tour in retrospective Swift kicked off the Eras tour in Glendale, Arizona, the first of many sold-out stadiums as the tour progressed first in the U.S. and later into South America, Asia, the United Kingdom and Canada. By the end of 2023, it had become the first tour to ever gross over $1 billion and saw hundreds of millions of dollars spent on merchandise. She is likely to bring in over $2 billion by the time the tour wraps on Dec. 8, according to concert trade publication Pollstar. Throughout the tour, Swift was named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year. Apple Music named her its artist of the year and Spotify revealed she was 2023’s most streamed artist globally. She dropped a box office-topping concert film and helped send NFL viewership skyrocketing when she began dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Toward the end of the tour, she released a coffee table book. And if that wasn’t enough, she released re-recordings of her Nashville-era 2010 record, 'Speak Now ' and 2014's record '1989,' as well as released her 11th studio album, 'The Tortured Poets Department.' 'I think it’s perfect in these times to have somebody like Taylor to kind of give us distraction, give us inspiration, give us hope,' said Ralph Jaccodine, an assistant professor at Berklee College of Music and a former concert promoter who has worked with Bruce Springsteen and others. 'And this is a woman that owning it, she’s come a long way. And now she can talk about artist rights and women’s rights and equality. And really, just her work ethic is relentless.' Even the word 'era' has become ubiquitous, with fans and casual observers using the term to explain both frivolous and transformative phases — are you in your 'villain era' or a 'healing era'? 'I think this tour really solidified her position as a legend,' said Kayla Wong, an influencer who runs the popular Swift-focused Instagram account @headfirstfearless. 'Whether or not you like her music, whether or not you think she’s talented, the numbers really speak for themselves. The tour broke so many records and was such a global phenomenon for so long that I think she’s achieved a level where it’s undeniable as to how everlasting her impact is.' Yet the tour did experience its own dark moments. In Brazil last year, one concertgoer — 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides — passed out and later died of heat exhaustion. In July, British police charged a 17-year-old with murder over a stabbing attack during a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance and yoga class that left three little girls dead. News outlets reported that Swift met with some of the survivors backstage in London. And in August, all three of Swift's concerts in Vienna were called off after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the city. Tens of thousands of Swifties from around the world had traveled to Vienna for the shows. 'Having our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,' Swift later wrote in a statement. 'The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.' Swifties stronger than ever Through the hardships and celebrations, Swift's connections to her fans has only ballooned and deepened throughout the tour. After the Vienna cancellations, many fans flocked to the streets to sing Swift's songs and placed friendship bracelets — which also became an iconic feature of the shows — on a nearby tree. Over the past two years, the fandom has welcomed new audiences — both old and new. 'I feel like years ago, we were kind of all the same age and fans for the same reason,' Wong said of Swifties. 'Now the fandom has people from all kinds of backgrounds, all ages, all different reasons for following her in the first place.'	https://apnews.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-end-06a41d7c717486f2c0e99a7304789912	2024-12-04T06:01:15-08:00	
Mexico raises its still-low minimum wage by 12%, but it marks no increase in dollar terms	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico announced Wednesday that it will increase its still strikingly low daily minimum wage by 12% next year. But because the Mexican peso has dropped by 18% in value over the last year, the increase actually marks a slight drop in constant dollar terms. The three-party minimum wage commission, made up of government, labor and business representatives, announced the increase Wednesday. It will take effect starting Jan. 1 2025. The new daily minimum wage will be about 279 pesos, or about $13.75. The 2024 wage of 249 pesos per day was worth $14.25 when it was announced in December 2023, but in that time the peso has dropped in value against the U.S. dollar, from 17.20 then to around 20.30 now. Domestic inflation in Mexico is currently running around 4.75%, so Wednesday's announcement could work out to a real-term increase of about 7%, unless inflation heats up. That is still only about $1.71 per hour, compared to a U.S. federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. However, many U.S. states have minimum wage rates that range from $10 to $16 per hour. Because living costs are higher along Mexico's northern border with the United States, the official minimum wage is higher there. For 2025, it will be set at around 420 pesos, or $20.70 per day.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-minimum-wage-increase-economy-devaluation-56ec73f2f9e20005e27f584d14fc9e37	2024-12-04T05:34:39-08:00	
NATO chief urges European allies to ramp up defense spending as Trump returns to White House	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte led a fresh push Wednesday for European countries to ramp up defense spending, a budget shortfall that President-elect Donald Trump used to berate U.S. allies during his first term in office, severely damaging trust. After Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula a decade ago, NATO leaders agreed to halt the defense cuts that began when the Cold War ended and move toward spending 2% of GDP on their military budgets. Since Russia launched its full-fledged invasion almost three years ago, the leaders have agreed that the 2% target should be the floor rather than the ceiling for defense spending. On average, U.S. allies combined meet that figure, but around a third of the members still do not individually. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, threatened not to defend 'delinquent' countries. NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any member must be considered an attack on them all. Trump’s remarks undermined confidence that the U.S. could be counted on in a crisis. 'If you want to keep the deterrence at the present level, 2% is not enough,' Rutte told reporters after chairing a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. 'We can now defend ourselves and nobody should try to attack us. But I want that to stay the same in 4 or 5 years.' In July, U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts endorsed the biggest shakeup of the way the military alliance would respond to any attack on its territory by Russia since the Cold War. It was meant to deter Moscow from targeting any of the 32 allies. Under highly secret new plans, NATO intends to have up to 300,000 troops ready to move to its eastern flank within 30 days. The plans lay out which allies would respond to an attack anywhere from the Arctic and Baltic Sea region through the Atlantic and east to the Black Sea. But senior NATO officials concede that countries might have to spend up to 3% of GDP to execute the security blueprint successfully. A new spending target is likely to be announced next year. Rutte also said NATO might set specific targets for member countries to fill military equipment gaps. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy insisted that 'the time to act is now.' 'We’re living in very dangerous times,' he said, singling out Russia and its role in conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, on top of its war on Ukraine. 'We urge all allies across the NATO family to get serious about defense spending.' On his last visit to Brussels for a NATO meeting, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that 'this is a time for every ally to lean in, not lean back.' The United States is by far the organization's most powerful member country. 'A stronger NATO means more capabilities to deter aggression, more effective allies to meet more complex challenges, and the peace and stability that allows our people to pursue fuller lives,' Blinken said. Rutte also underlined the importance of expanding Europe’s defense industry, with incentives to drive companies to set up more production lines and hire more workers to staff them, as Western support for Ukraine drains armament stocks. 'We are producing not enough at too high prices, and the delivery is too slow,' he said. 'We cannot have a situation where we just pay more for the same, and we see large kickbacks to the shareholders.' Rutte urged the allies 'to work closely together to make sure that we produce at a much higher rate and acceptable prices.' He noted 'a number of countries who are now buying South Korean (equipment) because our own defense companies are not producing at a rate we need.'	https://apnews.com/article/nato-defense-spending-trump-military-budgets-3cf6e8da6da08cbf84686d0b5f518f5a	2024-12-04T05:05:50-08:00	
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi gets 3-week reprieve from prison in Iran after surgery	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi was released temporarily from prison Wednesday after undergoing a complex surgery in Iran that saw part of a bone in her right leg removed over cancer fears, her supporters said. Video footage from Iran's capital, Tehran, showed Mohammadi taken out of the back of an ambulance, her black hair fanned out without the required hijab, or headscarf, covering it as she called out into the street. Her right leg was covered in a fabric cast. 'Hello freedom!' she shouted. 'Women, life, freedom! Freedom is our right! Long live freedom!' A campaign on Mohammadi's behalf said she would be free for 21 days, but would have to serve the remaining prison time later. The Iranian government did not acknowledge the medical furlough for Mohammadi, 52, which her supporters demanded should involve her being permanently freed. 'A 21-day suspension of Narges Mohammadi’s sentence is inadequate,' the campaign said. 'After over a decade of imprisonment, Narges requires specialized medical care in a safe, sanitary environment — a basic human right. As doctors have emphasized, a minimum of three months’ recovery is crucial for her healing.' It added: 'Narges should never have been imprisoned in the first place for her peaceful advocacy for human and women’s rights — the very work that earned her the Nobel Peace Prize.' Mohammadi is serving prison sentences totaling 13 years and nine months on charges of collusion against state security and propaganda against Iran’s government. She has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and spending years behind bars. That includes backing the nationwide, women-led protests sparked by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, which have seen women openly defy the government by not wearing the hijab. Mohammadi suffered multiple heart attacks while imprisoned before undergoing emergency surgery in 2022, her supporters say. In November of this year, her lawyer announced that doctors found a bone lesion that they feared could be cancerous, leading to her surgery. 'We are hugely relieved by Narges Mohammadi’s temporary release today from Evin prison, which is an important step in the right direction,' said Rebecca Vincent of Reporters Sans Frontières. 'We remain deeply concerned by her worrying health situation and urge the Iranian authorities to grant her sufficient time at home to allow for her full recovery.' Her release comes as Iran’s economy has been in tatters for years because of sanctions imposed by the West, in part over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. Its people are angry over the devaluation of their currency and government corruption. That’s fueled protests, as well as a government crackdown on dissent. The return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House in January has stoked concerns for some that he may resume his 'maximum pressure' campaign on the Islamic Republic.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-nobel-prize-narges-mohammadi-57297ee4f015ee0a25e064641246afd2	2024-12-04T05:00:48-08:00	
Relic of the Buddha loaned by China gets a warm welcome in Thailand	BANGKOK (AP) — More than 2,000 people took part Wednesday in a procession to escort a relic of the Buddha lent by China to a shrine in the Thai capital Bangkok to honor the birthday of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and to celebrate half a century of diplomatic relations between Thailand and China. The tooth relic, considered sacred by Buddhists, was flown in earlier in the day from the Lingguang Temple in Beijing, which normally houses it. Loans of the tooth as a show of friendship have been an effective form of soft diplomacy by China, even though competing claims from various countries on possessing the Buddha’s tooth raise questions about its provenance. The tooth was put in an ornate, golden container and placed on a flower-bedecked float as it was paraded through one of the oldest neighborhoods of the city. Attendants flanked the vehicle as it travelled about 2 1/2 kilometers (1 1/2 miles) to the relic’s temporary home, a soaring pavilion on Sanam Luang, a large field outside Bangkok’s famous Grand Palace. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and members of her cabinet received the relic amid the sounds of chanting monks. Representatives of China, including Beijing’s ambassador to Thailand, were also present, according to local media. The loan is the latest in a series of events to mark the 72nd birthday of the Thai king. It also commemorates the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Thailand and China, which occurs next year. It was previously displayed in Thailand in 2002 to mark the 75th birthday of Vajiralongkorn's father, King Bhumibol, who died in 2016. The relic will be on public display at the pavilion until mid-February.	https://apnews.com/article/buddha-relic-soft-diplomacy-religion-fbacb6fed0141e0560c02b2cc110dd5e	2024-12-04T04:13:44-08:00

Swift was 2024’s most-streamed artist globally, ranking in more than 26.6 billion streams. She's followed by The Weekend, Bad Bunny, Drake and Billie Eilish, in that order. In the U.S., the list looks similar: It's Swift in the top spot, followed by Drake, Zach Bryan, Morgan Wallen and Kanye West. Last year, Swift dethroned Puerto Rican reggaetón star Bad Bunny for the top spot, globally. He held the coveted title for three years in a row beginning in 2020. Swift also earned the title of most-streamed album in 2024, with 'The Tortured Poets Department.' She's followed by Eilish's 'Hit Me Hard and Soft,' Sabrina Carpenter's 'Short n' Sweet,' Karol G's 'Mañana Será Bonito' and Ariana Grande's 'eternal sunshine.' All of those titles are new to 2024 with the exception of Karol G's album, which released early last year. In the U.S., there are only slight differences: Swift's album still leads, followed by Wallen's 'One Thing At A Time' — released last year. Then it's Carpenter, Noah Kahan's 'Stick Season,' and Chappell Roan's 'The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,' also released in 2023. Carpenter leads the most-streamed songs both in the U.S. and globally this year, with her summertime smash 'Espresso.' It earned over 1.6 billion streams. Globally, she's followed by Benson Boone's 'Beautiful Things,' Eilish's 'Birds of a Feather,' FloyyMenor and Cris MJ's 'Gata Only' and Teddy Swims' 'Lose Control.' And in the U.S., she's trailed by Kendrick Lamar's 'Not Like Us,' Shaboozey's 'A Bar Song (Tipsy)', Post Malone and Morgan Wallen's 'I Had Some Help' and Tommy Richman's 'Million Dollar Baby.' This year, there are a few new features on Spotify Wrapped. Those include a new data story called 'Your Music Evolution,' documenting three distinct musical phases for each user, and a personalized playlist. The individualized 'Your Top Artist' feature has changed slightly, too, and now includes 'Longest Listening Streak' as well as the familiar 'Top Listeners.' That the biggest artists, globally, earned top spots on Spotify Wrapped should come as no surprise — they’re featured prominently across the streaming service, including on its highly influential playlists, in addition to boasting loyal, dedicated fanbases. For independent artists who may appear on an individual listener’s Wrapped, accessing a top spot on the global list would require billions of streams. Streaming now accounts for most of the money generated by the music industry — a whopping 84% in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, and 67.3% worldwide, according to a 2024 report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which tracks global sales. Spotify is the largest platform of all — making up roughly 31% of the total market share — with a reported 626 million users and 246 million subscribers in over 180 markets.	https://apnews.com/article/spotify-wrapped-2024-taylor-swift-306707264ea42c6e65ee82d79b4f833e	2024-12-04T04:01:16-08:00	
EU condemns reported Taliban move to suspend medical education for women and girls	The European Union on Wednesday condemned the Taliban for violating human rights and women's access to education after media reports that the Taliban's leader has ordered private and public institutions to stop providing medical courses for women and girls in Afghanistan. The Taliban have neither confirmed the order nor responded to the reports. The Public Health Ministry spokesman was unavailable for comment. In September 2021, a month after they returned to power, the Taliban stopped schooling for girls after grade six. They banned women from university in December 2022. Medical education, like nursing and midwifery, was one of the few ways they could continue their learning in classrooms. The BBC and others reported that five institutions across Afghanistan said the Taliban had instructed them to close until further notice, and women training as midwives and nurses were ordered not to return to classes Wednesday. The EU said the Taliban’s latest reported decision represented another appalling violation of fundamental human rights and an unjustifiable attack on women’s access to education in Afghanistan. 'The European Union expresses its strong concerns over this decision and its far-reaching implication, including the deepening of the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the exacerbation of the suffering of its people,' the statement said. It urged the Taliban to reverse the policy. A spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the U.N. in Afghanistan was working to verify the claims with relevant officials. 'This development raises serious concerns about the sustainability and appeal of formal education for female health workers,' said WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris. 'Such measures could have far-reaching implications for the future availability of qualified female health professionals and the continuity of health service delivery in the country.' A starker warning came from a senior health official in Afghanistan. He did not give his name for fear of reprisals from the Taliban. He said that Afghanistan would face major challenges beyond the control of the government if the suspension became permanent. 'If women are not trained as staff, the mortality rate of mothers and children will increase in remote areas,' he said. 'There will not be enough staff to provide services to female patients. Those NGOs that provide services in distant provinces and districts are still facing a shortage of doctors, midwives, nurses and other female staff.' A 22-year-old midwifery student learned Wednesday that the institute was stopping classes for her and her friends. She had already switched from a law degree after the Taliban stopped university for women and expressed her shock and disbelief at the latest decision. 'After an hour, when I calmed down a little, I cried a lot because we had this one way (to study) and it is also closed,' she said. 'It’s a difficult situation to have so many dreams in the field of education. But, in a second, all the dreams are crushed. This is the second time I have faced such a situation.' Another young woman said she had set out to be a pilot in the armed forces, an ambition that ended after the Taliban's return to power. So she started studying midwifery because of women's health issues, especially Afghanistan's high maternal mortality rates. She wanted to work in a hospital. On Wednesday, before the first exam of the semester, the institute told female students they could not return. 'It was the most difficult moment of my life when I heard this. It still is. They killed my hopes.' Both women spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal. Public dissent against Taliban rule is rare.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-medical-education-women-girls-c55047b95870386c86811bcedf7191ea	2024-12-04T02:32:26-08:00	
Syrian forces battling insurgents north of strategic city of Hama	BEIRUT (AP) — Syria said Wednesday its counteroffensive has pushed back insurgents attempting to advance to the strategic central city of Hama, while the insurgency says it captured more Syrian troops and Iran-backed militants in fierce battles. The latest flareup in Syria's long civil war comes after forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad over the past days captured large parts of the northern city of Aleppo, the country's largest, as well as towns and villages in southern parts of the northwestern Idlib province. The offensive is being led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadi group, as well as an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. For years, both have entrenched themselves in northwest Idlib province and parts of northern Aleppo, as the battered country reeled from years of political and military stalemates. The war between Assad and his foreign backers and the array of armed opposition forces seeking his overthrow has killed an estimated half-million people over the past 13 years. Syrian state media SANA on Wednesday said insurgents retreated some 20 kilometers (12 miles) from government-held Hama, Syria's fourth largest city, as government troops backed by Russian airpower entrenched themselves in the outskirts. Fierce fighting has raged for days as Damascus fears that the insurgents will make their way into the city like they did over the weekend into Aleppo. A Syrian photographer working for the German news agency dpa was killed in an airstrike near the city of Hama, the agency said Wednesday. Anas Alkharboutli, 32, has long documented Syria’s civil war, which started after a brutal crackdown on a popular uprising against Assad in 2011. He has worked for dpa since 2017. The insurgency through its Military Operations Department channel on the Telegram app said they captured five Iran-backed militants, of whom two were from Afghanistan, as well as three Syrian troops from its 25th Special Mission Forces Division in eastern Hama. The claims could not be independently confirmed. If the insurgents seize Hama city and control the province, it could leave the coastal cities of Tartous and Lattakia isolated from the rest of the country. Lattakia is a key political stronghold for Assad and Syria's Alawite community and a strategic Russian naval base. Tens of thousands have been displaced by the fighting, which started last week, Geir Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said Tuesday. 'If we do not see deescalation and a rapid move to a serious political process, involving the Syrian parties and the key international players, then I fear we will see a deepening of the crisis,' Pedersen said in an address the U.N. Security Council. 'Syria will be in grave danger of further division, deterioration, and destruction.' Turkey, which backs Syria's opposition, has called on Assad to reconcile with opposition forces and include them in any political solution to end the conflict. Ankara has been seeking to normalize ties with Syria to address security threats from groups affiliated with Kurdish militants along its southern border and to help ensure the safe return of more than 3 million Syrian refugees. Assad has insisted that Turkey’s withdrawal of its military forces from northern Syria be a condition for any normalization between the two countries. Damascus views the insurgents as terrorists, and Assad has vowed to respond to the insurgency with an iron fist. Turkish and Iranian officials have met earlier this week, in a bid to reach a solution to deescalate the flareup. Arab countries bordering Syria and once backed groups that tried to overthrow Assad, have expressed their concern of the conflict's regional impacts, and have backed the president.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-insurgency-aleppo-hama-turkey-assad-956c940cf0abe9159187d9e0498fdbee	2024-12-04T01:48:36-08:00	
French lawmakers vote to oust prime minister in the first successful no-confidence vote since 1962	PARIS (AP) — France’s far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined together Wednesday in a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes that forces Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet members to resign, a first since 1962. The National Assembly approved the motion by 331 votes. A minimum of 288 were needed. President Emmanuel Macron insisted he will serve the rest of his term until 2027. However, he will need to appoint a new prime minister for the second time after July’s legislative elections led to a deeply divided parliament. Macron will address the French on Thursday evening, his office said, without providing details. Barnier is expected to formally resign by then. A conservative appointed in September, Barnier becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in France’s modern Republic. 'I can tell you that it will remain an honor for me to have served France and the French with dignity,' Barnier said in his final speech before the vote. 'This no-confidence motion… will make everything more serious and more difficult. That’s what I’m sure of,' he said. Opposition to Barnier's proposed budget Wednesday's crucial vote rose from fierce opposition to Barnier's proposed budget. The National Assembly, France’s lower house of parliament, is deeply fractured, with no single party holding a majority. It comprises three major blocs: Macron’s centrist allies, the left-wing coalition New Popular Front, and the far-right National Rally. Both opposition blocs, typically at odds, are uniting against Barnier, accusing him of imposing austerity measures and failing to address citizens’ needs. Speaking on TF1 television after the vote, National Rally leader Marine Le Pen said 'we had a choice to make, and our choice is to protect the French' from a 'toxic' budget. Le Pen also accused Macron of being 'largely responsible for the current situation,' adding that 'the pressure on the President of the Republic will get stronger and stronger.' Speaking at the National Assembly ahead of the vote, hard-left lawmaker Eric Coquerel had called on the government to 'stop pretending the lights will go out,' noting the possibility of an emergency law to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year’s rules. 'The special law will prevent a shutdown. It will allow us to get through the end of the year by delaying the budget by a few weeks,' Coquerel said. Macron to pick a new prime minister Macron must appoint a new prime minister, but the fragmented parliament remains unchanged. No new legislative elections can be held until at least July, creating a potential stalemate for policymakers. Macron said discussions about him potentially resigning were 'make-believe politics' during a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this week, according to French media reports. 'I’m here because I’ve been elected twice by the French people,' Macron said. He was also reported as saying: 'We must not scare people with such things. We have a strong economy.' Impact on financial markets While France is not at risk of a U.S.-style government shutdown, political instability could spook financial markets. France is under pressure from the European Union to reduce its colossal debt. The country’s deficit is estimated to reach 6% of gross domestic product this year and analysts say it could rise to 7% next year without drastic adjustments. The political instability could push up French interest rates, digging the debt even further. Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING Bank, said uncertainty over France’s future government and finances is deterring investment and growth. 'The impact of France not having a government would clearly be negative for the growth of France and hence the Eurozone,' Brzeski said. France has seen bond market borrowing costs rise, bringing back ugly memories of the Greek debt crisis and default in 2010-2012. Analysts say France is far from a similar crisis because much of its outstanding debt does not come due for years, and because its bonds remain in demand due to a shortage of German government bonds. Additionally, the European Central Bank could intervene to lower French borrowing costs in case of extreme market turmoil, though the bar for that remains high. —- AP Journalist David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, contributed to the story.	https://apnews.com/article/france-government-collapse-no-confidence-barnier-3b408ee1ac4c502541a56fbe3a230479	2024-12-04T01:47:52-08:00	
Pope Francis discusses Ukraine with Hungary's nationalist leader Viktor Orban	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis met Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the Vatican on Wednesday and discussed with him the war in Ukraine, focusing on the humanitarian situation and efforts to promote peace in the region. Francis also discussed other themes with Orban, including the Hungarian presidency of the Council of the European Union as well as the 'central role of the family and the protection of the young generations,' the Vatican said in a statement. During his visit in Hungary last year, Francis met with some 35,000 Ukrainian refugees who remained in Hungary. Nearly 2.5 million refugees entered the eastern European country early on in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Orban has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in the war. But he has refused to supply Kyiv with weapons, and he has threatened to veto EU sanctions against Moscow while maintaining Hungary’s strong dependence on Russian energy. The Hungarian leader also met with Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin and Miroslaw Wachowski, the Vatican undersecretary for relations with states.	https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-viktor-orban-vatican-ukraine-war-refugees-4009d2bdd22312432487c071c018bc2a	2024-12-04T01:44:47-08:00	
Middle East latest: An Israeli strike on a Gaza tent camp kills at least 21 people	An Israeli strike on a tent camp housing displaced people in southern Gaza killed at least 21 people and wounded 28 on Wednesday, said the director of Nasser Hospital, Atif al-Hout, in the nearby city of Khan Younis. The Israeli military said its aircraft struck senior Hamas militants 'involved in terrorist activities' in the area. At least 15 bodies arrived at the hospital, but reaching a precise number of dead was difficult because many were dismembered, some without heads or badly burned. The strike hit in the Muwasi area, a sprawling coastal camp housing hundreds of thousands of displaced people. Earlier strikes elsewhere in Gaza killed eight people, including four children, health officials said. Israel's war against Hamas has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Israel’s blistering retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Here's the Latest: Amnesty International accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip CAIRO - Amnesty International accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip during its war with Hamas, saying it has sought to deliberately destroy Palestinians by mounting deadly attacks, demolishing vital infrastructure and preventing the delivery of food, medicine and other aid. The human rights group released a report Thursday in the Middle East that said such actions could not be justified by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, which ignited the war, or the presence of militants in civilian areas. Amnesty said the United States and other allies of Israel could be complicit in genocide, and called on them to halt arms shipments. 'Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now,' Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said in the report. Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has adamantly rejected genocide allegations against it as an antisemitic 'blood libel.' It is challenging such allegations at the International Court of Justice, and it has rejected the International Criminal Court’s accusations that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister committed war crimes in Gaza. 'The deplorable and fanatical organization Amnesty International has once again produced a fabricated report that is entirely false and based on lies,' Israel’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Israel accused Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate Israel, of carrying out a genocidal massacre in the attack that triggered the war, and said it is defending itself in accordance with international law. Israeli military bombs southern Lebanon as ceasefire with Hezbollah holds JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Wednesday it struck a launcher in southern Lebanon, which it said was in violation of the ceasefire it agreed to with the militant group Hezbollah. Israel has struck Lebanon repeatedly in the week since the ceasefire began, saying it reserves the right under the U.S.- and France-brokered deal to strike what it views as violations by Hezbollah. Hezbollah struck a disputed border territory held by Israel earlier this week, in what it said was a warning over the Israeli strikes. U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel, speaking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday about the Lebanon ceasefire, said it was 'largely holding in place.' He would not speak to individual allegations of violations. The ceasefire is meant to end nearly 14 months of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that began when the militant group began firing at Israel in solidarity with Hamas and the war in Gaza. Israeli strike on a Gaza tent camp kills at least 21 people, hospital says DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — A Palestinian health official said Wednesday that at least 21 people were killed by an Israeli strike on a camp housing displaced people in Gaza. Atif Al-Hout, the director of Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, said at least 28 people were wounded in the strike. The Israeli military said its aircraft struck senior Hamas militants 'involved in terrorist activities' in the area. The military said that the strike had set off secondary explosions, indicating explosives present in the area were set off. It was not possible to independently confirm the Israeli claims, and the strike could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp. At least 15 bodies arrived at the hospital, but reaching a precise number was difficult because many of the dead were dismembered, some without heads or badly burned. The strike hit in the Muwasi area, a sprawling coastal camp housing hundreds of thousands of displaced people near the southern city of Khan Younis. It came after Israeli forces struck targets in other areas of the Palestinian enclave. Earlier strikes on central Gaza killed eight people, including four children. Israel’s war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths because the militants often operate in residential areas and are known to position tunnels, rocket launchers and other infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques. Body of an Israeli hostage is recovered from Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel’s Shin Bet domestic security agency said Wednesday that Israeli forces recovered the body of a hostage held in Gaza. Itay Svirsky was captured alive from southern Israel during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack. Israel believes that he was killed while in captivity by his captors who held on to his body. The Shin Bet did not disclose details of the mission to recover Svirsky’s body. During its attack, Hamas killed 1,200 people and kidnapped 250. Israel believes roughly 100 remain in Gaza, about a third of whom are dead. Israeli military admits soldiers entered a West Bank hospital during a raid, after initially denying the claim JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Wednesday that soldiers had entered a West Bank hospital the previous day during a raid in search of militants, after initially denying the claim. The military said several soldiers entered the hospital’s entrance hall, suspecting that an armed militant was inside. On Tuesday, a Palestinian doctor working at the hospital in the town of Tubas said Israeli soldiers opened fire inside, a claim the military did not address in its statement Wednesday. The military had said its troops were operating around the hospital searching for alleged militants struck in an earlier airstrike but had denied the troops had entered. The doctor, Mahmoud Ghanam, said the troops had left after learning that a wounded man had been transferred to another hospital. Israeli raids on hospitals in the occupied West Bank are rare but have grown more common since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Violence in the occupied West Bank has surged since the war in Gaza began. The Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed about 800 people in the West Bank during that time. Israel says many of the Palestinians killed have been militants. But stone-throwing youths protesting Israeli raids and others not involved in confrontations have also been killed. Palestinian families describe being forcibly displaced from northern Gaza by Israeli military offensive BEIR LAHIYA, Gaza Strip — Dozens of Palestinian families in northern Gaza said Wednesday they were forcibly displaced when Israel's military expelled them from schools they were using as makeshift shelters. The fleeing civilians said Israel was expanding its major offensive in the north, the most heavily destroyed and isolated part of the Gaza Strip, which Israeli forces have almost completely besieged since early October. Experts say famine may be underway there. Associated Press footage showed dozens of displaced families on the road leaving Beit Lahia — some on foot while others used motorized rickshaws, bicycles or donkey carts to carry kids, older adults and their remaining belongings. Sadeia al-Rahel said Wednesday she was staying in a school in the town of Beit Lahiya when Israel's military dropped leaflets ordering everyone to evacuate. 'This morning a quadcopter (drone) detonated four bombs at the school. There were people injured, human remains, we left with nothing,' she said. 'They forcibly displaced us.' The 57-year-old said her family has been eating grass, leaves, and animal feed for two months due to the lack of food aid in the north. 'But no one cares' she added. Al-Rahel said her family didn’t even take blankets with them as they left. Meanwhile, 20-year-old Hafez Warshal stayed in Beit Lahia with his family for 13 months before evacuating the school where he was sheltering. He said he had no idea where he would go next. 'We’ll stay wherever we find a place,' he said. Israel’s war against Hamas has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The International Criminal Court is seeking to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister over accusations of using 'starvation as a method of warfare' by restricting humanitarian aid into Gaza. Israel rejects the allegations and says it has been working hard to improve the entry of aid. Israel says six hostages in Gaza were likely shot by captors after an airstrike nearby JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Wednesday that an investigation into the deaths of six hostages whose bodies were recovered from Gaza earlier this year determined that they were likely shot and killed by their captors in an underground tunnel after an Israeli strike hit nearby. The military recovered the bodies of the six hostages – all men, including three in their 70s and one in his 80s — from the southern city of Khan Younis in August. The investigation said the strike in question was one targeting Hamas commanders in February. 'Due to the extended time that had passed, it was not possible to determine with complete certainty the precise cause of death of the hostages or the exact timing of the gunfire,' the military statement said. An Israeli military official said the results were based on a 'forensic examination' carried out after the bodies were recovered. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the findings with the media, and did not not provide details on the examination. The military said it had no intelligence indicating that hostages were held in the area and would not have struck had it known. The military said that while troops followed all the necessary approvals for conducting the strike, it has added additional approvals to its protocols for certain strikes in response to the hostages’ deaths. The war in Gaza was sparked when Hamas launched its Oct. 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel, where militants killed 1,200 people and kidnapped 250. About 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with roughly a third said to be dead, according to Israeli authorities. Israel has made destroying Hamas’ military and governing capabilities, as well as freeing the hostages, the goals for its war in Gaza. But critics say those goals are in conflict, with the lives of hostages in danger the longer Israeli fights in Gaza. — By Tia Goldenberg Photographer for German news agency killed in an attack in Syria BERLIN — A Syrian photographer working for the German news agency dpa was killed by a fighter jet attack near the Syrian city of Hama, dpa reported on Wednesday. The news agency couldn’t immediately give more details about when 32-year-old Anas Alkharboutli was killed. But the agency’s editor-in-chief, Sven Gösmann, said 'all of us at dpa are in shock and infinitely saddened by the death of Anas Alkharboutli.' 'With his pictures he not only documented the horrors of war, he always worked for the truth,' Gösmann said. 'In recent days in particular, his photos were seen around the world as he reported on the civil war that flared up again.' Alkharboutli joined dpa as a photographer in the Middle East in 2017. He mainly reported from the Syrian civil war zone. Alkharboutli’s photography was recognized internationally. In 2020, he received the Young Reporter Trophy of the French Prix Bayeux for war reporting. At the 2021 Sony World Photography Awards, he won the Sports category with a series of images of children training in karate, the news agency said. Settlers attack Palestinian towns, burning homes and clashing with Israeli troops BEIT FURIK, West Bank — Jewish settlers mounted a string of attacks on Palestinian towns in the occupied West Bank overnight, burning homes and clashing with Israeli troops. There were no immediate reports of any Palestinian casualties. The Israeli military said Jewish settlers attacked the village of Beit Furik after troops arrived in the area to dismantle an unauthorized farming outpost they had built nearby on land privately owned by Palestinians. It said the settlers hurled stones, wounding two members of the paramilitary Border Police. Adel Hanni, a resident of the village, told the AP that a group of roughly 70 settlers gathered on the village lands early morning as the troops took down the outpost. The settlers burned Hanni’s son’s home, a car, a village shop and smashed the windows of several more homes. An Associated Press reporter saw a blackened home and a destroyed car on Wednesday morning. 'Some settlers started to break into the house, while others carried incendiary materials,' said Hanni, 57. Settlers also attacked the village of Huwara, which has been the target of several previous attacks — even before the outbreak of the war in Gaza — and clashed with troops near Rujeib, another Palestinian village, the military said. Israeli police and the Shin Bet security agency said in a statement that they were investigating the settler attacks. They said they arrested eight Israelis for suspected property damage and assaulting security forces. The West Bank has seen a surge in settler violence since the start of the war, which was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. Settlers have also raced to establish new farming outposts that rights groups say are among the biggest drivers of the violence. The U.N.’s humanitarian office said settler attacks on Palestinian farmers during the recent olive harvest season 'at least tripled' in 2024 compared to the last three years. Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for an independent state. The West Bank is home to some 3 million Palestinians who live under Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy in cities and towns. Some 500,000 Jewish settlers with Israeli citizenship live in more than 100 settlements across the West Bank, many of which resemble suburbs or small towns. Most of the international community considers the settlements to be illegal and an obstacle to peace. 4 children killed in Gaza strike DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medics said Israeli airstrikes in Gaza on Wednesday killed eight people, including four children. The Awda Hospital, which received the bodies from one strike, said five were killed as they gathered outside of shelters in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The hospital said another 15 people, mostly children, were wounded in the strike. Also in central Gaza, the Al-Aqsa Hospital in the city of Deir al-Balah said it received the bodies of three people who were killed in what it says were two separate Israeli strikes early Wednesday. The three dead include a man and a woman who were killed in a strike in Deir al-Balah, and another man killed in the urban refugee camp of Bureij, the hospital said. The Israeli military said it struck a 'terrorist target' in Nuseirat, without elaborating. It had no immediate comment on the other strikes. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israel returns bodies of militants who crossed border from Jordan JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said Wednesday it had returned the bodies of two militants who crossed into Israel from Jordan in October and shot two soldiers. The militants entered Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea on Oct. 18, shooting and wounding two soldiers before being shot dead by Israeli troops. Hamas praised the incursion but not claim responsibility for it. The Israeli military did not release the names of the militants who carried out the attack.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-latest-4-december-2024-1369e179a32e5272ac99f6818f69cb8e	2024-12-04T00:26:43-08:00	
Japanese court convicts Australian who says she was tricked into smuggling drugs	CHIBA, Japan (AP) — A Japanese court on Wednesday sentenced an Australian woman to six years in prison for smuggling amphetamines into the country, despite accepting her testimony that she was tricked as part of an online romance scam. The Chiba District Court said it found Donna Nelson, 58, from Perth, Australia, guilty of violating the stimulants control and customs laws. It ordered her to pay a fine of 1 million yen ($6,671) in addition to serving a prison term. Nelson was arrested at Japan’s Narita International Airport, near Tokyo, on Jan. 3, 2023, after customs officials found about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of phenylaminopropane, a stimulant, hidden under a false bottom in a suitcase she was carrying as checked luggage. Nelson told the court that she did not know that drugs were hidden in the suitcase and that she was carrying them for a man she hoped to marry. The man, whom she met online in 2020, told her he was the Nigerian owner of a fashion business. In 2023, he paid to travel to Japan via Laos, and asked her to collect dress samples from an acquaintance in Laos, the court said in the ruling. She was supposed to meet him in Japan but he never showed up, according to prosecutors. Nelson has already been in custody for nearly two years. The court said 430 days of that will be counted toward her sentence. Presiding Judge Masakazu Kamakura said that although Nelson was deceived, she had a sense that something was wrong with the arrangement and that something illegal could be hidden in the suitcase, and she could have stopped. Kamakura said Nelson was taken advantage of her desire to marry the man and that there is room for 'sympathy' for what she did. He imposed a shorter sentence than would be typical for the amount of drugs she was carrying, after prosecutors had demanded 10 years in prison and a fine of 3 million yen (about $20,000). Nelson’s lawyer Rie Nishida said the ruling was unjust and that she planned to appeal. 'We will fight until the end,' she said. On Wednesday, Nelson sobbed as the verdict was read out. One of her daughters, Kristal Hilaire, wiped away tears as she looked on from her seat in the audience. 'We are disappointed and devastated by the court’s verdict in our mum’s case,' Hilaire told reporters outside the court. 'We maintain that our mum was the victim of a romance scam. She is the victim of a crime and not a criminal. She has always been against drugs.' Hilaire said the past few weeks had been a difficult time for the family but that they have come together to support each other and Nelson during the trial, and that they will keep fighting 'until we can bring her home.' But Hillaire said she is worried about her mother, devastated and much thinner. 'I worry about how she would handle another six years.' Several other family members who attended earlier sessions, seeing Nelson for the first time since her arrest nearly two years ago, returned home ahead of the verdict. ___ Associated Press video journalists Mayuko Ono in Chiba and Ayaka McGill in Tokyo contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-australia-drug-smuggling-verdict-nelson-a9f2f9a01f2f11dc9fad100dd6137e40	2024-12-04T00:02:15-08:00	
Relatives hunt for the missing after Guinea stadium crush amid fears official death toll is too low	CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) — A distraught Kambaly Kouroumah is searching for his teenage brother, Adama, at a local morgue in southern Guinea’s Nzerekore city, where dozens of people died at a crowded stadium after chaos erupted during a soccer game. Kouroumah is one of many bereaved people searching hospitals and mortuaries for missing relatives following Sunday's tragic events during the final of a national tournament honoring military leader Mamadi Doumbouya. Official estimates say 56 people died in the crush, but the unofficial death toll is at least 135, according to the Collective of Human Rights Organizations of the Nzerekore region. More than 50 people remain missing, including Adama, 15, who was 'everything' to his devastated brother. 'I want to see him now, dead or alive,' a heartbroken Kouroumah said. The world’s latest sports crowd disaster happened during the final of the tournament at the Third of April stadium in honor of Doumbouya, who overran the country's elected president three years ago and added it to the list of several West African countries hit by military coups in recent years. But for a football-loving nation hungry for its first World Cup qualification and an Africa Cup of Nations triumph, the two-week tournament in Nzerekore, almost 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the capital of Conakry, had attracted not just adults and youths, but also children. Chaos had erupted at the crowded and open stadium after fans protested a referee’s penalty call and were throwing stones towards the field, according to witnesses and local media. Security forces reacted to the disturbance with tear gas as fans poured onto the pitch, survivors said. While some fans managed to jump over the high fence to escape, videos from the scene showed many struggling to squeeze themselves through the main stadium entrance, ending up being crushed by the crowd. Desperate fans were seen shouting and crying for help, many of them being trampled as they struggled to avoid the crush. Among the dead was Jaquerine Keba Koévogui, 15, whose father said she rarely visited the stadium and, although she loved soccer, would always prefer to watch it on television. 'My daughter was with other members of the family, mostly boys who were able to jump over the stadium walls while she tried to get out through the entrance,' said Jules Koevogui, 42. Mamadou Sanoh’s painful search for his 10-year-son ended with heartbreak. 'I went to the morgue and saw his body,' said Sanoh. 'I cannot tell you the shock I am feeling.' The National Alliance for Alternation and Democracy opposition coalition said the tournament was organized to drum up support for the 'illegal and inappropriate' political ambitions of the junta leader. While videos showed the stadium was filled at full capacity, Cissé Lancine, a local sports journalist, estimated there were between 20,000 and 30,000 spectators. The coalition has criticised the use of tear gas and has accused the security forces of using their vehicles to obstruct the stadium entrances. In Conakry and other parts of the country, flags are at half-mast as the country observes three days of mourning. Nzerekore's human rights organizations have called for the arrest of the organizers of the tournament. Authorities have said they were investigating the incident which adds growing pressure on Doumbouya who, since forcefully taking over power in 2021, has failed to solve the economic and political challenges he chastised the previous government for. The United Nations in Guinea has promised a quick response involving humanitarian, medical and psychological support to the victims of the disaster. 'This tragedy is a painful reminder of the crucial importance of ensuring safety in public places,' it said in a statement released on the X platform. Struggling to process the grief, families are asking questions and finding ways to prevent a reoccurrence. 'We must now keep our children away from large demonstrations of mobilization,' said Joel Gbamou, a civil society activist who lost his two sons in the tragedy. —- AP journalist Mark Banchereau in Dakar, Senegal, contributed. ____ Follow AP’s Africa coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/guinea-stampede-soccer-stadium-nzerekore-2bb8164bbfe1d5adbca1011c2535b4b9	2024-12-03T23:38:38-08:00	
Activists file second impeachment complaint against embattled Philippine Vice President Duterte	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A group led by left-wing activists filed a second impeachment complaint against the Philippine vice president on Wednesday over her alleged misuse of government funds and demanded that she be permanently barred from holding public office. The impeachment complaint filed by at least 74 activists, including human rights, labor and student leaders, before the House of Representatives reflects the extent of the political hostilities faced by Vice President Sara Duterte. She did not immediately comment on the new impeachment complaint or an earlier one filed Monday. Duterte, a 46-year-old lawyer, is the daughter of also-controversial former President Rodrigo Duterte, who oversaw a bloody anti-drug crackdown while in office. The killing of thousands of suspects during the crackdown is being investigated by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity. Her No. 1 political adversary has been President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., whom she publicly threatened with death in a Nov. 23 online news conference. Government investigators have launched a criminal investigation into her threat against the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives, a cousin and ally of Marcos. Duterte has tried to walk back her comments by saying they were not a direct death threat but rather an expression of concern for her own safety. The complaint filed Wednesday accused the vice president of 'betrayal of public trust over the illegal use and mishandling of 612.5 million pesos ($10.3 million) in confidential funds,' according to a statement by the complainants. The impeachment complaint said that in addition to the alleged misuse of the confidential and intelligence funds, the vice president and her staff allegedly tried to cover up the irregularities by submitting fabricated reports, receipts and documents to the Commission on Audit and deliberately obstructing a congressional investigation. It said that in December 2022, the vice president’s office spent 125 million pesos ($2 million) in 11 days during the Christmas holidays for suspicious expenditures, including renting 'safe houses,' paying for unspecified confidential information and financing rewards, which it said were not clearly explained by Duterte. 'Wasting the confidential funds is a big betrayal of the people,' said Liza Maza, a leading complainant from the Makabayan political coalition. 'This is not just a simple technical violation but a systematic misuse and robbery of public funds.' 'The impeachment is the antidote to impunity,' said Renato Reyes of Bayan, another left-wing political coalition. 'Citizens and taxpayers need to hold public officials accountable.' On Monday, a group of civil society activists, including Roman Catholic priests and pro-democracy activists, filed an initial impeachment case that contained about 24 alleged crimes and irregularities, including her death threats against Marcos and her alleged role in the extra-judicial killings of drug suspects under her father's crackdown. She was also accused of failing to stand up to Chinese aggression in the disputed South China Sea. The impeachment complaints will be examined by the House of Representatives, which is dominated by allies of Marcos and his cousin and key backer, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, who also has been politically at odds with the vice president. The process could take weeks or months. Congress is to start its Christmas recess on Dec. 20 and resume on Jan. 13. Many legislators will then start campaigning for reelection ahead of the May 12 midterm elections. The House has been investigating the alleged misuse of confidential and intelligence funds received by Duterte’s offices as vice president and education secretary. She has since left the education post. She has refused to respond to questions in detail in tense televised hearings. Philippine police have filed criminal complaints against Duterte and her security staff for allegedly assaulting authorities and disobeying orders in an altercation in Congress over the brief detention of her chief of staff, who was accused of hampering the congressional inquiry into the alleged misuse of funds. The National Bureau of Investigation subpoenaed Duterte to face investigators on Dec. 11 about her threats against the president. Marcos and Duterte won landslide victories as running mates in the 2022 election but have since fallen out over key differences. The two offices are elected separately in the Philippines, which has resulted in rivals occupying the country’s top political posts. ___ Associated Press journalists Aaron Favila and Joeal Calupitan contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-vice-president-duterte-impeachment-complaint-1edd5c533ae2f82d0cdad12bd5fd0c92	2024-12-03T23:17:30-08:00	
A history of martial law in South Korea in Associated Press photographs	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — When South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law this week it was the first time a South Korean government took such a drastic measure since it became a fully functioning democracy more than 35 years ago. But in the decades of largely autocratic governments and military rule from the end of World War II until the establishment of the Sixth Republic in 1988, martial law was not uncommon as the country faced political turmoil, uprisings, frequent protests and all-out war with North Korea. It was last imposed in 1979 by Prime Minister Choi Kyu-hah after the assassination of President Park Chung-hee, a military dictator who had seized power in a 1961 coup. It was then extended in 1980 by Gen. Chun Doo-hwan, who also took the presidency in a military coup. He used military force to put down student-led demonstrations in Gwangju, some 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Seoul, killing hundreds of protesters. In Seoul, thousands of university students took to the streets to demand an end to martial law, and were confronted by riot police using tear gas. Martial law was eventually lifted in 1981. Martial law was first used in 1948 by South Korea's first president Syngman Rhee as he cracked down on communist uprisings, killing thousands. It was also invoked during the 1950-53 Korean War to allow South Korea to use its military to stifle anti-government protests. As Rhee struggled to hold onto power in the face of growing opposition, he imposed martial law again in 1960. Hundreds were killed in clashes between protesters and police. After Rhee was forced to resign in the face of nationwide demonstrations, jubilant South Koreans climbed aboard a tank outside Seoul's City Hall to celebrate. While still president in 1972, Park Chung-hee initiated another coup to give himself dictatorial powers and declared martial law, again sending tanks into the streets of Seoul. It was lifted later the same year. Through the years until his assassination in 1979, protests against Park's rule grew, and he used emergency measures to justify the jailing of hundreds of dissidents.	https://apnews.com/article/korea-martial-law-yoon-president-9adbff7c7df6a2fa22b1fbf955a495fa	2024-12-03T23:08:47-08:00	
Shock martial law edict in South Korea follows chaotic recent history: A look at the crucial context	TOKYO (AP) — It may seem that the wild predawn scenes in Seoul, with hundreds of armed troops and frantic lawmakers storming South Korea's parliament building after the president suddenly declared martial law, came out of nowhere. But the chaotic events, which were still playing out Wednesday as opposition leaders introduced an impeachment motion and called for President Yoon Suk Yeol's immediate resignation, should be seen in the context of South Korea's recent tumultuous political and social history. These moments resonate with South Koreans in their daily lives, and as they look to explain Yoon's short-lived declaration of emergency martial law, even if there's still widespread confusion and anger over his decision. From a nationwide doctors' strike, to an opposition leader narrowly avoiding prison amid a raft of court cases, to millions of people filling the streets in protest to drive out an elected leader, here is a look at some of those recent crucial developments. A nationwide doctors' strike For months, it has been health, not politics, that has been a major focus of many South Koreans. An extended strike by thousands of junior doctors who have refused to see patients or attend surgeries has disrupted operations at hospitals across the country. The strife is especially acute in a nation facing a major demographic crisis. South Korea has one of the fastest aging, fastest shrinking populations in the developed world. There is hardly a family that has not struggled with medical care for loved ones. The strike, which is ongoing, began Feb. 20 in response to a government push to recruit more medical students. Yoon’s government has taken a hard line, warning that doctors must return to work or face license suspensions and prosecutions. He has said the strike poses 'a grave threat to our society.' At issue is the government plan to raise South Korea’s annual medical school admission cap by 2,000 from the current 3,058. The enrollment plan is meant to add up to 10,000 doctors by 2035 to cope with the country’s fast-aging population. Officials say South Korea has 2.1 physicians per 1,000 people — far below the average of 3.7 in the developed world. The striking doctors-in-training predict that doctors in greater competition would overtreat patients, increasing public medical expenses. Some critics say the striking junior doctors simply oppose the government plan because they believe adding more doctors would result in lower incomes. A powerful opposition in turmoil Investigations and legal proceedings against major political figures are common in South Korea. Almost all former presidents, or their family members and key associates, have been mired in scandals near the end of their terms or after they left office. The current opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, a firebrand liberal who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, has also been dogged by corruption claims. Lee, who was stabbed in an attack and underwent surgery earlier this year, says Yoon's promotion of divisive politics has worsened an already toxic national discourse. Last month Lee was convicted of violating election law and sentenced to a suspended prison term for making false statements during a presidential campaign. He faces three other trials over corruption and other criminal charges. It remains unclear whether the Supreme Court will decide on any of the cases before the next presidential vote in March 2027. Lee has steadfastly denied wrongdoing. It’s unclear, of course, how events in coming days will play out, but the martial law declaration could be a boon to Lee, especially if it results in an early exit for Yoon and a presidential by-election. On Wednesday, he livestreamed himself climbing over a wall near parliament, one of a wave of lawmakers who dodged troops and police to get into the National Assembly. Massive protests drive an elected president out of office Perhaps the most epochal event in recent South Korean political history — and the one many people will be thinking of as Yoon faces the consequences of his declaration — was the downfall of conservative former President Park Geun-hye. After near-daily protests in 2016 that saw millions take to the streets around the country, Park was the first democratically elected leader to be forced from office since democracy came to South Korea in the late 1980s. Park, who was pardoned in late 2021 by her liberal rival and successor, former President Moon Jae-in, was serving a lengthy prison term for bribery and other crimes. Park, the daughter of assassinated dictator Park Chung-hee, won election as South Korea’s first female president in late 2012 by beating Moon by a million votes. Conservatives celebrated her father as a hero who pulled the country up from postwar poverty despite his suppression of human rights. She was impeached by lawmakers in late 2016 and was formally removed from office and arrested the following year. Among the main charges she faced was collusion with her longtime confidante, Choi Soon-sil, to take millions of dollars in bribes and extortion from some of the country’s largest business groups, including Samsung, while she was in office. Park has described herself as a victim of political revenge.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-context-eb59571aa1ff36ca22f8427b39bb7133	2024-12-03T22:26:42-08:00	
New UN aid chief vows 'ruthlessness' to prioritize spending as funding for world's crises shrinks	GENEVA (AP) — The new head of the U.N. humanitarian aid agency says it will be 'ruthless' when prioritizing how to spend money, a nod to challenges in fundraising for civilians in war zones like Gaza, Sudan, Syria and Ukraine. Tom Fletcher, a longtime British diplomat who took up the U.N. post last month, said his agency is asking for less money in 2025 than this year. He said it wants to show 'we will focus and target the resources we have,' even as crises grow more numerous, intense and long-lasting. His agency, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, on Wednesday issued its global appeal for 2025, seeking $47 billion to help 190 million people in 32 countries — though it estimates 305 million worldwide need help. 'The world is on fire, and this is how we put it out,' he told reporters on Tuesday. The office and many other aid groups, including the international Red Cross, have seen donations shrink in recent years for longtime trouble spots like Syria, South Sudan, the Middle East and Congo and newer ones like Ukraine and Sudan. Aid access has been difficult in some places, especially Sudan and Gaza. The office's appeal for $50 billion for this year was only 43% fulfilled as of last month. One consequence of that shortfall was a 80% reduction in food aid for Syria, which has seen a sudden escalation in fighting in recent days. Such funds go to U.N. agencies and more than 1,500 partner organizations. The biggest asks for 2025 are for Syria — a total of $8.7 billion for needs both within the country and for neighbors that have taken in Syrian refugees — as well as Sudan at a total of $6 billion, the 'Occupied Palestinian Territory' at $4 billion, Ukraine at about $3.3 billion and Congo at nearly $3.2 billion. Fletcher said his office needs to be 'ruthless' in choosing to reach people most in need. 'I choose that word carefully, because it's a judgement call — that ruthlessness — about prioritizing where the funding goes and where we can have the greatest impact,' he said. 'It's a recognition that we have struggled in previous years to raise the money we need.' In response to questions about how much President-elect Donald Trump of the United States — the U.N.'s biggest single donor — will spend on humanitarian aid, Fletcher said he expects to spend 'a lot of time' in Washington over the next few months to talk with the new administration. 'America is very much on our minds at the moment,' he said, acknowledging some governments 'will be more questioning of what the United Nations does and less ideologically supportive of this humanitarian effort' laid out in the new report. This year has been the deadliest on record for humanitarians and U.N. staff, largely due to the Middle East conflict triggered by Palestinian militants' deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack in Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-humanitarian-aid-syria-trump-d61485754e1c03039332a30119dab403	2024-12-03T20:18:34-08:00	
Who is Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of Syria's shock insurgency?	BEIRUT (AP) — Over the past dozen years, Syrian militant leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has worked to remake his public image and the insurgency he commands, renouncing longtime ties to al-Qaida and consolidating power before emerging from the shadows. Now al-Golani, 42, seeks to seize the moment yet again, leading his fighters in a stunning offensive that has put them in control of Syria’s largest city, reigniting the country's long civil war and raising new questions about President Bashar Assad’s hold on power. The surge and al-Golani's place at the head of it are evidence of a remarkable transformation. Al-Golani's success on the battlefield follows years of maneuvering among extremist organizations while eliminating competitors and former allies. Along the way he moved to distance himself from al-Qaida, polishing his image and his extremist group's de-facto 'salvation government' in an attempt to win over international governments and the country’s religious and ethnic minorities. Putting himself forward as a champion of pluralism and tolerance, al-Golani's rebranding efforts sought to broaden his group's public support and legitimacy. Still, it had been years since Syria’s opposition forces, based in the country's northwest, made any substantial military progress against Assad. The Syrian president's government, with backing from Iran and Russia, has maintained its control of about 70 percent of the country in a stalemate that had left al-Golani and his jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, out of the spotlight. But the rebels' descent on Aleppo and nearby towns, alongside a coalition of Turkish-backed armed groups dubbed the Syrian National Army, has shaken up Syria’s tense detente and left the war-torn country’s neighbors in Jordan, Iraq, and Lebanon worried about this flareup spilling over. Al-Golani's beginnings in Iraq Al-Golani’s ties to al-Qaida stretch back to 2003 when he joined extremists battling U.S. troops in Iraq. The native of Syria was detained several times by the U.S. military, but remained in Iraq. During that time, al-Qaida usurped likeminded groups and formed the extremist Islamic State of Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In 2011, a popular uprising against Syria's Assad triggered a brutal government crackdown and led to all-out war. Al-Golani's prominence grew when al-Baghdadi sent him to Syria to establish a branch of al-Qaida called the Nusra Front. The United States labeled the new group as a terrorist organization. That designation still remains in place and the U.S. government has put a $10 million bounty on him. The Nusra Front and the Syrian conflict As Syria's civil war intensified in 2013, so did al-Golani’s ambitions. He defied al-Baghdadi’s calls to dissolve the Nusra Front and merge it with al-Qaida's operation in Iraq, to form the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Al-Golani nonetheless pledged his allegiance to al-Qaida, which later disassociated itself from ISIS. The Nusra Front battled ISIS and eliminated much of its competition among the Syrian armed opposition to Assad. In his first interview in 2014, al-Golani kept his face covered, telling a reporter for Qatari network Al-Jazeera that he rejected political talks in Geneva to end the conflict. He said his goal was to see Syria ruled under Islamic law and made clear that there was no room for the country's Alawite, Shiite, Druze, and Christian minorities. Consolidating power and rebranding In 2016, al-Golani revealed his face to the public for the first time in a video message that announced his group was renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and cutting its ties to al-Qaida. 'This new organization has no affiliation to any external entity,' he said in the video, filmed wearing military garb and a turban. The move paved the way for al-Golani to assert full control over fracturing militant groups. A year later, his alliance rebranded again as HTS as the groups merged, consolidating al-Golani’s power in northwest Syria’s Idlib province. Afterward HTS clashed with independent Islamist militants who opposed the merger, further emboldening al-Golani and and his group as the leading power in northwestern Syria, able to rule with an iron fist. With his power consolidated, al-Golani set in motion a transformation that few could have imagined. Replacing his military garb with shirt and trousers, he began calling for religious tolerance and pluralism. He appealed to the Druze community in Idlib, which the Nusra Front had previously targeted, and visited the families of Kurds who were killed by Turkish-backed militias. In 2021, al-Golani had his first interview with an American journalist on PBS. Wearing a blazer, with his short hair gelled back, the now more soft-spoken HTS leader said that his group posed no threat to the West and that sanctions imposed against it were unjust. 'Yes, we have criticized Western policies,' he said. 'But to wage a war against the United States or Europe from Syria, that’s not true. We didn’t say we wanted to fight.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-insurgency-alqaida-algolani-0c11961094ca4fb7fe1bccce1c4b3302	2024-12-03T20:12:21-08:00	
Power shortages in Ecuador are melting away the future of a small town’s ice-cream industry	SALCEDO, Ecuador (AP) — Ice-cream production in Salcedo, a quaint town in Ecuador's central highlands, began in the mid-20th century, born from the ingenuity of Franciscan nuns. Locals say the sisters would drink fruit shakes made with milk from the region’s dairy farms until one of them began collecting the leftovers, turning them into creamy popsicles that became an overnight sensation. The nuns sold the popsicles in town to gather funds for the poor. But the people of Salcedo saw a business opportunity and began experimenting with new flavors and techniques, establishing a thriving popsicle industry that has made their small town famous among ice-cream lovers. However, a recent wave of power outages, triggered by a prolonged dry spell, is threatening the future of Salcedo’s ice-cream industry and melting away its dreams of a more prosperous future. The daily power outages that began earlier this year and intensified in September can last up to 14 hours. They have come about due to drier than usual weather in Ecuador, which relies heavily on hydroelectric plants. During most months of the year, hydroelectric plants produce between 70% to 90% Ecuador’s electricity. The nation of 17 million people invested heavily in dams over the past two decades, but it is now struggling to come up with alternatives. 'We are living through the worst third-world conditions,' said Gabriel Pumasunta, owner of the Polar Bear ice-cream factory. 'We're plunged into darkness.' Pumasunta, who runs the small company with his two brothers, said that if the power outages continue this month, they will have no choice but to shut down the plant. 'We will have to work elsewhere,' he said. Pumasunta said that power outages have halted production and storage, causing much of his product to melt. Before outages intensified in September, Polar Bear was producing 60,000 popsicles per month, Salcedo said. Now, the small company makes 10,000 popsicles per month, and it has been forced to let go of eight of its 10 employees. To stay afloat, Pumasunta has dipped into the company’s savings and those of his family. He now works on the plant’s machines himself, taking care of deliveries to bring down costs, while his parents have also stepped up to help. President Daniel Noboa, who was elected last year in a special election that followed the resignation of Ecuador’s previous president, has not been able to solve the electricity crisis. The chamber of commerce in Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, estimates that power outages are generating weekly losses of $700 million for Ecuadorian businesses. Germán Soria, president of the association of artisanal ice-cream makers, said that before the power crisis, Salcedo had 80 small- and medium-sized ice-cream plants and three large factories. Now, 30 of these smaller plants have been forced to close. Soria’s own ice-cream plant, housed in a shed behind his house, now sits empty. He said he stopped production three weeks ago and has been forced to sell some equipment, as well as a plot of land to cover his debts. He said that the outages, which occur at unexpected times, make it hard to plan production. 'Our clients are also less keen to buy ice-cream, because they’re not sure if they can keep the popsicles from melting.' According to local officials, the power crisis has cost 300 jobs in Salcedo, a town renowned for its fruit-flavored ice-cream, including flavors such as blackberries, and taxo, an aromatic and somewhat acidic fruit that resembles passion fruit. President Noboa has promised that power shortages in Ecuador will end this month, but analysts doubt his claim, saying the country lacks the capacity to make up for a 1,900-megawatt deficit. The Ecuadorian government has bought and rented dozens of large electric generators that run on fossil fuels and are expected to arrive in the following weeks. But as Marco Acuña, the president of Ecuador's national guild of engineers, notes: 'They do not have the capacity to make up for the current deficit.' Meanwhile in Salcedo, the collapse of the local ice-cream industry has rippled through the local economy, impacting dairy farms, fruit growers, transporters and mom-and-pop stores that specialized in selling the famous popsicles. 'Before (the power cuts) we would buy up to 150 popsicles a day,' said Maria Juliette López, who owns a small shop on the Panamerican highway where tourists and truck drivers stop to buy snacks. 'Now we can only take up to 40 popsicles a day, because any product that is left over will melt' when her freezer stops working, she said. While the power outages appear to be hitting small- and medium-sized producers and vendors the most, Salcedo’s three largest ice-cream factories say they have also been impacted. One of those is Corp Ice-Cream, whose factory used to buzz with activity at noon, with its 35 employees working hard to produce up to 20,000 popsicles per day. But during a recent visit to the plant, there was only one employee sweeping in the dark, due to the lack of power. Paco Hinojosa, the company's manager, said Corp Ice Cream managed to stay afloat thanks to its customers in the United States, which order 120,000 popsicles per month during the summer. But the winter months bring a halt to U.S. exports, which won't resume until around March. Corp Ice Cream’s sales in Ecuador have gone down by 40% since the power outages began in mid September and that is taking a toll on its suppliers. 'We used to buy 2,500 liters of milk and 160 liters of cream each day,' Hinojosa said. 'Now we have cut down our orders by half — and the same goes for fruit.'

Amtrak Joe' Biden uses his visit to Angola to promote a major African rail project	LUANDA, Angola (AP) — Even in the waning days of his presidency and thousands of miles from home, U.S. President Joe Biden is finding ways to celebrate trains. Biden is using his third and final day in Angola to showcase the Lobito Corridor railway, where the U.S. and key allies are investing heavily to refurbish 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) of train lines in Zambia, Congo and Angola. The project aims to advance the U.S. presence in a region rich in cobalt, copper and other critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies. By the end of the decade, the rail line could even go a long way toward linking southern Africa's western coast with the continent's eastern edge. 'I’m probably the most pro-rail guy in America,' Biden, the first U.S. president to visit Angola, said during a speech Tuesday evening. Biden has long had the nickname Amtrak Joe for the 36 years he spent commuting by U.S. train from his home in Delaware to Washington while in the Senate. He said the Lobito Corridor constituted the largest U.S. investment in a train project outside the country. On Wednesday, Biden will fly from the capital of Luanda to Lobito on Africa's western coast to tour port facilities with Angolan President João Lourenço, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Tanzanian Vice President Philip Mpango. The leaders also plan to meet with representatives from companies that stand to benefit from the corridor project, including a telecommunication firm expanding cell service in the region, a food-production firm and Acrow Bridge, a Pennsylvania company that makes prefabricated steel bridges and has a contract to deliver nearly 200 to Angola. The Biden administration says the corridor will help business interests and counter China's growing influence in Africa — in addition to satisfying a president obsessed with riding the rails. In Lobito, Biden will announce $600 million in new U.S. investment for projects associated with the corridor, which has also drawn financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks. The administration says it currently can take cargo loads of materials about 45 days to get from eastern Congo or Zambia to the market, and usually involves going by truck to South Africa. Test loads run using the new rail corridor made the same journey in around 40 to 50 hours. China, meanwhile, already has heavy investments in mining and processing African minerals, and has used its Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure strategy to promote its economic and political influence around the world. In September, China said it had signed a deal with Tanzania and Zambia to revamp a separate railway line going east from Zambia to Tanzania’s Dar es Salaam on the east coast of Africa. The countries had previously worked together to build the railway line in the 1970s, but it fell into disrepair. China’s move to renovate it — announced on the sidelines of this year’s China-Africa forum — is seen by some analysts as the Chinese response to the Lobito Corridor. A senior U.S. administration official called the Lobito Corridor the heart of competing with China, not as a political adversary but from a business standpoint. The idea is, rather than pumping in simple aid, Washington will attempt to grow U.S. influence by promoting projects that can spark investment and therefore help communities and countries over the long haul. The Lobito Corridor has become a model approach that the U.S. is looking to replicate in other parts of the world, said the official, who briefed reporters during Biden's Angola visit on condition of anonymity to offer project details that haven't yet been made public. The corridor won't be completed for years, meaning much of the continued work would come during the administration of Republican Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20. The Biden White House says that Republicans in Congress and elsewhere have supported past efforts to promote African business interests through targeted investments and that such initiatives have appealed to Trump and his key advisers in the past. ___ Associated Press writer Gerald Imray in Cape Town, South Africa, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-lobito-corridor-us-china-investment-f5dd55e80331f2416136ff34bab60d4d	2024-12-03T20:08:40-08:00	
Australia is banning social media for people under 16. Could this work elsewhere — or even there?	It is an ambitious social experiment of our moment in history — one that experts say could accomplish something that parents, schools and other governments have attempted with varying degrees of success: keeping kids off social media until they turn 16. Australia's new law, approved by its Parliament last week, is an attempt to swim against many tides of modern life — formidable forces like technology, marketing, globalization and, of course, the iron will of a teenager. And like efforts of the past to protect kids from things that parents believe they're not ready for, the nation's move is both ambitious and not exactly simple, particularly in a world where young people are often shaped, defined and judged by the online company they keep. The ban won't go into effect for another year. But how will Australia be able to enforce it? That's not clear, nor will it be easy. TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram have become so ingrained in young people's lives that going cold turkey will be difficult. Other questions loom. Does the ban limit kids' free expression and — especially for those in vulnerable groups — isolate them and curtail their opportunity to connect with members of their community? And how will social sites verify people's ages, anyway? Can't kids just get around such technicalities, as they so often do? This is, after all, the 21st century — an era when social media is the primary communications tool for most of those born in the past 25 years who, in a fragmented world, seek the common cultures of trends, music and memes. What happens when big swaths of that fall away? Is Australia's initiative a good, long-time-coming development that will protect the vulnerable, or could it become a well-meaning experiment with unintended consequences? Platforms will be held liable The law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts. 'It’s clear that social media companies have to be held accountable, which is what Australia is trying to do,' said Jim Steyer, president and CEO of the nonprofit Common Sense Media. Leaders and parents in countries around the world are watching Australia’s policy closely as many seek to protect young kids from the internet's dangerous corners — and, not incidentally, from each other. Most nations have taken different routes, from parental consent requirements to minimum age limits. Many child safety experts, parents and even teens who have waited to get on social media consider Australia's move a positive step. They say there’s ample reason to ensure that children wait. 'What’s most important for kids, just like adults, is real human connection. Less time alone on the screen means more time to connect, not less,' said Julie Scelfo, the founder of Mothers Against Media Addiction, or MAMA, a grassroots group of parents aimed at combatting the harms of social media to children. 'I’m confident we can support our kids in interacting in any number of ways aside from sharing the latest meme.' The harms to children from social media have been well documented in the two decades since Facebook’s launch ushered in a new era in how the world communicates. Kids who spend more time on social media, especially when they are tweens or young teenagers, are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, according to multiple studies — though it is not yet clear if there is a causal relationship. What's more, many are exposed to content that is not appropriate for their age, including pornography and violence, as well as social pressures about body image and makeup. They also face bullying, sexual harassment and unwanted advances from their peers as well as adult strangers. Because their brains are not fully developed, teenagers, especially younger ones the law is focused on, are also more affected by social comparisons than adults, so even happy posts from friends can send them into a negative spiral. What unintended harms could be caused? Many major initiatives, particularly those aimed at social engineering, can produce side effects — often unintended. Could that happen here? What, if anything, do kids stand to lose by separating kids and the networks in which they participate? Paul Taske, associate director of litigation at the tech lobbying group NetChoice, says he considers the ban 'one of the most extreme violations of free speech on the world stage today' even as he expressed relief that the First Amendment prevents such law in the United States 'These restrictions would create a massive cultural shift,' Taske said. 'Not only is the Australian government preventing young people from engaging with issues they’re passionate about, but they’re also doing so even if their parents are ok with them using digital services,' he said. 'Parents know their children and their needs the best, and they should be making these decisions for their families — not big government. That kind of forcible control over families inevitably will have downstream cultural impacts.' David Inserra, a fellow for Free Expression and Technology, Cato Institute, called the bill 'about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike' in a recent blog post. While Australia's law doesn't require 'hard verification' such as an uploaded ID, he said, it calls for effective 'age-assurance' that includes an array of ways companies can estimate someone's age. He said no verification system can ensure accuracy while also protecting privacy and not impacting adults in the process. Privacy advocates have also raised concerns about the law's effect on online anonymity, a cornerstone of online communications — and something that can protect teens on social platforms. 'Whether it be religious minorities and dissidents, LGBTQ youth, those in abusive situations, whistleblowers, or countless other speakers in tricky situations, anonymous speech is a critical tool to safely challenge authority and express controversial opinions,' Inserra said. 'But if every user of online platforms must first identify themselves, then their anonymity is at risk.' Other countries are trying to figure it out, too Parents in Britain and across Europe earlier this year organized on platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram to promise not to buy smartphones for children younger than 12 or 13. This approach costs almost no money and requires no government enforcement. In the United States, some parents are keeping kids off social media either informally or as part of an organized campaign such as Wait Until 8th, a group that helps parents delay kids' access to social media and phones. This fall, Norway announced plans to ban kids under 15 from using social media, while France is testing a smartphone ban for kids under 15 in a limited number of schools — a policy that could be rolled out nationwide if successful. U.S. lawmakers have held multiple congressional hearings — most recently in January — on child online safety. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook’s founding. In July, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation designed to protect children from dangerous online content, pushing forward with what would be the first major effort by Congress in decades to hold tech companies more accountable. But the Kids Online Safety Act has since stalled in the House. While several states have passed laws requiring age verification, those are stuck in court. Utah became the first state to pass laws regulating children’s social media use in 2023. In September, a judge issued the preliminary injunction against the law, which would have required social media companies to verify the ages of users, apply privacy settings and limit some features. NetChoice has also obtained injunctions temporarily halting similar laws in several other states. And last May, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said there is insufficient evidence to show social media is safe for kids. He urged policymakers to address the harms of social media the same way they regulate things like car seats, baby formula, medication and other products children use. Said Scelfo: 'Why should social media products be any different? Kids may try to get around the restrictions — just like they do for alcohol, tobacco or drugs — but nobody is saying that because they try, we should give them unfettered access to them. Parents cannot possibly bear the entire responsibility of keeping children safe online, because the problems are baked into the design of the products. And so we need policies that hold Big Tech accountable for ensuring their products are safe.' ___ Associated Press Writer Laurie Kellman contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/social-media-ban-australia-kids-4dda8d92bd4b896ff502482b6736ab24	2024-12-03T20:07:17-08:00	
Philippines says China's coast guard blasts water cannon and sideswipes patrol vessel	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Chinese coast guard vessels, backed by navy ships, fired powerful water cannons and blocked and sideswiped a Philippine patrol vessel Wednesday in renewed aggression in a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, Philippine officials said. Three Philippine coast guard and bureau of fisheries vessels were on routine patrol to protect Filipino fishermen at the Scarborough Shoal when several Chinese coast guard and navy ships approached and staged 'aggressive actions' after dawn, the Philippine coast guard said. There was no immediate comment from Chinese officials. In the past, they have repeatedly cited China’s sovereignty in the contested offshore region and their determination to defend what they say is their territory despite a 2016 international arbitration decision that invalidated Beijing’s historical claims. China’s reported actions in the disputed waters came after a respite of more than a month while back-to-back major storms prevented many Philippine fishing and commercial vessels from venturing into the dangerously rough seas. Despite the Chinese ships’ 'reckless' maneuvers, the Philippines coast guard and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resource renewed their 'commitment to protecting the rights and safety of our fishermen within our maritime jurisdiction.' 'We will continue to be vigilant in safeguarding our national interests in the West Philippine Sea, the two Philippine law enforcement agencies said, using the Philippine name for the seas off the archipelago's western coast. China’s sweeping claims virtually cover the entire waterway and overlap with the territorial waters, exclusive economic zones and high seas claims of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Indonesia has also had confrontations with the Chinese coast guard, which backs Beijing’s fishing fleets. One of the Philippine vessels, BRP Datu Pagbuaya, was hit Wednesday by high-pressure water fired from a Chinese coast guard ship with bow number 3302 which targeted its navigational antennas about 16 nautical miles (30 kilometers) south of Scarborough, Manila’s coast guard said. Shortly after, the Chinese coast guard ship 'intentionally sideswiped the BRP Datu Pagbuaya on its starboard side' then 'launched a second water cannon attack on the same vessel,' the Philippine coast guard said. Philippine coast guard ship BRP Teresa Magbanua 'faced blocking, shadowing and dangerous maneuvers' by two Chinese navy and coast guard ships. Another Philippine coast guard ship, the BRP Cabra, 'was subjected to reckless maneuvers' by a Chinese coast guard ship at a distance of about 300 yards (274 meters), according to Philippine coast guard officials. The long-simmering territorial disputes are an Asian flashpoint and are a delicate fault line in the U.S.-China rivalry in the region. The U.S. lays no claims in the waters that are a key global trade route but has declared that freedom of navigation and overflight and the peaceful resolution of the conflicts were in its core national interest. The U.S. has warned that it’s obligated to defend its treaty ally the Philippines if Filipino forces come under attack in the South China Sea.	https://apnews.com/article/china-philippines-disputed-scarborough-shoal-south-china-sea-77e94f6acc69153bd7a9acc187027f9e	2024-12-03T19:06:04-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian stocks slide after South Korea's political drama, but Kospi falls only 2%	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian markets retreated Wednesday after overnight political drama in South Korea added to regional uncertainties, though the Kospi in Seoul fell less than 2%. U.S. futures rose while oil prices were little changed. South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol suddenly declared martial law on Tuesday night local time, prompting troops to surround the parliament. He accused pro-North Korean forces of plotting to overthrow one of the world’s most vibrant democracies. The martial law was revoked about six hours later. On Wednesday, South Korea’s main opposition party called for President Yoon to resign immediately or face impeachment. Yoon's move initially caused the won to plummet to a two-year low against the U.S. dollar, with losses of up to 2%, the sharpest one-day drop since the market’s seismic reaction to Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory. The won recovered some of those losses on Wednesday. The dollar was trading at 1,414.43 won, down from Tuesday's peak at 1,443.40. South Korea’s Kospi lost 1.9% to 2,451.64. Shares of Samsung Electronics, the country's biggest company, fell 1.1%. Meanwhile, the country’s financial regulator said they were prepared to deploy 10 trillion won ($7.07 billion) into a stock market stabilization fund at any time, the Yonhap news agency reported. Elsewhere in the region, China announced Tuesday it was banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony, and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications. Beijing took the measure after the U.S. expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software, and high-bandwidth memory chips. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added less than 0.1% to 19,752.59, while the Shanghai Composite edged down 0.1% to 3,375.20. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 0.4% to 39,077.04. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 0.5% to 8,454.10. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks tiptoed to more records, tacking a touch more onto what’s already been a stellar year. The S&amp;P 500 edged up less than 0.1% to 6,049.88, setting an all-time high for the 55th time this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2% to 44,705.53, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.4% to 19,480.91, hitting its own record set a day earlier. Treasury yields held relatively steady after a report showed U.S. employers were advertising slightly more job openings at the end of October than a month earlier. Continued strength there would raise optimism that the economy could remain out of a recession that many investors had earlier worried was inevitable. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.23% from 4.20% from late Monday. Yields have seesawed since Election Day on worries that Trump’s preferences for lower tax rates and bigger tariffs could spur higher inflation. But traders are still confident the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate again at its next meeting in two weeks. They’re betting on a nearly three-in-four chance of that, according to data from CME Group. Lower rates can give the economy a lift but also tend to fuel inflation. A report this week that could guide the Fed’s next move will be Friday's jobs report, which will show how many workers U.S. employers hired and fired during November. It could be difficult to parse given how much storms and strikes distorted figures in October. Based on trading in the options market, Friday’s jobs report appears to be the biggest potential market mover until the Fed announces its next decision on interest rates Dec. 18, according to strategists at Barclays Capital. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude lost 5 cents to $69.99 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 7 cents to $73.69 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 149.75 Japanese yen from 149.59 yen. The euro cost $1.0495, down from $1.0510. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-korea-inflation-rates-d8b662da846c8ae5b32ab3a91e3529f9	2024-12-03T18:58:41-08:00	
South Korean President Yoon is urged to resign or face impeachment over martial law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s main opposition party on Wednesday urged President Yoon Suk Yeol to resign immediately or face impeachment, hours after Yoon ended short-lived martial law that prompted troops to encircle parliament before lawmakers voted to lift it. Yoon has publicly responded to the opposition’s demand. But his office said senior presidential advisers and secretaries for Yoon offered to resign collectively and the president also put off his official Wednesday morning schedule. In the capital, tourists and residents walked around, traffic and construction were heard, and other than crowds of police holding shields, it seemed like a normal sunny, cold December morning. On Tuesday night, Yoon abruptly imposed the emergency martial law, vowing to eliminate 'anti-state' forces after he struggled to push forward his agenda in the opposition-dominated parliament. But his martial law was effective for only about six hours, as the National Assembly voted to overrule the president. The declaration was formally lifted around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting. The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the 300-seat parliament, said Wednesday that its lawmakers decided to call on Yoon to quit immediately or they would take steps to impeach him. 'President Yoon Suk Yeol’s martial law declaration was a clear violation of the constitution. It didn’t abide by any requirements to declare it,' the Democratic Party said in a statement. 'His martial law declaration was originally invalid and a grave violation of the constitution. It was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment.' Impeaching him would require support from two-thirds of the parliament, or 200 of its 300 members. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together have 192 seats. But when the parliament rejected Yoon’s martial law declaration in a 190-0 vote, 18 lawmakers from Yoon’s ruling People Power Party cast ballots supporting the rejection, according to National Assembly officials. The leader of the People Power Party, Han Dong-hun, who has long ties with Yoon dating to their days as prosecutors, criticized Yoon’s martial law declaration as 'unconstitutional.' If Yoon is impeached, he’ll be stripped of his constitutional powers until the Constitutional Court can rule on his fate. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the No. 2 position in the South Korean government, would take over his presidential responsibilities. Yoon’s martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, harkened to South Korea’s past military-backed governments when authorities occasionally proclaimed martial law and other decrees that allowed them to station combat soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or at public places like schools to prevent anti-government demonstrations. Such scenes of military intervention had not been seen since South Korea achieved a genuine democracy in the late 1980s until Tuesday night. After Yoon’s declaration, troops carrying full battle gear, including assault rifles, tried to keep protesters away from the National Assembly as military helicopters flew overhead and landed nearby. One soldier pointed his assault rifle at a woman who was among protesters outside the building demanding that the martial law be lifted. It wasn’t clear how the 190 lawmakers were able to enter a parliamentary hall to vote down Yoon’s martial law decree. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung livestreamed himself climbing over the wall, and while troops and police officers blocked some from entering they didn’t aggressively restrain or use force against others. No major violence has been reported. The troops and police personnel were later seen leaving the grounds of the National Assembly after the parliamentary vote to lift the martial law. National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said: 'Even with our unfortunate memories of military coups, our citizens have surely observed the events of today and saw the maturity of our military.' Han, the People Power Party leader, demanded that Yoon explain his decision and fire Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who he said recommended the martial law decree to Yoon. The Defense Ministry has not commented. Under South Korea’s constitution, the president can declare martial law during 'wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states' that require the use of military force to restrict the freedom of press, assembly and other rights to maintain order. Many observers question whether South Korea is currently in such a state. The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote. Some experts say Yoon clearly violated the constitution in how he imposed martial law. While martial law allows 'special measures' to restrict individual freedoms and the authority of agencies and courts, the constitution does not permit the functions of parliament to be restricted. But in following Yoon’s declaration on Tuesday, South Korea’s military proclaimed parliamentary activities were suspended and deployed troops to try to block lawmakers from entering the National Assembly. Park Chan-dae, the Democratic Party’s floor leader, called for Yoon to be immediately investigated on charges of rebellion over the way he deployed troops to the parliament. While the president mostly enjoys immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to alleged rebellion or treason. In Washington, the White House said the U.S. was 'seriously concerned' by the events in Seoul. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said President Joe Biden’s administration was not notified in advance of the martial law announcement and was in contact with the South Korean government. Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said there was no effect on the more than 27,000 U.S. service members based in South Korea. In Seoul, the streets seemed busy like a normal day Wednesday. Tourist Stephen Rowan, from Brisbane, Australia, who was touring Gyeongbokgung Palace, said he was not concerned at all. 'But then again, I don’t understand too much about the political status in Korea,' he said. 'But I hear they are now calling for the current president’s resignation, so ... apparently there’s going to be a lot of demonstrations. ... I would have been concerned if martial law had stayed enforced.' Yoon’s government and ruling party have been embroiled in an impasse with the Democratic Party over next year’s budget bill and a Democratic Party-led attempt to to impeach three top prosecutors. During his televised announcement, Yoon also described the opposition as 'shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces who are plundering the freedom and happiness of our citizens.' He did not elaborate. North Korea had no immediate comments. Natalia Slavney, research analyst at the Stimson Center’s 38 North website that focuses on Korean affairs, said Yoon’s imposition of martial law was 'a serious backslide of democracy' that followed a 'worrying trend of abuse' since he took office in 2022. South Korea 'has a robust history of political pluralism and is no stranger to mass protests and swift impeachments,' Slavney said, citing the example of former President Park Geun-hye, who was ousted from office and imprisoned for bribery and other crimes in 2017. She was later pardoned. ___ Associated Press writer Jennifer McDermott contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-25a2a7c957e77a19f771b6b7c56a2173	2024-12-03T16:14:46-08:00	
Artist Jasleen Kaur wins Turner Prize for work exploring her Scottish Sikh identity	LONDON (AP) — An artist whose work exploring her Scottish Sikh identity includes a vintage Ford car draped in a crocheted doily won the U.K.’s prestigious Turner Prize on Tuesday, during a ceremony picketed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators. Jasleen Kaur was awarded the 25,000-pound ($32,000) prize by actor James Norton at the Tate Britain gallery in London. Kaur used her acceptance speech to express support for scores of demonstrators outside. She is among signatories to a letter demanding Tate, which runs several major British art museums, cut ties with donors who are linked to Israel over its war in Gaza. 'This is not a radical demand,' Kaur said. 'This should not risk an artist’s career or safety. 'We need a proper ceasefire now,' she said. The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to Hamas health officials in Gaza. Israel launched the war in response to the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023 cross-border attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 hostage. A jury led by Tate Britain director Alex Farquhar praised the way 38-year-old Kaur 'weaves together the personal, political and spiritual' through 'unexpected and playful combinations of material.' Her winning exhibition mixes sculpture, print, everyday items — including family photos, a Ford Escort car and the popular Scottish soda Irn Bru — and immersive music to reflect on her upbringing in Glasgow’s Sikh community. Three other finalists – Pio Abad, Claudette Johnson and Delaine Le Bas – received 10,000 pounds ($12,670) each. Named for 19th-century landscape painter J.M.W. Turner and founded in 1984 to reward young artists, the prize helped make stars of shark-pickling artist Damien Hirst, potter Grayson Perry, sculptor Anish Kapoor and filmmaker Steve McQueen. But it has also been criticized for rewarding impenetrable conceptual work and often sparks debate about the value of modern art, with winners such as Hirst’s 'Mother and Child Divided,' which consists of two cows, bisected and preserved in formaldehyde, and Martin Creed’s 'Lights On and Off' -- a room with a light blinking on and off – drawing scorn from sections of the media. In 2019, all four finalists were declared winners after they refused to compete against one another, 'to make a collective statement in the name of commonality, multiplicity and solidarity.' In 2021, all five finalists were collectives rather than individual artists. The award was initially open to artists under 50 but now has no upper age limit. Works by the four finalists are on display until Feb. 16.	https://apnews.com/article/turner-prize-art-winner-jasleen-kaur-9c71eaf1a1b54077ec7abf25015aa603	2024-12-03T11:01:17-08:00	
Namibia will have its first female leader after VP wins presidential election for the ruling party	WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) — Namibia elected its first female leader as Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah was declared the winner Tuesday of a presidential election last week that was tarnished by technical glitches that caused a three-day extension to allow votes to be cast, and rejected as illegal by opposition parties. The 72-year-old Nandi-Ndaitwah won with 57% of the vote, defying predictions that she might be forced into a runoff. Her ruling SWAPO party also retained its parliamentary majority, although by a very thin margin, and extended its 34-year hold on power since the southern African country gained independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990. Namibia, a sparsely populated country of around 3 million on the southwestern coast of Africa, has a reputation for being one of the continent's more stable democracies and the problems around the election have caused consternation. Last Wednesday's vote was marred by shortages of ballot papers and other problems that led election officials to extend voting until Saturday. Opposition parties have said the extension is unconstitutional, and some have pledged to join together in a legal appeal to have the election invalidated. The Electoral Commission of Namibia, which ran the election, rejected opposition calls for a redo of the vote. It has undermined Nandi-Ndaitwah's place in history. She is set to become her country's fifth president since independence and a rare female leader in Africa. She was a member of Namibia's underground independence movement in the 1970s and received part of her higher education in the then-Soviet Union. She was promoted to vice president in February after President Hage Geingob died while in office. Nangolo Mbumba, who became president after Geingob's death, didn't run in the election. The ruling SWAPO party won 51 seats in the parliamentary vote, only just passing the 49 it needed to keep its majority and narrowly avoiding becoming another long-ruling party to be rejected in southern Africa this year. It was SWAPO's worst parliamentary election result. A mood of change has swept across the region, with parties that led their countries out of white minority or colonial rule in neighboring South Africa and Botswana both losing their long-held political dominance. South Africa's African National Congress, which freed the country from the racist system of apartheid, lost its 30-year majority in an election in May and had to form a coalition. Botswana's ruling party was stunningly removed in a landslide in October after governing for 58 years since independence from Britain. Mozambique's long-ruling Frelimo has been accused of rigging an October election and has faced weeks of violent protests against its rule. SWAPO faced similar challenges as those countries, with frustration at high unemployment and economic hardship, especially among young people, driving a desire for era-ending change. In a brief speech after the results were announced late Tuesday night, Nandi-Ndaitwah said Namibians had voted for peace, stability and youth empowerment. 'We are going to do what we promised you during the campaigns. Thank you for your confidence and trust in us,' she said. Nandi-Ndaitwah was also due to address the nation on Wednesday morning. 'SWAPO Wins. Netumbo Wins. Namibia Wins. Now Hard Work,' the ruling party posted on its official account on social media site X. Some opposition parties boycotted the announcement by the Electoral Commission of Namibia at its results center in the capital, Windhoek. The commission has been roundly criticized for its running of the vote, with many angry Namibians complaining they had to wait hours and sometimes over multiple days for the chance to vote. Just over 1 million votes were cast out of 1.4 million registered voters, according to the electoral commission. Panduleni Itula, the leading opposition candidate from the Independent Patriots for Change party, was second in the presidential election with 25% of the vote. His party won the second-largest number of seats in Parliament behind SWAPO. Itula and his party have led the criticism of the vote and said they will lodge their appeal against the election this week. Other opposition parties said they will join that legal challenge. Itula has said that thousands of voters may have been prevented from voting as only some polling stations allowed an extension. 'This election has violated the very tenets of our Electoral Act. Namibians deserve the right to choose their leaders freely and fairly, not through a rigged process,' he said. Namibia is a former German colony that came under South African control after World War I and its Black majority was later subjected to some of South Africa’s apartheid policies. SWAPO was at the forefront of the battle for independence from South Africa. While the country has swaths of desert running through it, it has diamond and uranium resources and untapped oil and gas off its coast that is being explored by international companies and could make it a major producer of both. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/namibia-election-female-leader-president-8ea8783e1aa56ea20d65970e87adc313	2024-12-03T10:36:20-08:00	
South Korea's leader prompts dismay by briefly declaring martial law. Here's what to know	TOKYO (AP) — Troops surround South Korea's parliament overnight when the president declares martial law. He accuses pro-North Korean forces of plotting to overthrow one of the world’s most vibrant democracies. Lawmakers voice outrage and vote to end the declaration, and the president lifts the decree before daybreak. President Yoon Suk Yeol spread fear and confusion through South Korea overnight by issuing his sudden edict late Tuesday, the first martial law declaration since more than four decades ago when the country was controlled by a dictatorship. The declaration, the rushed vote by lawmakers to overturn it and the president's lifting of martial law soon afterward were moments of high drama for an unpopular leader who has struggled with political deadlock in an opposition-dominated parliament and scandals involving him and his wife. While there was no direct evidence presented, Yoon raised the specter of North Korea as a destabilizing force. Yoon has long maintained that a hard line against the North is the only way to stop Pyongyang from following through on its nuclear threats against Seoul. Amid the surreal scenes of troops massing around parliament, here are some things to know as this story unfolds: Details on an 'anti-state' plot are vague Immediately after Yoon's declaration the military chief called in key commanders for talks. South Korean troops set up barricades and then made their way into parliament. The leader of the main opposition, which controls parliament, ordered lawmakers to return to the building, where they eventually voted to lift the declaration of martial law. Yoon lifted the martial law decree around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting. Yoon's declaration had been accompanied by an accusation that the opposition was engaged in 'anti-state activities plotting rebellion.' But he did not explain what that means, and provided no specific evidence. The vague statement is reminiscent of the heavy-handed tactics of the South Korean dictatorships that ended in the late 1980s. A series of strongmen repeatedly invoked North Korea when struggling to control domestic dissidents and political opponents. Lawmakers from both sides voice opposition The opposition lambasted Yoon's move as un-democratic. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon’s announcement 'illegal and unconstitutional.' But the sudden declaration was also opposed by the leader of Yoon's own conservative party, Han Dong-hoon, who called the decision 'wrong' and vowed to 'stop it with the people.' 'The people will block the president’s anti-constitutional step. The military must be on the side of the public in any case. Let’s resolutely oppose it,' Kim Dong Yeon, the opposition party governor of Gyeonggi province, which surrounds Seoul, wrote on X. Average South Koreans were in shock. Social media was flooded with messages expressing surprise and worry over Yoon’s announcement. 'Martial law? I thought it was deepfake content, but is it really a martial law decree?,' one X user wrote. 'I first thought about a war with North Korea when he said he would impose a martial law,' another X user wrote. Yoon is struggling politically There were quick claims that the emergency declaration was linked to Yoon’s political struggles. His approval rating has dropped, and he has had little success in getting his policies adopted by a parliament that has been controlled by the opposition since he took over in 2022. Conservatives have said the opposition moves are political revenge for investigations into the opposition leader, who is seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027. Just this month, Yoon denied wrongdoing in an influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife. The claims have battered his approval ratings and fueled attacks by his rivals. The scandal centers on claims that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee exerted inappropriate influence on the conservative ruling People Power Party to pick a certain candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of Myung Tae-kyun, an election broker and founder of a polling agency who conducted free opinion surveys for Yoon before he became president. Yoon has said he did nothing inappropriate. Martial law is extremely sensitive in South Korea South Korea became a democracy only in the late 1980s, and military intervention in civilian affairs is still a touchy subject. During the dictatorships that emerged as the country rebuilt from the destruction of the 1950-53 Korean War, leaders occasionally proclaimed martial law that allowed them to station combat soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or in public places to prevent anti-government demonstrations. Such scenes are unimaginable for many today. The dictator Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea for nearly 20 years before he was assassinated by his spy chief in 1979, led several thousand troops into Seoul in the early hours of May 16, 1961, in the country’s first successful coup. During his rule, he occasionally proclaimed martial law to crack down on protests and jail critics. Less than two months after Park Chung-hee’s death, Maj. Gen. Chun Doo-hwan led tanks and troops into Seoul in December 1979 in the country’s second successful coup. The next year, he orchestrated a brutal military crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising in the southern city of Gwangju, killing at least 200 people. In the summer of 1987, massive street protests forced Chun’s government to accept direct presidential elections. His army buddy Roh Tae-woo, who had joined Chun’s 1979 coup, won the election held later in 1987 thanks largely to divided votes among liberal opposition candidates. ___ AP writers Kim Tong-hyung and Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-north-korea-emergency-b310df4fece42c27051f58b8951f346f	2024-12-03T09:23:06-08:00	
Demonstrators in Georgia again converge on parliament after the country's EU bid was suspended	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Thousands of demonstrators in the Georgian capital converged on parliament again on Tuesday, venting outrage against the governing party's decision to suspend negotiations on joining the European Union. Like on five previous nights, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to push back the protesters, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital's central boulevard. Nearly 300 protesters have been detained, and 26 people, including three police officers, have been hospitalized with injuries. 'The more force they use, the angrier people become, because everyone they arrest has relatives, and everyone understands that this is injustice,' said Tamar Kordzaia, a member of Unity National Movement opposition group. Kordzaia voiced confidence that the protesters will achieve their goal of calling new elections and joining the EU, noting that police on Monday 'looked very tired. I am sure we need to withstand a little longer.' The ruling Georgian Dream party retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 parliamentary election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia's help and boycotted parliament sessions. Mass opposition protests sparked by the vote gained new momentum after the governing party's decision on Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. 'We are fighting for our democracy, to protect human rights, human dignity,' said Rusudan Chanturia, who attended Tuesday's protest. Another demonstrator, David Jandieri, said the daily protests must continue until the demonstrators achieve their goal. 'In fact, we do not have another choice,' he said. Georgia’s Interior Ministry said Tuesday that 293 protesters were detained on administrative charges and five arrested on criminal charges. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has refused to recognize the official election results and contested them in the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal on Tuesday. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to lead the opposition demand for a new parliamentary election. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc’s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. It requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The Georgian government’s announcement of the EU accession talks’ suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October’s election as neither free nor fair. On Monday, the EU reiterated its 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of Georgian Dream declared Tuesday that the government is willing to open EU accession talks if the bloc ends its 'blackmail.' 'I want to remind European bureaucrats and politicians, including those who are artificially hindering our country’s European integration, to bring negotiations to the table, and we will sign immediately, on the same day, at that very moment,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-protest-opposition-election-russia-european-union-16efe0ee5041dfd6847d22c64f084674	2024-12-03T08:59:09-08:00	
An Israeli strike kills a shepherd in Lebanon, further shaking the tenuous ceasefire	NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli forces carried out several new drone and artillery strikes in Lebanon on Tuesday, including a deadly strike that the Health Ministry and state media said killed a shepherd, further shaking a tenuous ceasefire meant to end more than a year of fighting with Hezbollah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed keep striking 'with an iron fist' against perceived Hezbollah violations of the truce. His defense minister warned that if the ceasefire collapses, Israel will target not just Hezbollah but the Lebanese state — an expansion of Israel’s campaign. Israel also carried out an airstrike in Syria, saying it killed a senior member of Hezbollah responsible for coordinating with Syria’s army on rearming and resupplying the Lebanese militant group. Israel has repeatedly hit Hezbollah targets in Syria, but Tuesday's attack was a rare public acknowledgement. Syrian state media reported that an Israeli drone strike hit a car in a suburb of the capital Damascus, killing one person. Since the two-month ceasefire in Lebanon began last Wednesday, the U.S.- and French-brokered deal has been rattled by near daily Israeli attacks, although Israel has been vague about the purported Hezbollah violations that prompted them. On Monday, it was shaken by its biggest test yet. Hezbollah fired two projectiles toward an Israeli-held disputed border zone, its first volley since the ceasefire began, saying it was a 'warning' in response to Israel’s strikes. Israel responded with its heaviest barrage of the past week, killing 10 people. On Tuesday, drone strikes hit four places in southern Lebanon, one of them killing the shepherd in the town of Shebaa, the state-run National News Agency said. The Health Ministry confirmed the death. Asked about the strike, the Israeli military said its aircraft struck a Hezbollah militant who posed a threat to troops. Shebaa is situated within a region of border villages where the Israeli military has warned Lebanese civilians not to return, with Israeli troops still present. Israeli forces fired an artillery shell at one location and opened fire with small arms toward a town, the news agency reported. With Tuesday’s death, Israeli strikes since the ceasefire began have killed at least 15 people. Under the terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its fighters, weapons and infrastructure from a broad swath of the south by the end of the initial 60-day phase, pulling them north of the Litani River. Israeli troops are also to pull back to their side of the border. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said any violations of the agreement would be met with 'a maximum response and zero tolerance.' Speaking to troops on Israel’s northern border Tuesday, he said if the war resumes, Israel will widen its strikes beyond the areas where Hezbollah’s activities are concentrated, and 'there will no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon.' The ceasefire ended 14 months of war between Israel and Hezbollah, capped by an intensified Israeli bombardment since late September and ground invasion that killed hundreds of Hezbollah members and civilians in Lebanon and sent more than 1.4 million fleeing their homes. Throughout that fighting, Israel largely refrained from striking critical infrastructure or the Lebanese armed forces, who kept to the sidelines. Israel has said its aim is to push Hezbollah away from the border to allow the return home of tens of thousands of Israelis forced to evacuate from the north since Hezbollah began firing into Israel in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. 'At the moment we are in a ceasefire, I note — a ceasefire, not the end of the war. We have a clear goal to return the residents, to rehabilitate the north,' Netanyahu said at the start of the government meeting Tuesday. 'We are enforcing this ceasefire with an iron fist, acting against any violation, minor or major,' he said. Lebanese officials have accused Israel of violating the ceasefire dozens of times with strikes, overflights of drones and demolitions of homes. When Israel has issued statements about its strikes, it says they were done because of 'hostile' actions by Hezbollah that posed a 'threat to Israeli civilians,' without specifying their nature. Tens of thousands of Lebanese who fled Israel's bombardment in the past months quickly returned to parts of the south after the ceasefire went into effect. In the southern city of Nabatiyeh, bulldozers cleared streets strewn with rubble and debris from destroyed buildings, and electricians worked on fixing power cables in an effort to restore electricity. Imad Yassin returned to find his clothing store destroyed. He hopes the state will provide compensation so he can rebuild. 'Netanyahu is trying to displace us as southern Lebanon citizens,' he said. But like many others, he had little faith Israel would abide by the ceasefire. Hussein Badreddin, a vegetable seller who also returned, said Israel was not committed to the truce. 'The Israelis are breaching the ceasefire whenever they can,' he said. Israel says that under the truce deal, it has the right to retaliate for Hezbollah violations. Speaking to reporters in Washington, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel would not discuss individual allegations of violations. 'We believe the ceasefire continues to be largely holding in place,' he said. The U.S. military announced last week that Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers alongside senior U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein will co-chair a U.S.-led committee that is supposed to monitor the ceasefire and ensure adherence to it. The committee also includes France, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL, Lebanon, and Israel. Hochstein led over a year of shuttle diplomacy to broker the ceasefire deal, and his role will be temporary until a permanent civilian co-chair is appointed. Under the deal, the Lebanese army and UNIFIL are to increase their presence in south Lebanon to ensure Hezbollah does not return. The Lebanese army, which is supported by the U.S. but has suffered severe financial strains in recent years, launched a recruitment drive Tuesday. The military currently has about 80,000 troops, with around 5,000 of them deployed in the south. ___ Abou AlJoud reported from Beirut.

Jill Biden's final foreign trip as first lady will close with her and Trump at Notre Dame cathedral	WASHINGTON (AP) — Jill Biden was departing Tuesday on her final solo foreign trip as first lady, a six-day, four-country jaunt through Italy, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar that wraps with her and President-elect Donald Trump joining other dignitaries in Paris to celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame cathedral. Biden will focus throughout the trip on the issues she has championed as first lady, including support for military families, education, and research into cancer and women's health, and will also highlight U.S. partnerships in these areas with the countries hosting her, according to her office. She is the first Italian American to become first lady and has planned a side trip to her ancestral hometown of Gesso, the tiny Sicilian village where her father's family hailed from. Paris is the final stop to help celebrate the reopening of Notre Dame. The cathedral was painstakingly reconstructed after fire nearly destroyed it five years ago. Trump, who was U.S. president at the time of the fire, announced on Monday that he also will travel to the French capital to join other VIPs attending the high-security event. Jill Biden has become somewhat of a world traveler as first lady. Tuesday's trip will be her 10th solo excursion outside of the U.S.. She also has accompanied her husband, President Joe Biden, on several of his foreign trips. On her own, she has led the U.S. delegations to both the pandemic delayed Tokyo Olympics in 2021 as well as this year's Games in Paris, traveled to Ukraine shortly after the invasion by Russia, and has visited Latin America and Africa. In October, she attended the inauguration of Mexico's first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum. Biden was scheduled to depart Tuesday evening after teaching her English and writing classes at Northern Virginia Community College. She arrives Wednesday at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Catania, Italy, to meet with personnel and deliver remarks as part of Joining Forces, her White House initiative to support military families. Her father, Donald Jacobs, was a Navy signalman during World War II. The first lady then stops in Gesso, Italy, before continuing on to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, for a day's worth of events on Thursday. The schedule includes a tour of Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi as part of the Biden Cancer Moonshot program, and participation in a conversation about the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research at the Milken Institute Middle East and Africa Summit. Biden will also visit with Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, chairwoman of the General Women’s Union and the Family Development Foundation, and president of the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood, in Abu Dhabi. On Friday in Doha, Qatar, the first lady will highlight the two countries' interests in education and health with separate visits to the Qatar Foundation and Weill Cornell Medicine - Qatar, respectively. She'll also be a guest at a dinner banquet hosted by Sheikha Moza bint Nasser to celebrate the royal family wedding of Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and Sheikha Fatima bin Nasser bin Hassan Al Thani at the Al-Wajba Palace in Doha. Biden is the keynote speaker Saturday at the Doha Forum, where policy leaders discuss global challenges, before she travels to Paris for the Notre Dame reopening. She is scheduled to return to Washington on Sunday.	https://apnews.com/article/jill-biden-trump-middle-east-italy-paris-ab8715f71995812b34a25d757603ecf2	2024-12-03T07:00:35-08:00	
Trudeau to meet with Canadian opposition leaders to discuss US relations after Trump tariff threat	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will have a meeting with all opposition leaders to discuss U.S.-Canada relations after President-elect Donald Trump threatened sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products. A source familiar with the matter said the meeting will happen early Wednesday afternoon. The person spoke on condition of anonymity they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Trudeau successfully employed a 'Team Canada' approach during Trump's first term in office when the free trade deal between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico was renegotiated. But Trudeau's minority government is in a much weaker position politically now and faces an election within a year. 'I would appeal to the opposition leaders, if you look at the history of Canada, we have always stood together when it comes to talking with one voice to the world,' Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said. 'The current leader of the opposition should learn from history. The best way to promote Canada’s interest, our workers and our industry, is to speak with one voice.' Trudeau returned home after a dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Friday without assurances the president-elect would back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner. The Republican president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. Trump called Friday's talks 'productive' but signaled no retreat from his pledge to enact the tariffs as one of his first executive orders when he takes office in January. Canada, which says Trump is unfairly lumping it in with Mexico, is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. During Trump’s first term, his move to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA, and reports that he was considering a 25% tariff on the auto sector were considered an existential threat in Canada. Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to Washington, told The Associated Press on Sunday that Trudeau was successful in getting Trump and key Cabinet nominees to understand that there is no comparison between the Canada-U.S. border and Mexico-U.S. border. Hillman, who sat at an adjacent table to Trudeau and Trump, said Canada is ready to make new investments in border security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers. The flows of migrants and seizures of drugs are vastly different. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with irregular migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing for national security.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-tariffs-trudeau-trade-opposition-border-5d3dbbb4a701bb1676ee588bfbf2396a	2024-12-03T06:26:35-08:00	
France’s government looks on the brink of collapse. What’s next?	PARIS (AP) — France’s minority government looks in its final hours as opposition lawmakers from the left and the far right vowed to topple Prime Minister Michel Barnier’s Cabinet. A no-confidence vote is scheduled Wednesday at parliament in the wake of a divisive budget debate, with a great chance of being successful. If the motion passes, Barnier's Cabinet would be the shortest-lived government in France's modern history, marking an unprecedented period of political instability. President Emmanuel Macron would be in charge of appointing a new prime minister. Why is the situation so volatile? Following the June-July parliamentary elections, the National Assembly, France’s powerful lower house of parliament, is divided into three major blocs: a left-wing coalition known as the New Popular Front, Macron’s centrist allies and the far-right National Rally party. None of them won an outright majority. In September, Macron asked Barnier, a conservative, to form a government dominated by Republicans and centrists — implicitly relying on the far right's goodwill to be able to stay in power. However, far-right leader Marine Le Pen now says her party will vote for bringing the government down, accusing Barnier of ignoring her demands. Meanwhile, the leftwing coalition denounces an 'austerity budget' and criticizes 'the absence of dialogue and disregard for parliamentary work.' A no-confidence motion requires at least half the votes at the National Assembly, that is 289 out of 577, to pass. Altogether, the left and the far right count over 330 lawmakers — yet some of them may abstain from voting. What if the government falls? Wednesday could see the first no-confidence motion succeed in over six decades. If the government falls, Macron could ask outgoing ministers to handle current affairs pending the appointment of a new prime minister. The parliament's fractured composition would remain the same. No new legislative elections can be held before July, because under the French Constitution, the National Assembly must remain in place for a minimum of one year. No favorite figure to replace Barnier has emerged yet. Macron could pick a politician from his centrist alliance, French media report. The New Popular Front asks for a left-wing Cabinet to be appointed instead. Some opposition lawmakers are calling for Macron to resign, but the French president has previously ruled out that option. How about the budget? France is at no risk of a government shutdown that in the United States would disrupt many services and squeeze federal employees. An outgoing government could present a special law to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year's rules. It would also be able to decide on renewing spending by decree in order to pay civil servants, pensions and other key government expenses. However, this would suspend any potential tax hike — like one initially expected on big companies — and freeze any new spending. In particular, an additional 3.3 billion euro ($3.5 billion) package for the French military was planned as the country supports Ukraine in its war against Russia. Later on, a new government could present its own budget proposals at parliament. Why are markets spooked? In a last-ditch effort to save his government, Barnier warned of ' a big storm and very serious turbulence on the financial markets.' France is under pressure from the European Union’s executive body to reduce its colossal debt. The country’s deficit is estimated to reach 6% of Gross Domestic Product this year and analysts say it could rise to 7% next year without drastic adjustments. The political instability could push up French interest rates, digging the debt even further. In addition, without a clear parliamentary majority, no major reform appears within the reach of a new government.	https://apnews.com/article/france-government-crisis-no-confidence-26555d5c435340bd97f422942f258a0e	2024-12-03T05:55:52-08:00	
Joe Biden's pardon of his son Hunter spurs broader discussion on who else should be granted clemency	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden's decision to break his word and pardon his son Hunter has spurred a broader discussion about what else he should be doing with the broad clemency powers of the presidency before he leaves office in January, including whether he should be pardoning Donald Trump. Biden on Tuesday ducked questions about his son, ignoring calls for him to explain his reversal as he was making his first presidential trip to Angola. He dismissed shouted questions about the matter with a laugh during a meeting with Angolan President João Lourenço at the presidential palace, telling the Angolan delegation: 'Welcome to America.' Biden was not scheduled to take questions from the press during his trip to Africa, and he has largely avoided interactions with reporters since President-elect Trump’s victory last month. Biden’s decision to offer his son a blanket pardon for actions over the past 11 years has sparked a political uproar in Washington, after the president repeatedly had said he would not use his extraordinary powers for the benefit of his family. Biden claimed that the Justice Department had presided over a 'miscarriage of justice' in prosecuting his son, using some of the same language that Trump uses to describe his own legal predicaments. Biden's reversal drew criticism from many Democrats, who are working to calibrate their approach to Trump as he prepares to take over the Oval Office in seven weeks. There is concern the pardon — and Biden's claims that his son was prosecuted for political reasons — will erode their ability to push back on the incoming president’s legal moves. And it has threatened to cloud Biden's legacy as he prepares to leave office on Jan. 20. Hunter Biden is the closest presidential relative ever to be granted clemency, but other leaders have pardoned family members and close friends. Bill Clinton pardoned his brother Roger for drug charges after Roger Clinton had served his sentence. By the time Trump left office after his first term, he had issued 144 pardons, which included Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in law, Jared Kushner. He also pardoned fervent supporters Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn and other people convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. In the months after the 2020 election, Trump and his allies were trying to overturn his loss, a failed effort that culminated in the violent riot by his supporters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. There were discussions at the time over whether Trump would preemptively pardon some of those involved in the effort — and maybe even himself — before he left office. But that never happened. Now, Democrats are having similar discussions about preemptive pardons on their side because of Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail. He's made no secret of his desire to seek revenge on those who prosecuted him or crossed him. He talks about 'enemies from within.' He's circulated social media posts that call for the jailing of Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, former Vice President Mike Pence and Sens. Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. He's also taken aim at Liz Cheney, a conservative Republican who campaigned for Harris, promoting a social media post that suggested he wanted military tribunals to punish her because she was guilty of treason. Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said last week on Boston Public Radio that Biden might consider broad pardons to protect people against whatever wrath Trump may seek, but also as a way to move the country past this acrimonious and divided time. 'I think that without question, Trump is going to try to act in a dictatorial way, in a fascistic way, in a revengeful first year at least of his administration toward individuals who he believes harmed him,' Markey said. Presidents enjoy expansive pardon powers when it comes to federal crimes. That includes granting clemency to people who have not yet been charged, as President Gerald Ford did in 1974 when he pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, over the Watergate scandal. The decision at the time caused an uproar but has been seen in the ensuing decades as a move that helped restore order. Markey cited Ford's pardon as a way for the country 'just to close that chapter and move on to a new era.' Biden could do the same, Markey said, to help the country move on 'to an agenda that deals with the ordinary families.' Sen. Joe Manchin, the Democrat-turned-independent from West Virginia, took it a step further and suggested Biden should even pardon Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, federal charges that are now evaporating with Trump's upcoming return to the White House. 'Why don't you go ahead and pardon Donald Trump for all his charges?' he said in an interview with CNN. 'It would have gone down a lot more balanced. I'm just saying, wipe them out.' At the same time, Democratic lawmakers and criminal justice reformers are pushing Biden to grant pardons to broad groups of Americans. Democrats Ayanna Pressley, Jim Clyburn and Mary Gay Scanlon wrote to Biden on Nov. 20, asking him to use his clemency powers to 'address longstanding injustices in our legal system, and set our nation on the path toward ending mass incarceration.' The letter, also signed by 61 others, suggested Biden could use his powers to send a powerful message of criminal justice reform and 'rectify unjust and unnecessary criminal laws passed by Congress and draconian sentences given by judges.' 'We encourage you to use your clemency powers to help broad classes of people and cases, including the elderly and chronically ill, those on death row, people with unjustified sentencing disparities, and women who were punished for defending themselves against their abusers,' they wrote.

South Korean president declares martial law, accusing opposition of anti-state activity	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law Tuesday vowing to eliminate 'anti-state' forces as he struggles against an opposition that controls the country’s parliament and which he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea. The surprising move harkens back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s, and was immediately denounced by the opposition and by the leader of Yoon’s own conservative party. Following Yoon's announcement, South Korea's military proclaimed that parliament and other political gatherings that could cause 'social confusion' would be suspended, according to the government-funded Yonhap news agency. The military also said that the country's striking doctors should return to work within 48 hours, Yonhap said. Thousands of doctors have been striking for months over government plans to expand the number of students at medical schools. It wasn’t immediately clear how long Yoon's martial law declaration could stand. Under South Korean law, martial law can be lifted with a majority vote in the parliament, where the opposition Democratic Party holds a majority. TV footage showed police officers blocking the entrance of the National Assembly. The leader of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, Han Dong-hoon, called the decision to impose martial law 'wrong' and vowed to 'stop it with the people.' Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon’s announcement 'illegal and unconstitutional.' Yoon said during a televised speech that martial law would help 'rebuild and protect' the country from 'falling into the depths of national ruin.' He said he would 'eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.' 'I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,' he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate 'some inconveniences.' Yoon — whose approval rating has dipped in recent months — has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022. Yoon’s party has been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition over next year’s budget bill. The opposition has also been attempting to pass motions to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations of Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls. Yoon has also been dismissing calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals. The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon’s announcement. Yoon's move is the first declaration of martial law since the country's democratization in 1987. The country's last previous martial law was in October 1979.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-997c22ac93f6a9bece68454597e577c1	2024-12-03T04:40:05-08:00	
The G20 has 'shock absorbers' to deal with Trump's return as US president, South Africa says	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — The Group of 20 has sufficient 'shock absorbers' to function effectively if the incoming Donald Trump administration promotes an America First policy at the expense of international cooperation, South Africa's leader said Tuesday as his country took over the bloc's presidency. South Africa assumed the rotational leadership of the group of the world's leading economies on Sunday from Brazil and will hand it over to the United States at the end of 2025. Those three countries will work together over the next 12 months as per the G20 protocol. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said he would elevate the impact of climate change on developing countries during South Africa's G20 presidency — the first by an African nation. U.S. President-elect Trump has shown his disdain for international cooperation on climate issues. 'We will seek to get sufficient consensus on decisions that need to be taken by the G20,' Ramaphosa said when asked if the G20 was prepared for a likely Trump America First approach in his second administration, which starts on Jan. 20. 'I think there will be sufficient shock absorbers that will be put in place that will enable the G20 to continue to function. ... We are advancing the interests of the people of the world.' Trump has given an indication that his foreign policy will be combative. He has pledged to impose new tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, while he also threatened this weekend 100% tariffs against nations in the BRICS bloc of developing nations, which include Brazil, Russia, China, India, South Africa and others. Trump wrote on social media site X that those countries should expect to 'wave goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy' if they pursue a policy of looking to move away from the U.S. dollar for international trade. BRICS countries have said they want to be less dependent on the dollar, but the group has taken little concrete action and analysts say it's unfeasible given the dollar's dominance. Ramaphosa said Tuesday he had reached out to the U.S. president-elect to congratulate him on his election victory and to tempt golf-loving Trump to make a state visit to South Africa to see its 'beautiful golf courses.' He said he also hoped Trump would travel for the G20 summit in South Africa in late 2025. 'If he has time, and he is very busy ... President Trump and possibly myself can go and play golf and talk about global matters,' Ramaphosa said. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-ramaphosa-trump-g20-e207bdef469c8bc0df5b2123fb4f7638	2024-12-03T04:17:02-08:00	
Middle East Latest: Israeli minister warns of wider strikes on Lebanon if ceasefire collapses	Israel’s defense minister warned that if the shaky ceasefire with Hezbollah collapses, Israel will widen its strikes and target the Lebanese state itself. He spoke the day after Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes that killed nearly a dozen people in Lebanon. Those strikes came after the Lebanese militant group fired a volley of projectiles as a warning over what it said were previous Israeli ceasefire violations. Speaking to troops on the northern border Tuesday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said any violations of the agreement would be met with 'a maximum response and zero tolerance.' He said if the war resumes, Israel will widen its strikes beyond the areas where Hezbollah’s activities are concentrated, and 'there will no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon.' Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel last year in solidarity with Hamas militants who are fighting in the Gaza Strip. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. Israel’s blistering retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,502 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war in Gaza has destroyed vast areas of the coastal enclave and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. ——— Here's the Latest: Germany arrests a Lebanese man accused of being a member of Hezbollah BERLIN — German authorities have arrested a Lebanese man accused of being a member of Hezbollah and working for groups controlled by the militant organization in Germany. Federal prosecutors said the suspect, identified only as Fadel R. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested in the Hannover region on Tuesday. The man is suspected of membership in a foreign terrorist organization and is not accused of direct involvement in any violence. Prosecutors said he joined Hezbollah in the summer of 2008 or earlier and took part in leadership training courses in Lebanon. From 2009, he allegedly had leadership duties in two groups controlled by Hezbollah in the Hannover area, organizing appearances by preachers close to the militants. According to prosecutors, he was briefly a correspondent for a Hezbollah media outlet in 2017 and was tasked with coordinating building work at a mosque. Germany is a staunch ally of Israel. It is also home to a Lebanese immigrant community of more than 100,000. Lebanese army launches recruitment drive to bolster presence in the south BEIRUT - The Lebanese army is looking for more recruits as it beefs up its presence in southern Lebanon after the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire. Lebanon’s army is a respected national institution that kept to the sidelines during the nearly 14-month conflict. During an initial 60-day truce, thousands of Lebanese troops are supposed to deploy in southern Lebanon, where U.N. peacekeepers also have a presence. Hezbollah militants are to pull back from areas near the border as Israel withdraws its ground forces. The army said those interested in joining up have a one-month period to apply, starting Tuesday. The Lebanese army has about 80,000 troops, with around 5,000 of them deployed in the south. Drone strike hits car in Damascus, Syrian news agency says DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s state news agency says a drone strike hit a car in a suburb of the capital, Damascus, killing one person. The agency did not give further details or say who was killed. It said the attack occurred Tuesday on the road leading to the Damascus International Airport south of the city. The area is known to be home to members of Iran-backed militant groups. Israel is believed to have carried out a number of strikes in the area in recent months as it has battled Iran-backed Hezbollah in neighboring Lebanon. Israeli officials rarely acknowledge such strikes. Israel warns the Lebanese state over ceasefire JERUSALEM — Israel’s defense minister warned that if the shaky ceasefire with Hezbollah collapses, Israel will widen its strikes and target the Lebanese state itself. He spoke the day after Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes that killed nearly a dozen people. Those strikes came after the Lebanese militant group fired a volley of projectiles as a warning over what it said were previous Israeli violations. Speaking to troops on the northern border Tuesday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said any violations of the agreement would be met with 'a maximum response and zero tolerance.' He said if the war resumes, Israel will widen its strikes beyond the areas where Hezbollah’s activities are concentrated, and 'there will no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon.' During the 14-month conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which came to an end last week with a ceasefire brokered by the United States and France, Israel largely refrained from striking critical infrastructure or the Lebanese armed forces, who kept to the sidelines. When Israeli strikes killed or wounded Lebanese soldiers, the Israeli military said it was accidental. The ceasefire agreement that took effect last week gives 60 days for Israel to withdraw its forces from Lebanon and for Hezbollah militants to relocate north of the Litani River. The buffer zone is to be patrolled by Lebanese armed forces and U.N. peacekeepers. Israel has carried out multiple strikes in recent days in response to what it says are violations by Hezbollah. Lebanon’s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, accused Israel of violating the truce more than 50 times in recent days by launching airstrikes, demolishing homes near the border and violating Lebanon’s airspace. Berri, a Hezbollah ally, had helped mediate the ceasefire. Israeli airstrike in northern West Bank kills two Palestinians JERUSALEM — Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike in the northern West Bank has killed two Palestinians. Israel’s military said it struck a militant cell near the town of Al-Aqaba, in the Jordan Valley. It did not immediately give more details. The Palestinian Health Ministry confirmed the two deaths and said a third person was moderately wounded. About 800 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. Israel has carried out near-daily military raids in the West Bank that it says are aimed at preventing attacks on Israelis, which have also been on the rise. Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for an independent state. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon reappears after pager attack BEIRUT — Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon made his first public appearance in Beirut since he was wounded in an attack involving exploding pagers in mid-September. Mojtaba Amani, who returned to Lebanon over the weekend after undergoing treatment in Iran, visited on Tuesday the scene south of Beirut where Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sept. 27. Speaking about the airstrike that destroyed six buildings and killed Nasrallah and others, Amani said Israel should get for its act 'the highest medal for sabotage, terrorism, blood and killing civilians.' Amani suffered serious injuries in his face and hands when a pager he was holding exploded in mid-September. The device was one of about 3,000 pagers that exploded simultaneously, killing and wounding many Hezbollah members. A day after the pager attack, a similar attack struck walkie-talkies. In total, the explosions killed at least 37 people and wounded more than 3,000, many of them civilians. Last month, a spokesperson for the office of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the pager attack was approved by Netanyahu.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-latest-3-december-2024-38090332748a5a5bb3648a728cb6b4ae	2024-12-03T02:26:00-08:00	
Syrian insurgents capture four central towns as government forces reclaim some territory	BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian insurgents captured four new towns early Tuesday, bringing them closer to the central city of Hama, opposition activists said, while government forces retook some territory they lost last week. The capture of the towns is the latest in the push by insurgents led by the salafi jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, as well as Turkey-backed opposition fighters. Insurgents now are about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Hama, the country’s fourth largest city. The latest push is part of a wide offensive by forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad that over the past days has captured large parts of the northern city of Aleppo, Syria’s largest, as well as towns and villages in southern parts of the northwestern Idlib province. The insurgents’ military operations administration said gunmen killed 50 government forces as they captured the central towns of Halfaya, Taybat al-Imam, Maardis and Soran. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, confirmed that the towns were taken. The pro-government Dama Post media outlet reported intense clashes in an around the towns, adding that Syrian troops are firing artillery shells at insurgents in the area. State media reported intense airstrikes by Syrian and Russian air forces in the area. Both the Observatory and pro-government media outlets reported that Syrian government forces on Tuesday captured the village of Khanaser, days after losing it. Khanaser sits on one of the roads that lead to Aleppo. The long war between Assad and his foreign backers and the array of armed opposition forces seeking his overthrow has killed an estimated half-million people over the past 13 years. To the east, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement that they captured seven villages from pro-government fighters. Syrian state media, however, denied that the villages were captured by the U.S.-backed SDF saying that the attack was repelled. The villages are close to a base housing U.S. troops in the area that is close to Iraq. Also Tuesday, Hakan Fidan, the foreign minister of Turkey, which is a main backer of groups opposed to Assad, said the recent rapid advance by insurgents in Syria shows that the Syrian president must reconcile with his own people and hold talks with the opposition. Assad and officials in his government say all armed groups in opposition-held parts of Syria are terrorists and has rejected any political solution with them. Turkey has been seeking to normalize ties with Syria to address security threats from groups affiliated with Kurdish militants along its southern border and to help ensure the safe return of more than 3 million Syrian refugees. Assad has insisted that Turkey's withdrawal of its military forces from northern Syria be a condition for any normalization between the two countries.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-hama-aleppo-idlib-sdf-assad-hts-f30e9aa6025fd81bc9aeb771ab39c625	2024-12-03T01:40:08-08:00	
China bans exports to US of gallium, germanium, antimony in response to chip sanctions	BANGKOK (AP) — China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports. The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after the Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications. The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology. China's Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof. 'China has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese companies, and malicious suppression of China’s technological progress,' Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine briefing Tuesday. 'I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction against Chinese companies,' Lin said. The minerals sourced in China are used in computer chips, cars and other products China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite. Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report. The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials. China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology. China says it's protecting itself from US trade restrictions After the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a so-called 'entity list' subject to strict export controls, China’s Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China’s 'rights and interests.' Nearly all of the companies affected by Washington's latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security. China's government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China’s fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology. Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, 'abuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.' 'Such behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,' it said in a statement. The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies. 'U.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China’s related industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,' it said. The U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year. The U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources. The export restrictions have had a mixed impact on prices for those critical minerals, with the price of antimony more than doubling this year to over $25,000 per ton. Prices for gallium, germanium and graphite also have mostly risen. ___ AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tech-semiconductor-chip-gallium-6b4216551e200fb719caa6a6cc67e2a4	2024-12-03T01:23:48-08:00	
Hamas and Fatah are near an agreement on who will oversee postwar Gaza	CAIRO (AP) — Palestinian officials say Fatah and Hamas are closing in on an agreement to appoint a committee of politically independent technocrats to administer the Gaza Strip after the war. It would effectively end Hamas' rule and could help advance ceasefire talks with Israel. The rival factions have made several failed attempts to reconcile since Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007. Israel has meanwhile ruled out any postwar role in Gaza for either Hamas or Fatah, which dominates the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. A Palestinian Authority official on Tuesday confirmed that a preliminary agreement had been reached following weeks of negotiations in Cairo. The official said the committee would have 12-15 members, most of them from Gaza. It would report to the Palestinian Authority, which is headquartered in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and work with local and international parties to facilitate humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. A Hamas official said that Hamas and Fatah had agreed on the general terms but were still negotiating over some details and the individuals who would serve on the committee. The official said an agreement would be announced after a meeting of all Palestinian factions in Cairo, without providing a timeline. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the talks. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas is dismantled and scores of hostages are returned. He says Israel will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza, with civilian affairs administered by local Palestinians unaffiliated with the Palestinian Authority or Hamas. No Palestinians have publicly volunteered for such a role, and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with the Israeli military. The United States has called for a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern both the West Bank and Gaza ahead of eventual statehood. The Israeli government, which is opposed to Palestinian statehood, is reportedly discussing a postwar plan with the United Arab Emirates, which normalized relations with Israel in 2020 and backs a rival Fatah faction. The Hamas official said the emerging Palestinian agreement would fulfill one of Israel’s war goals by ending Hamas’ rule in Gaza. It’s unclear if Israeli officials would see it that way. The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied West Bank, recognizes Israel and cooperates with it on security matters, a policy that is deeply unpopular among Palestinians, many of whom view it as a subcontractor of the occupation. Israel says the authority has not done enough to combat militancy or curb incitement. The committee would assume its responsibilities after a ceasefire agreement with Israel, the Hamas official said. American and Arab mediators have spent nearly a year trying to broker such an agreement, but the negotiations have repeatedly stalled. Hamas ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages remain inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of the dead were combatants. The offensive has leveled much of the coastal territory and displaced the vast majority of its 2.3 million residents. ___ Federman reported from Jerusalem. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-fatah-hamas-postwar-gaza-acc4da6042ed030f65d0cd0745b82217	2024-12-03T00:08:42-08:00	
Five things you probably didn't know about Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris	PARIS (AP) — Notre Dame Cathedral, which is set to reopen to the public on Sunday after a five-year restoration following a devastating fire, stands as a jewel of Gothic architecture, a symbol of Paris and a tourist mecca. But behind the grandeur of the cathedral, which took 182 years to build between the 12th and 14th centuries, lie some surprising stories. From medieval myths to modern-day mysteries, here are five special things to know about this Paris landmark: The heart of France, literally Notre Dame’s importance goes beyond its architecture and history — it’s literally the point from which all roads in France begin. In front of the cathedral, embedded in the cobblestones, lies a modest bronze-and-stone slab with the inscription 'point zéro des routes de France,' meaning 'starting point of the roads of France.'' This plaque marks the starting point for measuring distances between Paris and other cities across the country. While the plaque was installed in 1924, the idea of a national 'ground zero' dates to 1769. King Louis XV envisioned a central reference for France’s growing network of roads, a concept that tied the nation’s geography to its heart in Paris. The great gargoyle myth Those scary stone creatures on Notre Dame might seem ancient, but not all of them are what they appear. The actual gargoyles, which are monster-shaped gutters used to drain rainwater, have been around since the time of the cathedral’s construction. But the dramatic, monster-like figures often depicted on postcards and movies are chimera, and they’re much newer. In the 19th century, the architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, who was in charge of renovating the then-decaying building, added these creatures to add to the mystique of the cathedral. Viollet-le-Duc drew inspiration from Victor Hugo’s famous book ‘’The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' to create these demonic animal figures with personified expressions. How to tell them apart? Gargoyles resemble horizontal spikes coming out of the facade and have holes in their spouts to allow water to drain. A revolutionary makeover During the French Revolution, which saw waves of protest against the Church, Notre Dame wasn’t exactly treated like a revered cathedral. In 1793, revolutionaries stripped it of its religious symbols and renamed it 'Notre-Dame de la Raison' (Our Lady of Reason). Instead, the cathedral hosted festivals celebrating science and Enlightenment ideas, and for a short time, it was even used as a wine warehouse. Religious services resumed in 1795, and Notre Dame regained its sacred status on the impulse of French emperor Napoleon I, who held his coronation there in 1804, immortalized in a famous painting by Jacques-Louis David. The beheaded kings who returned centuries later In 1792, revolutionaries also decapitated 28 statues from Notre Dame’s facade, mistaking them for French monarchs. They were actually ancient kings of Judah, biblical ancestors of Jesus. The heads were thought lost forever, possibly destroyed or sold as building materials. But in 1977, workers renovating a courtyard in Paris’ 9th arrondissement uncovered hundreds of fragments of stone sculptures. Experts confirmed they were the missing heads of Notre Dame’s kings. How they ended up buried there remains a mystery. Today, 22 of the heads have been restored and are displayed at the Cluny Museum in Paris. Their discovery is considered one of the most remarkable archaeological finds in the city’s modern history. A fiery wake-up call on lead dust The 2019 fire that almost destroyed Notre Dame revealed a serious health risk. When the flames melted the roof, tons of toxic lead dust were released into the air and settled across Paris. The problem? Authorities discovered there were no rules to measure the danger of outdoor lead dust. This wasn’t just a Paris issue — major cities like London and Rome, and even the World Health Organization, don’t have guidelines for outdoor lead pollution. The Notre Dame fire highlighted a hidden problem, forcing officials to take a closer look at their safety standards. It took four months for the city to complete a deep-clean operation of the sidewalks even as tourists, residents and merchants walked streets around the cathedral daily. ___ For more of AP’s coverage on Notre Dame, visit https://apnews.com/hub/notre-dame-cathedral	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-cathedral-reopens-paris-192a2c5f4a8ded6e29ac2ff8660e04f4	2024-12-02T21:32:39-08:00	
Death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan upheld in Vietnam's largest fraud case	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — The death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan was upheld Tuesday in Vietnam's largest fraud case, the scale of which had raised concerns about the country's economy. She had been convicted in April of embezzlement and bribery over the fraud amounting to $12.5 billion, nearly 3% of Vietnam’s 2022 GDP. As chairperson of the Van Thinh Phat real estate firm, Lan illegally controlled Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank between 2012 and 2022 and allowed 2,500 loans that cost the bank $27 billion in losses. The court in Ho Chi Minh rejected her appeal against the conviction while adding that her death sentence could be commuted to life if she reimburses three-fourth of the losses, VN Express reported. The court said her violations had negatively impacted banking, caused public disorder and eroded people’s trust, the state media outlet said. Her arrest was among the most high-profile in an anti-corruption drive in Vietnam that intensified after 2022. The Blazing Furnace campaign touched the highest echelons of Vietnamese politics. But the scale of her fraud shocked the nation with analysts raising questions about whether other banks or businesses had similarly erred. This dampened Vietnam’s economic outlook and made foreign investors jittery at a time when Vietnam has been trying to position itself as a home for businesses pivoting their supply chains away from China. Lan, 67, and her family had set up the Van Thing Phat company in 1992 after Vietnam shed its state-run economy in favor of a more market-oriented approach open to foreigners. The company grew into one of Vietnam’s richest real estate firms, with luxury residential buildings, offices, hotels and shopping centers. This made her a key player in the country’s financial industry. She orchestrated the 2011 merger of the beleaguered SCB bank with two other lenders in coordination with Vietnam’s central bank. The court said that she used this to tap SCB for cash and, according to government documents, owned more than 90% of the bank while approving thousands of loans to 'ghost companies.' These loans, according to state media, found their way to her and she bribed officials to cover her tracks. The scale of the crime meant the case was split into two trials, and Lan was sentenced to another life sentence in October. At that trial, she was accused of raising $1.2 billion from nearly 36,000 investors by issuing bonds illegally through four companies, state media reported. She was also found guilty of siphoning off $18 billion obtained through fraud and for using companies controlled by her to illegally transfer more than $4.5 billion in and out of Vietnam between 2012 and 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-truong-my-lan-death-sentence-a51f557f092de27163b7c2baf1f803b4	2024-12-02T21:09:36-08:00	
US expands list of Chinese technology companies under export controls	BANGKOK (AP) — The U.S. Commerce Department has expanded the list of Chinese technology companies subject to export controls to include many that make equipment used to make computer chips, chipmaking tools and software. The 140 companies newly included in the so-called 'entity list' are nearly all based in China. But some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore. The revised rules were posted Monday on the website of the U.S. Federal Register for publication later this week. They also limit exports of high-bandwidth memory chips to China. Such chips are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence. China’s Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect its 'rights and interests,' without giving any details. 'This is a typical act of economic coercion and non-market practice,' the ministry said in a statement. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the move was intended to impair China's ability to use advanced technologies that 'pose a risk to our national security.' The addition of the companies to the 'entity list' means that export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with them. Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls, as the administration of President Joe Biden has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. 'The purpose of these Entity List actions is to stop PRC (Chinese) companies from leveraging U.S. technology to indigenously produce advanced semiconductors,' Matthew S. Axelrod, the assistant secretary for export enforcement, said in a statement. 'By adding key semiconductor fabrication facilities, equipment manufacturers, and investment companies to the Entity List, we are directly impeding the PRC’s military modernization, WMD (weapons of mass destruction) programs, and ability to repress human rights.' China has accused the U.S. of pursuing 'technology hegemony,' as Washington steps up pressure on Chinese tech giant Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers of advanced technology by blocking access to American suppliers. It particularly objects to what it calls 'long-arm jurisdiction' moves such as the U.S. decision to extend export controls to companies to apply to chip-making equipment makers in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore if they use any U.S. technology that might be sold to China. Pressure from Washington has spurred China to step up its efforts to develop its own advanced computer chips and other technologies, providing billions in subsidies and investments for the industry. Chinese manufacturers have made quick progress even though they remain years behind in some areas. Shares in Japanese computer chip makers and makers of related equipment surged Tuesday, with testing equipment maker Advantest surging 4.6%, Tokyo Electron gaining 4.6% and Applied Materials up 4.9%. Disco Corp., another chipmaker, jumped 6.9%, while the Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index gained 2.3%. Meanwhile, China's Naura Technology Group, whose companies were included in the new list, fell 3% and Piotech Inc., another chipmaker, lost 5.3%.	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-technology-chips-sanctions-bis-8f8ab1ab49b5bb57e5a290a3937fa939	2024-12-02T20:57:21-08:00	
Thanks to peace, two unexpected words are echoing across Afghanistan's capital: Luxury housing	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — In a town that has been through it all and is clawing its way back, a man named Omidullah is looking to hit paydirt. The Kabul real estate agent is selling a nine-bedroom, nine-bath, white-and-gold villa in the Afghan capital. On the roof's gable, glittering Arabic script tempts buyers and brokers with the word 'mashallah' — 'God has willed it.' The villa is listed at $450,000, a startling number in a country where more than half of the population relies on humanitarian aid to survive, most Afghans don’t have bank accounts, and mortgages are rare. Yet the offers are coming in. 'It’s a myth that Afghans don’t have money,' Omidullah said. 'We have very big businessmen who have big businesses abroad. There are houses here worth millions of dollars.' In Kabul, a curious thing is happening to fuel the high-end real estate market. Peace, it seems, is driving up property prices. Many are coming home People who spent years living and working abroad are returning home, keen to take advantage of the country’s much-improved security and stability after decades of war, destruction and infrastructure decay. They include Afghans escaping deportation campaigns in Iran and Pakistan who are taking their cash with them. Mortgages are rare because banks don’t have the deposits to facilitate lending. Afghans buy in cash or use the 'geerawi option' — when someone provides a fixed sum to a landlord in return for living on his property and staying there until the landlord returns the money. People were afraid to invest in Kabul before the Taliban takeover, according to another real estate agent, Ghulam Mohammed Haqdoost. But the country’s rulers have created better conditions for the property market in more ways than one. The city is less violent since the Taliban transitioned from insurgency to authority and foreign forces withdrew, although armored vehicles, checkpoints and militarized compounds remain common sights. The Taliban, sticklers for an intricate bureaucracy, have pledged to stamp out corruption and regulate legal and commercial matters. That means no more dealing with warlords or bribing local officials for land purchases or construction projects. Haqdoost is happy with how easily and quickly things are getting done under the new administration. 'House prices have risen by almost 40%,' he said. 'In the last three years, we have sold almost 400 properties. It wasn’t like that before.' For builders, times are good Business is good for Haqdoost, who employs 200 people in administration, including women who deal exclusively with female customers, and then some 1,000 in the construction arm of his company. He said most customers bring their wives along to viewings. That's because it’s women who call the shots when it comes to real estate purchases — even in a nation that critics say oppresses and disempowers women. 'The power and authority of the house is in the hands of the women,' Haqdoost said. 'They decide whether to buy the house or not.' Omidullah and Haqdoost said their clients want a garden, gym, sauna, swimming pool, guest quarters and at least one kitchen. Hospitality is a major part of Afghan culture and this tradition is built into housing. Afghans typically accommodate and host visiting friends or family in their homes, rather than in hotels or restaurants. Haqdoost’s client base is mostly overseas, and their international tastes are influencing interiors. They want novelties like dining tables and beds. In Afghanistan, it’s the norm for people to sleep and eat on the floor. It’s also the diaspora seeking out purpose-built apartment blocks offering amenities like central heating, double-pane windows and elevators. To make the city more attractive and livable, the municipal authority is busy building and repairing roads, installing streetlights, planting trees and removing trash. It’s also developing plans to promote affordable housing and encourage home ownership. It needs to. Kabul’s population was around 500,000 at the start of the millennium. Now it is more than 5 million. Some neighborhoods remain congested and noisy as a result, despite the municipality’s best beautification efforts. An oasis outside the Afghan capital? Those who can afford it head just outside the city. There, on the edge of Qargha Reservoir, sit some of Kabul’s most elaborate and expensive homes. One resembles an ornate mosque. Another evokes a Bond villain’s lair with its stark design and protrusion from the hills. Locals say it belongs to a wealthy Turkish magnate who comes and goes. They don’t give his name. This cluster of landscaped gardens and decorative terraces looks out onto the lake, one of the capital’s best-loved beauty spots. Since the Taliban came to power, it’s mostly a men-only area. Women stop for breaks with their families, but they tend not to linger because Vice and Virtue Ministry officials staff one of the checkpoints that encircle the body of water. Arash Asad is trying to sell his uncle’s property, which sits on around 4,000 square meters (43,000 square feet) of land. It has unobstructed views across the reservoir and to the Paghman Mountains at the foot of the Hindu Kush Himalaya. The asking price: $800,000. There are outbuildings to one side and a living area in the center of the plot topped off with a bright blue roof. The property is mostly rows of flowers and cherry trees. There are some cranes. The birds are included. 'Gardens are very important to Afghans,' Asad said. 'Many of them come from villages. When they move to cities, they want to have that reminder of their past because it stays with them.' Inside the glass-walled living area sits his uncle, gazing out at the water. Asad's family would prefer to have the property turned into a business rather than sell it. But the real estate broker fields numerous calls and messages during the 30-minute drive from central Kabul. Pictures of the property on social media have sparked a lot of interest. 'People think this country has no jobs and no economy,' Asad said. Outside the car, the sun dips over the reservoir and cars full of men head to the lakeside. 'But Afghans have made their money, illegally or legally, over the years. You wouldn’t believe it.'	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-real-estate-taliban-luxury-market-06cb2e2386a8fe1b24c416b0bd2bad92	2024-12-02T20:13:40-08:00	
In Angola, Biden plans to tout US investments and visit a slavery museum	LUANDA, Angola (AP) — Joe Biden is using the first visit to Angola by a U.S. president to promote Washington's hefty modern investments in the sub-Saharan Africa nation and to see a slavery museum where he'll acknowledge how the trafficking of human beings once linked the two nations' economies. A centerpiece of his trip is showcasing the U.S. commitment of $3 billion to the Lobito Corridor, a railway redevelopment linking Zambia, Congo and Angola that is meant to make it far easier to move raw materials around the continent and for export. The project also has drawn financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks. The project aims to advance the U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies and to counter China's heavy investments in mining and processing African minerals. The U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer) railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China’s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy in Africa and other parts of the world. Biden is set to fly to the Angolan port city of Lobito on Wednesday for a firsthand look at the corridor. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the Biden administration 'has absolutely transformed' U.S.-Africa relations and that the corridor's full completion is 'going to take years but there’s already been a lot of work put in.' That means much of it may fall to Biden's successor, Republican Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. Asked whether the project could proceed without future support from Trump, Kirby said it was 'our fervent hope that as the new team comes in and takes a look at this that they see the value too, that they see how it will help drive a more secure, more prosperous, more economically stable continent.' Kirby, speaking aboard Air Force One as Biden flew to Angola, said that the corridor was about more than simply Washington trying to outpace Beijing geopolitically. 'I would say there is no cold war on the continent. We’re not asking countries to choose between us and Russia and China. We’re simply looking for reliable, sustainable, verifiable investment opportunities that the people of Angola and the people of the continent can rely on,' he said. 'Too many countries have relied on spotty investment opportunities and are now wracked by debt.' The last U.S. president to visit sub-Saharan Africa was Barack Obama in 2015. Biden attended a United Nations climate summit in Egypt in North Africa in 2022. Biden had promised to visit Africa last year, after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit in December 2022. But the trip was delayed until this year and then pushed back again this October because of Hurricane Milton — reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still low priority for Washington. On Tuesday, Biden is to attend an official arrival ceremony and hold a bilateral meeting with Angolan President Joao Lourenco. Biden welcomed Lourenco to the Oval Office in November of last year. Biden is also set to meet with leaders from African business engagement groups he helped found before visiting Angola’s National Slavery Museum. The site was once the headquarters of the Capela da Casa Grande, a 17th century temple where slaves were baptized before boarding the ships that took them to America. Kirby said Biden will give a speech there acknowledging 'both the horrific history of slavery that has connected our two nations, but also looks forward to a future predicated on a shared vision that benefits both our people.'	https://apnews.com/article/biden-africa-angola-slave-museum-92b92fec66169e1f347142beb3735f52	2024-12-02T20:09:45-08:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street inches higher to set more records	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks tiptoed to more records amid a mixed Tuesday of trading, tacking a touch more onto what’s already been a stellar year so far. The S&amp;P 500 edged up by 2 points, or less than 0.1%, to set an all-time high for the 55th time this year. It’s climbed in 10 of the last 11 days and is on track for one of its best years since the turn of the millennium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 76 points, or 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.4% to its own record set a day earlier. AT&amp;T rose 4.6% after it boosted its profit forecast for the year. It also announced a $10 billion plan to send cash to its investors by buying back its own stock, while saying it expects to authorize another $10 billion of repurchases in 2027. On the losing end of Wall Street was U.S. Steel, which fell 8%. President-elect Donald Trump reiterated on social media that he would not let Japan’s Nippon Steel take over the iconic Pennsylvania steelmaker. Nippon Steel announced plans last December to buy the Pittsburgh-based steel producer for $14.1 billion in cash, raising concerns about what the transaction could mean for unionized workers, supply chains and U.S. national security. Earlier this year, President Joe Biden also came out against the acquisition. Tesla sank 1.6% after a judge in Delaware reaffirmed a previous ruling that the electric car maker must revoke Elon Musk’s multibillion-dollar pay package. The judge denied a request by attorneys for Musk and Tesla’s corporate directors to vacate her ruling earlier this year requiring the company to rescind the unprecedented pay package. All told, the S&amp;P 500 rose 2.73 points to 6,049.88. The Dow fell 76.47 to 44,705.53, and the Nasdaq composite gained 76.96 to 19,480.91. In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady after a report showed U.S. employers were advertising slightly more job openings at the end of October than a month earlier. Continued strength there would raise optimism that the economy could remain out of a recession that many investors had earlier worried was inevitable. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.23% from 4.20% from late Monday. Yields have seesawed since Election Day amid worries that Trump’s preferences for lower tax rates and bigger tariffs could spur higher inflation along with economic growth. But traders are still confident the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate again at its next meeting in two weeks. They’re betting on a nearly three-in-four chance of that, according to data from CME Group. Lower rates can give the economy more juice, but they can also give inflation more fuel. The key report this week that could guide the Fed’s next move will arrive on Friday. It’s the monthly jobs report, which will show how many workers U.S. employers hired and fired during November. It could be difficult to parse given how much storms and strikes distorted figures in October. Based on trading in the options market, Friday’s jobs report appears to be the biggest potential market mover until the Fed announces its next decision on interest rates Dec. 18, according to strategists at Barclays Capital. In financial markets abroad, the value of South Korea’s currency fell 1.1% against the U.S. dollar following a frenetic night where President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law and then later said he’d lift it after lawmakers voted to reject military rule. Stocks of Korean companies that trade in the United States also fell, including a 1.6% drop for SK Telecom. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.9% to help lead global markets. Some analysts think Japanese stocks could end up benefiting from Trump’s threats to raise tariffs, including for goods coming from China. Trade relations between the U.S. and China took another step backward after China said it is banning exports to the U.S. of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications. The counterpunch came swiftly after the U.S. Commerce Department expanded the list of Chinese technology companies subject to export controls to include many that make equipment used to make computer chips, chipmaking tools and software. The 140 companies newly included in the so-called 'entity list' are nearly all based in China. In China, stock indexes rose 1% in Hong Kong and 0.4% in Shanghai amid unconfirmed reports that Chinese leaders would meet next week to discuss planning for the coming year. Investors are hoping it may bring fresh stimulus to help spur growth in the world’s second-largest economy. In France, the CAC 40 rose 0.3% amid continued worries about politics in Paris, where the government is battling over the budget. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-trump-trade-inflation-fed-170ad728bd136fbcf5dc1511bac24bbf	2024-12-02T19:13:30-08:00	
Australian actor Ian Smith, who played Harold Bishop in 'Neighbours,' retires due to cancer	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Actor Ian Smith, who has played the character Harold Bishop in the iconic Australian soap opera 'Neighbours' since 1987, has announced his retirement after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. The 86-year-old actor revealed the diagnosis in an interview with 10 News First on Network 10, which broadcasts the series in Australia. The interview was broadcast on Monday. Smith has already filmed his last episode and said farewell to the other cast members on his final day of shooting. 'It isn’t just my last day in ‘Neighbours,’ it’s my last day of work,' Smith told 10. Smith said he was being treated for a rare form of lung cancer known as pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma. 'I found out a few months back that I have cancer, that I have a very aggressive, non-fixable cancer and ... they expect me to die,' Smith said. The producers of ' Neighbours,' which is set on fictional Ramsay Street in suburban Melbourne, used social media to confirm Smith’s departure. 'Harold waves goodbye to Ramsay Street. We’re sharing the sad news that Ian Smith will soon be stepping away from the beloved role of Harold Bishop,' the program posted on Monday. Network 10 described Smith as the 'heart and soul of the show.' 'Ian has brought joy, laughter and inspiration to audiences all around the world for decades,' the network said in a statement. 'Along with the cast and crew and all his fans from around the world, we will support Ian in any way we can during this difficult time,' it said. 'Neighbours' first screened in 1985 and has become Australia’s longest-running drama series. It has been sold to more than 60 countries and was most popular in Britain.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-ian-smith-neighours-harold-bishop-cancer-f3818bf45a7243ebc580d75c7899d30d	2024-12-02T18:00:06-08:00

Trudeau told Trump Americans would also suffer if tariffs are imposed, a Canadian minister says	TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Donald Trump that Americans would also suffer if the president-elect follows through on a plan to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, a Canadian minister who attended their recent dinner said Monday. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if they don’t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the United States. He said on social media last week that he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders. Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose responsibilities include border security, attended a dinner with Trump and Trudeau at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club on Friday. Trudeau requested the meeting in a bid to avoid the tariffs by convincing Trump that the northern border is nothing like the U.S. southern border with Mexico. 'The prime minister of course spoke about the importance of protecting the Canadian economy and Canadian workers from tariffs, but we also discussed with our American friends the negative impact that those tariffs could have on their economy, on affordability in the United States as well,' LeBlanc said in Parliament. If Trump makes good on his threat to slap 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, the price increases that could follow will collide with his campaign promise to give American families a break from inflation. Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods. The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington trade group, said last week that tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate. Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the U.S. should Trump follow through on the threat. After his dinner with Trump, Trudeau returned home without assurances the president-elect will back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner. Trump called the talks 'productive' but signaled no retreat from a pledge that Canada says unfairly lumps it in with Mexico over the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States. 'The idea that we came back empty handed is completely false,' LeBlanc said. 'We had a very productive discussion with Mr. Trump and his future Cabinet secretaries. ... The commitment from Mr. Trump to continue to work with us was far from empty handed.' Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump’s pick to lead the Interior Department, and Mike Waltz, Trump’s choice to be his national security adviser. Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, told The Associated Press on Sunday that 'the message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood.' Hillman, who sat at an adjacent table to Trudeau and Trump, said Canada is not the problem when it comes to drugs and migrants. On Monday, Mexico’s president rejected those comments. 'Mexico must be respected, especially by its trading partners,' President Claudia Sheinbaum said. She said Canada had its own problems with fentanyl consumption and 'could only wish they had the cultural riches Mexico has.' Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs at the two countries’ border are vastly different. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing for national security.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trudeau-trump-tarrifs-bdf1b2ae23167fcd9654ea4a45d43404	2024-12-02T13:02:35-08:00

Key players in Syria's long-running civil war, reignited by a shock rebel offensive	BEIRUT (AP) — Syria’s long civil war has reclaimed global attention after insurgents seized most of its largest city and dozens of nearby towns and villages. The stunning advance on Aleppo by rebel forces came as several key players in the conflict have been distracted or weakened, triggering the heaviest clashes since a 2020 ceasefire brought relative calm to the country’s north. Russian and Syrian forces have carried out dozens of airstrikes to try to limit the insurgents' advances, inflicting heavy casualties. Syria's civil war started in 2011 after an uprising against President Bashar Assad's rule. Five foreign powers have a military presence in the country including the U.S., Russia and Iran. Forces opposed to Assad, along with U.S.-backed fighters, control more than a third of the country. Israel holds the Golan Heights, which it seized in its 1967 war with its Arab neighbors. Here’s a look at the key players: Syrian pro-government forces, backed by Russia and Iran Syrian government troops have long controlled a large part of the country, thanks to allied forces dispatched by Russia and Iran. Assad's forces control most of the major population centers, including the capital Damascus and cities in Syria's center, south and east. The Syrian government's capture of Aleppo in late 2016 was a turning point in the conflict and their loss of the city in recent days is a major setback. Iran's military advisors and proxy fighters have played a critical role in shoring up Assad's forces throughout the war. But Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, which is backed by Iran, has been greatly weakened in its recent war with Israel and Iran has been distracted by the conflict. On Monday, Iranian-backed Iraqi militias deployed to Syria to back the government’s counteroffensive. Russia's military has supported Assad from the Mediterranean coast, where it maintains its only naval base outside the former Soviet Union, and at the Hemeimeem air base in Latakia province, which is home to hundreds of Russian troops. But much of its attention and resources have been focused on its war in Ukraine. Insurgent groups, backed mainly by Turkey Anti-government forces are led by the insurgent Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which long served as al-Qaida's branch in Syria and was considered a terrorist group by the U.N. as well as countries including the U.S. HTS controls much of northwest Syria and in 2017 set up a 'salvation government' to run day-to-day affairs in the region. In recent years, its leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the group's image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance. Other insurgent groups include Noureddine el-Zinki, which was formerly backed by the U.S., before it joined the HTS-led alliance. A Turkish-backed coalition of groups known as the Syrian National Army has attacked areas including the northern town of Tel Rifaat, controlled by the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Chinese fighters from the Turkistan Islamic Party and Chechen fighters from the former Soviet Union have taken part in the battles in the country's northwest, according to Syrian opposition activists. Turkey, which controls parts of northern Syria, will not say how many troops it has in the country. Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by the US The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed coalition of groups, controls large parts of eastern Syria. The SDF has battled the Islamic State group, capturing the last sliver of land held by the extremists in eastern Syria. About 900 American troops are stationed in Syria’s east to guard against a resurgence by the extremist group. SDF forces still controls several neighborhoods of Aleppo encircled by insurgents. Opposition activists have said that insurgents are willing to let those fighters cross to northeast Syria but it was not immediately clear if the Kurdish-led forces will do so. Turkey considers the principal Kurdish faction of the SDF to be linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which it and allies regard as a terrorist group.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-turkey-idlib-aleppo-hama-hts-sdf-65b2c2c864736327da1b7662a716768f	2024-12-02T12:27:59-08:00

Trump demands immediate release of Oct. 7 hostages, says otherwise there will be 'HELL TO PAY'	NEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is demanding the immediate release of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza, saying that if they are not freed before he is sworn into office for a second term there will be 'HELL TO PAY.' 'Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity,' Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social site. He added that, 'Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!' It was not immediately clear whether Trump was threatening to directly involve the U.S. military in Israel’s ongoing campaign against Hamas in Gaza. Trump allies have said he hopes there will be a ceasefire and hostage release deal before he returns to office early next year. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office declined comment. But the country's president, Isaac Herzog, welcomed Trump's comments in a social media post. 'Thank you and bless you Mr. President-elect @realDonaldTrump,' he wrote on X. 'We all pray for the moment we see our sisters and brothers back home!' The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 100 are still held inside Gaza, around two-thirds believed to be alive. Trump’s threat came hours after the Israeli government confirmed the death of Omer Neutra, a dual US--Israeli citizen, whose body is still believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza, according to the Israeli government. Days earlier, Hamas released a hostage video of Edan Alexander, who was serving in the Israeli military when he was taken by Hamas to Gaza. Filmed under apparent duress, Alexander calls on Trump to work to negotiate for his freedom and that of the remaining Hamas hostages. The Biden administration is mounting a last-ditch effort to try to restart talks between Israel and Hamas now that it has brokered a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. But the administration has said that Hamas has yet to show a willingness to reengage in negotiations and that the group isn’t concerned for its own lives or the lives of Gaza civilians. Israel’s retaliatory offensive for the attack has left at least 44,429 Palestinians dead, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The war has destroyed vast areas of the coastal enclave and displaced 90% of its population of 2.3 million people — often multiple times. ___ Associated Press writers Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-threat-hostages-israel-gaza-1aa9af22c070ab8ee0d8baf97bb05df8	2024-12-02T10:25:42-08:00	
Trump's tariff threats create division between Canada and Mexico over security at borders	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Threats by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to impose tariffs have created a split between Canada and Mexico, after Canadian officials said problems with the two countries’ borders shouldn’t be compared. On Monday, Mexico’s president rejected those comments, which were made following a meeting between Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 'Mexico must be respected, especially by its trading partners,' President Claudia Sheinbaum said, after Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, told The Associated Press on Sunday that 'the message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood.' Sheinbaum said Canada had its own problems with fentanyl consumption and 'could only wish they had the cultural riches Mexico has.' Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs at the two countries' border are vastly different. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Mexico's efforts to seize fentanyl before it reaches the U.S. have been lackluster. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone, while there were only 23,721 arrests at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024. During the same period, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border withe Mexico. Mexico feels especially hurt by the Canadian comments, because Mexican officials claim their government went to bat for Canada in the past. They claim that Trump, during his first term, initially wanted to leave Canada out of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement in 2018, and Mexico demanded it be included. It is unclear if that was actually the case. Trudeau also got ahead of Sheinbaum by meeting with the U.S. president-elect first. Both leaders are scrambling to get some assurances before Trump takes office. Hillman said Canada is ready to make new investments in border security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers. She also noted an agreement between Canada and the U.S. that allows for migrants caught crossing illegally to be sent back to Canada. She said Mexico and the U.S. do not have a similar agreement. On Monday, Sheinbaum revealed more about her own conversation last week with Trump, saying he 'had agreed' that Mexico wanted to focus on intelligence sharing in anti-drug efforts, noting 'he said that in his opinion that was good.' But she said Mexico would reject any direct U.S. intervention in Mexico and continue to enforce the tight restrictions on U.S. law enforcement agencies in Mexico imposed by her predecessor. 'That is going to maintained,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-canada-us-trump-tariffs-668a06c2beba2fca1967ab628db68418	2024-12-02T10:23:31-08:00	
A small migrant caravan sets out from southern Mexico but it's unlikely to reach the US border	TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) — A small migrant caravan has set out from southern Mexico, heading north, but is unlikely to reach the U.S. border after authorities broke up two other small caravans headed to the United States over the weekend. About 1,500 migrants — mostly from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, Colombia, Guatemala and Honduras — set out walking on Sunday from Tapachula, a city near Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala. They set out at night, to avoid the scorching daytime heat in the region. The two other small caravans had set out in November, after Donald Trump's election, but both were broken up weeks later by Mexican authorities. Some migrants were bused to cities in southern Mexico, and others were offered transit papers. Some in the caravan that set out Sunday said they would be willing to stay and find work in the industrial cities of northern Mexico. Most migrants cannot work, or cannot find work, in Tapachula, a city flooded with migrants. Santos Modesto, a migrant from Honduras, said most of those in the caravan would say they want to get to the U.S. so they could 'achieve a better life for their families.' 'But I think a lot of people here, if there were opportunities in Monterrey and surrounding areas, they would stay there,' Modesto said, 'because there are a lot of Cubans and Venezuelans who would rather stay here than return to their country.' The migrants said they were also concerned that Trump may eliminate the cellphone app CBP One that makes asylum claims more orderly after his Jan. 20 inauguration. About 1,450 appointments are made available daily, encouraging migrants to get an appointment before they show up at the border. 'There are a lot of reports that he has said he is going to do away with CBP One, that there are going to be deportations, the biggest deportation, but you have to have faith in God,' said Venezuelan migrant Francisco Unda, 38. Trump has threatened to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican products unless the country does more to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. Last week, Trump said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the U.S. Sheinbaum wrote on her social media accounts the same day that 'migrants and caravans are taken care of before they reach the border.' Sheinbaum has said she is confident that a tariff war with the U.S. can be averted but her statement — the day after she had a phone call with Trump — did not make clear who had offered what. Apart from the much larger first caravans in 2018 and 2019 — which were provided buses to ride part of the way north — no caravan has ever reached the U.S. border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way, though some individual members have made it. For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and immigration agents. They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the Guatemalan border. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-migrant-caravans-trump-tariffs-063d0707be67fdb171111faae25f562c	2024-12-02T09:04:57-08:00	
Georgia's protests lay bare a clash of values and interests as it navigates a Russia-West standoff	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgia is convulsed by political upheaval again after its pro-Moscow government, fresh off parliamentary elections denounced as rigged by its critics, decided to suspend negotiations for the small former Soviet republic to join the European Union. The small but ancient Caucasus country, which inhabits a crossroads between Slavic, Turkish and Persian cultures, has recently found itself navigating the geopolitical standoff between Russia under strongman President Vladimir Putin and the democratic, wealthy West. Here's a look at why the future of Georgia matters, both domestically and internationally. What's happening in Georgia? Official results from parliamentary elections on Oct. 26 gave victory to the ruling Georgian Dream party, which was created by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia. At the same time, opinion polls have repeatedly shown most Georgians want their country to join the European Union — and supporters of accession to the 27-member bloc have turned out in force to protest the government's move to suspend the process. Over 200 people have been detained after four nights of protests in the capital, Tbilisi, where tens of thousands of people have rallied outside parliament — a sizable turnout for a country of 3.7 million people. While parliament is controlled by Georgian Dream, President Salome Zourabichvili, who has a largely ceremonial role, has spoken out against what she calls the ruling party’s crackdown on free speech. She says many arrested protesters had injuries to their heads and faces. Navigating the standoff between Russia and the West Some see parallels between the recent protests in Georgia and those in Ukraine, another former Soviet republic, earlier this century as Kyiv sought to move closer to the West. The Georgian government’s move to suspend the EU membership process came after the European Parliament passed a resolution criticizing the Oct. 26 election as neither free nor fair. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow views the recent events in Georgia as similar to upheaval that rocked Ukraine in 2013 and 2014, when a pro-Russia president decided not to sign an association agreement with the EU — and eventually fled amid ensuing political unrest. Georgia, like Ukraine, has sought to join the NATO military alliance, which Putin's Russia considers a step too far for Western expansion into the former Soviet — and Russian — sphere of influence. Russia has a long border with Georgia, which is not contiguous with any EU country — though it does share a border with NATO member Turkey. In August 2008, Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which had made a botched attempt to regain control over its breakaway province of South Ossetia. Moscow recognized the independence of South Ossetia and another breakaway province, Abkhazia, and set up military bases there. US and EU try to exert more pressure on Georgian government On Saturday, the U.S. State Department announced the suspension of its strategic relationship with Georgia and condemned the decision to halt its efforts toward EU accession. The EU granted Georgia candidate status last December on condition that it meet the bloc’s stringent entry requirements. But in the spring, the EU put Georgia's accession on hold and cut financial support after the Georgian parliament passed a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-georgia-nato-european-union-protest-caucasus-66274e28828418301a44d80bad6c9ccd	2024-12-02T08:15:25-08:00	
French government faces no-confidence vote over Barnier's austerity budget	PARIS (AP) — French Prime Minister Michel Barnier is bracing for a no-confidence vote this week, a political reckoning almost certain to topple his fragile government and send shockwaves across the eurozone. Barnier on Monday invoked a rarely used constitutional mechanism to push through the contentious 2025 budget without parliamentary approval, arguing it was essential to maintain 'stability' amid deep political divisions. The move immediately drew sharp backlash, with Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally and the leftist New Popular Front both filing no-confidence motions in response, setting the stage for a vote as early as Wednesday that could see Barnier’s ouster. The looming showdown unfolds against the backdrop of a fractured National Assembly, left in disarray after June’s snap elections delivered no clear majority. President Emmanuel Macron had turned to Barnier in September to navigate the impasse and address France’s soaring deficit. Yet Barnier’s proposed austerity budget — slashing 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raising taxes by 20 billion euros — has only deepened divisions, inflaming tensions in the lower house and triggering this dramatic political confrontation. The use of the constitutional tool, called Article 49.3, allows the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote but leaves it exposed to no-confidence motions. Opposition leaders argue that Barnier’s concessions, including scrapping an electricity tax hike, do not go far enough to address their concerns. Le Pen accused Barnier of ignoring her party’s demands. 'Everyone must shoulder their responsibilities,' she said. The political standoff has unsettled financial markets, with borrowing costs rising sharply amid fears of prolonged instability. Barnier warned of 'serious turbulence' if the budget isn’t passed, but critics dismissed his remarks as fear-mongering. If the no-confidence motion succeeds, Macron will remain president but will need to appoint a new prime minister to steer legislation through the fractured assembly. The uncertainty threatens to deepen France’s economic troubles and reverberate across the eurozone.	https://apnews.com/article/france-budget-politics-crisis-macron-09bf6ec0fa3ed44bc3ffc6c17a792b25	2024-12-02T08:03:15-08:00	
PHOTOS OF THE YEAR: Through photographers' lenses, an epic catalog of humanity in 2024 emerges	In nearly 100 countries and all 50 U.S. states, visual journalists with The Associated Press are eyewitnesses to the world’s news, and have won 36 of AP's 59 Pulitzer Prizes since the award was established in 1917. AP photographers assembled a visual catalog of our civilization as life in 2024 hurtled directly at us at every speed and in every imaginable color and flavor — dizzying, unremitting, challenging the human race to make sense of it. And behind it all, the unspoken questions: How do you stop time? How do you preserve moments? Amid all the quick cuts that cut to the quick, how do you absorb what needs to be seen and remembered? The answer is encapsulated — as it has been for nearly two centuries now — in one word that contains multitudes and possibilities: photography. This year, AP photographers across the world captured 2024’s vast catalogue of events, from breaking news (wars, natural disasters, an assassination attempt) to intimate moments both quiet and exuberant. Thanks to photographers and their cameras, we were able to look down from the air. We crawled on the ground and looked up at events unfolding. We swam in the ocean. We gazed from a distance and got in front of fascinating faces. We looked straight on. We stared at the news from oblique angles. We saw landscapes of violence and of inspiration, and we saw intimate detail that only a modern digital camera with a talented human being behind it can deliver. We saw how people across the planet elected each other, loved each other, broke bread with each other, competed against each other in the most prestigious of forums. We saw them pray for — and with — each other, kill each other, mourn each other. Through photographers’ lenses, from the widest of wide angles to the most formidable of zooms, we saw: A pope alone in his chair, contemplating. Lava flowing across a burning landscape in Iceland. A former president of the United States — now its next president, too — thrusting his fist skyward in defiance after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt outside a small western Pennsylvania city. How do we stop time in 2024? A photographer reaches the scene, presses a button. A sophisticated contraption reacts to light. Pixels are preserved, edited and transmitted across the world. Through the lens, time stopped for a fraction of a second on Feb. 11 when Taylor Swift kissed Travis Kelce after his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, won the Super Bowl. In these images, people fight heat, battle cold, grapple with drought, take to the sea, pass the baton, cast the fishing line, beat each other with sticks. Anxiously and expectantly, they look for better lives; sometimes, they find them. The child was born on the water — on a boat along the River Bhramaputra in northeastern India on July 3, one of more than 100 million babies to arrive during a convulsive year. Her first tears in this world were frozen in time, made available to faraway eyes for one simple reason: a photographer was there to bear witness. In photography, vantage point is everything. Where the camera goes is what we see. The choices that AP photographers make in mere seconds can shape how we see our world for years. Flip through these photos in that light, and they become more impactful than they already are. Consider the case of Christophe Chavilinga, a 90-year-old man from a camp for displaced people called Munigi in eastern Congo. This year, he fell sick with mpox. By Aug. 16, blistering lesions covered great parts of his face. That was the day that, while he waited to be treated at a clinic, he stared straight into a camera. His eyes were weary. His mouth drooped. His dignity came through in every pixel. That moment, frozen, was beamed around the world. We saw prisoners reaching out from their cells for bread at a Paraguayan prison in July — their outstretched hands grasping, hoping for something to come their way. Each image manages to stop the world just a little. It gives us snippets of time to think about those around us and those far from us — and how they, like so many, are muddling their way through the 21st century, trying to survive and prosper. Some succeed, some do not. ___ Ted Anthony, director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation for The Associated Press, writes frequently about photography.

US will send Ukraine $725 million more in counter-drone systems, anti-personnel land mines	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is preparing to send Ukraine an additional $725 million in military assistance, including counter-drone systems and munitions for its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, which could indicate more of the longer-range missiles are headed to the battlefield. Two U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the package before it was announced, did not confirm whether the munitions for the HIMARS are the coveted ATACMS — the Army Tactical Missile System. But Ukraine has been pressing for more of the longer-range missiles to strike additional targets inside Russia. The package also includes more of the anti-personnel land mines that Ukraine is counting on to slow Russian and North Korean ground forces in Russia's Kursk region. President Joe Biden has pledged to spend all of the military assistance funds Congress approved earlier this year for Ukraine before the end of his administration on Jan. 20, which before Monday's news included about $7.1 billion in weapons that would be drawn from the Pentagon’s stockpiles. There is widespread speculation about what the new Trump administration will mean for Ukraine as the incoming president has promised to end the conflict. In a major shift, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signaled on Friday that an an offer of NATO membership to territory under Kyiv’s control could end 'the hot stage of the war.'	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-725-million-weapons-us-biden-38eaf70cad013d25cc7c505f7a3b6bcf	2024-12-02T06:52:43-08:00	
Hezbollah fires into Israel-held area after multiple Israeli strikes in Lebanon since truce began	JERUSALEM (AP) — Hezbollah fired into a disputed border zone held by Israel on Monday after multiple Israeli strikes inside Lebanon since a ceasefire took hold last week. The militant group said the volley, its first during the truce, was a warning shot in response to what it called repeated Israeli violations. Israeli leaders threatened to retaliate, further straining the fragile U.S.- and French-brokered ceasefire. The truce called for a 60-day halt in fighting, which aims to end more than a year of war between Hezbollah and Israel that's part of a wider regional conflict sparked by the devastating Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Israeli strikes in Lebanon in recent days have killed at least four people and wounded others. Lebanon’s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, accused Israel of violating the truce more than 50 times in recent days, with strikes, demolition of homes near the border and overflight of drones. Israel has said its strikes were in response to unspecified Hezbollah violations and that under the ceasefire deal it reserves the right to retaliate. The Israeli military said Hezbollah launched two projectiles on Monday toward Mount Dov, a disputed Israeli-held territory known as Shebaa Farms in Lebanon, where the borders of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel meet. Israel said the projectiles fell in open areas and no injuries were reported. Hezbollah said in a statement that it fired on an Israeli military position in the area as a 'defensive and warning response' after what it called 'repeated violations' of the ceasefire deal by Israel. It said complaints to mediators tasked with monitoring the ceasefire 'were futile in stopping these violations.' Officials in the United States — which along with France heads a commission meant to monitor adherence to the deal — played down the significance of Israeli strikes. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said, 'Largely speaking, the ceasefire is holding.' 'We’ve gone from dozens of strikes down to one a day maybe two a day,' Kirby said, referring to Israeli strikes. 'We’re going to keep trying and see what we can do to get it down to zero,' he told reporters aboard Air Force One as President Joe Biden made his way for a visit to Angola. Israel threatens retaliation Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Hezbollah fire was 'a serious violation' and vowed, 'Israel will respond forcefully.' Defense Minister Israel Katz said the volley 'will be met with a harsh response.' Under the ceasefire deal, Iran-backed Hezbollah has 60 days to withdraw its fighters and infrastructure from southern Lebanon, pulling back north of the Litani River, which is about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the Israeli-Lebanese border. During that time, Israeli troops are also to withdraw to their side of the border. On Monday before the Hezbollah fire, Israeli carried out at least four airstrikes and an artillery barrage on different parts of southern Lebanon, including a drone strike that killed a person on a motorcycle, according to Lebanese state media. Another strike killed a corporal in the Lebanese security services, state media said. The Israeli military said it carried out operations in the south against Hezbollah militants, 'thwarting threats to Israeli civilians,' without elaborating. Another drone strike Monday hit a Lebanese army bulldozer, wounding a soldier, in the northeastern town of Hermel – far north of the Litani River. The Israeli military said it hit military vehicles operating 'in the area of a Hezbollah missile manufacturing site.' The Lebanese army, which stayed on the sidelines of the Israel-Hezbollah fighting, is supposed to deploy additional troops in the south alongside U.N. peacekeepers to ensure Hezbollah’s withdrawal from the area. An Israeli strike on Saturday in the southern Marjayoun area killed two people, according to state media. In a video statement, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel was striking Hezbollah fighters in the south when they are identified or seen attempting to move weapons. 'Their presence south of the Litani River is the most basic violation of the understandings … They must move north immediately,' he said, despite the 60-day period the deal gives for a pullback. Fears of hunger mount in Gaza In Gaza, meanwhile, alarm over increasing hunger was growing — with the amount of food allowed in by Israel plunging over the past two months, compounded by a decision Sunday by the U.N. to halt aid deliveries from the main crossing into the territory because of the threat of armed gangs looting convoys. Experts already warned of famine in the northernmost part of Gaza, which Israeli forces have almost completely isolated since early October. Muhannad Hadi, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian Territories, warned on Monday of 'severe hunger surging' in central and southern Gaza as well. Speaking at a conference in Cairo aimed at increasing aid, he said more than 1 million people have not received their monthly food rations since July. Israel’s campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas’ Oct 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, has driven almost the entire population of the territory from their homes. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians now live in squalid tent camps and reliant on international aid. In a tent camp in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, Palestinians lined up at makeshift mud ovens trying to buy a few loaves of flatbread for their families. With the price of flour mounting because of scarcity, the bakers — women displaced from further north — said they could bake less bread, and families could afford far less. 'They divide them to their children, one loaf every day,' said Wafaa al-Attar, who was selling bread she made in a clay oven. A distant relative also selling bread, Enayat al-Attar, said some people cut up a single piece of flatbread among themselves. 'Flour is running out for everyone,' she said. The Israeli military said it allowed 40 trucks carrying 600 tons of flour for the World Food Program to enter the southern Gaza Strip on Sunday night, as well as 16 other food trucks. Israel has said it is working to increase the flow of aid. November saw an increase in the average number of humanitarian trucks it let into Gaza, up to 77 daily from 57 the month before, according to official Israeli figures. But the levels are still nearly the lowest of the entire 15-month war. And the U.N. says less than half of that actually reaches Palestinians because Israeli military restrictions, fighting and robberies make it too dangerous to deliver the aid. On Sunday, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said it is halting aid deliveries through Kerem Shalom, the main artery for aid, because of repeated robberies. It blamed the breakdown of law and order in large part on Israeli policies. ___ Abou AlJoud reported from Beirut.

Stars, heads of state, solemn rituals and high-security celebrations for Notre Dame's reopening	PARIS (AP) — The reopening of Notre Dame this coming weekend is going to be a high-security affair, with a repeat of some measures used during the Paris Olympics and the sealing-off to tourists of the cathedral's island location in the heart of the French capital. After more than five years of reconstruction following the fire that devastated Notre Dame in 2019, invite-only ceremonies Saturday and Sunday will usher in its rebirth. Police chief Laurent Nuñez said only people with invitations and the island's residents will have access to the Ile de la Cité in the middle of the River Seine, which includes Notre Dame and habitually hums with tourists. He said about 50 heads of state and government are expected and that security arrangements are drawing on the police measures that sealed off large sections of central Paris for the Paris Games' flamboyant opening ceremony. 'A very high level of security will be applied,' Nuñez said in an interview published Monday in Le Parisien. Archbishop to bang on the doors The first celebrations starting Saturday afternoon will blend religious ritual and showbiz. Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will preside at a reopening service, banging on Notre Dame's shuttered doors with his staff to reopen them, the cathedral website says. The archbishop will also symbolically reawaken Notre Dame's thunderous grand organ. The fire that melted the cathedral's lead roofing coated the huge instrument in toxic dust. Its 8,000 pipes, ranging in size from that of a pen to over 10 meters (33 feet) tall, have been painstakingly disassembled, cleaned, and retuned. There will also be psalms, prayers and singing. French President Emmanuel Macron will attend and address the VIP guests. A musical show After the service, opera singers Pretty Yende, from South Africa, and Julie Fuchs, from France; Chinese pianist Lang Lang; cellist Yo-Yo Ma; Benin-born singer Angelique Kidjo; Lebanese singer Hiba Tawaji and others will perform at a concert Saturday evening for the cathedral and those who took part in the reconstruction, says the show's broadcaster, France Télévisions. The security cordon sealing off the whole of the Ile de La Cité, plus a stretch of the Seine's southern bank and nine of its bridges, will be in place from early Saturday evening to Sunday night, the police chief said. Only those involved in the ceremonies and residents will be granted access, he said. All shops on the island — many are geared to the tourist trade — as well as boat tours that start and stop there will be closed for the weekend, he added. Sunday Mass and buffet The Paris archbishop will also lead an inaugural Mass and consecration of the new altar on Sunday morning. Nearly 170 bishops from France and other countries will join the celebration, as well as priests from all 106 parishes in the Paris diocese, the cathedral website says. It says Mass will be followed by a 'fraternal buffet' for the needy. Public viewing areas capable of holding 40,000 people will be set up on the Seine’s southern bank, so spectators can follow the two days of events on screens, the police chief said. ___ For more of AP’s coverage on Notre Dame, visit https://apnews.com/hub/notre-dame-cathedral	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-cathedral-reopens-ceremony-security-fire-efc740d20cf91f5ba1eabf45eecfe8ad	2024-12-02T03:44:07-08:00	
Philippine navy shadows Russian submarine spotted in the South China Sea	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine military deployed a navy ship and air force planes to shadow a Russian submarine, which passed through the South China Sea off the country’s western coast last week, a security official said Monday. The Russian submarine identified itself in response to a Philippine navy two-way radio inquiry, saying it was en route home to Russia’s eastern city of Vladivostok after joining an exercise with the Malaysian navy, Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the National Security Council, said. The submarine, like other foreign ships, has the right of 'innocent passage' in the country’s exclusive economic zone but it still sparked concern when it was spotted on Thursday about 80 nautical miles (148 kilometers) off the Philippine province of Mindoro, Malaya said. The submarine was sighted after it surfaced due to weather-related conditions, Malaya said. 'All of that is very concerning,' President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told reporters when asked about the submarine. 'Any intrusion into the West Philippine Sea, of our EEZ, of our baselines is very worrisome. So, yes, it’s just another one.' Marcos used the Philippine name for the South China Sea, where his country plus Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and other coastal states have faced an increasingly aggressive China, which claims the busy waterway virtually in its entirety. An alarming spike in territorial confrontations, particularly between Chinese and Philippine coast guard and naval forces, starting last year has prompted closer surveillance by the United States and other Western governments of the key global trade route.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-russian-submarine-south-china-sea-88d9ec7d91fc1f5294cfa8ad31e635eb	2024-12-02T01:30:21-08:00	
Volkswagen workers hold 2-hour strikes to push back against proposed pay cuts and plant closures	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Volkswagen workers launched rolling two-hour strikes Monday at nine plants across Germany to underscore their resistance to pay cuts and factory closures the company says are necessary to cope with a slack European auto market. The work stoppages included the company's base plant at Wolfsburg, where workers rallied against a cost-cutting drive by the automaker’s management in which they face the threat of the company’s first plant closures in its home country. Volkswagen argues that it must lower costs in Germany to levels achieved by competitors and by Volkswagen plants in eastern Europe and South America. Chief employee representative Daniela Cavallo has said employees should not shoulder the burden of management failures to develop attractive products and come up with a cheaper, entry-level electric vehicle. 'We demand that all make their contribution – management and the shareholder side as well,' Cavallo said at the rally in Wolfsburg as employees drummed, whistled and clapped. She said the next round of talks in a week’s time 'is likely to set the course – rapprochement or escalation. We are ready for both.' The so-called warning strikes, a common tactic in German wage negotiations, are taking place as part of talks for a new labor agreement after a mandatory peace period that bars strikes expired on Sunday. The IG Metall industrial union said any job actions beyond those occurring on Monday would be announced later. The company is demanding a 10% pay cut for 120,000 German workers and has said it can't avoid shedding factory capacity that is no longer needed. Employee representatives say the company has proposed closing three of its German plants. Thorsten Gröger, the regional leader of the IG Metall industrial union in Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is headquartered, said that the company won’t be able to 'overlook' the walkouts. 'If necessary, this will be one of the toughest conflicts Volkswagen has ever seen.' The company hasn't publicly detailed its plans but is facing a drop in demand in Europe, higher costs and increasing competition from Chinese automakers. Volkswagen built factories to supply a European car market of 16 million in annual vehicle sales, but now faces demand for around 14 million, Volkswagen brand head Thomas Schaefer was quoted as saying in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. Since Volkswagen has a quarter of the market, that represents a loss of 500,000 cars a year. For years, strong profits in China helped cover higher costs but the changing environment now means that 'it's high time to address this,' Schaefer said. The walkouts began at a plant in Zwickau in eastern Germany and were to continue at plants in Braunschweig, Chemnitz, Dresden, Emden, Hanover, Kassel, and Salzgitter. The next negotiations are slated for Dec. 9.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-volkswagen-strikes-d43f84ca4c633b8231fb45cf62887d01	2024-12-02T00:55:16-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israel says soldier thought to have been taken hostage is now presumed dead	The Israeli military said Monday an Israeli American soldier who was believed to have been captured alive by Hamas in its Oct. 7, 2023, attack was killed that day and his body taken into the Gaza Strip. Hamas is still holding around 100 hostages inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. The Biden administration says it is making another push for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining hostages, after nearly a year of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas repeatedly stalled. Diplomats see a potential opening after last week’s ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group, an ally of Hamas that began launching rocket attacks and trading fire with Israel the day after the October 2023 attack. The fragile ceasefire has held despite repeated Israeli strikes that have angered Lebanese officials but not yet triggered a response from Hezbollah. Israel says it has acted to thwart potential attacks. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. More than 100 hostages were released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israel’s ongoing retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,429 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has destroyed vast areas of the coastal enclave and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Here’s the Latest: Israeli American soldier thought to have been taken hostage is now presumed dead TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said Monday an Israeli American soldier who was believed to have been taken hostage alive on Oct. 7, 2023, is now presumed to have been killed during Hamas’ attack and his body taken into Gaza. Neutra, 21, was a New York native who enlisted in the Israeli military and was captured when Hamas attacked southern Israel. Neutra’s parents, Ronen and Orna, led a public campaign while he was thought to be alive for their son’s freedom. They spoke at protests in the U.S. and Israel, addressed the Republican National Convention this year and kept up ties with the Biden administration in their crusade to secure their son’s release. In a statement announcing the death, the military did not say how it came to the conclusion over Neutra’s fate. He was one of seven American Israelis still held in Gaza, four of whom are now said to be dead. Hamas released a video of one, Edan Alexander, over the weekend, indicating he was still alive. In late summer, Hamas killed Hersh Goldberg-Polin, another prominent Israeli American hostage, along with five other captives, whose bodies the Israeli military recovered. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Some 100 captives are still held inside Gaza, around two-thirds believed to be alive. Iranian-supported Iraqi militias back Syrian government's counteroffensive against insurgents Iraqi militias supported by Iran deployed in Syria on Monday to back the government’s counteroffensive against a surprise advance by insurgents who seized the largest city of Aleppo, a militia official and a war monitor said. Insurgents led by jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham launched a two-pronged attack on Aleppo last week and the countryside around Idlib before moving toward neighboring Hama province. Government troops built a fortified defensive line in northern Hama in an attempt to stall the insurgents’ momentum while jets on Sunday pounded rebel-held lines. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with Syrian President Bashar Assad in Damascus Sunday and announced Tehran’s full support for his government. He later arrived for talks in Ankara, Turkey, one of the rebels' main backers. Iran has been of Assad’s principal political and military supporters and deployed military advisers and forces after 2011 protests against Assad’s rule turned into an all-out war. Tehran-backed Iraqi militias already in Syria mobilized and additional forces crossed the border to support them, said the Iraqi militia official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. According to Britain-based opposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, some 200 Iraqi militiamen on pickups crossed into Syria overnight through the strategic Bou Kamal. They were expected to deploy in Aleppo to support the Syrian army’s pushback against the insurgents, the monitor said. US Navy destroys Houthi missiles and drones targeting American ships in Gulf of Aden DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — U.S. Navy destroyers shot down seven missiles and drones fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels at the warships and three American merchant vessels they were escorting through the Gulf of Aden. No damage or injuries were reported. U.S. Central Command said late Sunday that the destroyers USS Stockdale and USS O’Kane shot down and destroyed three anti-ship ballistic missiles, three drones and one anti-ship cruise missile. The merchant ships were not identified. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement and said they had targeted the U.S. destroyers and 'three supply ships belonging to the American army in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden.' Houthi attacks for months have targeted shipping through a waterway where $1 trillion in goods pass annually over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Israel’s ground offensive in Lebanon. A ceasefire was announced in Lebanon last week. The USS Stockdale was involved in a similar attack on Nov. 12. ___ Read more of the AP's coverage of the Middle East wars: https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-war-latest-2-december-2024-8ae460d7a2796c0bf93a2293d26d0fdf	2024-12-02T00:48:38-08:00	
Police in Georgia move again to disperse protests over the suspension of EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Police in Georgia's capital again moved to disperse thousands of demonstrators on Monday after over 200 people were detained during four previous nights of protests against the government’s decision to suspend negotiations to join the European Union. Police used water cannons and tear gas to drive protesters away from the parliament building where they have gathered each night since Thursday when the ruling Georgian Dream party declared its decision to put EU accession talks on hold. Georgian Dream's disputed victory in the country’s Oct. 26 parliamentary election, widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s aspirations to join the EU, has sparked mass demonstrations and the opposition boycott of the parliament. The opposition and the country's pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with Moscow's help. Georgia’s Interior Ministry said Monday that 224 protesters were detained on administrative charges and three arrested on criminal charges. So far, 113 police officers needed medical treatment while three others were hospitalized after clashes with protesters, who hurled fireworks at police. Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili said many of the arrested protesters had injuries to their heads and faces, including broken bones and eye sockets. Writing on X and citing lawyers who represent the detained, she said some people were subject to systematic beatings between arrest and transportation to detention facilities. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has rejected official election results and refused to recognize the parliament's legitimacy. She has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to spearhead the demands for a new parliamentary election. The president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, and foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas spoke to Zourabichvili on Sunday to condemn the violence against protesters and to note that 'the actions of the government run counter to the will of the people,' Costa wrote on X. Kallas and EU enlargement commissioner Marta Kos also released a joint statement that reiterated the EU’s 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country' and urged Georgian authorities to 'respect the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, and refrain from using force against peaceful protesters, politicians and media representatives.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of Georgian Dream has warned the opposition that 'any violation of the law will be met with the full rigor of the law.' 'Neither will those politicians who hide in their offices and sacrifice members of their violent groups to severe punishment escape responsibility,' he said. Kobakhidze argued that the government remains committed to the goal of European integration, claiming that 'the only thing we have rejected is the shameful and offensive blackmail.' The government’s announcement of the EU accession talks’ suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October’s election in Georgia as neither free nor fair. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc’s recommendations but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. Georgian Dream has increasingly adopted repressive laws mirroring those in Russia which crack down on freedom of speech and curtail LGBTQ+ rights. A law banning same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relations and people in the media came into force Monday. Speaking to The Associated Press on Saturday, Zourabichvili said that her country was becoming a 'quasi-Russian' state and that Georgian Dream controlled the major institutions. 'We are not demanding a revolution. We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again,' Zourabichvili said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov alleged parallels between protests in Georgia and massive demonstrations in Ukraine that led to the ouster of a Moscow friendly leader in 2014. Speaking to reporters on Monday, he accused outside forces of trying to 'destabilize the situation' and insisted that Russia is not interfering in Georgia.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-protest-election-russia-eu-c953b95d04ae2f4de3d272e3c4bb1039	2024-12-02T00:31:14-08:00	
Elton John says he has lost his eyesight and struggles to see his new stage musical	LONDON (AP) — Elton John says he struggled to watch his new musical because he has lost his eyesight after contracting an infection. The singer-songwriter attended the opening night of 'The Devil Wears Prada' in London on Sunday and told the audience that 'I haven’t been able to come to many of the previews because, as you know, I have lost my eyesight.' 'So it’s hard for me to see it, but I love to hear it and, boy, it sounded good tonight,' he said. John, 77, disclosed in September that an infection had left him 'with only limited vision in one eye.' He wrote on Instagram that 'I am healing, but it’s an extremely slow process and it will take some time before sight returns to the impacted eye.' John wrote the score for 'The Devil Wears Prada,' a stage musical based on the 2006 movie about a young journalist navigating the glamour and egos of a glossy fashion magazine. The production at London’s Dominion Theatre stars Vanessa Williams as the fearsome editor Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep in the film. Sunday’s gala, a fundraiser for the Elton John AIDS Foundation, was attended by celebrities and fashion-industry figures including designer Donatella Versace and former Vogue editor Anna Wintour, the rumored inspiration for the Priestly character.

He did not further elaborate but Iran has been of Assad's principal political and military supporters and has deployed military advisers and forces after 2011 protests against Assad’s rule turned into an all-out war.

Impeachment complaint filed against Philippine Vice President Duterte after she threatened president	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — An impeachment complaint was filed Monday against Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing a legal storm over a death threat she made against the president and her alleged role in extra-judicial killings of drug suspects, corruption and failure to stand up to Chinese aggression in the disputed South China Sea. The impeachment bid filed by several prominent civil society activists in the House of Representatives accuses Duterte of violating the country’s Constitution, betrayal of public trust and other 'high crimes,' including the death threats she made against the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives. Duterte did not immediately issue any response to the impeachment bid, which accused her of about two dozen alleged crimes. 'We're hoping that with this complaint, we can end the nightmare that our vice president has brought to the people,' said Rep. Percival Cendana, who gave the required endorsement of the complaint. The vice president’s threats showed the 'extent of respondent’s mental incapacity, her depravity and lack of mental fitness to continue holding the high office of vice president of the Philippines,' said a copy of the complaint seen by The Associated Press. 'The same constitute not only betrayal of public trust but also a high crime which would warrant her immediate impeachment from office.' Duterte, a 46-year-old lawyer, was also accused in the complaint of having unexplained wealth and of allowing a continuation of the extra-judicial killings of drug suspects begun by her father, a former mayor of southern Davao City, when she held that position in the past. The vice president’s legal troubles have unfolded with the backdrop of her increasingly bitter political feud with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his allies. She said in online news conference on Nov. 23 that she has contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Speaker Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned was not a joke. She later said she was not threatening him but was expressing concern for her own safety. The impeachment complaint will be scrutinized by the Philippine Congress, which is dominated by allies of Marcos and his cousin and key backer, Romualdez, who also has been politically at odds with the vice president. The process could take weeks or months. Congress is to start its Christmas recess on Dec. 20 and resume on Jan. 13. Many legislators will then start campaigning for reelection before May 12 midterm elections. The House has been investigating the alleged misuse of 612.5 million pesos ($10.3 million) of confidential and intelligence funds received by Duterte’s offices as vice president and education secretary. She has since left the education post. She has refused to respond to questions in detail in tense televised hearings. Duterte also vehemently protested when her chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, was ordered temporarily detained for allegedly hampering the inquiry. Lopez has been released from hospital detention. Philippine police have filed criminal complaints against Duterte and her security staff for allegedly assaulting authorities and disobeying orders in an altercation in Congress over Lopez’s detention. Duterte has accused Marcos, his wife and Romualdez of corruption, weak leadership and attempting to muzzle her because of speculation she may seek the presidency in 2028. The National Bureau of Investigation subpoenaed Duterte to face investigators about her threats against them. The police, military and the national security adviser immediately boosted the security of the Marcoses after the threats. The president has said an impeachment of Duterte would waste time while the country faces other challenges, but her opponents have said they will proceed to foster accountability and the rule of law. Marcos and Duterte won landslide victories as running mates in the 2022 election but have since fallen out over key differences. The two offices are elected separately in the Philippines, which has resulted in rivals occupying the country’s top political posts. Marcos and Duterte differ on their approaches to China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea and their views on the deadly anti-drug crackdown conducted by Duterte’s father, Rodrigo Duterte, who was the previous president in addition to ex-mayor of Davao. The complainants in the impeachment, including former military officers from a group called Magdalo, accused her of refusing to condemn Chinese aggressive actions against Philippine forces in the South China Sea. The complainants did not cite China by name. The brutal drug crackdown left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead in killings mostly by police that are being investigated by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity. The impeachment complaint cited a key witness to the killings, former police officer Arturo Lascanas, as saying that Sara Duterte allowed the extra-judicial killings of drug suspects to continue in Davao city when she served as its mayor. The drug crackdown was launched by her father when he was mayor. ___ Associated Press journalists Aaron Favila and Joeal Calupitan contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-duterte-impeachment-complaint-marcos-073f5ae8bf4bec1af48bdd24dec70635	2024-12-01T23:54:49-08:00	
Hong Kong launches panda sculpture tour as the city hopes the bear craze boosts tourism	HONG KONG (AP) — Thousands of giant panda sculptures will greet residents and tourists starting Saturday in Hong Kong, where enthusiasm for the bears has grown since two cubs were born in a local theme park. The 2,500 exhibits were showcased in a launch ceremony of PANDA GO! FEST HK, the city's largest panda-themed exhibition, at Hong Kong's airport on Monday. They will be publicly displayed at the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui, a popular shopping district, this weekend before setting their footprint at three other locations this month. One designated spot is Ocean Park, home to the twin cubs, their parents and two other pandas gifted by Beijing this year. The design of six of the sculptures, made of recycled rubber barrels and resins among other materials, was inspired by these bears. The cubs — whose birth in August made their mother Ying Ying the world’s oldest first-time panda mom — may meet visitors as early as February. In a separate media preview event on Monday, the new pair of Beijing-gifted pandas, An An and Ke Ke, who arrived in September, appeared relaxed in their new home at Ocean Park. An An enjoyed eating bamboo in front of the cameras and Ke Ke climbed on an installation. They are set to meet the public on Sunday. The displays reflect Hong Kong’s use of pandas to boost its economy as the Chinese financial hub works to regain its position as one of Asia’s top tourism destinations. Pandas are considered China’s unofficial national mascot. The country’s giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing’s soft-power diplomacy. Hong Kong's tourism industry representatives are upbeat about the potential impact of housing six pandas, hoping to boost visitor numbers even though caring for pandas in captivity is expensive. Officials have encouraged businesses to capitalize on the popularity of the bears to seize opportunities in what some lawmakers have dubbed the 'panda economy.' The organizer of the exhibitions also invited some renowned figures, including musician Pharrell Williams, to create special-edition panda designs. Most of these special sculptures will be auctioned online for charity and the proceeds will be donated to Ocean Park to support giant panda conversation efforts. Ying Ying and the twin cubs' father, Le Le, are the second pair of pandas gifted by Beijing to Hong Kong since the former British colony returned to China’s rule in 1997. The first pair were An An and Jia Jia who arrived in 1999. Jia Jia, who died at 38 in 2016, is the world’s oldest-ever panda to have lived in captivity. The average lifespan for a panda in the wild is 14 to 20 years, while in captivity it’s up to 30 years, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-panda-2500-sculptures-exhibitions-e03631be33fe7a5b367bcde89f7d399c	2024-12-01T23:17:46-08:00	
Scientists gather to decode puzzle of the world's rarest whale in 'extraordinary' New Zealand study	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — It is the world’s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery. 'I can’t tell you how extraordinary it is,' said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand’s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. 'For me personally, it’s unbelievable.' Van Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature -- which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July — is the first ever to take place. None has ever been seen alive at sea. The list of what scientists don’t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don’t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they’ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don’t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don’t know how this one died. Over the next week, researchers studying the 5-meter (16-foot) -long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin hope to find out. 'There may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,' said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. 'Who knows what we’ll discover?' Only six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification. New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand’s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile’s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986. DNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species — and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn’t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before. On Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks — normal, they said, and not the cause. The dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with Māori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. To Māori, whales are a taonga -– a precious treasure -– and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor. Members of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -– a prayer -– over the creature before the study begins. 'According to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,' said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te Rūnanga Ōtākou. 'It’s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.' The iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale’s head this week. 'It all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,' Cassidy said. It’s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world’s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean's deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery. The assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery. 'What we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,' said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. 'In discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.'	https://apnews.com/article/rarest-whale-zealand-spade-toothed-dissection-d71aad4ce6e47f4e1056a10cf5b8610e	2024-12-01T23:03:00-08:00	
Landmark climate change case opens at the top UN court as island nations fear rising seas	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The top United Nations court took up the largest case in its history on Monday, hearing the plight of several small island nations helpless in combating the devastating impact of climate change that they feel endangers their survival. They demand that major polluting nations be held to account. After years of lobbying by island nations who fear they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice last year for an opinion on 'the obligations of States in respect of climate change.' 'The stakes could not be higher. The survival of my people and so many others is on the line,' said Arnold Kiel Loughman, attorney-general of the Vanuatu archipelago nation. 'As the principal legal officer of my country, I have come before this court because domestic legal remedies are unable to address a crisis of the scope and magnitude,' he said during the opening session of two weeks of hearings. 'States have obligations, obligation to act with due diligence, to prevent significant harm to the environment, to prevent, to reduce the emissions and provide support to countries like mine to protect the human rights of present and future generations,' he said. Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and couldn't directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could be the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis. 'The conduct on trial here is that of states which have failed for over a century despite increasingly dire warnings to rein in the emissions from their territories. I must emphasize that since 1990, emissions have increased by over 50%, reaching an all time high in 2023,' Vanuatu’s climate change envoy Ralph Regenvanu told the court. He added that 'a handful of readily identifiable states have produced the vast majority of historic and current greenhouse gas emissions. Yet other countries, including my own, are suffering the brunt of the consequences.' The Hague-based court will hear from 99 countries and more than a dozen intergovernmental organizations over two weeks. It’s the largest lineup in the institution’s nearly 80-year history. Last month at the United Nations’ annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the $1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed. 'For our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the world’s biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines,' said Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change. Fifteen judges from around the world will seek to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? The second question makes particular reference to 'small island developing States' likely to be hardest hit by climate change and to 'members of 'the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change.' The judges were even briefed on the science behind rising global temperatures by the U.N.’s climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ahead of the hearings.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-world-court-icj-climate-global-warming-e954301f0258509f67e66ae2762da6f6	2024-12-01T22:54:37-08:00	
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is in Ukraine for his first visit in 2 1/2 years	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Ukraine for the first time in more than 2 1/2 years Monday, just weeks after he was criticized by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for having a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. That call came at a time of widespread speculation about what the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump will mean for Ukraine as the incoming president has promised to end the conflict. In a major shift, Zelenskyy signalled Friday that an an offer of NATO membership to territory under Kyiv’s control could end 'the hot stage of the war' in Ukraine. Scholz's visit comes ahead of an early German election expected in February. As the campaign gets under way, Scholz has pointed to Germany’s status as Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier while also highlighting his 'prudence' in working to prevent the war escalating and refusing to deliver Taurus long-range cruise missiles. Scholz has been cautious about talk of fast-tracking NATO membership for Ukraine. In recent months, he has emphasized the importance of finding a path to peace, while stressing that it must not be chosen over Ukraine’s head. Scholz said that in his meeting with Zelenskyy he will announce further military deliveries this month totaling 650 million euros. 'I would like to make clear here on the ground that Germany will remain Ukraine’s strongest supporter in Europe,' he said. Despite that, Scholz was criticized by Zelenskyy in November for speaking to Putin in what appeared to be the first conversation with the sitting leader of a major Western power in nearly two years. In that call, Scholz urged Putin to be open to negotiations with Ukraine but the Russian leader said any peace deal should acknowledge Russia’s territorial gains and security demands, including that Kyiv renounce joining NATO. Zelenskyy suggested the call to Putin risked opening 'a Pandora’s box' and would only serve to make Russia less isolated. He traveled to Berlin in October to meet Scholz to drum up support for his 'victory plan' to end the war in Ukraine on a tour of European capitals. The plan included a suggestion that Ukraine receive a formal invitation to join NATO and a request that Kyiv be given permission to use long-range Western missiles to strike at military targets inside Russia. Some Western nations granted permission for Kyiv to carry out long-range strikes with their weapons in November. Following the decision, Putin said Russia launched a strike on Ukraine with an unstoppable intermediate range ballistic missile dubbed the Oreshnik. It marked the first time that such a missile was used in the war or in any other conflict. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-germany-scholz-6b937199e732653dab0e1c4ed400b69c	2024-12-01T22:16:11-08:00	
56 people killed in stampede following clashes at a Guinea soccer match, authorities say	CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) — Fifty-six people were killed and several injured in a stampede at a soccer stadium in southern Guinea, following clashes between fans, Guinea’s government said Monday. Authorities are conducting an investigation to establish those responsible for the stampede on Sunday, Communications Minister Fana Soumah said in a statement read on national television. Among the victims are several children according to local media and a coalition of political parties. The stampede broke out on Sunday afternoon at the stadium in the city of Nzerekore during the final of a local tournament between the Labe and Nzerekore teams in honor of Guinea’s military leader, Mamadi Doumbouya, Guinea’s Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah said on the X platform. 'During the stampede, victims were recorded,' Bah said, without giving details. The regional authorities are working to restore calm in the area, he added. Local media reported that security forces tried to use tear gas (two words) to restore calm after the chaos that followed a disputed penalty. 'This (the disputed penalty) angered supporters who threw stones. This is how the security services used tear gas,' Media Guinea, a local news website, reported. It said several of those killed were children while some of the injured being treated at a regional hospital are in critical condition. Videos that appeared to be from the scene showed fans in a section of the stadium shouting and protesting the refereeing before clashes broke out as people poured onto the field. People were running as they tried to escape from the stadium, many of them jumping the high fence. Videos also showed many people lying on the floor in what looked like a hospital as a crowd gathered nearby, some assisting the wounded. The National Alliance for Alternation and Democracy opposition coalition called for an investigation. It said the tournament was organized to drum up support for the 'illegal and inappropriate' political ambitions of the military leader. Guinea has been led by the military since soldiers ousted President Alpha Conde in 2021. It is one of a growing number of West African countries, including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where the military has taken power and delayed a return to civilian rule. Doumbouya, who ousted the president three years ago, said he was preventing the country from slipping into chaos and chastised the previous government for broken promises. He has, however, been criticized for not meeting the expectations that he raised.	https://apnews.com/article/guinea-soccer-stampede-8663cce728047148546ad4030b1cedf8	2024-12-01T21:07:18-08:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mixed as Chinese stocks get a boost from strong factory orders	BANGKOK (AP) — World shares were mixed on Monday, with China leading gains as monthly surveys showed improving conditions for manufacturing, partly driven by a surge in orders ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next month. Oil prices rose and U.S. futures edged lower. Both official and private sector surveys of factory managers showed strong new orders and export orders, possibly partly linked to efforts by importers in the U.S. to beat potential tariff hikes by Trump once he takes office. On Saturday, Trump threatened 100% tariffs against the so-called BRIC bloc of nine nations if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar. The BRICs include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he wants the bloc to promise it won't create a new currency or otherwise try to undercut the U.S. dollar. 'Asia’s markets are riding a wave of optimism, catching a significant tailwind from Wall Street’s record-setting day on Friday and buoyed further by emerging signs that China’s economic funk might be easing,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. In early European trading, Germany's DAX was little changed at 19,626.00 and the CAC 40 in Paris sank 0.8% to 7,177.27. Britain's FTSE 100 edged 0.1% lower, to 8,279.24. The futures for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.2%. Innes noted that investors are also anticipating further moves by authorities in China to boost the economy ahead of Trump's inauguration next month. China's leaders usually convene an economic planning meeting in December, setting policy for the coming year. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.7% to 19,550.29, while the Shanghai Composite index jumped 1.1% to 3,363.98. Taiwan’s Taiex surged 2.1%. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.8% to 38,513.02, as the U.S. dollar regained some strength against the Japanese yen, boosting exporters. Toyota Motor Corp. gained 2.3%. Automaker Nissan Motor Co.'s shares initially fell, but they recovered those gains to close 0.4% higher as the company did not confirm reports saying its CFO, Stephen Ma, plans to step down as the company slashes jobs and production due to weakening sales in China and other markets. In South Korea, the Kospi slipped less than 0.1% to 2,454.48, while Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% higher to 8,447.90. In Bangkok, the SET jumped 0.7%. Friday's half-day post-Thanksgiving session ended with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.6% at 6,032.38, while the Dow gained 0.4% to 44,910.65. The Nasdaq added 0.8% to 19,218.17. Some retailers advanced as Black Friday unofficially kicked off the holiday shopping season, although retailers had been offering early deals for weeks. Macy’s and Best Buy each gained around 2%. Tesla shares rose 3.7% Friday and posted a monthly increase of more than 38%. The electric vehicle maker is expected to benefit from CEO Elon Musk’s support of Trump. Musk also gave a boost to Hasbro shares after he triggered takeover speculation when he asked in a post on X how much the toy and game company was worth. Hasbro, which owns the role-playing game Dungeon &amp; Dragons, rose 2%. Apple rose 1.1%. The technology giant is hoping recently added artificial intelligence features are enough to entice consumers to treat themselves or their relatives to a new iPhone for the holidays.

Climate solution: Sails make a comeback in shipping, to dent its huge carbon footprint	SAINT-MALO, France (AP) — Had he continued working aboard fuel-powered cargo ships, Yann Jourdan reckons he'd be earning perhaps four times what he now gets as captain of a sailboat that instead uses the wind's clean energy to transport goods across the Atlantic. But the hit to Jourdan's pay is buying him peace of mind. When his 3-year-old son, Marcel, grows up, the burly French mariner wants to be able to explain what he did to make a dent in the the shipping industry's huge carbon footprint. The international merchant fleet of more than 100,000 ships transports more than 80% of global trade. But it's also responsible for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Without a quick switch from dirty fuels to cleaner energies, its pollution is forecast to soar. Mariners pushing for wind power say investors used to view them as something of a joke. But as they pioneer a comeback for sail-powered cargo ships, they're having the last laugh. 'It’s our job to prove that it’s possible,' Jourdan said aboard the new Grain de Sail II cargo carrier as it sailed off the French port of Saint-Malo one recent autumn day. 'For me, it’s just logical, you know?' he said. 'Like the petrol is limited quantity and the wind is not.' Modern tech is supercharging sailboats The cleanest of the new vessels spearheading wind's embryonic revival are almost pure-sail vessels like Grain de Sail II. Half the length of a soccer field and able to carry 350 tons of goods in its holds, it uses its diesel engine only to maneuver in and out of port. 'We want to not only reduce the carbon footprint, we want to kill it,' said Jacques Barreau, co-founder of the Grain de Sail firm with his twin brother, Olivier. They used profits from their chocolate-making and coffee-roasting business in western France to finance their first sail-powered cargo ship, Grain de Sail I. With its aluminum hull, two giant carbon-fibre masts, mechanized systems for hauling and adjusting the billowing sails, and its bridge bristling with high-tech navigation gear, Grain de Sail II is a supercharged modern successor to sailing clippers of yore. The speediest of its four crossings so far to New York took 17 days, and just 15 days on the return trip to Saint-Malo. 'It’s a totally different way of sailing,' Barreau said. He foresees a future with 'thousands of sailing cargo (vessels) like this one and even bigger versions.' Wind power even for giant carriers Wind-assisted systems to save fuel are also being fitted to engine-powered cargo ships, all the way up to the massive 340-meter (1,115-foot) Sea Zhoushan. It transports iron ore and was built in China with five large spinning rotors on its deck that harness wind energy. When the ship entered service in 2021, Brazilian mining giant Vale said it expects fuel savings of up to 8% on its 40-day voyages between Brazil and China. Finland's Norsepower, the rotor manufacturer, says it has installed them on 16 ships since fitting its first in 2014 and has installations for 13 more vessels on order. Although wind-assisted vessels are just a tiny fraction of the global fleet, their numbers are growing at unprecedented rates, says Clarksons Research, which tracks shipping data. By its count, 165 cargo ships are already using wind to some degree or are due to have wind-assisted systems installed. In the European Union, larger cargo ships have to start paying for some of their emissions from 2025 and adhere to new EU regulations that aim to promote low-carbon fuels. Such pressure could strengthen wind's appeal. 'Ultimately, wind-assisted propulsion is going to help with the global transition for even the largest segments of the cargo shipping sector,' said Bryan Comer, who heads up efforts to decarbonize shipping at the non-profit International Council on Clean Transportation. 'We know that it works, right? Shipping originally was completely wind-powered.' What happens when the wind doesn't blow? But wind — unlike engines — can't be switched on at the touch of a button. French shipper Neoline is open about the fact that when its new 136-meter (446-foot) carrier begins sailing in 2025, it will use its diesel engine when winds alone can't meet its target of 13-day crossings between the French port of Saint-Nazaire and Baltimore on the U.S. eastern seaboard. 'We're aiming for punctuality,' says Neoline’s president, Jean Zanuttini. 'It wasn't speed that killed working sailing at the start of the 20th century, it was lack of punctuality.' 'We accept and recognize the fact that about 30% of our energy will come from a diesel system,' he said. Still, the other 70% from the Neoliner's new type of giant sails — made with fiberglass panels, not canvas — is expected to slash its fuel-use and be another step forward for wind. 'We are going to learn and we are going to improve,' Zanuttini said. 'And tomorrow we'll build ships that are bigger, that are more specialized for certain goods, and more efficient at every level.' Grain de Sail III already on the drawing board After the commercial launch of Grain de Sail I in 2020 and of Grain de Sail II this March, the Barreau twins are working to finance a third boat, Grain de Sail III. It will double the length of its predecessor and carry eight times more cargo, driving down costs. Grain de Sail hopes to have it in service by 2027. But it says its core philosophy will remain unchanged: The bigger ship will also use only wind power, except to maneuver in ports. That rigor shrinks its vessels' carbon footprint to just a small fraction of the emissions from fuel-powered vessels, the firm says. With a large golden ring in his left ear and bushy beard, Jourdan has the look of a pirate as he scrutinizes Grain de Sail II's rigging and tugs on its ropes to check their tautness in the wind. He swears there'll be no going back to fuel-powered carriers for him. 'For me now, it’s a dirty business,' he said. 'I just want to do something that I’m proud of.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Chief of International Criminal Court lashes out at US and Russia over threats and accusations	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The president of the International Criminal Court lashed out at the United States and Russia for interfering with its investigations, calling threats and attacks on the court 'appalling.' 'The court is being threatened with draconian economic sanctions by another permanent member of the Security Council as if it was a terrorist organization,' Judge Tomoko Akane, in her address to the institution’s annual meeting, which opened on Monday. Akane was referring to remarks made by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, whose Republican party will control both branches of Congress in January, and who called the court a 'dangerous joke' and urged Congress to sanction its prosecutor. 'To any ally, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, if you try to help the ICC, we’re going to sanction you,' Graham said on Fox News. This marks the first time the global court of justice calls out a sitting leader of a major Western all. Graham was angered by an announcement last month that judges had granted a request from the court’s chief prosecutor Karim Khan to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief for crimes against humanity in connection with the nearly 14-month war in Gaza. The decision has been denounced by critics of the court and given only milquetoast approval by many of its supporters, a stark contrast to the robust backing of an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin last year over war crimes in Ukraine. Graham’s threat isn’t seen as just empty words. President-elect Donald Trump sanctioned the court’s previous prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, with a travel ban and asset freeze for investigating American troops and intelligence officials in Afghanistan. Akane on Monday also had harsh words for Russia. 'Several elected officials are being subjected to arrest warrants from a permanent member of the Security Council,' she said. Moscow issued warrants for Khan and others in response to the investigation into Putin. The Assembly of States Parties, which represents the ICC’s 124 member countries, will convene its 23rd conference to elect committee members and approve the court’s budget against a backdrop of unfavorable headlines. The ICC was established in 2002 as the world’s permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the most heinous atrocities — war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. The court only becomes involved when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute those crimes on their territory. To date, 124 countries have signed on to the Rome Statute, which created the institution. Those who have not include Israel, Russia and China. The ICC has no police force and relies on member states to execute arrest warrants. U.S. President Joe Biden called the warrants for Netanyahu and the former defense minister 'outrageous' and vowed to stand with Israel. A year ago, Biden called the warrant for Putin 'justified' and said the Russian president had committed war crimes. The U.S. is not an ICC member country. France said it would 'respect its obligations' but would need to consider Netanyahu’s possible immunities. When the warrant for Putin was announced, France said it would 'lend its support to the essential work' of the court. Another member country, Austria, begrudgingly acknowledged it would arrest Netanyahu but called the warrants 'utterly incomprehensible.' Italy called them 'wrong' but said it would be obliged to arrest him. Germany said it would study the decision. Member Hungary has said it would stand with Israel instead of the court. Global security expert Janina Dill worried that such responses could undermine global justice efforts. 'It really has the potential to damage not just the court, but international law,' she told The Associated Press. Milena Sterio, an expert in international law at Cleveland State University, told the AP that sanctions against the court could affect a number of people who contribute to the court’s work, such as international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Clooney advised the current prosecutor on his request for the warrants for Netanyahu and others. 'Sanctions are a huge burden,' Sterio said. Also hanging heavy over the meeting in the Hague, are the internal pressures that Khan faces. In October, the AP reported the 54-year-old British lawyer is facing allegations he tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her. Two co-workers in whom the woman confided reported the alleged misconduct in May to the court’s independent watchdog, which says it interviewed the woman and ended its inquiry after five days when she opted against filing a formal complaint. Khan was never questioned. He has denied the claims. The Assembly of States Parties has announced it will launch an external probe into the allegations. It’s not clear if the investigation will be addressed during the meeting. The court, which has long faced accusations of ineffectiveness, will have no trials pending after two conclude in December. While it has issued a number of arrest warrants in recent months, many high-profile suspects remain at large. Member states don't always act. Mongolia refused to arrest Putin when he visited in September. Sudan’s former President Omar al-Bashir is wanted by the ICC over accusations related to the conflict in Darfur, but his country has refused to hand him over. Last week, Khan requested a warrant for the head of Myanmar’s military regime, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, for attacks against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority. Judges have yet to decide on that request. 'It becomes very difficult to justify the court’s existence,' Sterio said.	https://apnews.com/article/icc-israel-gaza-arrest-court-meeting-d2b42db2919a4be879bd3df771a4113f	2024-12-01T20:09:04-08:00	
Before exiting, Biden heads to Africa to highlight his own counter to China. Will Trump take it up?	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — President Joe Biden is finally making his long-promised visit to Africa this week, attempting to showcase a U.S.-backed railway project in three countries that he has pushed as a new approach in countering some of China's global influence. Biden's first visit to the continent as president — which he left to the very end — will highlight the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies. That's a key field for U.S.-China competition and China has a stranglehold on Africa's critical minerals. A new strategy The U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer), $2.5 billion railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China’s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy that has surged ahead. The Biden administration has called the corridor one of the president’s signature initiatives. Biden starts a three-day trip to Angola on Monday, yet Lobito’s future and any change in the way the United States engages with a continent of 1.4 billion leaning heavily toward China depends on the incoming administration of Donald Trump. 'President Biden is no longer the story,' said Mvemba Dizolele, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. 'Even African leaders are focused on Donald Trump.' A fit for Trump's vision? The U.S. has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to the Lobito Corridor alongside financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks. 'A lot is riding on this in terms of its success and its replicability,' said Tom Sheehy, a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan federal research institution. He called it one of the flagships for the G7's new Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which was driven by Biden and aims to reach other developing nations as a response to China's Belt and Road. Biden promised to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit for the first time in nearly a decade in December 2022. The trip was kicked back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still low priority. The last U.S. president to visit was Barack Obama in 2015. 'Africa never gets top attention,' said Witney Schniedman, an expert on African economic growth at the nonprofit Brookings Institution. But many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which isn't due for completion until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration and be given a chance. It goes some way to blunting China, which has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump's to-do list. 'As long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it's going to keep being funded,' said Christian-Géraud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations. Some success in Africa The Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola's Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito, a route west for Africa's critical minerals. It's little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, because China is dominant in the mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world's cobalt, most of which is heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe have to rely on. Lobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola's long and strong ties with Beijing. China financed a previous redevelopment of the railway. The Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola's civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year, while the U.S. has a stronger stake in regional security through a strategic presence on the Atlantic Ocean, and Angolan President João Lourenço's role mediating in a conflict in eastern Congo. In Angola, Biden will announce new developments on health, agribusiness, security cooperation as well as the Lobito Corridor, White House officials said on a preview call with reporters. The visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president to Angola, will 'highlight that remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angola relationship,' Frances Brown, a special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said on a separate call. It will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America's value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden's trip to criticize the Lourenço government's authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while security and other laws have been passed in Angola that severely restrict freedoms, throwing some scrutiny on Washington's new African partnership. Will the U.S. really show up? Those calling for more U.S. presence in Africa say Angola and the Lobito spinoff show what might be achieved, even with China-facing countries, if the U.S. is willing to consistently engage. But they see signs for Africa when China has held a summit with African leaders every three years since 2000, while the US has had just two summits, in 2014 and 2022, and there are no plans for the next one. Michelle Gavin, a former U.S. ambassador to Botswana and adviser on Africa to Obama, said that the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend. She doesn't see Biden's visit and Lobito being a major 'inflection point' that will drive a new U.S. focus across Africa. 'It is not just about trying to blunt China, but trying to imagine, OK, what does it look like if we actually were to show up in a more serious way?' she said. 'It’s one project. It’s one good idea. And I’m very glad we’re doing it. It’s not enough.' ___ AP writers Will Weissert in Washington and Fatima Hussein in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-africa-angola-trump-china-cd30e0123d91bf520846b28ffeacef80	2024-12-01T20:05:09-08:00
