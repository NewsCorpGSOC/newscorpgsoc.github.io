However, history shows that in societies which supported former warriors, they often became powerful leaders, reformers or artisans.

In the 19th century, Japanese samurai, after losing their warrior status, played a key role in economic and administrative reforms, applying discipline and strategic thinking to business and government. In Ukraine, Cossacks returning military campaigns not only received land and privileges, but also actively influenced local self-governance by holding leadership positions, developing crafts and engaging in trade.	https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/press-release/1049828.html	2025-02-21T05:08:16-08:00
