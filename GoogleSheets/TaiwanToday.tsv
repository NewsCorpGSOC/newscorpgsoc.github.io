Taiwan collaborates with US to advance circular electronic products	The Ministry of Environment's Resource Circulation Administration staged an International E-Waste Management Network annual exchange event Oct. 2-4 in Taipei City, to enhance efficient use of natural resources. The three-day gathering brought together over 70 participants from Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Tuvalu, Vietnam, the Philippines, and the U.S., to share experiences and techniques on issues related to circular production of electronic appliances and devices. Other highlights were DIY maintenance and visits to corporations, the MOENV said. Speaking in the opening ceremony online, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said that recycling plays a vital role in &ldquo;Taiwan's Pathway to Net-Zero Emissions in 2050.&rdquo; Since the inception of the Environmental Protection Agency recycling has been promoted and the newly established MOENV aims to facilitate the circular economy, together the initiatives have resulted in a 58 percent recycling rate. Peng said that strategies for recycling electrical and electronic appliances are key to net zero transition in 2050 and RECA is committed to launching environmental protection policies to strengthen recycling and regeneration. For example, it advocates appliance rental and usage of post-consumer recycled plastics, while raising public awareness of the issues. IEMN, set up after Taiwan and the U.S. signed an environmental technical agreement in 2011, is committed to effective management of global electronic waste and assisting other countries to develop recycling systems and technologies.

CIP minister congratulates Palau president on 30th anniversary of independence	Council of Indigenous Peoples Minister Ljaucu Zingrur, acting as President Lai Ching-te's special envoy, delivered a letter of congratulation to President Surangel Whipps Jr. of Palau Sept. 29 in the run-up to celebrations of the Pacific ally's 30th independence day. Ljaucu thanked Whipps for supporting Taiwan's participation in international arenas. The minister said that Taiwan's Indigenous people share deep cultural connections with the people of Palau, adding that he looks forward to further strengthening tribal exchanges and reinforcing bilateral ties on the foundation of the two sides' 25th anniversary of official ties. In response, Whipps said that one of the U.N. mandates is that every voice counts, and the people of Taiwan must not be excluded. He pledged to seek more cooperation opportunities for the two countries. According to the council, it worked with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to hold a banquet.

Taiwan sets strictest air pollution regulations in Asia	The Ministry of Environment announced amendments to Taiwan's Air Quality Standards Sept. 30 to bring the country's regulations more in line with global practices and offer better health protections to the public. According to the MOENV, the new regulations lower the maximum hourly, daily and yearly levels of pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide. In particular, the daily average threshold of PM 2.5 has been cut from 35 micrograms per cubic meter to 30 mcg/m3 and the yearly average threshold has dropped from 15 mcg/m3 to 12 mcg/m3, making them the strictest limits in Asia, the ministry said. The changes also update rules for air quality readings to provide a more accurate reflection of conditions starting Jan. 1, 2025. The ministry highlighted that according to data from 2021 to 2023, Taiwan is expected to experience good air quality 40 percent of the time under the new standards, while the chance of moderate and unhealthy days for sensitive groups may increase. The MOENV said the amendments follow guidelines set by the World Health Organization and a study published in July by Miaoli County-based National Health Research Institutes that shows a high correlation between PM 2.5 concentration and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The move is also part of the new administration's response to public calls for more effective air quality controls, it added. Achieving targets will require collective efforts by all parties involved, especially those responsible for producing pollutants, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said, adding that the ministry will roll out follow-up projects to tackle airborne particulates. Peng said the government's net-zero carbon emission policy will help improve air quality in Taiwan, as reduction of carbon and air pollution goes hand in hand. He added that the ministry hopes to lower the PM 2.5 standard further to 10 or 5 mcg/m3 in the future.

Foreign Minister Lin calls for global unity to fight authoritarianism	Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung called on like-minded partners to unite against authoritarianism and support Taiwan's participation in global organizations. Lin made the remarks during a sit-down with 11 journalists from 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Europe and North America last month in Taipei City. The minister brought them up to speed on issues ranging from new norms in cross-strait relations and growing authoritarian threats in the region to Taiwan's global participation and the new administration's integrated diplomacy approach. According to the minister, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, an emerging alliance known as CRINK, are expanding collaboration and posing a threat to Taiwan and fellow democracies around the world. Given the interconnectedness of national economies, Taiwan's values-based diplomacy can strengthen mutual support among like-minded partners, he added. Lin asserted that China's attempts to invade, blockade or isolate Taiwan will impact global navigation and that Beijing's ambition extends beyond the first island chain. Facing such challenges, Taiwan is leaving no stone unturned in strengthening its defense capabilities, as evidenced by the defense budget's expansion to 2.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product, the minister said, adding that this figure is higher than that of most NATO member states and is expected to increase to 3.5 percent in the future. With regard to global participation, Lin linked Taiwan's continued U.N. exclusion to China's willful misinterpretation of U.N. Resolution 2758, which he said does not mention Taiwan or its international status. He urged the global body to look squarely at Taiwan's bid, adding that the country can contribute not only its semiconductor prowess, but also its understanding of China's behavior. The minister's remarks have since been published in global news outlets such as World View Television, The New York Sun and Real America's Voice from the U.S.; National Newswatch from Canada; The Australian from Australia; The Jerusalem Post from Isreal; Lusa from Portugal; Die Presse from Austria; and Rzeczpospolita from Poland.

Academics and experts from cultural agencies around Taiwan were invited to share their experience and expertise, the MOC said, adding that the event mainly focused on how to meet the audience's needs through the deployment of software and hardware elements.

He expressed hope that the exchanges at the symposium would facilitate equal access to art among different demographics. As the Ministry of Culture's demonstration museum since 2013 for offering services to guests with visual and hearing impairments, as well as those with other special needs, the MOC said the NTMOFA actively promotes cultural equality and inclusion. The museum has implemented a mode that provides people with equal cultural participation, not just by serving the underprivileged, but also by enhancing mutual understanding between diverse groups, the ministry added.

MODA minister deepens AI governance links with international partners	Minister of Digital Affairs Huang Yen-nun led a delegation to a ministerial meeting on human rights-based governance organized by the Freedom Online Coalition to emphasize the government's commitment to strengthening digital collaboration with the U.S. and other like-minded partners. The conference, entitled &ldquo;AI for Humanity,&rdquo; was held Sept. 23 in New York City and, according to the Ministry of Digital Affairs, brought together officials and experts from many countries, including France and Germany. Among those who made remarks were U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp of the Netherlands, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna, and Mauricio Lizcano, Columbia's minister of information and communications technology.

MOFA thanks US for supportive statement, condemns China for suppressing Taiwan at UNGA79	The Sept. 27 remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken supporting cross-strait peace and stability is sincerely appreciated by the government and people of Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Sept. 28. According to a Sept. 27 press release by the U.S. State Department, Blinken made the remarks during his meeting with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi earlier the same day on the margins of the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York City. Blinken emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as raised concerns about China's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea, its support for Russia's defense industry base and war of aggression against Ukraine. The ministry welcomed the state secretary's unwavering support, and condemned China's persistent threats to the cross-strait status quo while the global community continues to voice concern for regional security and stability. In particular, the MOFA sternly condemned Wang's speech Sept. 28 at the general debate that the U.N. resolution 2758 has resolved once and for all the question of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan. The ministry said that the ROC (Taiwan) and China do not belong to each other, which is the current cross-strait status quo and a globally recognized fact. The said resolution does not mention Taiwan, nor does it confirm that Taiwan is part of China or authorize China to represent Taiwan at the U.N., the MOFA said, emphasizing that only the government elected by its people can represent Taiwan at the U.N. or other global venues. The MOFA called on China to stop misleading the world and urged the international community to heed Beijing's malicious attempts to use the resolution to pave way for its military aggression against Taiwan. As President Lai Ching-te said during his video speech at the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit, a stronger Taiwan is better able to promote democracy, peace and prosperity around the world. The government hopes that Taiwan and other democratic nations can jointly support the democratic umbrella and counter authoritarian aggression, Lai added. As a responsible global member, Taiwan will continue to strengthen its self-defense capabilities and work with the U.S. and other like-minded partners to defend the rules-based international order and ensure peace, stability and prosperity in the strait and the Indo-Pacific, the ministry said.

National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee holds inaugural meeting	President Lai Ching-te presided over the inaugural meeting of the National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee Sept. 26 in Taipei City, underscoring the government's commitment to enhancing civilian emergency preparedness. Delivering the opening remarks, Lai said climate change, large-scale natural disasters and authoritarian expansion pose challenges for both the country and the international community, adding that a more resilient Taiwan would make greater contributions to global democracy, peace and prosperity. The president highlighted three areas of focus to strengthen the country's response capabilities and expand government-civilian cooperation. The first is to prepare for worst-case scenarios. Comprehensive and proactive measures are essential for ensuring rapid reaction time and normal societal function in times of emergency, Lai said. Second, ordinary citizens should receive response and mobilization training to increase stockpiles of critical supplies and safeguard the operation of vital infrastructure, including the electric grid; finance, information security and transportation networks; and medical and evacuation facilities, the president added. Finally, the central and local governments must reinforce collaboration with civil organizations to identify problem areas and develop strategies to address them, Lai said. In selecting committee members, the government has taken background, experience, specialty, age and gender into careful consideration, the president said, adding that a diverse body will be better able to tackle the complexity of the task. Lai concluded by conveying confidence that robust determination and preparedness will deepen Taiwan's cooperation with like-minded partners in facing domestic and international concerns. The National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee is one of three advisory groups announced by the president in June. The other two are the National Climate Change Committee and the Healthy Taiwan Promotion Committee.

MOENV promotes plastic reduction at Taipei baseball game	Deputy Minister Shen Chih-hsiu took part in a baseball game Sept. 26 in Taipei City to promote the government's plastic reduction campaign, the Ministry of Environment said. According to the MOENV, Shen threw the first pitch to start the Chinese Professional Baseball League game between the Wei Chuan Dragons and Uni-President Lions. Taiwan swimmer and Olympian Wang Kuan-hung, who is the ministry's recycling ambassador, was also present at the ceremony. Shen said the fifth session of the U.N. Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee will take place in late November this year in Busan, South Korea to address plastic pollution, showing that plastic reduction has attained global consensus. As a responsible international community member, Taiwan needs to be part of the worldwide trend. To this end, the MOENV launched a program in July 2022 to offer a NT$5 discount to consumers who bring their own cups to purchase beverages at retail outlets and also implemented a ban earlier this month on single-use plastic cups at beverage shops nationwide. Shen said the initiatives are expected to cut the use of 790 million disposable cups a year. Shen said other similar projects are in the pipeline, including encouraging the public to bring reusable bags or totes for grocery shopping, and a ban on disposable toiletries and bottled water at hotels starting Jan. 1, 2025. These measures will lead to the use of 65 million fewer plastic bags and the reduction of 2,000 tons of plastics. The deputy minister urged participants to be responsible consumers by bringing their own bottles or borrowing reusable cups when attending baseball games and other events. The game also offered environmentally conscious fans free drinks and beverage discounts.

MODA stages forum on submarine cable, internet data center development	Bolstering development of the submarine communication cable and internet data center sectors was the theme of a forum held by the Ministry of Digital Affairs Sept. 26 in Taipei City to promote Taiwan's digital resilience. Jointly organized with the state-sponsored Telecom Technology Center based in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, the one-day event focused on development strategies for the two sectors in Taiwan, the analysis of potential risks faced by local supply chain players and the sharing of security assessments and related guidance. The event involved local experts and officials, as well as their counterparts from Australia and Japan. Those in attendance included Chiueh Her-ming, deputy minister at MODA; Chiu Wei-chen, deputy executive secretary of the Office of Science and Technology Policy under the National Science and Technology Council; and Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association Deputy Representative Takashi Hattori. Participants discussed the risks associated with development in the two sectors from legal and geopolitical perspectives, analyzed standard procedures to ensure the security of Taiwan's submarine cables and data cloud centers; and reviewed measures to respond to and manage incidents at such facilities. According to the MODA, over 95 percent of international communication is conducted through 436 submarine cables around the world. As an island, Taiwan especially relies on such cables to communicate with its offshore counties and townships, as well as its global partners, the ministry added. The MODA said the country's geographic location and technological prowess set it in good stead as a potential global submarine cable hub, adding that high-tech powerhouses Google LLC and Microsoft Corp. have set up data centers in the country. Given the threats of natural disasters and geopolitical concerns, however, local firms also need to ensure effective emergency preparedness, the ministry said. The forum served as a platform to exchange views on global trends and share experiences to address related challenges, in order to strengthen the security and reliability of local infrastructure, and boost investors' confidence in Taiwan, the MODA said.

President Lai addresses Concordia Annual Summit	President Lai Ching-te spoke to attendees of the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit via a recorded video message, pledging to build a stronger Taiwan while expressing his hope that democracies will jointly counter authoritarian aggression. Democracy around the world faces threats such as authoritarian expansion, Lai said, citing Russia's invasion of Ukraine and adding China's intensifying military intimidation in the Taiwan Strait and the East and South China Seas as examples. He specifically noted China's use of gray zone tactics, in addition to lawfare and the misrepresentation of history, to expand its power. Democratic Taiwan and authoritarian China are not subordinate to each other, Lai stressed during his explanation of Beijing's distortion of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758. The president also thanked the U.S. and the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China for opposing Beijing's misinterpretations and welcomed more countries to join in support of democracy worldwide. He went on to say that Taiwan's four pillars of peace are a plan to maintain the cross-strait peace and stability, adding that the country is committed to strengthening national defense, building economic security, deepening partnerships with democratic countries, and ensuring stable and principled cross-strait leadership. Alexander Tah-ray Yui, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., also attended the event, holding a dialogue with Keith Krach, former U.S. undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment. Their discussion focused on Taiwan's democratic resolve and ways to shape global security and peace through strategic cooperation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait is key to global economic growth and prosperity, Yui said. Taiwan is an indispensable partner in sustainable supply chains as it provides over 90 percent of global advanced semiconductor products, he added, calling on the international community to squarely face the country's improper exclusion from the U.N.'s specialized agencies and global organizations, and to incorporate its expertise and contributions into the process of sustainable international development. According to the Presidential Office, the summit was organized by New York-based nonprofit organization Concordia on the sidelines of the ongoing 79th U.N. General Assembly.

MOFA thanks Biden and like-minded partners for support	The U.S. President, the Republic of Korea and G7 foreign ministers' expressions of support for cross-strait peace is sincerely appreciated by the government and people of Taiwan, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. U.S. President Biden delivered a speech Sept. 24 at the 79th edition of the United Nations General Assembly, where he reiterated a firm stance on maintaining Taiwan Strait stability while voicing opposition to unfair economic competition and military coercion in the South China Sea. He added that the U.S. would continue to strengthen its network of Indo-Pacific alliances and partnerships. On the same day, G7 foreign ministers also met during UNGA79's high-level week, where they reaffirmed that maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait is vital to ensure international security and prosperity. They also supported Taiwan to gain meaningful participation in global institutions either as a member, an observer or guest, the MOFA said. Prior to the G7 ministerial meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Japan Foreign Minister Kamikawa Yoko and ROK Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul held a trilateral meeting Sept. 23. The three reiterated the significance of cross-strait stability and called for peaceful resolution of issues while conveying strong opposition to any unilateral change of the status quo in the Indo-Pacific.

Minister of Culture Li Yuan noted during the forum that promoting cultural heritage is one of 12 items included in a program launched by the ministry earlier this year. The forum provides an opportunity to share international perspectives, he said, pledging to bring the country's policies more in line with global trends while continuing to advance revitalization and sustainable stewardship of Taiwan's cultural assets.

President Lai vows to strengthen civil defense in Taiwan	President Lai Ching-te said Sept. 24 that Taiwan is committed to enhancing civil defense capabilities so that its people have the knowledge and skills needed to protect themselves and their beloved country. Lai made the remarks while participating in a civil defense training organized by Academia Formosana in the central county of Nantou. Authorities and organizations at all levels are working to advance civil defense and natural disaster response, as evidenced by drills held on the National Disaster Prevention Day Sept. 21, Lai said. He further praised the AF-formulated plans to reduce potential casualties and property damage during disasters and conflict. Lai went on to reiterate his missions as president, noting that safeguarding the country's sovereignty is a top priority. He added that the ROC (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other, and that the future of Taiwan can only be decided by its 23 million people. Ensuring the safety of the country's people is equally important, Lai said, citing the country's enhanced national defense capabilities since former President Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016. His third mission is to boost the country's economy, Lai said. The president noted that the bulk of Taiwan's overseas investment is flowing to Japan, the U.S., New Southbound Policy target countries and those across Europe, adding that the country's investment in China accounted for only 11.4 percent of its total foreign investment last year, decreasing from 83.8 percent in 2010. According to Lai, the newly established Presidential Office Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee will convene a meeting every three months to further the country's responses to natural disasters.

Taiwan reiterates bid for U.N. participation at GCTF workshop	Taiwan partnered up with Australia, Canada, Japan and the U.S. to hold a seminar on leveraging technology to achieve sustainable development Sept. 19 in New York City, underscoring the country's indispensable role in realizing the United Nations' sustainable development goals, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Organized under the Global Cooperation and Training Framework, the event attracted governmental officials and experts from over 10 countries and was presided over by Yanis Ben Amor, executive director of Columbia University's Center for Sustainable Development. Prominent attendees included Tom Chih-Chiang Lee, director-general of Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York; Charles C. Li, secretary general of the Taipei-based International Cooperation and Development Fund (TaiwanICDF); Chris P.

Speaking at the seminar, Lee said that the U.N.'s launch of the Summit of the Future, which aims to facilitate international collaboration in utilizing technology to advance the well-being of future generations, highlights the significance of Taiwan's inclusion in global bodies given that the country produces over 90 percent of the world's advanced chips. Despite the U.N.'s commitment to leave no one behind, it continues to shut out Taiwan's 23.5 million people, he added. According to the MOFA, there is a growing international consensus recognizing the importance of Taiwan in ensuring global welfare. This is evidenced by the joint statement released by Australia, India, Japan and the U.S. after their 4th Quadrilateral Security Dialogue that took place Sept. 21 in the U.S. state of Delaware, which stressed that maintaining cross-strait peace is vital to global prosperity. Similar sentiments were expressed in joint statements released Sept. 20 by Australia and the U.S. and Sept. 21 by Japan and the U.S. following leaders' meetings. Both declarations reiterated their commitment to safeguarding Taiwan Strait stability while conveying concern over China's aggressions in the South China Sea, the MOFA added.

Taiwan stages APEC chemical hazard training program	The Training Program on Capacity Building for Chemical Emergency Preparedness under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation opened Sept. 23 in Kaohsiung City, to ensure a swift response to chemical incidents, reduce environmental impact and enhance human safety. Organized by the Ministry of Environment, the six-day event involves 25 representatives from eight APEC member economies including Malaysia, Peru, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, as well as non-member countries such as France and Poland. During his opening remarks, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said accelerating economic and trade development has led to an increase in the production and transportation of chemical substances. Thus, there is also an increase in the number of cross-border accidents involving those substances and a concomitant impact on economic stability, environmental sustainability and human safety, he added. Peng said scenario training helps APEC member economies enhance capabilities in key issues such as hazard identification, on-site detection and incident response. The government is looking forward to sharing experience and expertise in managing hazardous chemical substances with its partner countries and helping to create an effective response mechanism in the region, the minister added. According to the MOENV Chemicals Administration, the training program was proposed by Taiwan this year during the APEC Chemical Dialogue.

MOI Deputy Minister lauds national efforts to tackle starfish overpopulation	Deputy Minister of the Interior Tung Chien-hung praised public and private efforts to tackle the overpopulation of the crown-of-thorns starfish, underscoring Taiwan's commitment to marine conservation, the Ministry of the Interior said Sept. 19. Tung expressed his recognition while visiting Dongsha Atoll National Park, Taiwan's first marine national park and the largest protected marine area in the country. According to the MOI, after detecting the issue earlier this year, the ministry's National Park Service invited experts from the Cabinet-level Ocean Affairs Council, Academia Sinica and other organizations to form a volunteer task force to monitor and control the species in waters surrounding the Dongsha Islands and other risk areas. The first group deployed Aug. 23 and returned Aug. 29, the ministry said, adding that a total of 11,044 crown-of-thorns starfish have been removed as of Sept. 13. Tung thanked the volunteers for their hard work, which is essential in reducing the impact on coral, the starfish's food source. The seagrass bed around the Dongsha Islands is a natural carbon sink and forms a critical part of a blue carbon ecosystem that provides a habitat to sea creatures like the sicklefin lemon shark, he said, urging the NPS' Marine National Park Headquarters to continue striving to protect Taiwan's rich sea assets. The deputy minister took the opportunity to compliment the DANP's efforts to desalinate seawater using newly designed wells to prevent seaweed debris from damaging water pumping equipment. The park has also collaborated with the local government to establish a sustainable water circulation system in which wastewater is injected into groundwater after treatment, providing a friendly environment for migratory birds and contributing to biodiversity, he added. Tung further expressed appreciation to the OAC's Coast Guard Administration for protecting the national park amid ship groundings and oil spills, as well as driving away unauthorized foreign vessels. The renovation of Dongguang Hospital has also enhanced the national park's long-term management by improving the quality of medical care on the islands, he added.

Taiwan, EU partners join forces to promote sustainable ocean governance	The Ministries of Environment and Foreign Affairs teamed up with the European Economic and Trade Office and EU member states' offices in Taiwan to hold the annual beach cleanup Sept. 21 in New Taipei City in observance of International Coastal Cleanup Day and World Cleanup Day. According to the MOENV, the event involved around 170 participants, including MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming, Deputy Foreign Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu, EETO Head Lutz G&uuml;llner and other officials from EU partner countries stationed in Taiwan. They collected a total of 464 kilograms of waste at the Bali Beiti Beach. Peng said Taiwan and the EU are solid economic and trade partners with many shared values.

The initiative aims to cultivate 450,000 professionals in the artificial intelligence, semiconductor, and net-zero and green sectors by 2028, as well as recruit 120,000 professionals and 80,000 technicians from abroad. According to the premier, talented individuals form the backbone of a country and are key to economic and industrial development. Given the challenges stemming from AI and digital transformation, he said the government needs to step up investment in talent cultivation to create an innovation-driven economic model, so that Taiwan can continue to play a key role in promoting global prosperity. The NDC initiative aims to achieve its policy goals through six strategies: cultivating talent in key industries; fostering digital skills with a solid foundation in humanities and social sciences; promoting reciprocal exchanges of international students; recruiting foreign professionals in key industries; building a complete talent retention ecosystem; and improving the retention of intermediate-level skilled foreign workers.

NDC builds Bridge program with outreach in Japan	Minister Liu Chin-ching of the National Development Council tours Japan to promote a bridge program to help startups from Taiwan reach out to the world and create a global ecosystem for innovation. The Executive Yuan's National Development Fund and the Kyoto University Innovation Capital Co., Ltd. set the initiative in motion with a memorandum of understanding Sept. 13 in Kyoto. Witnessed by Liu and Kyoto University President Nagahiro Minato, the pact will boost mutual investment to cultivate a larger talent pool in deep tech, a field that encompasses quantum technology, robotics and semiconductors, among others. Following the event, the NDC and Tokyo Metropolitan Government cooperated to hold a Taiwan-Japan startup summit Sept. 17 at Tokyo Innovation Base. Liu led a delegation of representatives from nearly 50 startups in Taiwan to participate in the event, while Governor Yuriko Koike of Tokyo attended the summit virtually. During his opening remarks, Liu introduced the council&#39;s Bridge program and said Taiwan will expand investment in domestic startups through funds focusing on fields spanning artificial intelligence, biomedicine, cultural creativity and green technology. He also announced the establishment of a startup hub in Tokyo to expand bilateral exchanges and create more business opportunities. According to the NDC, the summit focused on industrial innovations including the semiconductor supply chain. It helped startups from Taiwan meet potential investors in Japan in areas spanning AI, cybersecurity, financial technology, and national defense and aerospace, the council said, adding that financial institutions, venture capital firms and several local governments around Japan sent representatives to attend the event. Later the same day Liu joined a joint news conference held by the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo, elaborating on the council's plan to increase cooperation with Japan on technology innovations and the startup ecosystem.

MOENV delegation on carbon trading visits EU	Minister of Environment Peng Chi-ming, accompanied by Taiwan Representative to the European Union and Belgium, Roy Chun Lee, led a delegation from the Climate Change Administration to the EU to conduct exchange on air quality governance, carbon emission trading, chemical substance management, circular economy, climate change and the Global Plastic Treaty, sharing Taiwan's specific practices to implement carbon reduction. Peng briefed high level EU officials on Taiwan's current progress, including trial implementation of carbon fees starting in August this year and full enactment in 2025. It also plans to launch full cap control and emissions trading within four years. The Emission Trading System (ETS) established by the EU in 2005 is the most mature in the world with many stakeholders and plays a role in diplomacy, and thus can serve as a useful reference for Taiwan. Exchanges with high-level officials covered emission monitoring plans, inventory, inspection, total volume settings, emission quota allocations and auction, trading market structure and emission quota payments. The MOENV plans a further delegation to Europe in 2025, drawn from academia, environmental organizations and industries to gain insight into carbon pricing to complete Taiwan's regulations and facilitate follow-up legal implementation. The EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) is a tariff that targets carbon leakage in offshore production of imported goods to the bloc's 27 member nations. It is currently in its transitional phase (2023-2026) with only selected industries including cement, iron, steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity and hydrogen subject to the tariff. After 2026 all imported goods will be subject to the tariff and Taiwan's metal fastener, steel and aluminum industries are mainly affected. In the transition period domestic industry has completed declarations with government guidance. After the EU CBAM is fully implemented, domestic carbon pricing will need to integrate with the EU and the MOENV stated that this visit determined through face-to-face discussion that Taiwan carbon fees can be deducted from EU CBAM certificates and detailed regulations for the deduction will be announced in mid-2025. Due to the complexity of CBAM regulations, the MOENV will assign full-time personnel to the EU early next year to keep abreast of the latest developments and participate in negotiations to assist response by domestic industries. Peng said the visit had established a robust communication channel that has given Taiwan more confidence and better understanding in the development of carbon pricing and the carbon fee first system, especially as domestic enterprises are very concerned about CBAM. The EU has also gained a clearer view of Taiwan&#39;s ambitions in climate change efforts as an important global technology supply chain.

Foreign Minister Lin receives German Bundestag delegation	Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung received Michael M&uuml;ller and Andreas Larem, both members of the German Bundestag, Sept. 16 in Taipei City, pledging to continue working with Taiwan's democratic partners to counteract authoritarianism. Both parliamentarians are members of the Social Democratic Party and serve on the Bundestag Committee on Foreign Affairs. This is their first visit to Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. According to Lin, as authoritarian regimes including China continue to challenge rules-based international order, democracies around the world need to stand in unity to strengthen their economic and social resilience. Taiwan is willing to share with European partners its experiences in combating China's hybrid tactics, misinformation campaigns and economic coercion, he said. The minister commended the recent crossing of the Taiwan Strait by German naval vessels to defend freedom of navigation and welcomed the de-risk policy of the EU and the EU member state. He also praised the recent investment by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. in Dresden as a milestone in the two-way relations, anticipating the two sides will continue expanding their trade and economic partnership. In response, M&uuml;ller and Larem both stressed the importance of unity among democracies against authoritarian expansion. It is important for members of the free world to enhance cooperation in their economies, technology and culture to build resilience, they added. Later the same day, the two parliamentarians attended a lunch hosted by Deputy Foreign Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu. The deputy minister cautioned that China's aggression is not only a cross-strait issue but a severe challenge to rules-based international order. He said Taiwan looks forward to collaborating further with its European partners to ensure peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.

MOFA thanks US for latest arms sale	The U.S. government's approval of an arms sale with a total value of US$228 million is sincerely welcomed by the government and people of Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Sept. 17. Initiated at the behest of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., the deal includes the return, repair and reshipment of spare aircraft parts and related equipment, the ministry said. The move demonstrates the U.S. government's strong support for Taiwan's self-defense capabilities and underscores the importance Washington attaches to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, it added. According to the MOFA, this is the 16th arms sale announced by U.S. President Joe Biden's administration and reflects a policy of normalizing such deals with Taiwan. The decision also shows Washington's long-standing rock-solid commitment to Taiwan's security under the Taiwan Relations Act and Six Assurances. Amid China's frequent use of gray zone tactics to harass and coerce countries in the region, Taiwan is fully committed to enhancing its self-defense and asymmetric combat capabilities in order to safeguard its freedom and democratic way of life. The government will continue working with the U.S. to deepen security partnership, protect the rules-based international order, and promote peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, the MOFA added. The Presidential Office and Ministry of National Defense also issued statements welcoming the development, with the PO thanking Washington for its continuous support and expansion of Taiwan-U.S. partnership and the MND anticipating that the deal will ensure an ample supply of maintenance components for the air force.

MOFA thanks Lithuania, Netherlands, US and UK for supporting Taiwan	Recent actions and statements backing Taiwan by Lithuania, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the U.S. are sincerely appreciated by the government and people, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Dutch House of Representatives passed a resolution Sept. 12 recognizing that U.N. Resolution 2758 neither grants the People's Republic of China sovereignty over Taiwan nor negates Taiwan's right to participate in the U.N. and other international organizations, the MOFA said, adding that the move is particularly significant in light of the ongoing 79th session of the U.N. General Assembly. The Netherlands has become the first European country and second in the world to pass similar decrees following the Australian Senate's Aug. 22 passage of a motion supporting Taiwan's sovereignty and participation in global bodies, the ministry said. The resolution was preceded by the Dutch House's passage of a motion promoting Taiwan's international involvement in April and another in May urging its government to join the European Union and other like-minded partners in voicing disapproval of China's military exercises around Taiwan, the MOFA added. Equally welcomed is the joint statement released Sept. 14 following the first U.K.-U.S. Strategic Dialogue that took place Sept. 10 in London, the ministry said. The two sides reiterated the indispensability of Taiwan Strait stability to the security and prosperity of the international community and called for the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues. The MOFA also expressed appreciation for a joint statement issued after the Lithuania-U.S. Strategic Dialogue Sept. 12 in Vilnius, in which the two countries encouraged the establishment of a robust economic partnership between Taiwan and Lithuania and backed Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. Taiwan will continue to work with like-minded countries to defend the rules-based international order and preserve democracy, peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.

MOL hosts APEC workshop	The Ministry of Labor staged an APEC Workshop on Advancing Occupational Safety and Health for the Workforce in Green Energy Sectors Sept. 3 in Taipei City to explore measures in response to potential risks inherent in green energy industries. Academics and experts from Korea, Malaysia, Peru, Thailand and the U.S., representatives of global labor and employment organizations, as well as domestic specialists participated in the forum, according to the MOL. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Deputy Minister of Labor Wang An-pang pointed out that along with awareness of sustainability, APEC member economies have actively advanced net zero emissions and low carbon transition. Although green energy industries facilitate a sustainable environment, there are some risks inherent in such workplaces that may adversely affect employees' health. Accordingly, the International Labor Organization has incorporated safeguarding regulations for both work environments and staff in the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The first topic in the seminar focused on the issue of just transition and potential risks faced by employees in green energy industries. Glacer Ni&ntilde;o A. Vasquez, APEC Policy Support Unit researcher, Jennifer Sheehy, U.S. Department of Labor Office&#39;s Disability Employment Policy deputy assistant secretary and Annick Starren, European Agency for Safety and Health at Work senior project manager, shared their views. Officials and researchers from Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Peru and Thailand talked about best practice case studies in the second half of the seminar, the MOL added.

Deputy Foreign Minister Tien outlines Taiwan’s UN79 campaign	Ahead of the opening of the United Nations&#39; 79th General Assembly Sept. 10 in New York City, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Chung-kwang held a press event Sept. 3 in Taipei City to detail Taiwan's annual U.N. campaign. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the theme of the U.N.G.A. general debate, set to kick off Sept. 24, is &ldquo;Leaving No One Behind: Acting Together for the Advancement of Peace, Sustainable Development and Human Dignity for Present and Future Generations.&rdquo; Ironically, Taiwan's 23.5 million people are still excluded from the global organization, it said. The deputy minister said China's distortion of U.N.G.A. Resolution 2758 continues to pose serious threats to the Taiwan Strait status quo and peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Tien urged the U.N. to take proactive action to address the issue. Since the resolution does not exclude Taiwan's U.N. participation, Tien called on the global organization to seek proper arrangements for Taiwan to take part in its activities, meetings and mechanisms, so that Taiwan can contribute to fulfilling U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. Tien also said the U.N. Secretariat should adopt a neutral position and stop misusing the resolution to deprive the rights of Taiwan people and media to visit the U.N., take part in or cover its activities and meetings. To canvass more global support for Taiwan, Tien said the government will continue to appeal to its allies' permanent U.N. representatives to send joint letters to U.N. Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres and speak for Taiwan at related U.N. events. Equally importantly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung penned an article that has been published in various international mainstream media, highlighting how Taiwan's U.N. inclusion could secure peace in the Indo-Pacific. A short film entitled &ldquo;IC You&rdquo; was launched the same day to showcase Taiwan's technology and semiconductor manufacturing prowess, emphasizing the country's key role in global development. A number of sideline events will also be staged during the 79th assembly elucidating the case for Taiwan's U.N. participation, the ministry said.

Taiwan, Arizona ink MOU on industrial cooperation	Taiwan concluded a memorandum of understanding on industrial cooperation with the U.S. state of Arizona Sept. 2 in Taipei City, spotlighting their joint commitment to further cementing the bilateral partnership, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said. The accord was signed by Jeff Lin, CEO of the ministry's Taiwan-USA Industrial Cooperation Promotion Office, and Steve Hsu, representative of the Arizona-Taiwan Trade and Investment Office. The event was witnessed by Chen Pei-li, deputy director general of the MOEA's Industrial Development Administration, and Sandra Watson, president and CEO of Arizona Commerce Authority. Under the pact, the two sides will deepen unmanned aerial vehicle and semiconductor collaboration while boosting high-tech personnel exchanges. According to Chen, Taiwan and the U.S. should work together to build a supply chain free from China's influence for the sake of both sides' national security, as Beijing accounts for 60-70 percent of the global commercial drone market. The government provides subsidies for developing critical UAV components, including parts used in communications, flight control and artificial intelligence image recognition, she said, adding that the country also established the Asia UAV AI Innovation Application R&amp;D Center in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County to integrate resources from over 30 manufacturers. Equally important is strengthening the two sides' semiconductor equipment cooperation, which will lay the foundation for chip production, Chen said. She added that Taiwan has a proven track record in cultivating semiconductor personnel and that more exchanges and training are expected to further expand the joint talent pool. In response, Watson said her delegation includes representatives from prestigious schools such as Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University, adding that they will meet with counterparts from Industrial Technology Research Institute and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University during their visit. Lin additionally extolled the two sides' growing ties, as evidenced by the establishment of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s Arizona operations, and noted that ITRI's North America branch and the Chiayi UAV center inked an MOU on resource sharing in April. Hsu said Taiwan and Arizona share similar economic goals and industrial strengths, adding that the latest MOU demonstrates their solid alliance and common visions.
