Premier Cho attends APG money laundering seminar	Premier Cho Jung-tai said that Taiwan is committed to collaboration with other nations to effectively combat crime and uphold global security and stability. Cho made the statement while attending the opening ceremony of the 2024 Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering assessor training workshop Oct. 21 in Taipei City. Taiwan joined the APGML as a founding member in 1997 and this was the first time that the country has held the five-day event, the premier said. During the seminar, experts from Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Taiwan shared knowledge and experience on prevention of money laundering, financing terrorism and dealing with large-scale destructive weapons. Cho also extended a sincere welcome to David Shannon, APG's acting executive secretary and participants from 17 countries. The government has placed strong emphasis on preventing money laundering and financing terrorism to safeguard society, shown by the fact that Taiwan ranked as having regular follow-up of such crime in APGML mutual evaluation in 2019. The premier said that to promote stricter governance and more effective law enforcement, new strategies would be adopted. These include legal adaptation, including the implementation of a Money Laundering Control Act and a Fraud Crime Prevention Act, to more efficiently prosecute such crime. A second strategy is control of criminal behavior through use of digital tools by agencies such as Coast Guard Administration, police stations, prosecutors' offices and other bodies. Educating the public on identification of disinformation as well as proactive measures by financial institutions to prevent scams is also vital. Global cooperation is also an effective tactic, as evidenced by recent seizure of transnational fraud call centers through joint investigations by Taiwan and the U.S. Prevention of money laundering is a common international goal shared by Taiwan and Cho concluded by expressing hope that the APGML would hold further events in Taiwan.

President Lai receives RSF director general	President Lai Ching-te said Oct. 16 that Taiwan is committed to working with democratic partners and organizations including Reporters Without Borders to safeguard press freedom and sustainable democracy in the world. Lai made the remarks while meeting with Thibaut Bruttin, director general of the France-based nongovernmental organization at the Presidential Office in Taipei City. The president first thanked the organization, known as RSF, for establishing its East Asia representative office in Taipei in 2017. Taiwan is ranked highly in Asia in several freedom and democracy ratings, he said, citing the country's top position in Asia in the RSF's latest World Press Freedom Index. According to Lai, the number of international media organizations stationed in Taiwan has been increasing each year. He added that the country is an ideal center for global media outlets to gain a foothold in the Asia-Pacific as it is a hub of press freedom in the region. The president went on to say that government and civil society alike are committed to defending democracy, citing as evidence the government's dedication to establishing a solid cybersecurity mechanism and the efforts of the country's NGOs to draft measures to counter disinformation. The Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee was further set up by the PO to strengthen national resilience to deal with such challenges. Lai concluded by stressing that just as the world needs Taiwan, Taiwan needs the world in the ongoing fight to counter disinformation and authoritarian expansion. The country will continue to expand exchanges with partners to safeguard the democratic way of life, he said. In response, Bruttin praised Taiwan's outstanding performance in the RSF's press freedom index and suggested areas in which his organization hopes to contribute, including formulating public policies to crack down on disinformation on social media, encourage media self-discipline and strengthen the role of public media, as well as exposing external propaganda and foreign interference.

Lai emphasizes strength through unity in National Day address	President Lai Ching-te delivered the National Day address in front of the Presidential Office Oct. 10 in Taipei City, vowing to make Taiwan a stronger force for regional peace, stability and prosperity. At the celebration of the 113rd anniversary of the founding of the ROC (Taiwan), Lai said the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other. The PRC has no right to represent Taiwan's 23 million people and his mission as president is to uphold the commitment to resist annexation or encroachment upon the country's sovereignty. To this end, Lai pledged to safeguard lives and property by implementation of the four pillars of peace action plan; by further developing the economy and expanding investment in social care. He cited three government committees established at the Presidential Office: climate change, health promotion and whole-of-society defense resilience, which deal with challenges like extreme weather and advance net-zero transition by 2050. According to Lai, Taiwan is committed to strengthening resilience in national defense, economic livelihood, disaster prevention and democracy. The country is resolved to uphold cross-strait peace and stability and achieve global security and prosperity, he said, adding that Taiwan is willing to work with China on addressing global issues and called on Beijing to apply its influence to end conflicts like Russia's invasion of Ukraine and to shoulder international responsibility. The president went on to elaborate on ways to promote the country's economic development, achieve regional balance and ensure people's well-being across generations. The government will further develop the five trusted industry sectors, expedite improvements to the safety of the national road network and implement measures including childcare for ages 0-6 and long-term care, among other tasks, while combatting fraud and housing speculation, he said. Lai concluded by saying that the people of Taiwan share common convictions so their determination to defend national sovereignty and to protect their free and democratic way of life remain unchanged.

MOFA thanks allies, partners for backing Taiwan’s UN participation	Support from the global community for Taiwan's bid to participate in the activities, mechanisms and meetings of the U.N. is sincerely appreciated by the government of Taiwan, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Oct. 4. According to the MOFA, top-level officials from Taiwan's allies including Belize, Eswatini, Marshall Islands, Palau, Paraguay, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and Grenadines and Tuvalu spoke in support of Taiwan during the U.N. General Debate and Summit of the Future Sept. 20-30 in New York. Among them, Palau, Marshall Islands, St. Lucia and Tuvalu pointed out that the U.N. resolution 2758 did not exclude Taiwan from participating in U.N. specialized agencies, the ministry said. Leaders and high-level officials from like-minded partners stressed the importance of maintaining cross-strait peace and stability, the MOFA said, citing remarks made by U.S. President Joe Biden and Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs Penny Wong during the General Debate. Other similar sentiments were expressed by a joint statement released after the Group of Seven's foreign ministers' meeting at the high-level week of the UN General Assembly, the ministry added. The fact that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell condemned China's distortion and misuse of U.N. Resolution 2758 to suppress Taiwan during a congressional hearing and Caspar Veldkamp, minister of foreign affairs of the Netherlands, said during a congressional inquiry that the resolution does not involve Taiwan, are both deeply appreciated, the MOFA said. Other nations' parliamentarians also showed their support through various means, the MOFA said, citing a resolution passed by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China on UN Resolution 2758 in July. The MOFA also reported that the legislative branches of Australia, Guatemala and the Netherlands greenlighted motions voicing support of Taiwan based on the IPAC resolution. In UN inclusion-related activities, President Lai Ching-te delivered a video address to the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit, calling for global support of Taiwan's international participation.

The MOFA reiterated that U.N. Resolution 2758 did not mention Taiwan and must not to be used as a basis to exclude the country from taking part in U.N. special agencies and global organizations. Taiwan is committed to contributing to the global community and its exclusion is a loss for all and undermines achievement of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, the ministry said, urging the U.N. to stop succumbing to China's pressure and to include Taiwan to fulfill its principle of leaving no one behind.

President Lai receives German Marshall Fund delegation from the US	President Lai Ching-te said Oct. 4 that Taiwan is committed to enhancing resilience in the defense, economic and disaster prevention spheres as it works with like-minded democratic partners to counteract authoritarian expansionism. The president made the remarks while receiving a delegation from the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a Washington-based think tank. The group was led by Heather A. Conley, senior advisor to the board of trustees, and included Chair Christopher Schroeder and other senior staffers, as well as Francesco M. Tal&ograve;, former permanent representative of Italy to NATO, and Rajmund Andrzejczak, former chief of the general staff of the Polish Armed Forces.

The president noted that the U.S. has also continued to coordinate with its allies to reiterate the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He took the opportunity to thank former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Jessica Lewis, in attendance with the GMF delegation, for her tremendous assistance in facilitating the U.S. government's provision of defense capabilities to Taiwan. Lai stated that he hopes to see Taiwan resolve the double taxation issue with the U.S. to further advance trade ties, and mentioned plans to conclude an investment agreement with the EU to bolster economic exchanges and cooperation. The president thanked the think tank for paying close attention to cross-strait issues, as evidenced by its research report saying that China has distorted UNGA Resolution 2758 and improperly linked it with its &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Such staunch support is sincerely appreciated by the government and people, he said. During her meeting with the group earlier the same day, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim said Typhoon Krathon and Hurricane Helene serve as reminders that society must strengthen its resilience to natural disasters and other challenges.

CIP minister congratulates Palau president on 30th anniversary of independence	Council of Indigenous Peoples Minister Ljaucu Zingrur, acting as President Lai Ching-te's special envoy, delivered a letter of congratulation to President Surangel Whipps Jr. of Palau Sept. 29 in the run-up to celebrations of the Pacific ally's 30th independence day. Ljaucu thanked Whipps for supporting Taiwan's participation in international arenas. The minister said that Taiwan's Indigenous people share deep cultural connections with the people of Palau, adding that he looks forward to further strengthening tribal exchanges and reinforcing bilateral ties on the foundation of the two sides' 25th anniversary of official ties. In response, Whipps said that one of the U.N. mandates is that every voice counts, and the people of Taiwan must not be excluded. He pledged to seek more cooperation opportunities for the two countries. According to the council, it worked with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to hold a banquet. Attendees including Palau's president, the Minister of State Gustav Aitaro and traditional leaders enjoyed a performance by NaLuWan Dance Troupe. The CIP called the visit a key part of promoting relations with Austronesian countries, and noted that the minister called at the headquarters of the Austronesian Forum to inspect operations, which resumed in 2019 at the decision of its 13 members. The council said it will continue to boost the establishment of close relations between the two sides' local governments and expand bilateral tribal collaborations across the board.

Taiwan sets strictest air pollution regulations in Asia	The Ministry of Environment announced amendments to Taiwan's Air Quality Standards Sept. 30 to bring the country's regulations more in line with global practices and offer better health protections to the public. According to the MOENV, the new regulations lower the maximum hourly, daily and yearly levels of pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide. In particular, the daily average threshold of PM 2.5 has been cut from 35 micrograms per cubic meter to 30 mcg/m3 and the yearly average threshold has dropped from 15 mcg/m3 to 12 mcg/m3, making them the strictest limits in Asia, the ministry said. The changes also update rules for air quality readings to provide a more accurate reflection of conditions starting Jan. 1, 2025. The ministry highlighted that according to data from 2021 to 2023, Taiwan is expected to experience good air quality 40 percent of the time under the new standards, while the chance of moderate and unhealthy days for sensitive groups may increase. The MOENV said the amendments follow guidelines set by the World Health Organization and a study published in July by Miaoli County-based National Health Research Institutes that shows a high correlation between PM 2.5 concentration and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The move is also part of the new administration's response to public calls for more effective air quality controls, it added. Achieving targets will require collective efforts by all parties involved, especially those responsible for producing pollutants, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said, adding that the ministry will roll out follow-up projects to tackle airborne particulates. Peng said the government's net-zero carbon emission policy will help improve air quality in Taiwan, as reduction of carbon and air pollution goes hand in hand. He added that the ministry hopes to lower the PM 2.5 standard further to 10 or 5 mcg/m3 in the future.

Foreign Minister Lin calls for global unity to fight authoritarianism	Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung called on like-minded partners to unite against authoritarianism and support Taiwan's participation in global organizations. Lin made the remarks during a sit-down with 11 journalists from 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Europe and North America last month in Taipei City. The minister brought them up to speed on issues ranging from new norms in cross-strait relations and growing authoritarian threats in the region to Taiwan's global participation and the new administration's integrated diplomacy approach. According to the minister, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, an emerging alliance known as CRINK, are expanding collaboration and posing a threat to Taiwan and fellow democracies around the world. Given the interconnectedness of national economies, Taiwan's values-based diplomacy can strengthen mutual support among like-minded partners, he added. Lin asserted that China's attempts to invade, blockade or isolate Taiwan will impact global navigation and that Beijing's ambition extends beyond the first island chain. Facing such challenges, Taiwan is leaving no stone unturned in strengthening its defense capabilities, as evidenced by the defense budget's expansion to 2.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product, the minister said, adding that this figure is higher than that of most NATO member states and is expected to increase to 3.5 percent in the future. With regard to global participation, Lin linked Taiwan's continued U.N. exclusion to China's willful misinterpretation of U.N. Resolution 2758, which he said does not mention Taiwan or its international status. He urged the global body to look squarely at Taiwan's bid, adding that the country can contribute not only its semiconductor prowess, but also its understanding of China's behavior. The minister's remarks have since been published in global news outlets such as World View Television, The New York Sun and Real America's Voice from the U.S.; National Newswatch from Canada; The Australian from Australia; The Jerusalem Post from Isreal; Lusa from Portugal; Die Presse from Austria; and Rzeczpospolita from Poland.

Artificial intelligence and information and communications-related courses would also be incorporated into the curriculum in vocational schools. The government, academic institutions and industry should collaborate to cultivate students' interdisciplinary expertise, Lai emphasized, adding that a substantial new project would also offer overseas training courses for students from Taiwan. Students will have more opportunity to receive training and exchange in other countries, which will stimulate innovation and growth for domestic industry, Lai concluded.

Accessibility at the heart of Taichung fine art museum’s work	A seminar on the inclusive and accessible operation of museums was staged Sept. 28 at the Taichung City-based National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts. Academics and experts from cultural agencies around Taiwan were invited to share their experience and expertise, the MOC said, adding that the event mainly focused on how to meet the audience's needs through the deployment of software and hardware elements. The second phase of an exhibit entitled &ldquo;Reconstructing the History of Art in Taiwan&rdquo; opened Sept. 7 to display fourteen works that address the topic posed in the event's subtitle: &ldquo;A Pluralistic Art History for Future Generations.&rdquo; The pieces, procured through the National Development Council' Forward-looking Infrastructure Development, are accompanied by a plethora of assistive and accessibility tools to welcome all guests to appreciate art: touch adaptations of visual works, audio descriptions, sign language guides and Braille. Speaking at the forum, Deputy Director Wang Jia-zheng of the NTMOFA said that the institution is devoted to the expansion of user-friendly museums, adding that the facility has accumulated substantive results in advancing access to culture over the past ten years. Wang continued that the current &ldquo;Future Generations&rdquo; exhibit showcases the museum's research on rebuilding Taiwan's art history as well as its achievements in collection, maintenance and preservation. He expressed hope that the exchanges at the symposium would facilitate equal access to art among different demographics. As the Ministry of Culture's demonstration museum since 2013 for offering services to guests with visual and hearing impairments, as well as those with other special needs, the MOC said the NTMOFA actively promotes cultural equality and inclusion. The museum has implemented a mode that provides people with equal cultural participation, not just by serving the underprivileged, but also by enhancing mutual understanding between diverse groups, the ministry added.

During the event, Lai welcomed Whipps' two-day visit and thanked him for supporting Taiwan and speaking up for the country's right to participate in international organizations. The president also encouraged WTCC members to experience Palau's beauty in person and explore potential business avenues. In response, Whipps thanked Taiwan for its continuous support for Palau's economic and tourism development, adding that he looks forward to deepening trade cooperation with Taiwan businesses. He expressed hope of further strengthening bilateral friendship as the two countries celebrate 25 years of official ties and Palau marks its 30th anniversary of independence. Lin also took the opportunity to express appreciation to Whipps for his remarks backing Taiwan during the U.N.

MODA minister deepens AI governance links with international partners	Minister of Digital Affairs Huang Yen-nun led a delegation to a ministerial meeting on human rights-based governance organized by the Freedom Online Coalition to emphasize the government's commitment to strengthening digital collaboration with the U.S. and other like-minded partners. The conference, entitled &ldquo;AI for Humanity,&rdquo; was held Sept. 23 in New York City and, according to the Ministry of Digital Affairs, brought together officials and experts from many countries, including France and Germany. Among those who made remarks were U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp of the Netherlands, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna, and Mauricio Lizcano, Columbia's minister of information and communications technology. In exchanges at the conference, Huang said that accountability, fairness, privacy, security and transparency are vital to the advancement of artificial intelligence, and added that these principles would boost societal confidence in AI and ensure its long-term development. He also called for a unified effort to tackle AI's potential hazards, the ministry said. In addition to the symposium, Huang also attended a reception held by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs and Google, where the minister joined academics and experts from around the world to explore best practices in leveraging AI technology to respond to challenges, particularly in the areas of climate change, education and public health.

MOFA thanks US for supportive statement, condemns China for suppressing Taiwan at UNGA79	The Sept. 27 remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken supporting cross-strait peace and stability is sincerely appreciated by the government and people of Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Sept. 28. According to a Sept. 27 press release by the U.S. State Department, Blinken made the remarks during his meeting with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi earlier the same day on the margins of the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York City. Blinken emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as raised concerns about China's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea, its support for Russia's defense industry base and war of aggression against Ukraine. The ministry welcomed the state secretary's unwavering support, and condemned China's persistent threats to the cross-strait status quo while the global community continues to voice concern for regional security and stability. In particular, the MOFA sternly condemned Wang's speech Sept. 28 at the general debate that the U.N. resolution 2758 has resolved once and for all the question of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan. The ministry said that the ROC (Taiwan) and China do not belong to each other, which is the current cross-strait status quo and a globally recognized fact. The said resolution does not mention Taiwan, nor does it confirm that Taiwan is part of China or authorize China to represent Taiwan at the U.N., the MOFA said, emphasizing that only the government elected by its people can represent Taiwan at the U.N. or other global venues. The MOFA called on China to stop misleading the world and urged the international community to heed Beijing's malicious attempts to use the resolution to pave way for its military aggression against Taiwan. As President Lai Ching-te said during his video speech at the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit, a stronger Taiwan is better able to promote democracy, peace and prosperity around the world. The government hopes that Taiwan and other democratic nations can jointly support the democratic umbrella and counter authoritarian aggression, Lai added. As a responsible global member, Taiwan will continue to strengthen its self-defense capabilities and work with the U.S. and other like-minded partners to defend the rules-based international order and ensure peace, stability and prosperity in the strait and the Indo-Pacific, the ministry said.

National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee holds inaugural meeting	President Lai Ching-te presided over the inaugural meeting of the National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee Sept. 26 in Taipei City, underscoring the government's commitment to enhancing civilian emergency preparedness. Delivering the opening remarks, Lai said climate change, large-scale natural disasters and authoritarian expansion pose challenges for both the country and the international community, adding that a more resilient Taiwan would make greater contributions to global democracy, peace and prosperity. The president highlighted three areas of focus to strengthen the country's response capabilities and expand government-civilian cooperation. The first is to prepare for worst-case scenarios. Comprehensive and proactive measures are essential for ensuring rapid reaction time and normal societal function in times of emergency, Lai said. Second, ordinary citizens should receive response and mobilization training to increase stockpiles of critical supplies and safeguard the operation of vital infrastructure, including the electric grid; finance, information security and transportation networks; and medical and evacuation facilities, the president added. Finally, the central and local governments must reinforce collaboration with civil organizations to identify problem areas and develop strategies to address them, Lai said. In selecting committee members, the government has taken background, experience, specialty, age and gender into careful consideration, the president said, adding that a diverse body will be better able to tackle the complexity of the task. Lai concluded by conveying confidence that robust determination and preparedness will deepen Taiwan's cooperation with like-minded partners in facing domestic and international concerns. The National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee is one of three advisory groups announced by the president in June. The other two are the National Climate Change Committee and the Healthy Taiwan Promotion Committee.

MOENV promotes plastic reduction at Taipei baseball game	Deputy Minister Shen Chih-hsiu took part in a baseball game Sept. 26 in Taipei City to promote the government's plastic reduction campaign, the Ministry of Environment said. According to the MOENV, Shen threw the first pitch to start the Chinese Professional Baseball League game between the Wei Chuan Dragons and Uni-President Lions. Taiwan swimmer and Olympian Wang Kuan-hung, who is the ministry's recycling ambassador, was also present at the ceremony. Shen said the fifth session of the U.N. Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee will take place in late November this year in Busan, South Korea to address plastic pollution, showing that plastic reduction has attained global consensus. As a responsible international community member, Taiwan needs to be part of the worldwide trend. To this end, the MOENV launched a program in July 2022 to offer a NT$5 discount to consumers who bring their own cups to purchase beverages at retail outlets and also implemented a ban earlier this month on single-use plastic cups at beverage shops nationwide. Shen said the initiatives are expected to cut the use of 790 million disposable cups a year. Shen said other similar projects are in the pipeline, including encouraging the public to bring reusable bags or totes for grocery shopping, and a ban on disposable toiletries and bottled water at hotels starting Jan. 1, 2025. These measures will lead to the use of 65 million fewer plastic bags and the reduction of 2,000 tons of plastics. The deputy minister urged participants to be responsible consumers by bringing their own bottles or borrowing reusable cups when attending baseball games and other events. The game also offered environmentally conscious fans free drinks and beverage discounts.

MODA stages forum on submarine cable, internet data center development	Bolstering development of the submarine communication cable and internet data center sectors was the theme of a forum held by the Ministry of Digital Affairs Sept. 26 in Taipei City to promote Taiwan's digital resilience. Jointly organized with the state-sponsored Telecom Technology Center based in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, the one-day event focused on development strategies for the two sectors in Taiwan, the analysis of potential risks faced by local supply chain players and the sharing of security assessments and related guidance. The event involved local experts and officials, as well as their counterparts from Australia and Japan. Those in attendance included Chiueh Her-ming, deputy minister at MODA; Chiu Wei-chen, deputy executive secretary of the Office of Science and Technology Policy under the National Science and Technology Council; and Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association Deputy Representative Takashi Hattori. Participants discussed the risks associated with development in the two sectors from legal and geopolitical perspectives, analyzed standard procedures to ensure the security of Taiwan's submarine cables and data cloud centers; and reviewed measures to respond to and manage incidents at such facilities. According to the MODA, over 95 percent of international communication is conducted through 436 submarine cables around the world. As an island, Taiwan especially relies on such cables to communicate with its offshore counties and townships, as well as its global partners, the ministry added. The MODA said the country's geographic location and technological prowess set it in good stead as a potential global submarine cable hub, adding that high-tech powerhouses Google LLC and Microsoft Corp. have set up data centers in the country. Given the threats of natural disasters and geopolitical concerns, however, local firms also need to ensure effective emergency preparedness, the ministry said. The forum served as a platform to exchange views on global trends and share experiences to address related challenges, in order to strengthen the security and reliability of local infrastructure, and boost investors' confidence in Taiwan, the MODA said.

During the signing ceremony, Huang said the NPM is actively responding to the government's open data policies and the global trend for museums to enhance public access to their collections. The museum is committed to upholding transparency and will continue to introduce its collections to countries around the world, he added. Echoing Huang's remarks, Chen said Wikipedia volunteers need institutions like the NPM to provide credible research information for encyclopedia content.

President Lai addresses Concordia Annual Summit	President Lai Ching-te spoke to attendees of the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit via a recorded video message, pledging to build a stronger Taiwan while expressing his hope that democracies will jointly counter authoritarian aggression. Democracy around the world faces threats such as authoritarian expansion, Lai said, citing Russia's invasion of Ukraine and adding China's intensifying military intimidation in the Taiwan Strait and the East and South China Seas as examples. He specifically noted China's use of gray zone tactics, in addition to lawfare and the misrepresentation of history, to expand its power. Democratic Taiwan and authoritarian China are not subordinate to each other, Lai stressed during his explanation of Beijing's distortion of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758. The president also thanked the U.S. and the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China for opposing Beijing's misinterpretations and welcomed more countries to join in support of democracy worldwide. He went on to say that Taiwan's four pillars of peace are a plan to maintain the cross-strait peace and stability, adding that the country is committed to strengthening national defense, building economic security, deepening partnerships with democratic countries, and ensuring stable and principled cross-strait leadership. Alexander Tah-ray Yui, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., also attended the event, holding a dialogue with Keith Krach, former U.S. undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment. Their discussion focused on Taiwan's democratic resolve and ways to shape global security and peace through strategic cooperation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait is key to global economic growth and prosperity, Yui said. Taiwan is an indispensable partner in sustainable supply chains as it provides over 90 percent of global advanced semiconductor products, he added, calling on the international community to squarely face the country's improper exclusion from the U.N.'s specialized agencies and global organizations, and to incorporate its expertise and contributions into the process of sustainable international development. According to the Presidential Office, the summit was organized by New York-based nonprofit organization Concordia on the sidelines of the ongoing 79th U.N. General Assembly. Dignitaries giving speeches at the event included President Santiago Pe&ntilde;a Palacios of Paraguay and Theresa May, former prime minister of the U.K. (YCH-E) Write to Taiwan Today at ttonline@mofa.gov.tw	https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&post=259283	2024-09-26T00:00:00-07:00

International forum on Taiwan cultural heritage staged in Taipei	The 2024 International Forum on Taiwan Cultural Heritage was staged Sept. 25-26 at National Taiwan University in Taipei City, underscoring government efforts to strengthen international cooperation on cultural heritage management, preservation and promotion. Organized by the Ministry of Culture, the event invited experts from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea and the U.S. to join dialogues with domestic academics, experts, officials and representatives of civil society organizations. The guest experts are all members of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), an advisory body of the U.N.

Taiwan flexes soft power at Tokyo film festival, Lyon illustration fair	Three Taiwan productions have been short-listed in two categories at this year's Tokyo International Film Festival, according to the Ministry of Culture Sept. 25. Making its Asian premiere at TIFF, which will take place from Oct. 28 to Nov. 6, &ldquo;Daughter's Daughter&rdquo; is among the 15 entries short-listed for the Competition section following its Honorable Mention at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was directed by Huang Xi and stars Sylvia Chang, with Chang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, another Taiwanese cinematic icon, as the executive producers. The film depicts the story of a mother who must confront her hidden past after learning of the death of her daughter, who had lived in the U.S. with her same-sex partner. Through the mother's struggle with past remorse and future responsibilities, the drama delves into the complexity of LGBTQ+ issues, in vitro fertilization and reproductive rights. A Taiwan-Japan co-production directed by Shinzo Katayama, &ldquo;Lust in the Rain&rdquo; is also nominated for the Competition category. With 90 percent of its content shot in Taiwan, the film presents a unique adaptation of a surreal love story by Japanese cartoonist and essayist Yoshiharu Tsuge. &ldquo;Black Ox,&rdquo; starring Lee Keng-sheng and jointly produced by Taiwan, Japan and the U.S., is selected in the Asia Future category. This drama with stunning visual imagery tells the journey of a man and an ox on the path to spiritual awakening, inspired by a Zen legend. According to the MOC, the selection of the three films marks an exciting milestone for the country's cinema, as it has been 20 years since &ldquo;The Passage,&rdquo; directed by Cheng Wen-tang, was nominated for the TIFF Competition category. Prior to that, &ldquo;Darkness and Light,&rdquo; directed and written by Chang Tso-chi, won the best film award at the 1999 TIFF, the ministry added.

President Lai vows to strengthen civil defense in Taiwan	President Lai Ching-te said Sept. 24 that Taiwan is committed to enhancing civil defense capabilities so that its people have the knowledge and skills needed to protect themselves and their beloved country. Lai made the remarks while participating in a civil defense training organized by Academia Formosana in the central county of Nantou. Authorities and organizations at all levels are working to advance civil defense and natural disaster response, as evidenced by drills held on the National Disaster Prevention Day Sept. 21, Lai said. He further praised the AF-formulated plans to reduce potential casualties and property damage during disasters and conflict. Lai went on to reiterate his missions as president, noting that safeguarding the country's sovereignty is a top priority. He added that the ROC (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other, and that the future of Taiwan can only be decided by its 23 million people. Ensuring the safety of the country's people is equally important, Lai said, citing the country's enhanced national defense capabilities since former President Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016. His third mission is to boost the country's economy, Lai said. The president noted that the bulk of Taiwan's overseas investment is flowing to Japan, the U.S., New Southbound Policy target countries and those across Europe, adding that the country's investment in China accounted for only 11.4 percent of its total foreign investment last year, decreasing from 83.8 percent in 2010. According to Lai, the newly established Presidential Office Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee will convene a meeting every three months to further the country's responses to natural disasters.

Through the images on display and screening of feature films and documentaries, the exhibition spotlights the historical predicament of the Māori and how they strived against adversity to defend their treasured dignity and justice. It is hoped that the Māori experience can inspire Taiwan society to reflect on itself and serve as a reference when it comes to promoting transitional justice for the country's Indigenous inhabitants, she added. Pearson said the Indigenous peoples of Taiwan and his country share similar experiences in searching for their historical identity. Holding this exhibition at the NHRM, which is located inside the Jing-Mei White Terror Memorial Park, is a reminder of the hardship and suffering experienced by all those who fought for human rights, he added. According to the NHRM, the exhibition is underway till March 23, 2025, and also features five film screenings and four post-screening discussions. It begins with the history of the Māori in New Zealand, and focuses on the trade, cooperation and confrontation between those in the Aotearoa region and European settlers since the 18th century, as well as their search for truth that reflects their tribal values.

Taiwan reiterates bid for U.N. participation at GCTF workshop	Taiwan partnered up with Australia, Canada, Japan and the U.S. to hold a seminar on leveraging technology to achieve sustainable development Sept. 19 in New York City, underscoring the country's indispensable role in realizing the United Nations' sustainable development goals, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Organized under the Global Cooperation and Training Framework, the event attracted governmental officials and experts from over 10 countries and was presided over by Yanis Ben Amor, executive director of Columbia University's Center for Sustainable Development. Prominent attendees included Tom Chih-Chiang Lee, director-general of Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York; Charles C. Li, secretary general of the Taipei-based International Cooperation and Development Fund (TaiwanICDF); Chris P. Lu, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations for management and reform; Rebecca Bryant, Australia's ambassador and deputy permanent representative to the U.N.; Hussein Hirji, political counsellor at the Permanent Mission of Canada to the U.N.; and Hiromi Tengeji, representative director of Kopernik Japan. Speaking at the seminar, Lee said that the U.N.'s launch of the Summit of the Future, which aims to facilitate international collaboration in utilizing technology to advance the well-being of future generations, highlights the significance of Taiwan's inclusion in global bodies given that the country produces over 90 percent of the world's advanced chips. Despite the U.N.'s commitment to leave no one behind, it continues to shut out Taiwan's 23.5 million people, he added. According to the MOFA, there is a growing international consensus recognizing the importance of Taiwan in ensuring global welfare. This is evidenced by the joint statement released by Australia, India, Japan and the U.S. after their 4th Quadrilateral Security Dialogue that took place Sept. 21 in the U.S. state of Delaware, which stressed that maintaining cross-strait peace is vital to global prosperity. Similar sentiments were expressed in joint statements released Sept. 20 by Australia and the U.S. and Sept. 21 by Japan and the U.S. following leaders' meetings. Both declarations reiterated their commitment to safeguarding Taiwan Strait stability while conveying concern over China's aggressions in the South China Sea, the MOFA added.

Taiwan stages APEC chemical hazard training program	The Training Program on Capacity Building for Chemical Emergency Preparedness under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation opened Sept. 23 in Kaohsiung City, to ensure a swift response to chemical incidents, reduce environmental impact and enhance human safety. Organized by the Ministry of Environment, the six-day event involves 25 representatives from eight APEC member economies including Malaysia, Peru, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, as well as non-member countries such as France and Poland. During his opening remarks, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said accelerating economic and trade development has led to an increase in the production and transportation of chemical substances. Thus, there is also an increase in the number of cross-border accidents involving those substances and a concomitant impact on economic stability, environmental sustainability and human safety, he added. Peng said scenario training helps APEC member economies enhance capabilities in key issues such as hazard identification, on-site detection and incident response. The government is looking forward to sharing experience and expertise in managing hazardous chemical substances with its partner countries and helping to create an effective response mechanism in the region, the minister added. According to the MOENV Chemicals Administration, the training program was proposed by Taiwan this year during the APEC Chemical Dialogue. It is taking place at the Southern Emergency Response Training Center for Toxic Substances, a globally recognized training facility, located inside National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology in southern Taiwan.
