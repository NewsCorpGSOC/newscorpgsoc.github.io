Taiwan to host 1st World Bird Fair in September	Taiwan will host the inaugural World Bird Fair Sept. 20-21 in the central city of Taichung to promote bird conservation and birdwatching ecotourism, the Tourism Administration said March 17. The announcement was made by TA Director-General Chou Yung-hui while welcoming a delegation from the World Birdfairs Council March 13 in Taipei City. The WBC is a global nonprofit organization that represents birding events across the world. Taiwan's diverse landscapes make it a prime destination for birdwatching, with 691 bird species recorded, including 32 endemic species and 52 subendemic ones, the organizers said. The fair will feature two experience-sharing forums, followed by a trip to Dasyueshan Forest Recreation Area, the most popular birding site in central Taiwan, the TA said, anticipating representatives from 25 countries to gather in Taiwan for the event. According to Chou, ecotourism is among the fastest-growing tourism sectors in the postpandemic era. The first ever bird fair in Taiwan will help promote the country's rich avian biodiversity and develop green and sustainable tourism, he said, adding that the TA will take the opportunity to showcase the country's 13 national scenic areas to attract more foreign visitors. During their stay in Taiwan, the 10-member WBC delegation toured the Tri-Mountain National Scenic Area and the main venues of the bird fair. Ornithologist Horacio Matarasso from Argentina said the WBC has grown from a small entity in 2020 to a global organization with more than 50 birding associations as members. He expects the upcoming event to bring WBC members even closer together. Naturalist and wildlife guide Andrew Sebastian from Malaysia described Taiwan as a portal to Asian birding, saying that Taiwan is an ideal candidate to become a major birdwatching destination, while Maria Marth from Brazil praised Taiwan for its urban greening efforts.

One measure aims to increase domestic and foreign demand, she noted, adding that Taiwan has already signed cooperative agreements with countries such as Czechia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and the U.S. to boost international orders. Another measure provides tax incentives to encourage technological innovations for key components and promotes investment by the National Development Fund to drive mass production, Cheng said. Equally important is to establish an industry ecosystem and manufacturing clusters, she added, citing a plan by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Chiayi County Government to build another hall at the R&amp;D center and the ongoing construction of an aerospace park in the county's Minxiong Township. These are complemented by efforts to enhance cybersecurity and whole-of-society resilience, the vice premier explained. The government will continue offering subsidies to help local enterprises align with international cybersecurity standards and regulating exclusive airspace for sandbox testing, she said, adding that drone development is anticipated to strengthen democratic resilience, disaster prevention, the economy and national defense. Cheng concluded by saying that the UAV industry is key to Taiwan's future and urged the public and private sectors to work together to build a competitive supply chain.

Deputy foreign minister gives interview to The Japan Times	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chih-chung Wu said the government is committed to ensuring Indo-Pacific peace and stability while expanding exchanges with Japan. Wu made the remarks during an interview earlier this month in Taipei City with Gabriel Dominguez for two online articles published March 11 and 12 in the English edition of The Japan Times. According to Wu, Taiwan and Japan share the same beliefs and values, as well as close cultural, people-to-people and trade exchanges. The outpouring of assistance from Taiwan's people in the wake of Japan's Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011 further underscores the strong bond between the two sides, he said. The deputy minister stressed that a peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific is in Japan's interest, adding that Taiwan welcomed the Taiwan Strait transit of a Japan Self-Defense Forces vessel in February. The move highlighted Japan's role as a key regional stakeholder, he said. It is critical that Japan continue strengthening its defense capabilities in response to regional developments and supporting exchanges with Taiwan, Wu said, expressing the hope of more higher-level interactions and bilateral cooperation going forward. Wu went on to say that the Trump administration's efforts to defend its interests in the Asia-Pacific are in line with Taiwan's resolution to safeguard its national interests. The two are important partners, as evidenced by the major investment by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in the U.S. and Taiwan's position as the country's seventh-largest trade partner, he said, adding that the government will continue to deepen trade and security relations with Washington. The deputy minister also emphasized that Taiwan's and Ukraine's situations differ in that the government has been doing its utmost to enhance its self-defense capabilities for years. He said cross-strait developments have a huge impact on the global economy given the local semiconductor sector's significance in global supply chains. As a responsible stakeholder in the international community, Taiwan will continue to avoid provocative actions to prevent giving China any excuse to escalate tensions in the strait, he said, adding that the government looks forward to deepening exchanges with Japan and other like-minded partners to contribute to regional peace and stability.

Taiwan steps up carbon capture to meet net-zero emission goals	The Ministry of Environment has approved four projects to increase carbon sequestration as part of the agency's efforts to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions. According to the MOENV, the plans involve afforestation, enhancing the carbon capture capacity of depleted and bamboo forests and upgrading the management of mature forests. Carbon sequestration refers to the natural or artificial process of absorbing and storing greenhouse gases from the environment. To reach the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, the government is establishing carbon sinks as one of its 12 major strategies, the ministry said. Under the projects, nonforest or deforested land larger than 0.5 hectares with less than 40 percent soil disturbance for flat areas and less than 33 percent for sloped areas is targeted for tree planting, the MOENV said, adding that the planting cannot disrupt existing agricultural operations. Additionally, forests that have maintained tree cover over the last 20 years with lower than average carbon storage capacity and no commercial logging activities will be thinned in the initial stages to reduce resource competition and encourage healthy growth. For land that already meets the definition of a mature forest, the initiative aims to optimize stand density with selective harvesting of timber products. Similarly, bamboo forests with growth more than five years old will be harvested to renew carbon sink capacity. Entities willing to join in any of the projects must submit plans for review in accordance with the MOENV's regulations, the ministry concluded.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to French media	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chih-chung Wu said peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait are key to maintaining regional security and prosperity. Wu made the remarks during an interview last month in Taipei City with Bernard de la Billardi&egrave;re, host of the news show Enqu&ecirc;te Exclusive, for a documentary aired March 9 on the French TV channel M6. According to Wu, Taiwan produces 60 percent of chips and nearly 95 percent of high-end semiconductors for the world, making it an indispensable player in the global semiconductor supply chain. The country is committed to maintaining the cross-strait status quo, reducing risk of confrontation and promoting regional and global peace and prosperity, the deputy minister added. Wu stressed that the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; means that Taiwan has never been part of China, adding that any unilateral attempts by Beijing to change the status quo through military action will be considered invasion. While Taiwan has official relations with only 12 countries, it has 111 overseas offices around the world and sees itself as &ldquo;sui generis,&rdquo; meaning unique, the minister said. The country is a robust democracy with a well-run government, thriving society and economy, he said, adding that Taiwan's people enjoy high living standards and free media, while the government engages extensively with the world through a pragmatic approach. In terms of Taiwan-U.S. relations, Wu said the Indo-Pacific is part of U.S. interests. The ongoing drills undertaken by France and the Philippines in the South China Sea and continuous military maneuvers in the region by major countries all highlight the strategic importance of Taiwan. The government hopes to strengthen its bonds with members of the free world through cooperation in the semiconductor sector so as to ensure regional peace and stability and promote global security and prosperity, Wu said.

MAC deputy minister condemns China’s misinterpretation of UNGA Resolution 2758	Mainland Affairs Council Deputy Minister Shen Yu-chung rebuked China's spurious claims regarding U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758, stressing that the resolution makes no mention of Taiwan throughout its entire text. The resolution neither states that Taiwan is a part of the People's Republic of China nor does it authorize China to represent Taiwan in the U.N., Shen said, adding that the PRC didn't even exist when the Cairo Declaration was issued in 1943, which specified that Taiwan and the outlying Penghu Islands were among the Japanese-held territories to be restored to the ROC. The deputy minister made the remarks earlier this month while attending a seminar analyzing China's 2025 Two Sessions and the launch ceremony of a China and regional development research center at Tunghai University in central Taiwan's Taichung City. According to Shen, China's government reports show that both its budget deficit and deflationary pressure are increasing. However, Beijing continues to hike military spending, which has drawn attention from neighboring countries and democracies around the world, he said. Other academics participating in the event suggested that the government continue monitoring the Two Sessions to gain deeper insight into China's decision-making process, stability maintenance policies and changes in its international Taiwan strategy. They added that the government should pay close attention to the Fujian demonstration zone, which aims to advance cross-strait development through transportation infrastructure and economic and trade exchanges. Recommendations also included that the government should keep an eye on the impact of Chinese businesses on Taiwan enterprises and Beijing's attempts to drum up support for unification among Taiwan's youth while cultivating more China studies experts, according to the MAC.

Sun Moon Lake recognized as green destination at ITB Berlin	Taiwan's Sun Moon Lake National Scenic Area is a winner of the Green Destinations Top 100 Story Awards presented during the 2025 ITB in Berlin, the Tourism Administration said March 5. According to the TA, the popular tourist site is the third-place winner in the business and marketing category for its Good Practice Story titled &ldquo;Join Us! Harnessing Collective Wisdom to Promote Sustainable Tourism.&rdquo; The award represents global recognition of the government's promotion of green tourism, the agency said. In an effort to help local businesses implement sustainable tourism practices such as waste reduction and low-carbon travel, the SMLNSA Administration began inviting entities to attend project brainstorming workshops in 2023. The joint effort has paid off, with several major corporations already taking part in such tours and travel agencies promoting the packages, the TA said. The TA noted that this is the third time the scenic area has been honored with the award. Its 2022 &ldquo;Say Goodbye to Single-Use Plastics&rdquo; campaign involving 29 businesses successfully reduced carbon emissions by 206.05 kilograms, while its 2023 &ldquo;Use the Sustainable Tourism Model to Make Tribes Have New Possibilities-Economy Under the Forest&rdquo; campaign helped Indigenous Bunun tribe members turn dried Maqaw seeds, a traditional food seasoning, into perfume to enhance community prosperity. The National Center for Traditional Arts' Yilan Park in the northeastern county also won the third place in the culture and tradition category this year for its &ldquo;Be a Sharer: The Revitalization of the Traditional Orange Turtle Sharing Culture&rdquo; campaign, the TA said.

Guishan Island reopens to the public	Travelers are again allowed to visit Guishan Island off the coast of northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County, the Tourism Administration announced during a beach cleanup and tree-planting activity Feb. 28 on the island. According to the TA, Guishan Island is usually closed to the public from every Dec. 1 to Feb. 28 to allow the island's ecology to recuperate. However, extensive damage resulting from October 2024's Typhoon Kong-rey led the Northeast and Yilan Coast National Scenic Area Administration to announce an early closure Nov. 5 to effect repairs. The agency spent four months restoring facilities on the island to return it to pristine condition. TA Director-General Chou Yung-hui thanked the Coast Guard Administration and local fisheries and tourism promotion associations for their support in the process. Beginning March 1, up to 1,800 people per day will be allowed to register to visit the island Thursday through Tuesday, and only 100 will be granted permits to hike the interior. Wednesdays are reserved for researchers. The only active volcano in the country, Guishan Island is 10 kilometers off the coast of Toucheng Township. Popular activities include hiking the island's coast and peak, exploring an abandoned military tunnel, spotting dragonflies, and joining whale- and dolphin-watching tours.

Bonnie Glaser of GMF visits National Museum of Taiwan History	Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific Program at Washington, D.C.-based German Marshall Fund of the United States, visited the National Museum of Taiwan History Feb. 22 in the southern city of Tainan. The U.S. expert was in the country as head of a 14-member delegation from the think tank's Taiwan-U.S.-Europe Policy Program (TUPP). The international cohort of young scholars comprised specialists in the fields of artificial intelligence, commerce, information and communications technology, international politics and public health. According to the NMTH, this was Glaser's fifth visit to the museum since 2018 as head of a TUPP delegation. This year's attendees showed particular interest in the interactions between Indigenous and Han peoples, as well as Wangye beliefs. They were especially curious about the traditional costumes of the vanguard that leads parades in honor of these deities. During a sit-down at the venue, the visitors explored topics including responses to transitions of power in Taiwan, local museums' use of historical studies to organize exhibitions for domestic and international audiences, and methods of communicating effectively with patrons of all ages. Glaser said she continued to visit the NMTH because its permanent exhibits present historical perspectives that are relatable to patrons from home and abroad, adding that the museum's English tour guide services also help visitors from the western world better understand Taiwan. NMTH Director Chang Lung-chih said the museum reopened its permanent exhibition hall in 2021 to showcase Taiwan's connection with the world. In addition to highlighting the country's multiethnic history and experiences with colonialism, exhibitions at the site also focus on contemporary studies on topics such as Indigenous groups, maritime history, post-war social development, social movements and new migrants.

Lai attends ceremony marking 78th anniversary of 228 Incident	President Lai Ching-te pledged to expedite the opening of political archives to further the implementation of transitional justice on Feb. 28 in Taipei City. Lai made the remarks during a ceremony marking the 78th anniversary of the Feb. 28 Incident, during which he also offered condolences to victims and their surviving family members on behalf of the government. The incident occurred in 1947 amid protests of unjust treatment and calls for government reform. Military crackdowns in response to these protests claimed the lives of many civilians and ushered in decades of martial law. The incident had long been a taboo topic, the president noted, adding that it was not until after democratization that the government began to make apologies, offer compensation to victims and their families, and designate Feb. 28 as an annual day of remembrance. Lai continued by acknowledging that while considerable progress has been made toward justice, the search for historical truth takes intensive work. Last year he requested that the National Security Bureau prepare approximately one million documents from its records during the martial law period for submission to the National Development Council's National Archives Administration by June. The president added that the Ministry of Culture had also begun reviews of historical sites related to human rights violations to preserve them for posterity. He concluded with hopes that the annual memorial service not only honor victims and offer comfort to the families of the dead, but also reinforce the lessons of history so that they might not be repeated.

MOENV announces new regulations on HFCs	The Ministry of Environment announced two sets of regulations Feb. 25 governing hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), as the government continues to bring Taiwan's regulations into line with global standards. According to the MOENV, the move is in response to an amendment by the parties to the Montreal Protocol. Adopted in September of 1987, the landmark U.N. environmental treaty regulates the production and consumption of nearly 100 man-made chemicals referred to as ozone depleting substances. During their 28th meeting in October of 2016 in Kigali, Rwanda, the parties signed the Kigali Amendment to add HFCs to the list of controlled substances and approve a timeline for their gradual reduction by 80-85 percent by the late 2040s. The amendment has been ratified by more than 160 countries and territories so far, the MOENV added. HFCs are mainly used in electronic cleansing, fire extinguishing equipment, industrial processing and refrigeration. While they are considered substitutes for hydrochlorofluorocarbons, an ozone depleting substance, they also contain high global warming potential values. The ministry said under the new rules, production of 18 types of HFCs is banned immediately and starting July 1 this year, approval has to be obtained for the import and export of such products and mixtures containing the chemicals.

Taiwan reports 2nd highest foreign trade in 2024	Taiwan recorded its second-best foreign trade numbers in 2024, thanks in part to continuous expansion of the global economy, the Ministry of Finance said Feb. 25. The MOF attributed the strong showing to factors like inflation mitigation and the recovery of economic resilience around the world, adding that global supply chain restructuring and expanding artificial intelligence applications greatly benefited local semiconductor and information communication technology sectors. According to the ministry, Taiwan's exports grew 9.9 percent to US$475 billion during the year, with figures reaching a new monthly high in August, along with a second peak in December. Imports surged 12.2 percent to US$394 billion as semiconductor firms ramped up investments in equipment to prepare for a booming global AI supply chain. A breakdown of the figures shows that electronic components and parts topped the export list, accounting for 37.3 percent of the total, followed by ICT and audiovisual products at 27.9 percent and basic metals at 6 percent. Taiwan's exports to the U.S. reached a record high of US$111.4 billion, up 46.1 percent over 2023. Exports to major trade partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations increased 15.1 percent to US$87.8 billion, also a record high. While China and Hong Kong remained the leading destination for local exports, the combined share dropped to 31.7 percent, the lowest in 23 years. The U.S. surpassed ASEAN members to take the second spot, with its share of 23.4 percent the highest in 24 years. Despite geopolitical risk and uncertainties stemming from the tariff policies of the U.S. new administration, the MOF expected recovering global trade and expanding investment in AI applications by global cloud service providers to continue to benefit Taiwan's exporters.

President Lai receives 228 Incident overseas victims’ families	President Lai Ching-te expressed hope Feb. 24 that Taiwan's 23 million people will unite to safeguard the country while maintaining the constitutional system of democracy, freedom, and human rights to continue Taiwan's development and prosperity.

The 228 Incident occurred in 1947 after the Japanese colonial government's withdrawal in late 1945 and followed calls for government reform. When these demands went unmet, protests broke out around the country, prompting a military crackdown that resulted in many civilian deaths. The president first thanked the group for its longstanding work for speaking out in support of Taiwan, noting that this year is the 78th anniversary of the 228 Incident. The death of Taiwan social elites in the event including the first Taiwan prosecutor Wang Yu-lin and artist Chen Cheng-po caused incalculable losses to Taiwan society, he said, offering apologies again on behalf of the government. The government will spare no effort to do make amends for the 228 Incident, Lai said, citing remedial measures including admitting mistakes, offering apologies, making compensation, investigating the truth, restoring reputations, revoking judgments and setting up memorials and monuments. He added that government authorities are committed to pursuing transitional justice to seek the truth, bring justice and guarantee that such an incident will never happen again. Although this is an unfinished task, Lai said the government will declassify political archives and stressed that people must not forget history and understand the differences between democracy and authoritarianism to protect freedom. The government seeks to unite the country, protect public safety and never allow an event like the 228 Incident to happen again, Lai concluded. To this end, Taiwan's sovereignty must be safeguarded, he said, adding that the ROC (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other, Taiwan's sovereignty is inviolable and cannot be annexed, and that the country's future is to be determined by its 23 million people.

VP Hsiao receives German Marshall Fund delegation	Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim met with a delegation from U.S. headquartered German Marshall Fund's Taiwan-US-Europe Policy Program Feb. 20 in the Presidential Office in Taipei City. Hsiao said that in the face of challenges, Taiwan and its transatlantic partners need to continue dialogue and cooperation so that both can maintain economic prosperity, social resilience and enhance common interests. She added that the two sides share values such as freedom and democracy and thus should work together to face challenges.

She added that Taiwan attaches great importance to balanced growth in all walks of life and that use of artificial intelligence must benefit traditional industries and small and medium sized enterprises. Over the past two years, the U.S. has become Taiwan's largest overseas investment location with over 40 percent of overall foreign investment going to that destination, compared to 2010 when over 80 percent of foreign investment went to China. Hsiao said that adjustment and diversification in economics and trade ensures that Taiwan becomes a continuously prosperous and resilient society. The vice president further noted that one of President Lai's major policies is to institutionalize the concept of whole-of-society defense resilience.

OAC Minister vows to maintain Indo-Pacific peace, stability	The Cabinet-level Ocean Affairs Council Minister Kuan Bi-ling said Feb. 19 that the council is committed to working with its Indo-Pacific counterparts to safeguard peace, prosperity and stability in the region. Kuan made the remarks during an interview on a current affairs Yahoo TV program. China has increased its grey zone assaults on Taiwan by holding military exercises, as well as harassing the country by the frequent appearance of coast guard ships, militia fishing boats and scientific research ships in waters surrounding Taiwan, Kuan said. The minister said that that vessels from China have conducted research in Taiwan's contiguous zone recently, with at least 65 resulting scientific articles published in international journals, she added. The minister said that the close approach to Taiwan of such ships also had strategic intentions, as the surveys included information about seabed geology, topography and hydrology. The OAC will deal with such ships with caution while at the same time advancing the country's own scientific research in surrounding waters, she noted. The OAC is committed to working with Indo-Pacific partners in strengthening maritime law enforcement and disaster relief, Kuan said, citing a joint search and rescue drill conducted by Taiwan cutter Shun Hu No. 9 and the Japan Coast Guard patrol vessel Sagami last year. The minister also noted that military ships from 10 countries including Canada and the U.S. have passed through the Taiwan Strait 17 times last year, demonstrating freedom of navigation of the strait. Kuan concluded by pledging that the OAC will help to secure national security and work with partners to ensure Indo-Pacific peace and stability.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to French media	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chih-chung Wu said the government is fully determined to defend Taiwan's democratic way of life and enhance the country's strategic value. Wu made the remarks during an online interview with R&eacute;gis Soubrouillard for an article published Feb. 14 in Paris-based weekly magazine Challenges. According to the deputy minister, despite a lack of official ties, Taiwan is committed to expanding relations with its global partners based on shared interests in innovation, trade, technical cooperation and respect for democratic values. Wu said the U.S. is an important supporter of Taiwan, with Washington set to continue its arms sales, high-level exchanges, trade and economic cooperation with Taiwan. The U.S. sees Taiwan as part of a broader strategic framework to keep the Indo-Pacific safe from China's threats, he said, adding that the two sides are also in discussions about supply chain issues, especially in the semiconductor sector. Taiwan keeps a watchful eye on China's multiple threat strategies and remains prepared for any possible situations, Wu said, adding that the people will not waver in their resolution to defend their democratic institutions. A confrontation in the Taiwan Strait would impact the entire world, and China would pay a costly price for invading Taiwan, the deputy minister said. Wu also said the EU is aware of the risk of its economic reliance on China and is taking a tougher stance against Beijing, while countries like Lithuania, Czechia and Slovakia have publicly voiced support for Taiwan despite pressure from Beijing. At a time when Europe looks to ensure the security of its supply chains, the deputy minister said Taiwan is leveraging the strategic asset of its semiconductor prowess to expand investment in Europe. The country is also enhancing cooperation and exchanges with France in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and energy transitions, Wu added.

MOEA reveals ITRI’s advanced cooling solution for AI chips	The Ministry of Economic Affairs displayed the latest development in two-phase cooling technology for artificial intelligence chips Feb. 18 in Taipei City, highlighting government efforts to advance high-performance computing. Developed by Hsinchu County-based Industrial Technology Research Institute in northern Taiwan, the technology removes heat through rapid evaporation and condensation of a dielectric liquid. The expanded contact area between the coolant and the chips also accelerates heat conduction to elevate computing efficacy and stability. According to the MOEA, the two-phase cooling innovation can boost AI chip cooling capacity beyond 1,500 watts, compared to 1,000 watts with current single-phase technology. The ITRI-developed system has successfully applied for field verification from the global integrated circuit design heavyweight Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., the ministry said, adding that if adopted by global data centers, the cooling solution could reduce annual carbon emissions by 50 million tons. The success is a result of a 2014 MOEA project that encourages advanced industrial technology development, the ministry said. ITRI also receives support enabling it to work with enterprises such as New Taipei City-headquartered Aewin Technologies Co., Ltd. and Giga-Byte Technology Co., Ltd. to establish a complete supply chain pertinent to heat dissipation in order to drive growth in the country's AI sector. Such cooling technology further solidifies Taiwan's leadership in the global AI industry, the MOEA said, adding that the breakthrough will also create a sustainable computing environment while consolidating the country's key role in international green energy development.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Ukrainian media	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu called on the global community to stand with Taiwan to ensure global supply chain stability and international security integrity. Wu made the remarks during an interview with Tim Mak, founder of Kyiv-based publication Counteroffensive, for an article published Feb. 15 on military technology in Taiwan. Citing remarks by President Lai Ching-te, the Counteroffensive article said Taiwan aspires to become the Asian hub of drone supply chains for global democracies. Based on observations of the Russia-Ukraine war, Taiwan is developing affordable unmanned aerial vehicles, which are expected to play a key role in global confrontations. The article also said that since the late 20th century, the free world has taken the view that welcoming China and Russia into the flow of international trade would have a democratizing effect. Wu said the war has proven that such thinking is naive. The deputy minister said the appropriate strategic response should be to try to separate the so-called &ldquo;red supply chain&rdquo; and the democratic supply chain, adding that Taiwan's prowess in electronics manufacturing and semiconductor technology make it a key player in this regard. Through global supply chain restructuring, the country wants to ensure that local semiconductor technologies will not fall into the hands of Russia or other authoritarian regimes, Wu said, adding that an additional priority is the enhancement of Taiwan's self-defense. According to Counteroffensive, Taiwan is making progress in developing drones and asymmetrical tactics with its rich scientific knowledge. Wu called on the free world to include Taiwan in the global security network as a means to ensure regional and global peace and stability.
