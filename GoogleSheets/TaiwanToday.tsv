NDC builds Bridge program with outreach in Japan	Minister Liu Chin-ching of the National Development Council tours Japan to promote a bridge program to help startups from Taiwan reach out to the world and create a global ecosystem for innovation. The Executive Yuan's National Development Fund and the Kyoto University Innovation Capital Co., Ltd. set the initiative in motion with a memorandum of understanding Sept. 13 in Kyoto. Witnessed by Liu and Kyoto University President Nagahiro Minato, the pact will boost mutual investment to cultivate a larger talent pool in deep tech, a field that encompasses quantum technology, robotics and semiconductors, among others. Following the event, the NDC and Tokyo Metropolitan Government cooperated to hold a Taiwan-Japan startup summit Sept. 17 at Tokyo Innovation Base.

MOENV delegation on carbon trading visits EU	Minister of Environment Peng Chi-ming, accompanied by Taiwan Representative to the European Union and Belgium, Roy Chun Lee, led a delegation from the Climate Change Administration to the EU to conduct exchange on air quality governance, carbon emission trading, chemical substance management, circular economy, climate change and the Global Plastic Treaty, sharing Taiwan's specific practices to implement carbon reduction. Peng briefed high level EU officials on Taiwan's current progress, including trial implementation of carbon fees starting in August this year and full enactment in 2025. It also plans to launch full cap control and emissions trading within four years. The Emission Trading System (ETS) established by the EU in 2005 is the most mature in the world with many stakeholders and plays a role in diplomacy, and thus can serve as a useful reference for Taiwan. Exchanges with high-level officials covered emission monitoring plans, inventory, inspection, total volume settings, emission quota allocations and auction, trading market structure and emission quota payments. The MOENV plans a further delegation to Europe in 2025, drawn from academia, environmental organizations and industries to gain insight into carbon pricing to complete Taiwan's regulations and facilitate follow-up legal implementation. The EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) is a tariff that targets carbon leakage in offshore production of imported goods to the bloc's 27 member nations. It is currently in its transitional phase (2023-2026) with only selected industries including cement, iron, steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity and hydrogen subject to the tariff. After 2026 all imported goods will be subject to the tariff and Taiwan's metal fastener, steel and aluminum industries are mainly affected. In the transition period domestic industry has completed declarations with government guidance. After the EU CBAM is fully implemented, domestic carbon pricing will need to integrate with the EU and the MOENV stated that this visit determined through face-to-face discussion that Taiwan carbon fees can be deducted from EU CBAM certificates and detailed regulations for the deduction will be announced in mid-2025. Due to the complexity of CBAM regulations, the MOENV will assign full-time personnel to the EU early next year to keep abreast of the latest developments and participate in negotiations to assist response by domestic industries. Peng said the visit had established a robust communication channel that has given Taiwan more confidence and better understanding in the development of carbon pricing and the carbon fee first system, especially as domestic enterprises are very concerned about CBAM. The EU has also gained a clearer view of Taiwan&#39;s ambitions in climate change efforts as an important global technology supply chain.

Foreign Minister Lin receives German Bundestag delegation	Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung received Michael M&uuml;ller and Andreas Larem, both members of the German Bundestag, Sept. 16 in Taipei City, pledging to continue working with Taiwan's democratic partners to counteract authoritarianism. Both parliamentarians are members of the Social Democratic Party and serve on the Bundestag Committee on Foreign Affairs. This is their first visit to Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. According to Lin, as authoritarian regimes including China continue to challenge rules-based international order, democracies around the world need to stand in unity to strengthen their economic and social resilience. Taiwan is willing to share with European partners its experiences in combating China's hybrid tactics, misinformation campaigns and economic coercion, he said. The minister commended the recent crossing of the Taiwan Strait by German naval vessels to defend freedom of navigation and welcomed the de-risk policy of the EU and the EU member state. He also praised the recent investment by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. in Dresden as a milestone in the two-way relations, anticipating the two sides will continue expanding their trade and economic partnership. In response, M&uuml;ller and Larem both stressed the importance of unity among democracies against authoritarian expansion. It is important for members of the free world to enhance cooperation in their economies, technology and culture to build resilience, they added. Later the same day, the two parliamentarians attended a lunch hosted by Deputy Foreign Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu. The deputy minister cautioned that China's aggression is not only a cross-strait issue but a severe challenge to rules-based international order. He said Taiwan looks forward to collaborating further with its European partners to ensure peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.

MOFA thanks US for latest arms sale	The U.S. government's approval of an arms sale with a total value of US$228 million is sincerely welcomed by the government and people of Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Sept. 17. Initiated at the behest of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., the deal includes the return, repair and reshipment of spare aircraft parts and related equipment, the ministry said. The move demonstrates the U.S. government's strong support for Taiwan's self-defense capabilities and underscores the importance Washington attaches to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, it added. According to the MOFA, this is the 16th arms sale announced by U.S. President Joe Biden's administration and reflects a policy of normalizing such deals with Taiwan. The decision also shows Washington's long-standing rock-solid commitment to Taiwan's security under the Taiwan Relations Act and Six Assurances. Amid China's frequent use of gray zone tactics to harass and coerce countries in the region, Taiwan is fully committed to enhancing its self-defense and asymmetric combat capabilities in order to safeguard its freedom and democratic way of life. The government will continue working with the U.S. to deepen security partnership, protect the rules-based international order, and promote peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, the MOFA added. The Presidential Office and Ministry of National Defense also issued statements welcoming the development, with the PO thanking Washington for its continuous support and expansion of Taiwan-U.S. partnership and the MND anticipating that the deal will ensure an ample supply of maintenance components for the air force.

MOFA thanks Lithuania, Netherlands, US and UK for supporting Taiwan	Recent actions and statements backing Taiwan by Lithuania, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the U.S. are sincerely appreciated by the government and people, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Dutch House of Representatives passed a resolution Sept. 12 recognizing that U.N. Resolution 2758 neither grants the People's Republic of China sovereignty over Taiwan nor negates Taiwan's right to participate in the U.N. and other international organizations, the MOFA said, adding that the move is particularly significant in light of the ongoing 79th session of the U.N. General Assembly. The Netherlands has become the first European country and second in the world to pass similar decrees following the Australian Senate's Aug. 22 passage of a motion supporting Taiwan's sovereignty and participation in global bodies, the ministry said. The resolution was preceded by the Dutch House's passage of a motion promoting Taiwan's international involvement in April and another in May urging its government to join the European Union and other like-minded partners in voicing disapproval of China's military exercises around Taiwan, the MOFA added. Equally welcomed is the joint statement released Sept. 14 following the first U.K.-U.S. Strategic Dialogue that took place Sept. 10 in London, the ministry said. The two sides reiterated the indispensability of Taiwan Strait stability to the security and prosperity of the international community and called for the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues. The MOFA also expressed appreciation for a joint statement issued after the Lithuania-U.S. Strategic Dialogue Sept. 12 in Vilnius, in which the two countries encouraged the establishment of a robust economic partnership between Taiwan and Lithuania and backed Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. Taiwan will continue to work with like-minded countries to defend the rules-based international order and preserve democracy, peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.

Deputy Foreign Minister Tien outlines Taiwan’s UN79 campaign	Ahead of the opening of the United Nations&#39; 79th General Assembly Sept. 10 in New York City, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Chung-kwang held a press event Sept. 3 in Taipei City to detail Taiwan's annual U.N. campaign. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the theme of the U.N.G.A. general debate, set to kick off Sept. 24, is &ldquo;Leaving No One Behind: Acting Together for the Advancement of Peace, Sustainable Development and Human Dignity for Present and Future Generations.&rdquo; Ironically, Taiwan's 23.5 million people are still excluded from the global organization, it said. The deputy minister said China's distortion of U.N.G.A. Resolution 2758 continues to pose serious threats to the Taiwan Strait status quo and peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Tien urged the U.N. to take proactive action to address the issue. Since the resolution does not exclude Taiwan's U.N. participation, Tien called on the global organization to seek proper arrangements for Taiwan to take part in its activities, meetings and mechanisms, so that Taiwan can contribute to fulfilling U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. Tien also said the U.N. Secretariat should adopt a neutral position and stop misusing the resolution to deprive the rights of Taiwan people and media to visit the U.N., take part in or cover its activities and meetings. To canvass more global support for Taiwan, Tien said the government will continue to appeal to its allies' permanent U.N. representatives to send joint letters to U.N. Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres and speak for Taiwan at related U.N. events. Equally importantly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung penned an article that has been published in various international mainstream media, highlighting how Taiwan's U.N. inclusion could secure peace in the Indo-Pacific. A short film entitled &ldquo;IC You&rdquo; was launched the same day to showcase Taiwan's technology and semiconductor manufacturing prowess, emphasizing the country's key role in global development. A number of sideline events will also be staged during the 79th assembly elucidating the case for Taiwan's U.N. participation, the ministry said.

Taiwan, Arizona ink MOU on industrial cooperation	Taiwan concluded a memorandum of understanding on industrial cooperation with the U.S. state of Arizona Sept. 2 in Taipei City, spotlighting their joint commitment to further cementing the bilateral partnership, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said. The accord was signed by Jeff Lin, CEO of the ministry's Taiwan-USA Industrial Cooperation Promotion Office, and Steve Hsu, representative of the Arizona-Taiwan Trade and Investment Office. The event was witnessed by Chen Pei-li, deputy director general of the MOEA's Industrial Development Administration, and Sandra Watson, president and CEO of Arizona Commerce Authority. Under the pact, the two sides will deepen unmanned aerial vehicle and semiconductor collaboration while boosting high-tech personnel exchanges. According to Chen, Taiwan and the U.S. should work together to build a supply chain free from China's influence for the sake of both sides' national security, as Beijing accounts for 60-70 percent of the global commercial drone market. The government provides subsidies for developing critical UAV components, including parts used in communications, flight control and artificial intelligence image recognition, she said, adding that the country also established the Asia UAV AI Innovation Application R&amp;D Center in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County to integrate resources from over 30 manufacturers. Equally important is strengthening the two sides' semiconductor equipment cooperation, which will lay the foundation for chip production, Chen said. She added that Taiwan has a proven track record in cultivating semiconductor personnel and that more exchanges and training are expected to further expand the joint talent pool. In response, Watson said her delegation includes representatives from prestigious schools such as Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University, adding that they will meet with counterparts from Industrial Technology Research Institute and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University during their visit. Lin additionally extolled the two sides' growing ties, as evidenced by the establishment of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s Arizona operations, and noted that ITRI's North America branch and the Chiayi UAV center inked an MOU on resource sharing in April. Hsu said Taiwan and Arizona share similar economic goals and industrial strengths, adding that the latest MOU demonstrates their solid alliance and common visions.

MOI stages symposium on environmentally conscious architecture	A forum on natural carbon sinks and low-carbon architecture was held by the Ministry of the Interior at National Chung Hsing University Sept. 2 in the central city of Taichung as part of ongoing government efforts to achieve net-zero emissions. In her opening remarks, MOI Minister Liu Shyh-fang said challenges to achieving Taiwan's policy goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 remain. The one-day event aimed to facilitate communication between the government, general public and business sector in order to address climate change mitigation issues, she added. According to Liu, national parks, wetlands and coastal areas, which all fall within the scope of the MOI, play a key role in capturing carbon dioxide. These areas are home to blue carbon ecosystems like tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrass meadows that are essential for carbon sequestration. Statistics show that the country's national parks are responsible for removing over 2 million tons of carbon emission equivalents (CO2e), the minister said, adding that blue carbon ecosystems account for 95,000 tons of CO2e. Based on satellite imagery, the MOI estimates a carbon sink loss of 3,821 tons of CO2e in Taroko National Park as a result of April's magnitude 7.4 earthquake in eastern Taiwan, she said, vowing that the MOI will step up efforts at other national parks and wetlands to make up the loss. Liu said low-carbon architecture is being promoted throughout the country and the MOI is making sure that social housing projects are certified as both green and smart buildings. She expects a total of 250,000 such housing units to reduce 112,300 tons of CO2e per year by 2032, with all other new public buildings set to achieve level 1 energy-efficiency standards by 2026.
