National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee holds inaugural meeting	President Lai Ching-te presided over the inaugural meeting of the National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee Sept. 26 in Taipei City, underscoring the government's commitment to enhancing civilian emergency preparedness. Delivering the opening remarks, Lai said climate change, large-scale natural disasters and authoritarian expansion pose challenges for both the country and the international community, adding that a more resilient Taiwan would make greater contributions to global democracy, peace and prosperity. The president highlighted three areas of focus to strengthen the country's response capabilities and expand government-civilian cooperation. The first is to prepare for worst-case scenarios. Comprehensive and proactive measures are essential for ensuring rapid reaction time and normal societal function in times of emergency, Lai said. Second, ordinary citizens should receive response and mobilization training to increase stockpiles of critical supplies and safeguard the operation of vital infrastructure, including the electric grid; finance, information security and transportation networks; and medical and evacuation facilities, the president added. Finally, the central and local governments must reinforce collaboration with civil organizations to identify problem areas and develop strategies to address them, Lai said. In selecting committee members, the government has taken background, experience, specialty, age and gender into careful consideration, the president said, adding that a diverse body will be better able to tackle the complexity of the task. Lai concluded by conveying confidence that robust determination and preparedness will deepen Taiwan's cooperation with like-minded partners in facing domestic and international concerns. The National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee is one of three advisory groups announced by the president in June. The other two are the National Climate Change Committee and the Healthy Taiwan Promotion Committee.

MOENV promotes plastic reduction at Taipei baseball game	Deputy Minister Shen Chih-hsiu took part in a baseball game Sept. 26 in Taipei City to promote the government's plastic reduction campaign, the Ministry of Environment said. According to the MOENV, Shen threw the first pitch to start the Chinese Professional Baseball League game between the Wei Chuan Dragons and Uni-President Lions. Taiwan swimmer and Olympian Wang Kuan-hung, who is the ministry's recycling ambassador, was also present at the ceremony. Shen said the fifth session of the U.N. Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee will take place in late November this year in Busan, South Korea to address plastic pollution, showing that plastic reduction has attained global consensus. As a responsible international community member, Taiwan needs to be part of the worldwide trend. To this end, the MOENV launched a program in July 2022 to offer a NT$5 discount to consumers who bring their own cups to purchase beverages at retail outlets and also implemented a ban earlier this month on single-use plastic cups at beverage shops nationwide. Shen said the initiatives are expected to cut the use of 790 million disposable cups a year. Shen said other similar projects are in the pipeline, including encouraging the public to bring reusable bags or totes for grocery shopping, and a ban on disposable toiletries and bottled water at hotels starting Jan. 1, 2025. These measures will lead to the use of 65 million fewer plastic bags and the reduction of 2,000 tons of plastics. The deputy minister urged participants to be responsible consumers by bringing their own bottles or borrowing reusable cups when attending baseball games and other events. The game also offered environmentally conscious fans free drinks and beverage discounts.

MODA stages forum on submarine cable, internet data center development	Bolstering development of the submarine communication cable and internet data center sectors was the theme of a forum held by the Ministry of Digital Affairs Sept. 26 in Taipei City to promote Taiwan's digital resilience. Jointly organized with the state-sponsored Telecom Technology Center based in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, the one-day event focused on development strategies for the two sectors in Taiwan, the analysis of potential risks faced by local supply chain players and the sharing of security assessments and related guidance. The event involved local experts and officials, as well as their counterparts from Australia and Japan. Those in attendance included Chiueh Her-ming, deputy minister at MODA; Chiu Wei-chen, deputy executive secretary of the Office of Science and Technology Policy under the National Science and Technology Council; and Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association Deputy Representative Takashi Hattori. Participants discussed the risks associated with development in the two sectors from legal and geopolitical perspectives, analyzed standard procedures to ensure the security of Taiwan's submarine cables and data cloud centers; and reviewed measures to respond to and manage incidents at such facilities. According to the MODA, over 95 percent of international communication is conducted through 436 submarine cables around the world. As an island, Taiwan especially relies on such cables to communicate with its offshore counties and townships, as well as its global partners, the ministry added. The MODA said the country's geographic location and technological prowess set it in good stead as a potential global submarine cable hub, adding that high-tech powerhouses Google LLC and Microsoft Corp. have set up data centers in the country. Given the threats of natural disasters and geopolitical concerns, however, local firms also need to ensure effective emergency preparedness, the ministry said. The forum served as a platform to exchange views on global trends and share experiences to address related challenges, in order to strengthen the security and reliability of local infrastructure, and boost investors' confidence in Taiwan, the MODA said.

President Lai addresses Concordia Annual Summit	President Lai Ching-te spoke to attendees of the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit via a recorded video message, pledging to build a stronger Taiwan while expressing his hope that democracies will jointly counter authoritarian aggression. Democracy around the world faces threats such as authoritarian expansion, Lai said, citing Russia's invasion of Ukraine and adding China's intensifying military intimidation in the Taiwan Strait and the East and South China Seas as examples. He specifically noted China's use of gray zone tactics, in addition to lawfare and the misrepresentation of history, to expand its power. Democratic Taiwan and authoritarian China are not subordinate to each other, Lai stressed during his explanation of Beijing's distortion of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758. The president also thanked the U.S. and the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China for opposing Beijing's misinterpretations and welcomed more countries to join in support of democracy worldwide. He went on to say that Taiwan's four pillars of peace are a plan to maintain the cross-strait peace and stability, adding that the country is committed to strengthening national defense, building economic security, deepening partnerships with democratic countries, and ensuring stable and principled cross-strait leadership. Alexander Tah-ray Yui, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., also attended the event, holding a dialogue with Keith Krach, former U.S. undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment. Their discussion focused on Taiwan's democratic resolve and ways to shape global security and peace through strategic cooperation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait is key to global economic growth and prosperity, Yui said. Taiwan is an indispensable partner in sustainable supply chains as it provides over 90 percent of global advanced semiconductor products, he added, calling on the international community to squarely face the country's improper exclusion from the U.N.'s specialized agencies and global organizations, and to incorporate its expertise and contributions into the process of sustainable international development. According to the Presidential Office, the summit was organized by New York-based nonprofit organization Concordia on the sidelines of the ongoing 79th U.N. General Assembly. Dignitaries giving speeches at the event included President Santiago Pe&ntilde;a Palacios of Paraguay and Theresa May, former prime minister of the U.K. (YCH-E) Write to Taiwan Today at ttonline@mofa.gov.tw	https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&post=259283	2024-09-26T00:00:00-07:00

President Lai vows to strengthen civil defense in Taiwan	President Lai Ching-te said Sept. 24 that Taiwan is committed to enhancing civil defense capabilities so that its people have the knowledge and skills needed to protect themselves and their beloved country. Lai made the remarks while participating in a civil defense training organized by Academia Formosana in the central county of Nantou. Authorities and organizations at all levels are working to advance civil defense and natural disaster response, as evidenced by drills held on the National Disaster Prevention Day Sept. 21, Lai said. He further praised the AF-formulated plans to reduce potential casualties and property damage during disasters and conflict. Lai went on to reiterate his missions as president, noting that safeguarding the country's sovereignty is a top priority. He added that the ROC (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other, and that the future of Taiwan can only be decided by its 23 million people. Ensuring the safety of the country's people is equally important, Lai said, citing the country's enhanced national defense capabilities since former President Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016. His third mission is to boost the country's economy, Lai said.

Taiwan stages APEC chemical hazard training program	The Training Program on Capacity Building for Chemical Emergency Preparedness under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation opened Sept. 23 in Kaohsiung City, to ensure a swift response to chemical incidents, reduce environmental impact and enhance human safety. Organized by the Ministry of Environment, the six-day event involves 25 representatives from eight APEC member economies including Malaysia, Peru, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, as well as non-member countries such as France and Poland. During his opening remarks, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said accelerating economic and trade development has led to an increase in the production and transportation of chemical substances. Thus, there is also an increase in the number of cross-border accidents involving those substances and a concomitant impact on economic stability, environmental sustainability and human safety, he added. Peng said scenario training helps APEC member economies enhance capabilities in key issues such as hazard identification, on-site detection and incident response. The government is looking forward to sharing experience and expertise in managing hazardous chemical substances with its partner countries and helping to create an effective response mechanism in the region, the minister added. According to the MOENV Chemicals Administration, the training program was proposed by Taiwan this year during the APEC Chemical Dialogue. It is taking place at the Southern Emergency Response Training Center for Toxic Substances, a globally recognized training facility, located inside National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology in southern Taiwan.

MOI Deputy Minister lauds national efforts to tackle starfish overpopulation	Deputy Minister of the Interior Tung Chien-hung praised public and private efforts to tackle the overpopulation of the crown-of-thorns starfish, underscoring Taiwan's commitment to marine conservation, the Ministry of the Interior said Sept. 19. Tung expressed his recognition while visiting Dongsha Atoll National Park, Taiwan's first marine national park and the largest protected marine area in the country. According to the MOI, after detecting the issue earlier this year, the ministry's National Park Service invited experts from the Cabinet-level Ocean Affairs Council, Academia Sinica and other organizations to form a volunteer task force to monitor and control the species in waters surrounding the Dongsha Islands and other risk areas. The first group deployed Aug. 23 and returned Aug. 29, the ministry said, adding that a total of 11,044 crown-of-thorns starfish have been removed as of Sept. 13. Tung thanked the volunteers for their hard work, which is essential in reducing the impact on coral, the starfish's food source. The seagrass bed around the Dongsha Islands is a natural carbon sink and forms a critical part of a blue carbon ecosystem that provides a habitat to sea creatures like the sicklefin lemon shark, he said, urging the NPS' Marine National Park Headquarters to continue striving to protect Taiwan's rich sea assets. The deputy minister took the opportunity to compliment the DANP's efforts to desalinate seawater using newly designed wells to prevent seaweed debris from damaging water pumping equipment. The park has also collaborated with the local government to establish a sustainable water circulation system in which wastewater is injected into groundwater after treatment, providing a friendly environment for migratory birds and contributing to biodiversity, he added. Tung further expressed appreciation to the OAC's Coast Guard Administration for protecting the national park amid ship groundings and oil spills, as well as driving away unauthorized foreign vessels.

MOFA thanks allies and like-minded nations for UN inclusion support	The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell's reiteration of his country's long-standing support of stability in the Taiwan Strait together with backing from ten allies for Taiwan's inclusion in the United Nations, are sincerely welcomed by the government and people of Taiwan, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sept. 20. During a Sept. 18 congressional hearing, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell voiced his disapproval of China's distortion and misuse of U.N. Resolution 2758 to suppress Taiwan and deny its legitimacy, the MOFA said. It added that it appreciated Campbell's remarks, which followed similar sentiments voiced for Taiwan from Mark Lambert, State Department China coordinator and deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs, and Daniel Kritenbrink, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. In addition, nine of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, including Belize, Eswatini, Guatemala, Palau, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and Grenadines, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands' permanent representatives to the UN also submitted a joint letter to U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, in which they strongly refuted China's distortion and misuse of U.N. Resolution 2758. Another diplomatic ally, Paraguay, sent a letter independently to convey support for Taiwan's participation in the international body. The MOFA also reported that recently both Australia and the Netherlands passed resolutions or motions which voiced a consensus that U.N. Resolution 2758 does not specifically mention Taiwan. It called on the international community to jointly oppose China's misinterpretation of the resolution by taking substantive action, adding that Taiwan would continue to work with like-minded countries to safeguard the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region.

Taiwan, EU partners join forces to promote sustainable ocean governance	The Ministries of Environment and Foreign Affairs teamed up with the European Economic and Trade Office and EU member states' offices in Taiwan to hold the annual beach cleanup Sept. 21 in New Taipei City in observance of International Coastal Cleanup Day and World Cleanup Day. According to the MOENV, the event involved around 170 participants, including MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming, Deputy Foreign Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu, EETO Head Lutz G&uuml;llner and other officials from EU partner countries stationed in Taiwan. They collected a total of 464 kilograms of waste at the Bali Beiti Beach. Peng said Taiwan and the EU are solid economic and trade partners with many shared values. The annual event reflects the commitment of the two sides to promoting the health of Taiwan's coastal areas while calling attention to the daunting challenges associated with climate change, he added. The minister said that since the government launched the Salute to the Seas project, the coastal waste dropped by 60 percent from 2,294 tons in 2019 to 940 tons in 2023 before reaching a new low of 686 tons as of the third quarter this year. An additional NT$5.9 billion (US$189 million) has been earmarked for the second phase of the project to be carried out by 15 agencies under nine councils and ministries, Peng added. One key development is the ban on single-use plastic cups at beverage shops that came into effect this month, Peng said, adding that the measure will lead to a reduction of 790 million disposable plastic cups each year. Echoing Peng's remarks, G&uuml;llner said the EU invests 350 million euros each year in marine protection and is proud to organize beach cleanup activities around the world, including its involvement in the Taiwan event for the sixth year. He welcomed Taiwan's efforts to restrict plastic use and emphasized that the EU will continue to work with global partners to promote sustainable ocean governance.

Taiwan International Human Rights Film Festival begins in Taipei	The National Museum of Human Rights kicked off the 2024 Taiwan International Human Rights Film Festival Sept. 19 in Taipei City, highlighting the government's dedication to advancing justice. According to the NHRM, this year's event features 10 films from around the world that address themes of bullying and historical justice, among others.

Taiwan sets goal of enhancing talent competitiveness	Premier Cho Jung-tai said the government is intent on bolstering the competitiveness of Taiwan's professionals and expanding global recruitment to fulfill President Lai Ching-te's vision of powering economic growth through innovation. Cho made the remarks during a briefing by the National Development Council on its project to enhance national talent competitiveness. The initiative aims to cultivate 450,000 professionals in the artificial intelligence, semiconductor, and net-zero and green sectors by 2028, as well as recruit 120,000 professionals and 80,000 technicians from abroad. According to the premier, talented individuals form the backbone of a country and are key to economic and industrial development. Given the challenges stemming from AI and digital transformation, he said the government needs to step up investment in talent cultivation to create an innovation-driven economic model, so that Taiwan can continue to play a key role in promoting global prosperity. The NDC initiative aims to achieve its policy goals through six strategies: cultivating talent in key industries; fostering digital skills with a solid foundation in humanities and social sciences; promoting reciprocal exchanges of international students; recruiting foreign professionals in key industries; building a complete talent retention ecosystem; and improving the retention of intermediate-level skilled foreign workers.

NDC builds Bridge program with outreach in Japan	Minister Liu Chin-ching of the National Development Council tours Japan to promote a bridge program to help startups from Taiwan reach out to the world and create a global ecosystem for innovation. The Executive Yuan's National Development Fund and the Kyoto University Innovation Capital Co., Ltd. set the initiative in motion with a memorandum of understanding Sept. 13 in Kyoto. Witnessed by Liu and Kyoto University President Nagahiro Minato, the pact will boost mutual investment to cultivate a larger talent pool in deep tech, a field that encompasses quantum technology, robotics and semiconductors, among others.

MOENV delegation on carbon trading visits EU	Minister of Environment Peng Chi-ming, accompanied by Taiwan Representative to the European Union and Belgium, Roy Chun Lee, led a delegation from the Climate Change Administration to the EU to conduct exchange on air quality governance, carbon emission trading, chemical substance management, circular economy, climate change and the Global Plastic Treaty, sharing Taiwan's specific practices to implement carbon reduction. Peng briefed high level EU officials on Taiwan's current progress, including trial implementation of carbon fees starting in August this year and full enactment in 2025. It also plans to launch full cap control and emissions trading within four years. The Emission Trading System (ETS) established by the EU in 2005 is the most mature in the world with many stakeholders and plays a role in diplomacy, and thus can serve as a useful reference for Taiwan. Exchanges with high-level officials covered emission monitoring plans, inventory, inspection, total volume settings, emission quota allocations and auction, trading market structure and emission quota payments. The MOENV plans a further delegation to Europe in 2025, drawn from academia, environmental organizations and industries to gain insight into carbon pricing to complete Taiwan's regulations and facilitate follow-up legal implementation. The EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) is a tariff that targets carbon leakage in offshore production of imported goods to the bloc's 27 member nations. It is currently in its transitional phase (2023-2026) with only selected industries including cement, iron, steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity and hydrogen subject to the tariff. After 2026 all imported goods will be subject to the tariff and Taiwan's metal fastener, steel and aluminum industries are mainly affected. In the transition period domestic industry has completed declarations with government guidance. After the EU CBAM is fully implemented, domestic carbon pricing will need to integrate with the EU and the MOENV stated that this visit determined through face-to-face discussion that Taiwan carbon fees can be deducted from EU CBAM certificates and detailed regulations for the deduction will be announced in mid-2025. Due to the complexity of CBAM regulations, the MOENV will assign full-time personnel to the EU early next year to keep abreast of the latest developments and participate in negotiations to assist response by domestic industries. Peng said the visit had established a robust communication channel that has given Taiwan more confidence and better understanding in the development of carbon pricing and the carbon fee first system, especially as domestic enterprises are very concerned about CBAM. The EU has also gained a clearer view of Taiwan&#39;s ambitions in climate change efforts as an important global technology supply chain.

Foreign Minister Lin receives German Bundestag delegation	Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung received Michael M&uuml;ller and Andreas Larem, both members of the German Bundestag, Sept. 16 in Taipei City, pledging to continue working with Taiwan's democratic partners to counteract authoritarianism. Both parliamentarians are members of the Social Democratic Party and serve on the Bundestag Committee on Foreign Affairs. This is their first visit to Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. According to Lin, as authoritarian regimes including China continue to challenge rules-based international order, democracies around the world need to stand in unity to strengthen their economic and social resilience. Taiwan is willing to share with European partners its experiences in combating China's hybrid tactics, misinformation campaigns and economic coercion, he said. The minister commended the recent crossing of the Taiwan Strait by German naval vessels to defend freedom of navigation and welcomed the de-risk policy of the EU and the EU member state. He also praised the recent investment by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. in Dresden as a milestone in the two-way relations, anticipating the two sides will continue expanding their trade and economic partnership. In response, M&uuml;ller and Larem both stressed the importance of unity among democracies against authoritarian expansion. It is important for members of the free world to enhance cooperation in their economies, technology and culture to build resilience, they added. Later the same day, the two parliamentarians attended a lunch hosted by Deputy Foreign Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu. The deputy minister cautioned that China's aggression is not only a cross-strait issue but a severe challenge to rules-based international order. He said Taiwan looks forward to collaborating further with its European partners to ensure peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.

MOFA thanks US for latest arms sale	The U.S. government's approval of an arms sale with a total value of US$228 million is sincerely welcomed by the government and people of Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Sept. 17. Initiated at the behest of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., the deal includes the return, repair and reshipment of spare aircraft parts and related equipment, the ministry said. The move demonstrates the U.S. government's strong support for Taiwan's self-defense capabilities and underscores the importance Washington attaches to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, it added. According to the MOFA, this is the 16th arms sale announced by U.S. President Joe Biden's administration and reflects a policy of normalizing such deals with Taiwan. The decision also shows Washington's long-standing rock-solid commitment to Taiwan's security under the Taiwan Relations Act and Six Assurances. Amid China's frequent use of gray zone tactics to harass and coerce countries in the region, Taiwan is fully committed to enhancing its self-defense and asymmetric combat capabilities in order to safeguard its freedom and democratic way of life. The government will continue working with the U.S. to deepen security partnership, protect the rules-based international order, and promote peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, the MOFA added. The Presidential Office and Ministry of National Defense also issued statements welcoming the development, with the PO thanking Washington for its continuous support and expansion of Taiwan-U.S. partnership and the MND anticipating that the deal will ensure an ample supply of maintenance components for the air force.

MOFA thanks Lithuania, Netherlands, US and UK for supporting Taiwan	Recent actions and statements backing Taiwan by Lithuania, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the U.S. are sincerely appreciated by the government and people, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Dutch House of Representatives passed a resolution Sept. 12 recognizing that U.N. Resolution 2758 neither grants the People's Republic of China sovereignty over Taiwan nor negates Taiwan's right to participate in the U.N. and other international organizations, the MOFA said, adding that the move is particularly significant in light of the ongoing 79th session of the U.N. General Assembly. The Netherlands has become the first European country and second in the world to pass similar decrees following the Australian Senate's Aug. 22 passage of a motion supporting Taiwan's sovereignty and participation in global bodies, the ministry said. The resolution was preceded by the Dutch House's passage of a motion promoting Taiwan's international involvement in April and another in May urging its government to join the European Union and other like-minded partners in voicing disapproval of China's military exercises around Taiwan, the MOFA added. Equally welcomed is the joint statement released Sept. 14 following the first U.K.-U.S. Strategic Dialogue that took place Sept. 10 in London, the ministry said. The two sides reiterated the indispensability of Taiwan Strait stability to the security and prosperity of the international community and called for the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues.

MOI stages symposium on environmentally conscious architecture	A forum on natural carbon sinks and low-carbon architecture was held by the Ministry of the Interior at National Chung Hsing University Sept. 2 in the central city of Taichung as part of ongoing government efforts to achieve net-zero emissions. In her opening remarks, MOI Minister Liu Shyh-fang said challenges to achieving Taiwan's policy goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 remain. The one-day event aimed to facilitate communication between the government, general public and business sector in order to address climate change mitigation issues, she added. According to Liu, national parks, wetlands and coastal areas, which all fall within the scope of the MOI, play a key role in capturing carbon dioxide. These areas are home to blue carbon ecosystems like tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrass meadows that are essential for carbon sequestration. Statistics show that the country's national parks are responsible for removing over 2 million tons of carbon emission equivalents (CO2e), the minister said, adding that blue carbon ecosystems account for 95,000 tons of CO2e. Based on satellite imagery, the MOI estimates a carbon sink loss of 3,821 tons of CO2e in Taroko National Park as a result of April's magnitude 7.4 earthquake in eastern Taiwan, she said, vowing that the MOI will step up efforts at other national parks and wetlands to make up the loss. Liu said low-carbon architecture is being promoted throughout the country and the MOI is making sure that social housing projects are certified as both green and smart buildings. She expects a total of 250,000 such housing units to reduce 112,300 tons of CO2e per year by 2032, with all other new public buildings set to achieve level 1 energy-efficiency standards by 2026.
