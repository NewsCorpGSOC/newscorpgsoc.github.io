MOEA reveals ITRI’s advanced cooling solution for AI chips	The Ministry of Economic Affairs displayed the latest development in two-phase cooling technology for artificial intelligence chips Feb. 18 in Taipei City, highlighting government efforts to advance high-performance computing. Developed by Hsinchu County-based Industrial Technology Research Institute in northern Taiwan, the technology removes heat through rapid evaporation and condensation of a dielectric liquid. The expanded contact area between the coolant and the chips also accelerates heat conduction to elevate computing efficacy and stability. According to the MOEA, the two-phase cooling innovation can boost AI chip cooling capacity beyond 1,500 watts, compared to 1,000 watts with current single-phase technology. The ITRI-developed system has successfully applied for field verification from the global integrated circuit design heavyweight Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., the ministry said, adding that if adopted by global data centers, the cooling solution could reduce annual carbon emissions by 50 million tons. The success is a result of a 2014 MOEA project that encourages advanced industrial technology development, the ministry said. ITRI also receives support enabling it to work with enterprises such as New Taipei City-headquartered Aewin Technologies Co., Ltd. and Giga-Byte Technology Co., Ltd. to establish a complete supply chain pertinent to heat dissipation in order to drive growth in the country's AI sector. Such cooling technology further solidifies Taiwan's leadership in the global AI industry, the MOEA said, adding that the breakthrough will also create a sustainable computing environment while consolidating the country's key role in international green energy development.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Ukrainian media	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu called on the global community to stand with Taiwan to ensure global supply chain stability and international security integrity. Wu made the remarks during an interview with Tim Mak, founder of Kyiv-based publication Counteroffensive, for an article published Feb. 15 on military technology in Taiwan. Citing remarks by President Lai Ching-te, the Counteroffensive article said Taiwan aspires to become the Asian hub of drone supply chains for global democracies. Based on observations of the Russia-Ukraine war, Taiwan is developing affordable unmanned aerial vehicles, which are expected to play a key role in global confrontations. The article also said that since the late 20th century, the free world has taken the view that welcoming China and Russia into the flow of international trade would have a democratizing effect. Wu said the war has proven that such thinking is naive. The deputy minister said the appropriate strategic response should be to try to separate the so-called &ldquo;red supply chain&rdquo; and the democratic supply chain, adding that Taiwan's prowess in electronics manufacturing and semiconductor technology make it a key player in this regard. Through global supply chain restructuring, the country wants to ensure that local semiconductor technologies will not fall into the hands of Russia or other authoritarian regimes, Wu said, adding that an additional priority is the enhancement of Taiwan's self-defense. According to Counteroffensive, Taiwan is making progress in developing drones and asymmetrical tactics with its rich scientific knowledge. Wu called on the free world to include Taiwan in the global security network as a means to ensure regional and global peace and stability.

NHRM holds lectures on human rights during TIBE	The National Human Rights Museum staged four lectures Feb. 8-9 at Taipei International Book Exhibition in the capital, underscoring the facility's commitment to deepening education on civil liberties, according to the Ministry of Culture. The talks spanned literature creation, picture book publication, and TV and film production, the MOC said. The NHRM's display of research, publications and cultural products at its pavilion aimed to deepen the public's insight into human rights issues, it added. In one of the Feb. 8 lectures, Paiwan writer Liglav A-wu shared her process of portraying Taiwan's White Terror period through an Indigenous lens while serving as an artist in residence at NHRM. Since extant political files are not categorized by ethnic group, she painstakingly tracked down affected individuals from local tribes. A-wu noted that the interviews demonstrated the profound impact authoritarian rule had on native groups, adding that she hopes her work will help Indigenous people learn more about their history. Additionally, illustrator Cincin Chang expounded on her new book &ldquo;Giraffe President,&rdquo; which probes causes of collective trauma and strives to resolve intergenerational conflict. In the work, Chang explores how authoritarianism arises and becomes accepted by society. In response to an audience question on educating children, she emphasized the importance of media literacy, the MOC said. During a Feb. 9 event hosted by poet Hong Hong, fellow poets Hsiang Yang and Chen Yun-yuan introduced a selection of 180 poems on the White Terror period that are set to be published in the second half of the year. Hsiang said that how writers reflect social pain is of great significance, while Chen remarked that compared to prose and fiction, poetry is a better medium to portray subtle but omnipresent agony and violence of the era, the ministry concluded. The White Terror refers to a period from 1949 to 1992, during which the government declared martial law and suppressed and prosecuted political dissidents.

New stamp collection pays tribute to artistic pioneers	A set of stamps featuring the works of four 20th century painters will be released Feb. 12 to showcase Taiwan's achievements in fine arts, according to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Chunghwa Post Co. Ltd. According to Chunghwa Post, this year's collection features works held at the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts based in central Taiwan's Taichung City.

Chen Cheng-po's 1935 oil painting &ldquo;Tamsui Landscape (Tamsui)&rdquo; depicts the small historic town in what is now New Taipei City during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945). The artist created a rich sense of spatial depth by layering in buildings on a hillside, roofs of varied heights and winding paths. &ldquo;Yehliu Scenery,&rdquo; an oil painting completed in 1969 by Chen Hui-kun, features a striking contrast between the yellow-brown rock formations and the deep blue water. The contours of the rocks and coastline are smoothly outlined in dark brown, while the sky is rendered with lighter blues and white to evoke the vastness of the seascape. Another stamp shows &ldquo;A Sea of Clouds at Alishan&rdquo; by Liao Chi-chun. The 1953 oil painting's layers of soft pink clouds drift toward a distant horizon, while trees and other greenery in the foreground provide a lush resting place for the eye. &ldquo;Mt. Jade Covered in Snow,&rdquo; a watercolor and ink work on paper completed in 1989 by Ma Pai-sui, consists of 14 individual small paintings that stand alone as complete works. When assembled, they form a single large composition that gives the effect of viewing the magnificent mountain through a window.

Taiwan to raise national computing power	The National Science and Technology Council is building a high-speed computer system to drive research and development of generative artificial intelligence and related business applications in Taiwan, according to the Executive Yuan. After a briefing from the NSTC at the EY Feb. 6 in Taipei City, Premier Cho Jung-tai said computing power plays a key role in promoting industrial digital transformation, personnel cultivation and economic growth. To fulfill President Lai Ching-te's vision of building Taiwan into an AI nation, it is imperative to develop sovereign AI and a complete digital ecosystem, he added. To achieve this policy goal, Cho said the development of high-speed computers, data centers and cloud service platforms, among other digital infrastructure, is to be prioritized. In particular, the premier said government focus will be on creating computing structures more suitable for large language model services and applications development. This will secure Taiwan's global competitiveness and key strategic position while helping create more job opportunities in the process, bolstering prosperity and benefiting domestic small and medium-sized enterprises and startups for more balanced regional development, he added. It is also important to engage the private sector to promote AI and introduce it to all aspects of the business sector, Cho said. This will ensure inclusive and sustainable growth of the digital economy, so that AI innovations can benefit all segments of society, the premier added. According to the NSTC, Taiwan ranked 11th in the world in terms of computing power based on the data released by Top500 project in November 2024. The initiative to create a New Silicon Valley in southern Taiwan unveiled by the Executive Yuan earlier this year will play a key role in bolstering Taiwan's computing capabilities, the NSTC said.

Hakka Bombing of the Dragon underway in Miaoli	The Hakka tradition known as Bombing of the Dragon is being held at the Yuqing Temple in northern Taiwan's Miaoli County, the Hakka Affairs Council said Feb. 6. According to HAC Deputy Minister Fan Tso-ming, there are four well-known events around Taiwan to celebrate the Lantern Festival. He said participating in activities like the Bombing of the Dragon, especially in central Taiwan and as it is the first Hakka celebration after the Lunar New Year, helps sustain Hakka communities' economic development. Fan joined other guests to dot the eyes of 13 dragon models, the HAC said, further expressing the wish for the central and local governments to continue to work together to promote Hakka culture. The Bombing of the Dragon in Miaoli originates from dragon dances, according to the Ministry of the Interior. Traditionally, after worshipping ancestors and before leaving home again for work at the time of the Lantern Festival, Hakka people pray to be immune from disaster and for abundant harvest in the new year, and the activities around the dragon are part of this desire, the HAC said. Activities around the dragon are divided into six stages: first the making of the dragon before the Lunar New Year. Then on the ninth day of the first lunar month, the dragon has its eyes dotted with pupils in a ceremony to symbolize the divine spirit entering the mythical beast to bless the people and start the festival. The final four stages take place on the day of the Lantern Festival, namely welcoming, walking with and throwing fireworks at the dragon, and then the return of the dragon to the heavens. The Bombing of the Dragon was launched in 1998 in Miaoli, and this year will be held from Feb. 6 through Feb. 14, the HAC added.

Taiwan campus redesign projects win global recognition	Several Taiwan campus redesign projects have won global recognition, thanks to the Design Movement on Campus initiative launched by the Ministry of Education and implemented by Taiwan Design Research Institute since 2019. According to the MOE, 91 such projects have been completed so far under the aesthetic education campaign. Among these, the campus renovation at Zhongfeng Elementary School in the central county of Nantou was a 2024 winner of Japan's prestigious Good Design Award in the public facility, civil structure and landscape category. The project gave the school's oldest trees a new lease on life as an outdoor classroom. According to the jury, the design offers a soft physical connection with nature; serves as a space for gathering, reading or staging performances; and inspires children to use the site in innovative ways. Also recognized was Taipei Municipal Fuxing High School, which recently featured in a TV program by Japan media outlet NHK for building campus kennels to house stray dogs and cats as part of the school's life education program, the MOE said. Equally impressive, Hudong Elementary School in the central county of Changhua transformed a dim space into a bright, multifunctional rhythm classroom dubbed the Light Room/Roof. The project has won Taiwan's Golden Pin Design Award and Japan's Good Design Award, as well as featuring in an article in Thailand's leading creative magazine Art4d. The MOE said the success of the campus redesign movement has also caught the attention of British design magazine Wallpaper*, which ran an article featuring several other projects, including a new storage and seating system transformed from an outdated special needs classroom at Sinhua Elementary School in the southern city of Tainan.

Taiwan gears up cancer prevention efforts	To implement further cancer prevention in Taiwan, the government is investing in developing better treatment and offering more support to patients and their families, the Ministry of Health and Welfare said Feb. 4. The MOHW made the remarks in a statement marking World Cancer Day, an initiative led by Geneva-based Union for International Cancer Control to raise awareness of the disease and encourage its prevention, detection and treatment. The campaign theme for 2025-2027 is &ldquo;United by Unique,&rdquo; which focuses on unity and support for a shift of health systems towards people-centered care. According to the ministry, the Health Promotion Administration has been working with Taipei City-based Hope Foundation for Cancer Care to subsidize the establishment of cancer resource centers in Taiwan since 2000. To date, 105 hospitals around the country have set up such facilities, which serve as key network hubs for patients searching for treatment and related information for their specific needs. Citing statistics released Dec. 19, 2024, by the HPA, the MOHW said 130,293 people were diagnosed with cancer in 2022, an increase of 8,531 new cases from the year before. The five-year survival rate was 62.9 percent between 2018 and 2022, up from 51.1 percent between 2016 and 2000, it added. The HPA statistics also show lung, colon and breast cancer as the three leading diseases in that order for both men and women combined, with a standardized incidence rate of 323.3 people per 100,000 population. The ministry said this shows that patients coexist with cancer for a longer period of time and reflects an increased need to offer them more comprehensive care. While the primary goal of treatment has been on treatment, the MOHW said it is equally important to address the psychological and social needs of the patients themselves and their families. Cancer resource centers play a key role in this regard, the MOHW said, adding that it will continue to implement more projects to offer better people-centered care and services.

Taiwan tiger grouper shipment en route to Japan	The first shipment of Taiwan tiger groupers is heading to Japan after gaining approval for export last October, spotlighting government efforts to expand into new markets, the Ministry of Agriculture said Feb. 5. According to the MOA, the batch was procured by Osaka-based West Japan Railway Co. and will be sold in its Rail Kitchen Chikugo, as well as its hotels and supermarkets in Hokkaido and Kyoto prefectures and the Kyushu region. During the news conference announcing the shipment, MOA Minister Chen Junne-jih said the ministry provided rigorous evidence of the product's safety during several bilateral economic and trade conferences. The export approval reflects Japanese recognition of the groupers' quality, breeding management and water quality monitoring, Chen noted, adding that the development marks a milestone in access to the global market for Taiwan fishery products. The ministry will continue to promote domestically raised tiger groupers by ensuring a stable supply and enhancing Japanese consumers' awareness of Taiwan products, Chen said, adding that the MOA's Fisheries Agency will help more local businesses obtain export approval to Japan, while the Fisheries Research Institute will keep monitoring the breeding environment to ensure quality. The minister went on to say that the MOA will conduct market surveys, launch small sampler fish meat packages and hold promotional activities in Japan. Pingtung County Magistrate Chou Chun-mi noted that the southern Taiwan county is the largest grouper breeding area in the country, with an annual output of 7,206 metric tons and an annual output value of NT$1.89 billion (US$57.5 million). This latest shipment follows that of yellow groupers to Japan in 2023, she said. Chen additionally stressed that the successful export of tiger grouper is the result of coordinated efforts by academics, officials and businesses, adding that it demonstrates the strength of cross-sector cooperation.

SBNPM holds exhibition on Taoist immortal Lu Dongbin	The Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum is holding an exhibition featuring calligraphy and artifacts relating to Lu Dongbin, one of the Taoism's Eight Immortals, showcasing various interpretations of the immortals from sophisticated literary depictions to popular images of longevity and prosperity. According to the SBNPM, the Lu Dongbin legend emerged in the early 11th century with accounts of his miraculous manifestations. His spiritual legacy encompasses both literary work and spiritual practice, including distinctive sword techniques for overcoming worldly desire and emotional attachment. Titled &ldquo;Tracing the Taoist Immortal Lu Dongbin in the NPM collection,&rdquo; the exhibition's most important piece is the transcription of verses relating to the immortal character by Dong Qichang (1555-1636). The scroll is a rendition of Lu's poetry with a commentary, the SBNPM said, adding that Dong's brushwork centers on controlled tip movements and fluid transitions, creating lines that possess both vigor and grace. Through slightly asymmetrical, yet balanced character structures, expansive composition spacing and the dramatic interplay of ink and empty space, the work ultimately creates an ethereal and transcendent visual experience, the museum noted. The SBNPM said that other highlights of the exhibition are objects decorated with images of the eight immortals, including a gourd-shaped vase in blue underglaze, a vase with polychrome decoration and a round carved-polychrome lacquer box.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Italy’s Corriere Della Sera	Deputy Foreign Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu gave an interview to Massimo Franco of Italy's leading daily news media, Corriere Della Sera, in early January to stress the importance of a free and democratic Taiwan to global security. In an article published Jan. 26 by the media outlet, Wu compared Taiwan to 1938's Czechoslovakia, when it was the fifth largest industrial power in Europe and the tenth in the world. By taking over its industries through the Munich Agreement, Nazi Germany was able to pay for the start of the Second World War. This, Wu said, is what China wants to do with Taiwan: take over its semiconductor industry, which accounts for 90 percent of global production, and change the world. While Taiwan only has 12 diplomatic allies in the world, it maintains close political, economic and trade relationship with more than 100 countries, he said. Pointing out the production and technological leadership of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Wu said if Taiwan is invaded, factories around the world will shut down in weeks. Taiwan is fully aware of the threats and dangers from China and is preparing for the worst according to three guidelines: develop defensive capabilities; garner support from the free world; and make security in the Taiwan Strait an international rather than a regional issue. With regard to Taiwan-Vatican relations, Wu praised the Holy See as a unique religious entity with high moral standards, defending moral and religious freedom as an important mission. Based on diplomatic relations that have lasted more than 80 years, Taiwan will continue to maintain its close ties with the Holy See, Wu said.

Lai responds to pope’s World Day of Peace call	President Lai Ching-te sent a letter Jan. 31 to Pope Francis in response to his message marking the 58th World Day of Peace. In the letter, the president expressed support for the papal plea that the global community initiate a cultural shift that would bring an end to governing interpersonal and international relations through exploitation and oppression and herald true and lasting peace. According to Lai, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and convergence of authoritarian regimes threaten the rules-based international order and severely impact peace and stability both in the Indo-Pacific and around the world. Echoing the pope's belief that war means defeat for all, Lai said the international community has reached consensus on upholding cross-strait peace and stability, adding that Taiwan is committed to safeguarding its freedom, equality, democracy and respect for human rights. Taiwan is proactively implementing values-based diplomacy and the Diplomatic Allies Prosperity Project to accelerate the development of allied nations, Lai said, adding that the country helps alleviate poverty by strengthening basic infrastructure, transferring technology and cultivating talent. In response to the pope's call for a new global financial framework jointly addressing climate change, food crises and other challenges, Lai expressed hope that international organizations will stop excluding Taiwan for political reasons. Taiwan is willing and able to shoulder its international responsibility to contribute and share its valuable experience through global platforms, he added. The president concluded by saying that Taiwan will continue to collaborate with the Holy See to advance world peace through concrete action while jointly upholding the core values of justice, democracy, freedom and peace.

Its selection for the exhibition will serve as an excellent opportunity for global audiences to better understand Taiwan's vibrant literary landscape, she added. With a BA in theater arts from National Sun Yat-sen University and a masters in illustration from the U.K.'s Kingston University, Ballboss was also selected for the exhibition in 2019 and 2022. The artist said his latest work has special meaning to him due to the extensive field research and interviews he undertook to create it, adding that the Taiwanese version also presented a new challenge. Established in 1967 and considered one of the longest-running and most successful Bologna book fair initiatives, the exhibition attracted 21,870 submissions from 4,374 artists representing 89 countries and territories this year. The final selection came down to 76 artworks by 77 authors from 29 countries, and the winning works will be on display from March 31 to April 3, followed by a two-year global tour, the MOC said.

President Lai convenes 3rd National Climate Change Committee meeting	President Lai Ching-te convened the third meeting of the National Climate Change Committee at the Presidential Office Jan. 23 in Taipei City, reaffirming the administration's commitment to taking decisive climate change actions. Citing World Meteorological Organization statistics, Lai said 2024 was the warmest year in history and was marked with extreme weather conditions such as persistent high temperatures, severe droughts, strong winds and disastrous rainfalls.

Act on Wildlife Conservation amendments passed by Legislature	The Legislative Yuan passed amendments to the Act on Wildlife Conservation Jan. 21 in Taipei City, underscoring the government's respect for Taiwan's Indigenous heritage in its efforts to conserve wildlife, protect biodiversity and maintain the balance of natural ecosystems. The amendments, which involve nine clauses of the act, prohibit the use of steel-jaw traps, dynamite and other explosives to catch wild animals, the Ministry of Agriculture said, adding that any devices, equipment and medication used to illegally catch wild animals, as well as the catch and their products, will be confiscated. In addition, owners of protected animals bear the responsibility to report and recover lost animals, as well as pay for all associated costs if a government agency provides assistance. Stricter punishment is also imposed on those who fail to do so. According to the MOA, the amendments allow members of Indigenous groups to hunt wild animals for nonprofit purposes, including birth celebrations and other ritual ceremonies. In a move to decriminalize hunting without prior approval from relevant agencies, the amendments impose only administrative fines on Indigenous individuals for such violations and exonerate first-time offenders. Following the passage, the revised regulations governing the hunting and slaughtering of wild animals for cultural and ritual purposes by Indigenous groups are expected to take effect in 2026, the MOA added.

MOHW diversifies care for dementia patients	The Ministry of Health and Welfare said Jan. 20 that the ministry is committed to diversifying services for dementia patients in accordance with condition severity to provide the most appropriate and professional care. According to the MOHW, the Long-term Care Plan 2.0 launched in 2017 has stipulated that dementia patients of extremely mild, mild, moderate and severe symptoms shall be taken into care by facilities in line with their severity. Those with extremely mild and mild symptoms are encouraged to go to dementia care stations to participate in activities to stimulate cognition and thus mitigate symptoms, the ministry said. For those in moderate and severe groups, long-term care institutions are recommended for high professional care personnel to patient ratio and the establishment of barrier-free facilities and equipment, the MOHW said. Such institutions also provide catering and transportation services, activities to advance patients' self-care and social activity while offering guidance and consultation for family members, it added. The ministry went on to say that starting 2025, if the condition of a patient served by a dementia care station deteriorates, the local government shall help to transfer the patient to long-term care management centers and case managers within six months. If the transfer is not successful, the original care station may continue to provide services to the patient, it added. In response to the annual increase in numbers of people with dementia, the ministry is working hard to encourage local governments to implement appropriate care resources according to disease stage, thus ensuring that patients receive appropriate and professional services, the MOHW said. It added that it also provides subsidies for dementia care stations and long-term care facilities for patients with severe conditions to alleviate the burden on relatives.

According to the MOC, &ldquo;The Whisper of the Waves&rdquo; is directed by Chung Po-yuan, with choreography by Japanese dancer Emiko Agatsuma. Inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, it incorporates Taiwan's unique culture of jitong, a type of folk religion practitioner, into the story while exploring human propensity for love, loneliness and existential contemplation, the ministry said. The theater added that the work also discusses issues such as same-sex marriage and surrogacy, noting that it demonstrates the cultural breadth and depth of democratic Taiwan's artistic landscape. The TCC in New York further expressed the hope that the performance will spotlight Taiwan's performing arts groups and raise the country's artistic profile on the global stage. First performed in Taiwan in 2020, &ldquo;The Whisper of the Waves&rdquo; has been staged in eight countries, including Czechia, Germany, Japan, South Korea and the U.K. (YCH-E) Write to Taiwan Today at ttonline@mofa.gov.tw	https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&post=264731	2025-01-21T00:00:00-08:00	
Premier Cho reaffirms commitment to safeguarding coastal security	Premier Cho Jung-tai said Jan. 20 that the government is sparing no effort to protect the safety of all Coast Guard Administration staff as they continue to safeguard Taiwan's coastal security and sovereignty. The premier made the remarks while visiting the base of the CGA's Northern Sector Flotilla at Taipei Port to express gratitude to personnel for sacrificing their Lunar New Year holidays for the people of Taiwan. According to Cho, given Taiwan's 1,200 kilometers of coastline, any breach along the shores would greatly compromise national security and lead to severe damage. The Northern Sector Flotilla is the largest among five such units in terms of personnel and patrol vessel numbers, and plays a leading role in monitoring the country's territorial waters from the shores of the northeastern county of Yilan to the northern county of Hsinchu, he added. The premier commended CGA staff for their tireless efforts in carrying out rescue missions, combating smuggling and ensuring maritime order and ecological conservation, citing as an example the 35-day mission over 17,000 kilometers by CG-5002 Hsinchu in 2024 to protect the rights of local fishermen. Cho said in the past two weeks he attended the ceremony marking the delivery of CG-611 Chang Bin, PP-10096 and PP-3525 and the naming of CG-612 Suao, as well as visiting a CGA command in the outlying Kinmen County. The government is fully aware of the hard work of all CGA personnel and will always stand with them, he added.
