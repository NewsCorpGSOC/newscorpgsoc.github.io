President Lai receives Czech parliamentary delegation	President Lai Ching-te said Nov. 12 that Taiwan is committed to furthering bilateral collaboration with Czechia in areas spanning culture, cyber security and semiconductors. Lai made the remarks while greeting a delegation from the Chamber of Deputies' Czech Republic-Taiwan Parliamentary Platform led by its chair Marek Benda at the Presidential Office in Taipei City. Taiwan and Czechia both value freedom and democracy, which motivates them to face the challenges of authoritarian expansion together, Lai said. The two sides enjoy a growing relationship, he added, citing visits by Senate President Milo&scaron; Vystrčil and COD Speaker Mark&eacute;ta Pekarov&aacute; Adamov&aacute; in recent years. The strength of the countries' bilateral ties are also evident in Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim's trip to Czechia earlier this year, and former President Tsai Ing-wen's attendance at the Forum 2000 Conference last month, Lai said, adding that the opening of the Czech Centre Taipei in June, baseball exhibition games between national teams earlier this month and the launch of Taipei-Prague direct flights last year further demonstrate the close bilateral cooperation. The president concluded by encouraging delegation members in their efforts to gain a deeper understanding of Taiwan and explore opportunities for bilateral collaboration during their stay. Benda expressed similar sentiments in his response and added that Taiwan's National Palace Museum and the National Museum in Prague have arranged to work together on a large-scale exhibition next year. He agreed with Lai on the importance of boosting exchanges in the semiconductor industry and expressed his hope to advance mutually beneficial economic collaboration. The chair went on to say that cross-strait peace and stability is critical to ensuring the safety of transportation routes throughout Southeast Asia, adding that he and other delegation members fundamentally reject China's military intimidation and its continued distortion of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758. (YCH-E) Write to Taiwan Today at ttonline@mofa.gov.tw	https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&post=261613	2024-11-13T00:00:00-08:00	
Taiwan students rank high in ICILS survey	Taiwan's eighth graders delivered strong performances in the 2023 International Computer and Information Literacy Study recently released by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, the Ministry of Education said Nov. 12. First conducted in 2013 and held every five years, the ICILS is designed to measure the capacity of eighth grade students to use information and communications technology productively beyond the basic use of digital technology. It tests students in computational thinking and computer and information literacy. According to the MOE, this is the first time that Taiwan has taken part in the survey, which involved more than 130,000 students and 60,000 plus teachers in 34 countries and territories. In the 2023 ICILS cycle, 5,112 local students took the computational thinking test and received an average score of 548 points. Just over 50 percent reached or surpassed level 3, indicating that they possess the ability to solve complex problems independently. The global averages are 483 points and 29 percent, respectively. In terms of computer and information literacy, local students averaged 515 points, trailing only their peers from South Korea, Czechia and Denmark. Sixty-four percent of test takers achieved level 2 scores or higher, surpassing the global average of 49 percent to demonstrate their creativity and skill when addressing information and communications technology problems, as well as their ability to communicate clearly on the subject. Consistent with global trends, girls outperformed boys in the computer and information literacy test, though computational thinking test results showed no measurable difference. The MOE also noted that while students' test scores are generally related to their family background, these differences are less pronounced in Taiwan. The MOE said the results reflect the success of Taiwan's digital education, adding that the government will continue to implement policies to support the digital literacy of the country's youth so that they can successfully pursue lifelong education and meet future challenges.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Canada’s The Globe and Mail	The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu said Taiwan is committed to enhancing ongoing partnership with the U.S. while strengthening cooperation with President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration. Wu made the remarks during an interview with Steven Chase for an article published Nov. 9 in Toronto-based daily newspaper The Globe and Mail. Taiwan is confident Trump will not abandon the Asian democracy to China because it plays a key role in the U.S. supply chain for cutting-edge semiconductor chips, Wu said, adding that he believes the U.S. would act to protect its national interests in the event of a cross-strait conflict. According to Wu, Taiwan produces more than 60 percent of the world's integrated circuits and over 90 percent of the most advanced chips, which are required in core technologies from smartphones to medical devices. The country also provides 100 percent of the global supply of chips used in artificial intelligence, he said, adding that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is a world leader in semiconductor production. The deputy minister described Taiwan's strategy as a &ldquo;not today&rdquo; policy regarding possible attacks from China. He added that Taiwan will continue to strengthen its self-defense while working with like-minded partners including Japan and the U.S. to safeguard regional peace and stability. Wu took the opportunity to thank Canada for backing Taiwan, most recently reflected in the House of Commons' passage of a motion rejecting a public relations campaign by China Nov. 6. The motion stated that U.N. Resolution 2758 neither establishes the People's Republic of China's sovereignty over Taiwan nor addresses Taiwan's participation in U.N. specialized agencies, the MOFA said, adding that the Canadian lower house also expressed support for Taiwan's meaningful engagement in international organizations.

Premier Cho attends APG money laundering seminar	Premier Cho Jung-tai said that Taiwan is committed to collaboration with other nations to effectively combat crime and uphold global security and stability. Cho made the statement while attending the opening ceremony of the 2024 Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering assessor training workshop Oct. 21 in Taipei City. Taiwan joined the APGML as a founding member in 1997 and this was the first time that the country has held the five-day event, the premier said. During the seminar, experts from Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Taiwan shared knowledge and experience on prevention of money laundering, financing terrorism and dealing with large-scale destructive weapons. Cho also extended a sincere welcome to David Shannon, APG's acting executive secretary and participants from 17 countries. The government has placed strong emphasis on preventing money laundering and financing terrorism to safeguard society, shown by the fact that Taiwan ranked as having regular follow-up of such crime in APGML mutual evaluation in 2019. The premier said that to promote stricter governance and more effective law enforcement, new strategies would be adopted. These include legal adaptation, including the implementation of a Money Laundering Control Act and a Fraud Crime Prevention Act, to more efficiently prosecute such crime. A second strategy is control of criminal behavior through use of digital tools by agencies such as Coast Guard Administration, police stations, prosecutors' offices and other bodies. Educating the public on identification of disinformation as well as proactive measures by financial institutions to prevent scams is also vital. Global cooperation is also an effective tactic, as evidenced by recent seizure of transnational fraud call centers through joint investigations by Taiwan and the U.S. Prevention of money laundering is a common international goal shared by Taiwan and Cho concluded by expressing hope that the APGML would hold further events in Taiwan.

President Lai receives RSF director general	President Lai Ching-te said Oct. 16 that Taiwan is committed to working with democratic partners and organizations including Reporters Without Borders to safeguard press freedom and sustainable democracy in the world. Lai made the remarks while meeting with Thibaut Bruttin, director general of the France-based nongovernmental organization at the Presidential Office in Taipei City.

He added that the country is an ideal center for global media outlets to gain a foothold in the Asia-Pacific as it is a hub of press freedom in the region. The president went on to say that government and civil society alike are committed to defending democracy, citing as evidence the government's dedication to establishing a solid cybersecurity mechanism and the efforts of the country's NGOs to draft measures to counter disinformation. The Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee was further set up by the PO to strengthen national resilience to deal with such challenges. Lai concluded by stressing that just as the world needs Taiwan, Taiwan needs the world in the ongoing fight to counter disinformation and authoritarian expansion. The country will continue to expand exchanges with partners to safeguard the democratic way of life, he said. In response, Bruttin praised Taiwan's outstanding performance in the RSF's press freedom index and suggested areas in which his organization hopes to contribute, including formulating public policies to crack down on disinformation on social media, encourage media self-discipline and strengthen the role of public media, as well as exposing external propaganda and foreign interference.

MOFA denounces China’s aggression, thanks like-minded partners for concern	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned China's Joint Sword-2024B military drills around Taiwan and called on Beijing to immediately cease provocation Oct. 14. Such exercises are a challenge to the international rules-based order and gravely undermine regional peace and stability, the MOFA said, adding that the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo and threaten Taiwan's democracy followed President Lai Ching-te's Oct. 10 National Day address in which he urged China to jointly safeguard prosperity.

The U.S. Department of State issued a statement Oct. 13 to convey serious concern over the People's Liberation Army's military exercises in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan. It asserted that it was unreasonable for China to respond to an annual speech with intimidation and urged the country to act with restraint and refrain from any further action that could jeopardize regional stability. Additionally, the European External Action Service released a statement Oct. 14 that said China's military drills risk escalating regional tensions and reiterated that Taiwan Strait peace is strategically significant to global security. During an interview Oct. 14, Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba similarly noted that peace and security around Taiwan is very important to the country and the region, adding that the government would closely monitor the situation and be ready to respond if necessary.
