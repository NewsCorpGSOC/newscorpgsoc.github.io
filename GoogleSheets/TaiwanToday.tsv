NSTC unveils new carbon capture, conversion technologies	A research team from National Taiwan University has successfully developed pioneering technologies in membrane-based carbon capture and electrochemical carbon conversion, according to the National Science and Technology Council Dec. 11. Supported by the NSTC's net-zero emission program, the NTU ZERO team comprises chemical engineering and chemistry experts from the Taipei City-based university. In particular, the team has established a pilot production machine capable of converting carbon dioxide into upstream chemical products, with a processing capacity of 50 kilograms of CO2 per day. According to the NSTC, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas currently produce most of Taiwan's energy supply, while thermal power generation accounts for 14 percent of the country's carbon emissions, with industrial emissions making up 55 percent of the total. Both the sources can utilize the new carbon capture technology for reuse or storage, the council added. Based on the NTU team's calculations, the efficiency of the most widely adopted carbon capture technology is only about 60 percent given its method and choice of absorbents. In comparison, the NTU team developed an innovative ultramicroporous metal-organic framework that can absorb CO2 with an estimated efficiency of nearly 90 percent. Equally impressive, the NSTC said the team has developed a high efficiency electrochemical process that can convert CO2 into syngas, formic acid, ethanol or ethylene, which are all higher-value chemical compounds with negative carbon footprints. Its low power consumption and high selectivity also reduce the energy and cost of subsequent product purification, the council added. The NSTC expects the positive development will inspire more domestic industries to invest in related initiatives and help contribute to the government's goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2025.

Speaking at the event, MOI Minister Liu Shyh-fang said that the number of foreign nationals who have immigrated to Taiwan through marriage now exceeds 600,000, in addition to the several hundred thousand foreign residents who work, study or do business in Taiwan. President Lai Ching-te's announcement of the New Immigrants Basic Act in August marked a milestone in domestic immigration policy with the law's enhanced protection of multiculturalism and immigrants' fundamental rights and interests, Liu said. A raft of measures have been implemented to help naturalized citizens adapt to their new lives, including a dream building project for parents and children and radio programs providing dedicated support, she added. The minister concluded by vowing to continue working with other ministries and civil organizations to formulate policies and services meeting the needs of new residents.

Taiwan welcomes 7 million foreign visitors to date	More than 7 million foreign nationals have visited Taiwan as of Dec. 3 this year, with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Tourism Administration expecting the upward trend to continue for the rest of the year. TA statistics shows that Japan is back as the leading source of travelers and accounts for 1.18 million arrivals, followed by Hong Kong and Macau with 1.16 million arrivals, and South Korea with nearly 0.9 million visits. Thanks to additional flights on existing routes and new ones, as well as a variety of promotion campaigns, the U.S. is now the fourth largest traveler source with nearly 0.6 million arrivals, surpassing pre-pandemic numbers. The agency attributed the strong performances to the success of key policy initiatives promoting Taiwan as a top vacation destination. Some examples include the establishment of offices so far this year in Jakarta, Mumbai, Paris and Vancouver. The TA said a new tourism information center will open for business Dec. 20 in Manila, while two new ones are being planned for Seattle and Sydney next year. Seven travel sites and two firms from Taiwan are among the 2024 Green Destinations Top 100 Stories presented by the Netherlands-based Green Destinations Foundation, the TA said. To build on these results, the government will continue to create low-carbon travel destinations and promote Taiwan as a top choice for green and sustainable tourism. Tourism is a key sector in government strategy, with new promotional initiatives such as the &ldquo;Taiwan, Waves of Wonder&rdquo; overseas campaign, subsidies for domestic travel and joint promotional projects with local governments. Based on all these factors, the TA expects to see the sector create NT$1 trillion (US$30.86 billion) in output by 2028.

Historical wrongs may be forgiven, but they must not be forgotten, Lai said, adding that the government will keep working to discover and record truths as a key method of uniting the people of Taiwan and fostering the country's development by promoting transitional justice throughout society. Following Lai's remarks, Minister of Culture Li Yuan said the MOC will continue to work to pass the Site of Injustice Preservation Act, even as it encourages creative efforts to pass the lessons of history on to younger generations.

Techno art exhibition kicks off at NTMFA	The 2024 International Techno Art Exhibition has brought together 12 artists to explore the liberation of human consciousness via digital technology, and is underway through March 2, 2025, at the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in the central city of Taichung. During the Nov. 30 opening ceremony Deputy Culture Minister Lee Ching-hwi said an increasing number of artists are intrigued by the rapid development of artificial intelligence and have begun to take inspiration from the technology and incorporate it into their works. Some are intrigued by the question of whether AI has a soul, she said, adding that such reflective thinking is key to artistic creation. This exhibition, &ldquo;Right Where It Belongs,&rdquo; provides a venue for the public to engage with AI and the future that it promises, Lee continued, adding that it is also important that as people move toward the future, they attend to the reminders from the artists&#39; creations to not leave the past behind. According to the organizer, the exhibition is inspired by technium, an idea proposed by Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired magazine. This cutting-edge concept and hypothesis is concerned with the integration of the artificial and natural worlds from a technical perspective, and regards technology as an evolving extension of the human mind. &ldquo;Exploration and Exploitation&rdquo; by New Taipei City-based Simple Noodle Art is one of the works on display. It features an interactive system that uses AI technology to modify its output based on the audience's visual responses to the video being displayed, and asks whether AI exacerbates social divisions when faced with the dilemma of exploring or exploiting humans. The event also includes side events such as two workshops, a forum, an artistic talk and guided tours of the museum, the organizers said.

Taiwan's five major policies on the recycling of plastic resources align with the content of the draft treaty, the MOENV said. The ministry advocates the reuse of resources and avoidance of unnecessary consumption, and has also prohibited the use of certain disposable plastic products. Moreover, the MOENV also encourages manufacturers to utilize recycled or alternative materials and has established certification mechanisms for these resources. The ministry is also encouraging cooperation with other ministries and their agencies, as evidenced by coastal cleanup projects.

MOFA thanks UK House of Commons for support of Taiwan	A motion passed by the U.K. House of Commons affirming that U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan is deeply appreciated by the government and people, both the Presidential Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Nov. 29. Proposed by Blair McDougall, a member of the lower house's Foreign Affairs Committee, the motion was jointly signed by cross-party MPs including Sarah Champion, co-chair of the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group, and Iain Duncan Smith, co-chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, among others. According to the motion, UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan, and neither does it address the political status of Taiwan, nor establish The People's Republic of China's sovereignty over Taiwan. It is silent both on the status of Taiwan in the U.N. and on Taiwan participation in UN agencies, while stating clearly that nothing in law prevents the participation of Taiwan in international organizations. The motion further condemned efforts made by PRC representatives to distort the meaning of the resolution as well as their alteration of historic documents. Catherine West, parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, said that UNGA Resolution 2758 should not be utilized to exclude Taiwan from meaningful engagement in global mechanisms, adding that the U.K. opposes any attempt to misinterpret the resolution, which is not in the interests of the people of Taiwan, the U.K. nor the world. In response, the PO said the motion expressly refutes China's distortion of the resolution and denounces Beijing's attempts to restrict Taiwan's global presence. It demonstrates the international community's support of Taiwan's democratic values, the office said, adding that the country will continue to work with other democracies to defend the core values of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. The current motion followed a similar resolution greenlighted by the IPAC during its annual meeting in July, and motions passed by the European Parliament and legislative branches in Australia, Canada, Guatemala and the Netherlands, according the MOFA.

Vice premier reaffirms government commitment to net-zero transition	Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said Nov. 27 that the government is promoting energy transition and green growth strategies to drive Taiwan's economy through innovation while establishing the country as a provider of innovative and sustainable solutions. The vice premier made the remarks during an event organized by Taipei City-based financial magazine Business Weekly to honor 100 local firms for their carbon competitiveness. Cheng commended the magazine for launching the annual rankings in 2022, saying that they have been instrumental not just in encouraging the reduction of carbon emissions in Taiwan, but in helping enterprises break the traditional pattern of thought that sees carbon reduction as a cost burden that reduces corporate competitiveness. The vice premier also noted a positive trend in the past three years, as companies began to adopt more innovative approaches. She added that the latest list shows a decoupling of carbon emissions from profitability growth. Cheng also commended the honorees for working to enhance their energy efficiency, invest in energy storage equipment and help suppliers map out carbon reduction measures, among other initiatives.

Premier Cho outlines national development plan for Taiwan	Premier Cho Jung-tai reiterated the government's national development plan and expressed hope of working with the private sector to adapt Taiwan to the changing global landscape and enhance the country's economic sustainability. The premier made the remarks during his first breakfast meeting with members of Taipei City-based Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce Nov. 26 in the capital. According to Cho, a raft of key policy initiatives are already being implemented. These include the Five Trusted Industry Sectors of artificial intelligence, military, next-generation communications, semiconductors, and security and surveillance; the five NT$10 billion (US$307.6 million) funds promoting AI, cultural and creative content, green growth, health tech and youth empowerment; and the pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050. The goal is to ensure an average economic growth of 3 percent in the following four years, with the gross domestic product per capita topping US$40,000, unemployment remaining below 3.5 percent and the consumer price index staying within 2 percent, he said. As decided at the first meeting of the Cabinet-level Economic Development Commission staged in July this year, the government plans to transform Taiwan into Asia's hub for asset management; introduce NT$3 trillion of domestic and foreign capital in key industries; and cultivate and recruit top-tier professionals from home and abroad, Cho said. Equally important is the need to encourage innovation for inclusive growth, the premier said, adding that six major governance programs and 140 regional infrastructure projects are already in the pipeline to ensure balanced development throughout the country. Cho said the new National Climate Change Committee overseen by the Presidential Office reflects the government's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

President Lai receives US Senator Jeff Merkley	President Lai Ching-te said Nov. 26 that Taiwan is committed to strengthening security cooperation with the U.S. while deepening bilateral economic and trade ties to make further contributions to regional peace, stability and development of global prosperity. Lai made the remarks when meeting at the Presidential Office in Taipei City with a U.S. delegation led by Jeff Merkley, U.S. senator and cochair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. The president first thanked Merkley for his long-term support of Taiwan through speaking in the U.S. Congress, citing last year's Taiwan Relations Reinforcement Act. Lai also noted a resolution reaffirming U.S. commitment to Taiwan and recognizing the 45th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act, which was sponsored by Merkley and Senator Marco Rubio earlier this year. Taiwan will continue to maintain the cross-strait status quo and uphold freedom and democracy, the president said, reiterating that the ROC (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other. The country will continue to enhance its self-defense capability and advance military procurement, he said, adding that the annual national defense budget has increased by 80 percent over the past eight years. The government is also committed to reinforcing economic resilience, as evidenced by the changing destinations of overseas investment: China accounted for 80 percent of the total in 2011 and this has been reduced to just 11.4 percent in 2023, Lai noted. The president further pledged to expand the economic relationship with the U.S. through future negotiations under the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade and urged swift processing of a bill to resolve double taxation issues. In response, Merkley praised Taiwan's democracy and promised to promote bilateral collaboration in areas spanning military security to climate change and other global issues. The senator further reaffirmed U.S. Congressional support for Taiwan during the U.S. administration transition. Following the meeting, Merkley and his delegation were received by Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, who expressed anticipation of continued robust Taiwan-U.S. relations. According to the MOFA, Merkley's itinerary included a meeting with National Security Council Secretary-General Jaushieh Joseph Wu and a banquet hosted by Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung during his Nov. 25-27 stay.

MOENV reaffirms government commitment to plastic reduction	The government is working across all sectors to formulate plastic reduction policy measures in line with global standards, the Ministry of Environment said in a statement Nov. 25. The ministry's remarks came following the opening of the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee of the UN Environment Program the same day in Busan, South Korea. The seven-day event aims to develop an international legally binding instrument by 2024 to address the full plastic lifecycle, including production, design and disposal. During a press event in Taipei City, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said the ministry is closely monitoring INC-5's progress, and will review the government's 2018 plastic reduction goals and set new targets accordingly. The ministry is working on a bill to integrate the Waste Disposal Act and Resource Recycling Act for reuse of plastics in the circular economy, he added. According to the MOENV's Resource Circulation Administration, the UN plastics treaty seeks to reduce consumption of single-use plastics and develop replacements, as well as establish specific design requirements for plastic products that lead to an increase in their recyclability, among other goals. Following the future implementation of the treaty, the administration will take inventory of current regulations and formulate new measures in response. As part of this work, the MOENV set up a plastics alliance earlier this year to coordinate public and private sector action, formulate policy guidelines and offer technical support for local firms adapting to the global plastics treaty, the ministry said.

Taiwan novel wins US National Book Award	&ldquo;Taiwan Travelogue,&rdquo; a Mandarin-language novel written by Yang Shuang-zi and translated into English by Lin King, has won the National Book Award for Translated Literature presented by the U.S.-based National Book Foundation, the Ministry of Culture said Nov. 21. Set in 1938 during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945), the novel is a bittersweet love story between a Japanese novelist and her Taiwanese interpreter. It was recognized for its artful exploration of language, history and power. According to the MOC, the novel was a sensation when the Mandarin edition was published in 2020. It won Taiwan's highest literary honor, the Golden Tripod Award, the following year. The English translation was made possible with MOC support, and it became the first literary work from Taiwan to win the National Book Award for Translated Literature, the highest award of its kind in the U.S. The Japanese translation also won Japan's 2024 Best Translation Award, another first for Taiwan. In her acceptance speech, Yang said that Taiwan has continuously faced the threat of invasion by another powerful nation for more than a century, contributing to the Taiwanese people's complicated relationship with their national and ethnic identity. Writing about the past is a means of moving toward the future and examining what it means to be Taiwanese, she added. Yang also thanked the MOC for supporting her project from its inception in 2018 to the publication of the English translation in the U.S. this November. Born in the U.S. and raised in Taiwan, King said the novel explores the essence of translated literature, adding that the English version aims to convey the spirit of the original story rather than offering a Westernized adaptation. The MOC said it is planning a series of book tours involving Yang and King to promote the novel in New York, Los Angeles and Houston next year.

Framework Convention on Climate Change is sincerely appreciated by the government and people, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Nov. 13. According to the MOFA, during the COP29 High Level Segments for Heads of State and Government Nov. 11-12 in Azerbaijan, Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine said that Taiwan has developed a wide range of innovative technologies and solutions to address climate change and that it deserves a seat at the UNFCCC. Citing the U.N. principle of leaving no one behind, Tuvalu Prime Minister Feleti Penitala Teo said his country supports Taiwan's participation in UNFCCC activities and other U.N.-affiliated organizations. Eswatini PM Russell Mmiso Dlamini called for Taiwan's inclusion in global climate response action so that it can make contributions to the world. To make the case for Taiwan's UNFCCC participation, Hsinchu County-based Industrial Technology Research Institute teamed up with the Marshall Islands to hold a meeting Nov. 12 on the sidelines of COP29 on technology and market-based instruments to promote a transition away from fossil fuels. The event is one of seven activities planned with support from the Ministry of Environment this year, in addition to a situation room set up by the ministry to monitor the latest developments at the annual conference. According to the MOENV, no effort is being spared on the domestic front, as evidenced by the inauguration of a zero-waste manufacturing center Nov. 13 in the central city of Taichung. During the event, Environment Minister Peng Chi-ming and Lara Ho, senior vice president of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in carbon capture, carbon emission reduction and green technology development. Both sides expect the public-private initiative to inspire more local businesses to follow suit and help advance the country's policy goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, the ministry added.
