Taiwan reports 2nd highest foreign trade in 2024	Taiwan recorded its second-best foreign trade numbers in 2024, thanks in part to continuous expansion of the global economy, the Ministry of Finance said Feb. 25. The MOF attributed the strong showing to factors like inflation mitigation and the recovery of economic resilience around the world, adding that global supply chain restructuring and expanding artificial intelligence applications greatly benefited local semiconductor and information communication technology sectors. According to the ministry, Taiwan's exports grew 9.9 percent to US$475 billion during the year, with figures reaching a new monthly high in August, along with a second peak in December. Imports surged 12.2 percent to US$394 billion as semiconductor firms ramped up investments in equipment to prepare for a booming global AI supply chain. A breakdown of the figures shows that electronic components and parts topped the export list, accounting for 37.3 percent of the total, followed by ICT and audiovisual products at 27.9 percent and basic metals at 6 percent. Taiwan's exports to the U.S. reached a record high of US$111.4 billion, up 46.1 percent over 2023. Exports to major trade partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations increased 15.1 percent to US$87.8 billion, also a record high. While China and Hong Kong remained the leading destination for local exports, the combined share dropped to 31.7 percent, the lowest in 23 years. The U.S. surpassed ASEAN members to take the second spot, with its share of 23.4 percent the highest in 24 years. Despite geopolitical risk and uncertainties stemming from the tariff policies of the U.S. new administration, the MOF expected recovering global trade and expanding investment in AI applications by global cloud service providers to continue to benefit Taiwan's exporters.

President Lai receives 228 Incident overseas victims’ families	President Lai Ching-te expressed hope Feb. 24 that Taiwan's 23 million people will unite to safeguard the country while maintaining the constitutional system of democracy, freedom, and human rights to continue Taiwan's development and prosperity. Lai made the remarks when meeting with the 228 Incident overseas victims' families homecoming group at the Presidential Office in Taipei City. The 228 Incident occurred in 1947 after the Japanese colonial government's withdrawal in late 1945 and followed calls for government reform. When these demands went unmet, protests broke out around the country, prompting a military crackdown that resulted in many civilian deaths. The president first thanked the group for its longstanding work for speaking out in support of Taiwan, noting that this year is the 78th anniversary of the 228 Incident. The death of Taiwan social elites in the event including the first Taiwan prosecutor Wang Yu-lin and artist Chen Cheng-po caused incalculable losses to Taiwan society, he said, offering apologies again on behalf of the government. The government will spare no effort to do make amends for the 228 Incident, Lai said, citing remedial measures including admitting mistakes, offering apologies, making compensation, investigating the truth, restoring reputations, revoking judgments and setting up memorials and monuments. He added that government authorities are committed to pursuing transitional justice to seek the truth, bring justice and guarantee that such an incident will never happen again. Although this is an unfinished task, Lai said the government will declassify political archives and stressed that people must not forget history and understand the differences between democracy and authoritarianism to protect freedom. The government seeks to unite the country, protect public safety and never allow an event like the 228 Incident to happen again, Lai concluded. To this end, Taiwan's sovereignty must be safeguarded, he said, adding that the ROC (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other, Taiwan's sovereignty is inviolable and cannot be annexed, and that the country's future is to be determined by its 23 million people.

VP Hsiao receives German Marshall Fund delegation	Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim met with a delegation from U.S. headquartered German Marshall Fund's Taiwan-US-Europe Policy Program Feb. 20 in the Presidential Office in Taipei City. Hsiao said that in the face of challenges, Taiwan and its transatlantic partners need to continue dialogue and cooperation so that both can maintain economic prosperity, social resilience and enhance common interests. She added that the two sides share values such as freedom and democracy and thus should work together to face challenges. Hsiao noted that Taiwan has become an economy that contributes to global prosperity and plays a key role in the technology supply chain, however, work must continue to maintain this critical and irreplaceable leading position. She added that Taiwan attaches great importance to balanced growth in all walks of life and that use of artificial intelligence must benefit traditional industries and small and medium sized enterprises. Over the past two years, the U.S. has become Taiwan's largest overseas investment location with over 40 percent of overall foreign investment going to that destination, compared to 2010 when over 80 percent of foreign investment went to China. Hsiao said that adjustment and diversification in economics and trade ensures that Taiwan becomes a continuously prosperous and resilient society. The vice president further noted that one of President Lai's major policies is to institutionalize the concept of whole-of-society defense resilience. This issue has been discussed with many American partners over the years and in future will involve the private sector and other partners as, in the face of increasingly serious compound threats, it is critical to strengthen social resilience.

OAC Minister vows to maintain Indo-Pacific peace, stability	The Cabinet-level Ocean Affairs Council Minister Kuan Bi-ling said Feb. 19 that the council is committed to working with its Indo-Pacific counterparts to safeguard peace, prosperity and stability in the region. Kuan made the remarks during an interview on a current affairs Yahoo TV program.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to French media	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chih-chung Wu said the government is fully determined to defend Taiwan's democratic way of life and enhance the country's strategic value. Wu made the remarks during an online interview with R&eacute;gis Soubrouillard for an article published Feb. 14 in Paris-based weekly magazine Challenges. According to the deputy minister, despite a lack of official ties, Taiwan is committed to expanding relations with its global partners based on shared interests in innovation, trade, technical cooperation and respect for democratic values. Wu said the U.S. is an important supporter of Taiwan, with Washington set to continue its arms sales, high-level exchanges, trade and economic cooperation with Taiwan. The U.S. sees Taiwan as part of a broader strategic framework to keep the Indo-Pacific safe from China's threats, he said, adding that the two sides are also in discussions about supply chain issues, especially in the semiconductor sector. Taiwan keeps a watchful eye on China's multiple threat strategies and remains prepared for any possible situations, Wu said, adding that the people will not waver in their resolution to defend their democratic institutions. A confrontation in the Taiwan Strait would impact the entire world, and China would pay a costly price for invading Taiwan, the deputy minister said. Wu also said the EU is aware of the risk of its economic reliance on China and is taking a tougher stance against Beijing, while countries like Lithuania, Czechia and Slovakia have publicly voiced support for Taiwan despite pressure from Beijing. At a time when Europe looks to ensure the security of its supply chains, the deputy minister said Taiwan is leveraging the strategic asset of its semiconductor prowess to expand investment in Europe. The country is also enhancing cooperation and exchanges with France in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and energy transitions, Wu added.

MOEA reveals ITRI’s advanced cooling solution for AI chips	The Ministry of Economic Affairs displayed the latest development in two-phase cooling technology for artificial intelligence chips Feb. 18 in Taipei City, highlighting government efforts to advance high-performance computing. Developed by Hsinchu County-based Industrial Technology Research Institute in northern Taiwan, the technology removes heat through rapid evaporation and condensation of a dielectric liquid. The expanded contact area between the coolant and the chips also accelerates heat conduction to elevate computing efficacy and stability. According to the MOEA, the two-phase cooling innovation can boost AI chip cooling capacity beyond 1,500 watts, compared to 1,000 watts with current single-phase technology. The ITRI-developed system has successfully applied for field verification from the global integrated circuit design heavyweight Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., the ministry said, adding that if adopted by global data centers, the cooling solution could reduce annual carbon emissions by 50 million tons. The success is a result of a 2014 MOEA project that encourages advanced industrial technology development, the ministry said. ITRI also receives support enabling it to work with enterprises such as New Taipei City-headquartered Aewin Technologies Co., Ltd. and Giga-Byte Technology Co., Ltd. to establish a complete supply chain pertinent to heat dissipation in order to drive growth in the country's AI sector. Such cooling technology further solidifies Taiwan's leadership in the global AI industry, the MOEA said, adding that the breakthrough will also create a sustainable computing environment while consolidating the country's key role in international green energy development.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Ukrainian media	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu called on the global community to stand with Taiwan to ensure global supply chain stability and international security integrity. Wu made the remarks during an interview with Tim Mak, founder of Kyiv-based publication Counteroffensive, for an article published Feb. 15 on military technology in Taiwan. Citing remarks by President Lai Ching-te, the Counteroffensive article said Taiwan aspires to become the Asian hub of drone supply chains for global democracies. Based on observations of the Russia-Ukraine war, Taiwan is developing affordable unmanned aerial vehicles, which are expected to play a key role in global confrontations. The article also said that since the late 20th century, the free world has taken the view that welcoming China and Russia into the flow of international trade would have a democratizing effect. Wu said the war has proven that such thinking is naive. The deputy minister said the appropriate strategic response should be to try to separate the so-called &ldquo;red supply chain&rdquo; and the democratic supply chain, adding that Taiwan's prowess in electronics manufacturing and semiconductor technology make it a key player in this regard. Through global supply chain restructuring, the country wants to ensure that local semiconductor technologies will not fall into the hands of Russia or other authoritarian regimes, Wu said, adding that an additional priority is the enhancement of Taiwan's self-defense. According to Counteroffensive, Taiwan is making progress in developing drones and asymmetrical tactics with its rich scientific knowledge. Wu called on the free world to include Taiwan in the global security network as a means to ensure regional and global peace and stability.

NHRM holds lectures on human rights during TIBE	The National Human Rights Museum staged four lectures Feb. 8-9 at Taipei International Book Exhibition in the capital, underscoring the facility's commitment to deepening education on civil liberties, according to the Ministry of Culture. The talks spanned literature creation, picture book publication, and TV and film production, the MOC said. The NHRM's display of research, publications and cultural products at its pavilion aimed to deepen the public's insight into human rights issues, it added. In one of the Feb. 8 lectures, Paiwan writer Liglav A-wu shared her process of portraying Taiwan's White Terror period through an Indigenous lens while serving as an artist in residence at NHRM. Since extant political files are not categorized by ethnic group, she painstakingly tracked down affected individuals from local tribes. A-wu noted that the interviews demonstrated the profound impact authoritarian rule had on native groups, adding that she hopes her work will help Indigenous people learn more about their history. Additionally, illustrator Cincin Chang expounded on her new book &ldquo;Giraffe President,&rdquo; which probes causes of collective trauma and strives to resolve intergenerational conflict. In the work, Chang explores how authoritarianism arises and becomes accepted by society. In response to an audience question on educating children, she emphasized the importance of media literacy, the MOC said. During a Feb. 9 event hosted by poet Hong Hong, fellow poets Hsiang Yang and Chen Yun-yuan introduced a selection of 180 poems on the White Terror period that are set to be published in the second half of the year. Hsiang said that how writers reflect social pain is of great significance, while Chen remarked that compared to prose and fiction, poetry is a better medium to portray subtle but omnipresent agony and violence of the era, the ministry concluded. The White Terror refers to a period from 1949 to 1992, during which the government declared martial law and suppressed and prosecuted political dissidents.

New stamp collection pays tribute to artistic pioneers	A set of stamps featuring the works of four 20th century painters will be released Feb. 12 to showcase Taiwan's achievements in fine arts, according to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Chunghwa Post Co. Ltd. According to Chunghwa Post, this year's collection features works held at the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts based in central Taiwan's Taichung City. Similar sets of stamps have been published since 2002. Chen Cheng-po's 1935 oil painting &ldquo;Tamsui Landscape (Tamsui)&rdquo; depicts the small historic town in what is now New Taipei City during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945). The artist created a rich sense of spatial depth by layering in buildings on a hillside, roofs of varied heights and winding paths. &ldquo;Yehliu Scenery,&rdquo; an oil painting completed in 1969 by Chen Hui-kun, features a striking contrast between the yellow-brown rock formations and the deep blue water. The contours of the rocks and coastline are smoothly outlined in dark brown, while the sky is rendered with lighter blues and white to evoke the vastness of the seascape. Another stamp shows &ldquo;A Sea of Clouds at Alishan&rdquo; by Liao Chi-chun. The 1953 oil painting's layers of soft pink clouds drift toward a distant horizon, while trees and other greenery in the foreground provide a lush resting place for the eye. &ldquo;Mt.

Taiwan to raise national computing power	The National Science and Technology Council is building a high-speed computer system to drive research and development of generative artificial intelligence and related business applications in Taiwan, according to the Executive Yuan. After a briefing from the NSTC at the EY Feb. 6 in Taipei City, Premier Cho Jung-tai said computing power plays a key role in promoting industrial digital transformation, personnel cultivation and economic growth. To fulfill President Lai Ching-te's vision of building Taiwan into an AI nation, it is imperative to develop sovereign AI and a complete digital ecosystem, he added. To achieve this policy goal, Cho said the development of high-speed computers, data centers and cloud service platforms, among other digital infrastructure, is to be prioritized. In particular, the premier said government focus will be on creating computing structures more suitable for large language model services and applications development. This will secure Taiwan's global competitiveness and key strategic position while helping create more job opportunities in the process, bolstering prosperity and benefiting domestic small and medium-sized enterprises and startups for more balanced regional development, he added. It is also important to engage the private sector to promote AI and introduce it to all aspects of the business sector, Cho said. This will ensure inclusive and sustainable growth of the digital economy, so that AI innovations can benefit all segments of society, the premier added. According to the NSTC, Taiwan ranked 11th in the world in terms of computing power based on the data released by Top500 project in November 2024. The initiative to create a New Silicon Valley in southern Taiwan unveiled by the Executive Yuan earlier this year will play a key role in bolstering Taiwan's computing capabilities, the NSTC said.

Hakka Bombing of the Dragon underway in Miaoli	The Hakka tradition known as Bombing of the Dragon is being held at the Yuqing Temple in northern Taiwan's Miaoli County, the Hakka Affairs Council said Feb. 6. According to HAC Deputy Minister Fan Tso-ming, there are four well-known events around Taiwan to celebrate the Lantern Festival. He said participating in activities like the Bombing of the Dragon, especially in central Taiwan and as it is the first Hakka celebration after the Lunar New Year, helps sustain Hakka communities' economic development. Fan joined other guests to dot the eyes of 13 dragon models, the HAC said, further expressing the wish for the central and local governments to continue to work together to promote Hakka culture. The Bombing of the Dragon in Miaoli originates from dragon dances, according to the Ministry of the Interior. Traditionally, after worshipping ancestors and before leaving home again for work at the time of the Lantern Festival, Hakka people pray to be immune from disaster and for abundant harvest in the new year, and the activities around the dragon are part of this desire, the HAC said. Activities around the dragon are divided into six stages: first the making of the dragon before the Lunar New Year. Then on the ninth day of the first lunar month, the dragon has its eyes dotted with pupils in a ceremony to symbolize the divine spirit entering the mythical beast to bless the people and start the festival. The final four stages take place on the day of the Lantern Festival, namely welcoming, walking with and throwing fireworks at the dragon, and then the return of the dragon to the heavens. The Bombing of the Dragon was launched in 1998 in Miaoli, and this year will be held from Feb. 6 through Feb. 14, the HAC added.

Taiwan campus redesign projects win global recognition	Several Taiwan campus redesign projects have won global recognition, thanks to the Design Movement on Campus initiative launched by the Ministry of Education and implemented by Taiwan Design Research Institute since 2019. According to the MOE, 91 such projects have been completed so far under the aesthetic education campaign. Among these, the campus renovation at Zhongfeng Elementary School in the central county of Nantou was a 2024 winner of Japan's prestigious Good Design Award in the public facility, civil structure and landscape category. The project gave the school's oldest trees a new lease on life as an outdoor classroom. According to the jury, the design offers a soft physical connection with nature; serves as a space for gathering, reading or staging performances; and inspires children to use the site in innovative ways. Also recognized was Taipei Municipal Fuxing High School, which recently featured in a TV program by Japan media outlet NHK for building campus kennels to house stray dogs and cats as part of the school's life education program, the MOE said. Equally impressive, Hudong Elementary School in the central county of Changhua transformed a dim space into a bright, multifunctional rhythm classroom dubbed the Light Room/Roof. The project has won Taiwan's Golden Pin Design Award and Japan's Good Design Award, as well as featuring in an article in Thailand's leading creative magazine Art4d. The MOE said the success of the campus redesign movement has also caught the attention of British design magazine Wallpaper*, which ran an article featuring several other projects, including a new storage and seating system transformed from an outdated special needs classroom at Sinhua Elementary School in the southern city of Tainan.

Taiwan gears up cancer prevention efforts	To implement further cancer prevention in Taiwan, the government is investing in developing better treatment and offering more support to patients and their families, the Ministry of Health and Welfare said Feb. 4. The MOHW made the remarks in a statement marking World Cancer Day, an initiative led by Geneva-based Union for International Cancer Control to raise awareness of the disease and encourage its prevention, detection and treatment. The campaign theme for 2025-2027 is &ldquo;United by Unique,&rdquo; which focuses on unity and support for a shift of health systems towards people-centered care. According to the ministry, the Health Promotion Administration has been working with Taipei City-based Hope Foundation for Cancer Care to subsidize the establishment of cancer resource centers in Taiwan since 2000. To date, 105 hospitals around the country have set up such facilities, which serve as key network hubs for patients searching for treatment and related information for their specific needs. Citing statistics released Dec. 19, 2024, by the HPA, the MOHW said 130,293 people were diagnosed with cancer in 2022, an increase of 8,531 new cases from the year before. The five-year survival rate was 62.9 percent between 2018 and 2022, up from 51.1 percent between 2016 and 2000, it added. The HPA statistics also show lung, colon and breast cancer as the three leading diseases in that order for both men and women combined, with a standardized incidence rate of 323.3 people per 100,000 population. The ministry said this shows that patients coexist with cancer for a longer period of time and reflects an increased need to offer them more comprehensive care. While the primary goal of treatment has been on treatment, the MOHW said it is equally important to address the psychological and social needs of the patients themselves and their families. Cancer resource centers play a key role in this regard, the MOHW said, adding that it will continue to implement more projects to offer better people-centered care and services.

Taiwan tiger grouper shipment en route to Japan	The first shipment of Taiwan tiger groupers is heading to Japan after gaining approval for export last October, spotlighting government efforts to expand into new markets, the Ministry of Agriculture said Feb. 5. According to the MOA, the batch was procured by Osaka-based West Japan Railway Co. and will be sold in its Rail Kitchen Chikugo, as well as its hotels and supermarkets in Hokkaido and Kyoto prefectures and the Kyushu region. During the news conference announcing the shipment, MOA Minister Chen Junne-jih said the ministry provided rigorous evidence of the product's safety during several bilateral economic and trade conferences. The export approval reflects Japanese recognition of the groupers' quality, breeding management and water quality monitoring, Chen noted, adding that the development marks a milestone in access to the global market for Taiwan fishery products. The ministry will continue to promote domestically raised tiger groupers by ensuring a stable supply and enhancing Japanese consumers' awareness of Taiwan products, Chen said, adding that the MOA's Fisheries Agency will help more local businesses obtain export approval to Japan, while the Fisheries Research Institute will keep monitoring the breeding environment to ensure quality. The minister went on to say that the MOA will conduct market surveys, launch small sampler fish meat packages and hold promotional activities in Japan. Pingtung County Magistrate Chou Chun-mi noted that the southern Taiwan county is the largest grouper breeding area in the country, with an annual output of 7,206 metric tons and an annual output value of NT$1.89 billion (US$57.5 million). This latest shipment follows that of yellow groupers to Japan in 2023, she said.

SBNPM holds exhibition on Taoist immortal Lu Dongbin	The Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum is holding an exhibition featuring calligraphy and artifacts relating to Lu Dongbin, one of the Taoism's Eight Immortals, showcasing various interpretations of the immortals from sophisticated literary depictions to popular images of longevity and prosperity. According to the SBNPM, the Lu Dongbin legend emerged in the early 11th century with accounts of his miraculous manifestations. His spiritual legacy encompasses both literary work and spiritual practice, including distinctive sword techniques for overcoming worldly desire and emotional attachment. Titled &ldquo;Tracing the Taoist Immortal Lu Dongbin in the NPM collection,&rdquo; the exhibition's most important piece is the transcription of verses relating to the immortal character by Dong Qichang (1555-1636). The scroll is a rendition of Lu's poetry with a commentary, the SBNPM said, adding that Dong's brushwork centers on controlled tip movements and fluid transitions, creating lines that possess both vigor and grace. Through slightly asymmetrical, yet balanced character structures, expansive composition spacing and the dramatic interplay of ink and empty space, the work ultimately creates an ethereal and transcendent visual experience, the museum noted. The SBNPM said that other highlights of the exhibition are objects decorated with images of the eight immortals, including a gourd-shaped vase in blue underglaze, a vase with polychrome decoration and a round carved-polychrome lacquer box.

To this end, he cited the Four Pillars of Peace action plan, which involves strengthening national defense, building economic security, deepening partnerships with democratic countries, and maintaining stable and principled cross-strait leadership. The third mission is to improve the standard of living across the board, Lai said. He outlined a raft of measures spanning minimum wage increases, tax reductions, the national childcare policy for aged 0-6 and the Youth Overseas Dream Fund program, adding that the government will continue to care for the well-being of all segments of society while working with the private sector to bolster Taiwan's economic growth.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Italy’s Corriere Della Sera	Deputy Foreign Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu gave an interview to Massimo Franco of Italy's leading daily news media, Corriere Della Sera, in early January to stress the importance of a free and democratic Taiwan to global security. In an article published Jan. 26 by the media outlet, Wu compared Taiwan to 1938's Czechoslovakia, when it was the fifth largest industrial power in Europe and the tenth in the world. By taking over its industries through the Munich Agreement, Nazi Germany was able to pay for the start of the Second World War. This, Wu said, is what China wants to do with Taiwan: take over its semiconductor industry, which accounts for 90 percent of global production, and change the world. While Taiwan only has 12 diplomatic allies in the world, it maintains close political, economic and trade relationship with more than 100 countries, he said. Pointing out the production and technological leadership of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Wu said if Taiwan is invaded, factories around the world will shut down in weeks. Taiwan is fully aware of the threats and dangers from China and is preparing for the worst according to three guidelines: develop defensive capabilities; garner support from the free world; and make security in the Taiwan Strait an international rather than a regional issue. With regard to Taiwan-Vatican relations, Wu praised the Holy See as a unique religious entity with high moral standards, defending moral and religious freedom as an important mission. Based on diplomatic relations that have lasted more than 80 years, Taiwan will continue to maintain its close ties with the Holy See, Wu said.

Lai responds to pope’s World Day of Peace call	President Lai Ching-te sent a letter Jan. 31 to Pope Francis in response to his message marking the 58th World Day of Peace. In the letter, the president expressed support for the papal plea that the global community initiate a cultural shift that would bring an end to governing interpersonal and international relations through exploitation and oppression and herald true and lasting peace. According to Lai, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and convergence of authoritarian regimes threaten the rules-based international order and severely impact peace and stability both in the Indo-Pacific and around the world. Echoing the pope's belief that war means defeat for all, Lai said the international community has reached consensus on upholding cross-strait peace and stability, adding that Taiwan is committed to safeguarding its freedom, equality, democracy and respect for human rights. Taiwan is proactively implementing values-based diplomacy and the Diplomatic Allies Prosperity Project to accelerate the development of allied nations, Lai said, adding that the country helps alleviate poverty by strengthening basic infrastructure, transferring technology and cultivating talent. In response to the pope's call for a new global financial framework jointly addressing climate change, food crises and other challenges, Lai expressed hope that international organizations will stop excluding Taiwan for political reasons. Taiwan is willing and able to shoulder its international responsibility to contribute and share its valuable experience through global platforms, he added. The president concluded by saying that Taiwan will continue to collaborate with the Holy See to advance world peace through concrete action while jointly upholding the core values of justice, democracy, freedom and peace.

Taiwan artist to be featured in Illustrators Exhibition at Bologna Children’s Book Fair	&ldquo;Perhaps Trees Remember&rdquo; by Taiwan artist Ballboss has been selected to feature in the Illustrators Exhibition at the 2025 Bologna Children's Book Fair set to kick off March 31 in the Italian city, according to the Ministry of Culture. Published in December 2024 by Tainan City-based National Museum of Taiwan Literature in both Mandarin and Taiwanese, the book documents a community cultural asset preservation campaign that collected local stories and historical materials to set up the Taiwan Literature Base, which is housed in a compound in Taipei City dating from the Japanese colonial era (1895-1945). According to NMTL Director Chen Ying-fang, the illustrated book addresses issues spanning history, the environment, cultural assets and civic awareness, invoking universal values that resonate with readers. Its selection for the exhibition will serve as an excellent opportunity for global audiences to better understand Taiwan's vibrant literary landscape, she added. With a BA in theater arts from National Sun Yat-sen University and a masters in illustration from the U.K.'s Kingston University, Ballboss was also selected for the exhibition in 2019 and 2022. The artist said his latest work has special meaning to him due to the extensive field research and interviews he undertook to create it, adding that the Taiwanese version also presented a new challenge. Established in 1967 and considered one of the longest-running and most successful Bologna book fair initiatives, the exhibition attracted 21,870 submissions from 4,374 artists representing 89 countries and territories this year. The final selection came down to 76 artworks by 77 authors from 29 countries, and the winning works will be on display from March 31 to April 3, followed by a two-year global tour, the MOC said.
