Since the resolution does not exclude Taiwan's U.N. participation, Tien called on the global organization to seek proper arrangements for Taiwan to take part in its activities, meetings and mechanisms, so that Taiwan can contribute to fulfilling U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. Tien also said the U.N. Secretariat should adopt a neutral position and stop misusing the resolution to deprive the rights of Taiwan people and media to visit the U.N., take part in or cover its activities and meetings. To canvass more global support for Taiwan, Tien said the government will continue to appeal to its allies' permanent U.N. representatives to send joint letters to U.N. Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres and speak for Taiwan at related U.N. events. Equally importantly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung penned an article that has been published in various international mainstream media, highlighting how Taiwan's U.N. inclusion could secure peace in the Indo-Pacific. A short film entitled &ldquo;IC You&rdquo; was launched the same day to showcase Taiwan's technology and semiconductor manufacturing prowess, emphasizing the country's key role in global development. A number of sideline events will also be staged during the 79th assembly elucidating the case for Taiwan's U.N. participation, the ministry said.

Taiwan, Arizona ink MOU on industrial cooperation	Taiwan concluded a memorandum of understanding on industrial cooperation with the U.S. state of Arizona Sept. 2 in Taipei City, spotlighting their joint commitment to further cementing the bilateral partnership, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said. The accord was signed by Jeff Lin, CEO of the ministry's Taiwan-USA Industrial Cooperation Promotion Office, and Steve Hsu, representative of the Arizona-Taiwan Trade and Investment Office. The event was witnessed by Chen Pei-li, deputy director general of the MOEA's Industrial Development Administration, and Sandra Watson, president and CEO of Arizona Commerce Authority. Under the pact, the two sides will deepen unmanned aerial vehicle and semiconductor collaboration while boosting high-tech personnel exchanges. According to Chen, Taiwan and the U.S. should work together to build a supply chain free from China's influence for the sake of both sides' national security, as Beijing accounts for 60-70 percent of the global commercial drone market. The government provides subsidies for developing critical UAV components, including parts used in communications, flight control and artificial intelligence image recognition, she said, adding that the country also established the Asia UAV AI Innovation Application R&amp;D Center in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County to integrate resources from over 30 manufacturers. Equally important is strengthening the two sides' semiconductor equipment cooperation, which will lay the foundation for chip production, Chen said. She added that Taiwan has a proven track record in cultivating semiconductor personnel and that more exchanges and training are expected to further expand the joint talent pool. In response, Watson said her delegation includes representatives from prestigious schools such as Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University, adding that they will meet with counterparts from Industrial Technology Research Institute and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University during their visit. Lin additionally extolled the two sides' growing ties, as evidenced by the establishment of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s Arizona operations, and noted that ITRI's North America branch and the Chiayi UAV center inked an MOU on resource sharing in April. Hsu said Taiwan and Arizona share similar economic goals and industrial strengths, adding that the latest MOU demonstrates their solid alliance and common visions.

MOI stages symposium on environmentally conscious architecture	A forum on natural carbon sinks and low-carbon architecture was held by the Ministry of the Interior at National Chung Hsing University Sept. 2 in the central city of Taichung as part of ongoing government efforts to achieve net-zero emissions. In her opening remarks, MOI Minister Liu Shyh-fang said challenges to achieving Taiwan's policy goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 remain. The one-day event aimed to facilitate communication between the government, general public and business sector in order to address climate change mitigation issues, she added. According to Liu, national parks, wetlands and coastal areas, which all fall within the scope of the MOI, play a key role in capturing carbon dioxide. These areas are home to blue carbon ecosystems like tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrass meadows that are essential for carbon sequestration. Statistics show that the country's national parks are responsible for removing over 2 million tons of carbon emission equivalents (CO2e), the minister said, adding that blue carbon ecosystems account for 95,000 tons of CO2e. Based on satellite imagery, the MOI estimates a carbon sink loss of 3,821 tons of CO2e in Taroko National Park as a result of April's magnitude 7.4 earthquake in eastern Taiwan, she said, vowing that the MOI will step up efforts at other national parks and wetlands to make up the loss. Liu said low-carbon architecture is being promoted throughout the country and the MOI is making sure that social housing projects are certified as both green and smart buildings. She expects a total of 250,000 such housing units to reduce 112,300 tons of CO2e per year by 2032, with all other new public buildings set to achieve level 1 energy-efficiency standards by 2026.
