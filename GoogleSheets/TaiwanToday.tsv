FSC announces 2nd edition of sustainable economic activities guidelines	The Financial Supervisory Commission announced the second edition of the reference guidelines for the recognition of sustainable economic activities, as well as recommendations on carbon reduction transformation plans and related matters Dec. 31, 2024. According to the FSC, the commission has worked with multiple ministries to revise the guidelines and roll them out, along with associated recommendations to help enterprises and financial institutions identify sustainable economic activities and bolster their communications. The new guidelines now include the waste removal and resource recycling industry, as well as the agriculture and forestry industry, while also nearly doubling the list of recognized sustainable general economic activities. They also offer a method for calculating the sustainability proportion, allowing financial institutions to judge whether they meet the guidelines' requirements in the areas of loans, investments, asset management and property insurance. The guidelines explain that sustainable economic activities must make real contributions to any of six environmental goals: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainability and conservation of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and biodiversity conservation and restoration. Further, the activities may not cause major harm to any of the six goals or violate social security laws. If the economic activity of an enterprise only fulfills two of the three conditions, but it has already formulated an improvement plan, it can be called &ldquo;in transition.&rdquo; The FSC's recommendations enable enterprises to build their own improvement plans and have taken inspiration from international standards and practices. The commission looks forward to seeing these tools help companies enhance their sustainability.

The policy blueprint aims to build a society with zero tolerance for sexual harassment and that encourages more female involvement in decision making and public participation, among other goals. Cho said Taiwan tops Asia when it comes to experience in promoting gender equality, citing as examples revisions to the Sexual Harassment Prevention Act, Gender Equality in Employment Act and Gender Equity Education Act. he also mentioned achievements highlighted in activities and events organized by government agencies and ministries. In particular, the premier said new regulations allow more working individuals to take parental leave for work-family balance, while same-sex couples with one individual from China can now register marriage in Taiwan. Another achievement is the narrowing of the gender pay gap in Taiwan. The Ministry of Labor said the difference in pay between men and women decreased from 15.8 percent more for males in 2022 to 14.7 percent more in 2023. Statistics compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed that the medium pay gap for full-time workers in Taiwan averaged 15.3 percent in 2022, which is narrower than those of Canada, Finland, Japan, South Korea and the U.S. The premier directed agencies and ministries to continue reviewing projects on a regular basis, such as those to encourage more females to engage in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, eliminate gender barriers for women in careers and monitor the gender pay gap in all segments of society.

MOFA delivers 2024 report card	Taiwan has attained record recognition and support in 2024 on the strength of the government's steadfast, integrated and values-based diplomacy and the hard work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and associated overseas offices to defend the nation's dignity, interests and sovereignty, as well as the rights of its people. According to the MOFA, the year 2024 has been marked by persistent geopolitical turbulence and standoffs between democracies and authoritarian regimes, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and unsettling developments in the Middle East. Despite these global challenges, the ministry said Taiwan reached another milestone with its January presidential election and has continued to deepen relations with diplomatic allies and like-minded partners as an essential player in promoting stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. The country's resilience against authoritarian expansion and proactive contributions to global humanitarian efforts are widely recognized by the international community, the MOFA added. Highlights of the MOFA's efforts this year include arranging President Lai Ching-te's Smart and Sustainable Development for a Prosperous Austronesian Region tour in December to allies the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau, and Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung's visits to allies St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Guatemala, St. Lucia, Belize and St. Kitts and Nevis in October and to Belgium, Lithuania and Poland in November. The ministry said progress is similarly reflected in the country's relations with key partners such as Japan, the U.S. and the European Union, adding that support for Taiwan's global participation is also on the rise, with many commending Taiwan as a force for good in defending democratic values and cross-strait peace. Under the ministry's allied prosperity project and the president's promotion of the Five Trusted Industry Sectors, the MOFA will implement eight major initiatives to expand cooperative ties with friends of Taiwan in areas spanning new energy development and carbon rights, semiconductor supply chain resilience, smart agriculture, smart medicine, and sustainable tourism, among others. With geopolitics set to turn a new page in 2025, the MOFA said it will continue to conduct diplomatic affairs with confidence, resilience, professionalism and flexibility while sparing no effort in following the president's directives to show that Taiwan Can Help and Taiwan Can Lead.

Public and private sectors collaborate to protect birds’ habitats	Taijiang National Park in the southern city of Tainan celebrated 15 years in operation with the heartwarming story of a black-faced spoonbill that returns to Annan District every fall after being rescued by park staff. At the end of February 2015 a group of sick birds was spotted by workers at Taijiang. The endangered creatures were sent to the Ministry of Agriculture's Taiwan Biodiversity Research Institute in the central county of Nantou for care. Six birds recovered and were released to the wild a few weeks later. By April of that year a juvenile of the group with the tag number T69 was registered as present in Liaoning province in northeastern China. The National Park Service said that it was logged at fishponds in Annan District every October, displaying a touching fidelity to its winter habitat. In recent years Taijiang has worked to promote an expanded eco-friendly habitat in the areas surrounding the park by cooperating with local fish farmers. Forty-seven farmers have joined the project to date, covering an area of 248.57 hectares. This mode of cooperation has simultaneously facilitated development of the fishery industry and ecological conservation, the NPS added. Park Director Shieh Wei-sung emphasized that since the establishment of the park in 2009, it has been dedicated to the maintenance of habitats in the protected areas while actively building relations with corporations, neighboring communities and nongovernmental organizations to gradually forge a public-private preservation network. He concluded that the facility would continue to incorporate sustainable resources from businesses and construct environmentally friendly habitats to provide safer and richer surroundings for all migratory birds.

Deputy MODA minister attends AI summit in Belgium	Deputy Minister of Digital Affairs Lin Yi-jing attended the International Artificial Intelligence Summit held earlier this month in Brussels, Belgium to share the government's strategies in promoting this key sector. During his speech, Lin said the rapid development of AI technology has created tremendous possibilities for the global community and that harnessing the power of AI holds the key to the future. However, Lin cautioned that potential threats come together with breakthroughs. Lin said AI computation models are similar to human brain functions and are increasing speeds by a hundred-fold each year. He called on the free world to work in unity against potential AI endangerment of humanity. A concerted response will ensure the development of an AI ecosystem with good intentions to prevent the technology from abuse and manipulation, he added. Lin said AI's high costs and development mean that the technology is increasingly falling into the ownership of a few global high-tech powerhouses. He urged members of the global community to share technology and develop AI models in response to specific needs and circumstances. Citing Taiwan as an example, the deputy minister said the government is developing an AI model with local cultural and linguistic characteristics, and others catering to Taiwan's semiconductor industry, among other sectors. According to the MODA, Lin also took the opportunity to exchange views with other key participants in the event, such as U.S. AI Safety Institute Director Elizabeth Kelly and U.K. AI Safety Institute Director Oliver Ilott. Themed &ldquo;AI Equitable Access and Opportunity: AI for Inclusive Growth,&rdquo; the one-day event was organized by Forum Europe and involved panelists including Kenya Amb. to the EU Bitange Ndemo and Signe Ratso, deputy director-general for innovation, prosperity and international cooperation of the European Commission.

TAITRA outlines development strategies for 2025	Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) held a press event Dec. 26 in Taipei City to unveil its 2025 development strategies in response to new geopolitical challenges and economic uncertainties. During the event, TAITRA Chair James C.F. Huang said that given Taiwan's key position in the global supply chain, the inauguration of U.S. President Donald J. Trump will have a major effect on global tariffs, trade and logistics. The country's small- and medium-sized enterprises need to formulate new strategies since they will feel the greatest impact, he added. As a result, Huang said in 2025 TAITRA will step up research on geoeconomics and the U.S. market; promote the Five Trusted Industry Sectors unveiled by President Lai Ching-te in his inauguration speech in May; implement the Ministry of Economic Affairs' export promotion campaigns; and initiate a raft of events, such as trade shows at home and abroad, to help local firms stay ahead of technological development trends and tap into related business opportunities. Equally important, Huang said the council will continue to conduct geoeconomic surveys for its TAITRA Index, and include its global network for data collection. According to TAITRA, new initiatives for next year include the establishment of a trade center in Prague; additional staff at its Fukuoka office to promote the Taiwan Select brand; a Taiwan health industry exhibition center in Southeast Asia; a Taiwan Expo in the U.S. city of Dallas that focuses on artificial intelligence applications, advanced manufacturing and the health sector; and the launch of a new exhibition center in the central city of Taichung in the fourth quarter.

MOC launches initiative to preserve Taiwanese language	A plan to encourage families to speak Taiwanese in the home was announced by the Ministry of Culture Dec. 25 in Taipei City, highlighting the government's commitment to preserving the country's multilingual heritage. Prominent attendees at the launch ceremony included MOC Minister Li Yuan and Caring for Taiwan Foundation Chair Chou Ching-yu. Speaking at the event, Li voiced the hope that every national tongue would become widespread because language equality reflects the equity among different ethnic groups. Chou pointed out that a long-term focus on Mandarin has led to a gradual decrease in speakers of other national languages, adding that despite the passage of the Development of National Languages Act in 2019, Taiwanese does not have any specific law or organization to promote its use. The initiative is a response to an MOC survey conducted in 2020 that found a significant decline in Taiwanese as a first language among younger generations. Under the plan, households that comprise at least two members of different generations or are formed by a married couple can apply to become a Taiwanese-speaking family. Based on language proficiency, those who wish to improve their Taiwanese can register for the &ldquo;Taiwanese language learning family&rdquo; track, while those who are fluent can register for the &ldquo;Taiwanese culture family&rdquo; track, the MOC said, adding that status is granted after members complete required courses.

Premier Cho pledges to raise Taiwan cancer survival rates by 2030	As part of President Lai Ching-te's policy goal of building a healthier Taiwan, a drive to reduce the country's cancer deaths by one-third by 2030 will be implemented, the Executive Yuan said Dec. 24. During a cross-ministerial cancer prevention meeting at the EY, Premier Cho Jung-Tai said this will be achieved through a three-pronged approach: improving early-stage screening, focusing on genetic testing and precision medicine, and establishing a NT$10 billion (US$306.09 million) fund to develop new cancer drugs. According to Cho, statistics released Dec. 19 by the Ministry of Health and Welfare showed that in 2022, more than 130,000 Taiwan citizens were diagnosed with cancer for the first time, up 8,500 from the year before. The MOHW attributed the increase to the fact that more individuals undertook screening and received treatment following the slowdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many causes contributed to cancer, the premier said MOHW findings acknowledged the importance of early screening, which allows patients time to seek treatment and thus improve survival rates. In particular, as chewing betel nut is a major cause of oral cancers, Cho said there should be clear laws to regulate the crops' consumption and manage the plantations. He directed the Ministry of Agriculture and other agencies to work together to review progress so far and propose measures, such as public awareness campaigns on its health hazards and guidelines to phase out betel nut plantations. Starting in 2025, the government will offer subsidies to screen for lung, breast, colon and cervical cancer and for human papillomavirus to an expanded demographic.

Taiwan’s GDP forecast to grow 3.1 percent in 2025	Taiwan's economy is projected to grow 3.1 percent in 2025 on the strength of reviving demand for electronic products and expanding high-speed computing and artificial intelligence applications, Academia Sinica said Dec. 23. According to AS, Taiwan's annual growth rates for real exports and imports of goods and services in 2025 are forecast at 6.53 percent and 7.17 percent, respectively, as the country's increasingly important role in the AI hardware supply chain drives a sustained rise in foreign trade. However, the institution cautioned that U.S. tariff policies may pose uncertainties for Taiwan's export performance. As for private investment, AS said the real annual growth rate is estimated at 5.46 percent due to robust demand for automation, AI-driven opportunities and low-carbon development trends, along with increasing investments from international corporations in Taiwan. Similarly, investment in public infrastructure is also expected to steadily increase, it added. Real private consumption is expected to see modest growth of 2.02 percent in 2025, AS said. Adjustments in minimum wage and military, government and education salaries, along with strong corporate profitability in 2024, are expected to support private consumption, though an increase could be mitigated by uncertainties such as heightened stock market volatility, it added. In addition, AS statistics showed that the unemployment rate for 2025 is projected at 3.26 percent, down from 3.37 percent in 2024, while the inflationary pressures are expected to persist next year. The global economic environment is anticipated to face higher uncertainty in 2025, with concerns spanning the intensity of U.S. trade protectionism and acceleration of supply chain restructuring and market fragmentation, AS said, adding that Taiwan must work to transform these challenges into opportunities.

Taiwan readies for carbon fee collection	The National Development Council said Dec. 19 that all relevant government agencies will work hand in hand to implement a carbon pricing system set to take effect in 2025, following a briefing by the Ministry of Environment on the new policy measure. According to three regulations drafted by the MOENV in August this year, during the initial stage the fees will be levied on about 281 power and gas suppliers and manufacturing firms that emit the equivalent of more than 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Starting Jan. 1, 2025, entities must calculate their annual greenhouse gas emissions and pay their carbon fees by the end of May the next year. Compared to the standard fee of NT$300 (US$9.18) per ton, there are also preferential rates to entities that submit self-determined reduction plans that include strategies such as a switching to low-carbon fuels, adopting negative emission technology, improving energy efficiency, using renewable energy or enhancing industrial processes. The NDC said the system aims to reduce carbon emissions and drive net-zero transition for Taiwan's industrial sector. If all relevant entities submit self-determined reduction plans, the NDC expects collective carbon emissions to be cut by 37 million tons by 2030, which will help achieve Taiwan's intended nationally determined contribution of carbon emissions. To this end, the MOENV has held seven briefings on carbon fee regulations and organized seminars with local governments throughout the country. The NDC said more measures are in the pipeline to enhance public consensus and bring Taiwan's regulations in line with global standards, so that the system will play a key role in driving green growth for a better future for all.

According to the Ministry of Culture, the forum's title references a diving technique that gradually releases inert gases from body tissues as a metaphor for resilience under pressure. The in-depth panel discussions aimed to break established norms by raising critical voices and proposing unconventional modes of cultural production in an increasingly turbulent world, the ministry added. In the &ldquo;Rice and Breadfruit: An Acquired Taste of Empire&rdquo; session, panelists discussed global and local food systems and their alternatives and impacts, while &ldquo;Art, Politics and Communion in the Age of Radical Appropriation&rdquo; unveiled how art helps sustain systemic inequality and envisioned a new kind of artistic practice that would support a more egalitarian future. This was followed by &ldquo;Breath and Belonging: Navigating Migration, Memory and Cinema,&rdquo; in which panelists described how they incorporated the themes of diaspora and migration in their politically charged work. Finally, &ldquo;Toy Volcano&rdquo; examined the skepticism and paranoia of technical media and the parallels between physical landscapes through the lens of animation theory and machinic delusions. Launched in 2007 by National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in central Taiwan's Taichung City, the biennial event aims to explore how a multiplicity of perspectives has come to inform contemporary reality and how that reality, characterized by a high degree of ambiguity, has in turn enriched Asian cultural perspectives. Themed &ldquo;How To Hold Your Breath&rdquo; and running through March 2, 2025, this year's festival showcases 83 works by 35 artists and groups from over 20 countries. Starting Dec. 21, the biennial will screen the &ldquo;How Breath Moves&rdquo; cinematic program featuring eight films and pre- and post-screening discussions.

NSTC unveils new carbon capture, conversion technologies	A research team from National Taiwan University has successfully developed pioneering technologies in membrane-based carbon capture and electrochemical carbon conversion, according to the National Science and Technology Council Dec. 11. Supported by the NSTC's net-zero emission program, the NTU ZERO team comprises chemical engineering and chemistry experts from the Taipei City-based university. In particular, the team has established a pilot production machine capable of converting carbon dioxide into upstream chemical products, with a processing capacity of 50 kilograms of CO2 per day. According to the NSTC, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas currently produce most of Taiwan's energy supply, while thermal power generation accounts for 14 percent of the country's carbon emissions, with industrial emissions making up 55 percent of the total. Both the sources can utilize the new carbon capture technology for reuse or storage, the council added. Based on the NTU team's calculations, the efficiency of the most widely adopted carbon capture technology is only about 60 percent given its method and choice of absorbents. In comparison, the NTU team developed an innovative ultramicroporous metal-organic framework that can absorb CO2 with an estimated efficiency of nearly 90 percent. Equally impressive, the NSTC said the team has developed a high efficiency electrochemical process that can convert CO2 into syngas, formic acid, ethanol or ethylene, which are all higher-value chemical compounds with negative carbon footprints. Its low power consumption and high selectivity also reduce the energy and cost of subsequent product purification, the council added. The NSTC expects the positive development will inspire more domestic industries to invest in related initiatives and help contribute to the government's goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2025.

Taiwan welcomes 7 million foreign visitors to date	More than 7 million foreign nationals have visited Taiwan as of Dec. 3 this year, with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Tourism Administration expecting the upward trend to continue for the rest of the year. TA statistics shows that Japan is back as the leading source of travelers and accounts for 1.18 million arrivals, followed by Hong Kong and Macau with 1.16 million arrivals, and South Korea with nearly 0.9 million visits. Thanks to additional flights on existing routes and new ones, as well as a variety of promotion campaigns, the U.S. is now the fourth largest traveler source with nearly 0.6 million arrivals, surpassing pre-pandemic numbers. The agency attributed the strong performances to the success of key policy initiatives promoting Taiwan as a top vacation destination. Some examples include the establishment of offices so far this year in Jakarta, Mumbai, Paris and Vancouver. The TA said a new tourism information center will open for business Dec. 20 in Manila, while two new ones are being planned for Seattle and Sydney next year. Seven travel sites and two firms from Taiwan are among the 2024 Green Destinations Top 100 Stories presented by the Netherlands-based Green Destinations Foundation, the TA said. To build on these results, the government will continue to create low-carbon travel destinations and promote Taiwan as a top choice for green and sustainable tourism. Tourism is a key sector in government strategy, with new promotional initiatives such as the &ldquo;Taiwan, Waves of Wonder&rdquo; overseas campaign, subsidies for domestic travel and joint promotional projects with local governments. Based on all these factors, the TA expects to see the sector create NT$1 trillion (US$30.86 billion) in output by 2028.
