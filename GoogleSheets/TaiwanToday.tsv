Two patrol boats were also launched, the PP-10096 and PP-3525, with the former being the CGA's largest such vessel at 100 tons and the latter the fastest at 35 tons. Speaking at the ceremony, Cho thanked the Kaohsiung-based Jong Shyn Shipbuilding Co. for its part in advancing the government's indigenous shipbuilding project. He added that the corporation's work has helped forge a solid foundation for coastal defense while stimulating the development of the domestic sector.

President Lai receives Reagan Foundation delegation	President Lai Ching-te said Jan. 9 that Taiwan would implement the Four Pillars of Peace action plan to ensure regional peace and contribute to global prosperity. Lai met with a delegation from the California-based Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute led by its president, David Trulio, at the Presidential Office in Taipei City. Former U.S. President Reagan was a strong supporter and friend of Taiwan, Lai said, adding that the Six Assurances were proposed by Reagan in 1982 and the Taiwan Relations Act was passed by the U.S. Congress in 1979 and both have served as a firm basis for bilateral ties. Reagan's belief in peace through strength is vital at a time when authoritarian regimes are in the ascendant, Lai said. The rise of autocratic states shows the importance of unity between democracies to maintain rules-based international order, Lai added. Lai conveyed gratitude to Trulio and the foundation for backing Taiwan despite China's threats and anticipated furthering Taiwan-U.S. relations through working with the institute. He also thanked the foundation for the warm reception offered to former President Tsai Ing-wen during her stopover in California, April 2023. In response, Trulio said that the visit comes at a critical juncture as the U.S. prepares to transition to a new administration. The delegation has been impressed with Taiwan's vibrant democracy and its leading position in global economy and technology, he added. The robust two-way partnership and U.S. defense deterrence are indispensable to security across the Taiwan Strait, Truio noted. He concluded by anticipating that the two sides would continue to work together to fulfill mutual commitments to upholding democracy, freedom and stability.

ITH Director Chung Shu-min mentioned at the event that a collection of papers presented in the last workshop is to be published soon. NHRM Deputy Director Chen Shu-man said in her remarks that it is the museum's responsibility to clarify the historical truth of the period and disseminate it through exhibitions and education. The museum's work also plays a vital role in realizing the country's transitional justice, she added. According to Chen, the two bodies have also been in cooperation since 2017 to compile and streamline White Terror period information resources into an online search platform called Taiwan Human Rights Memory Bank. The resources are categorized into the five main areas of people, events and cases, institutions and organizations, laws and systems, and search terms. The White Terror refers to a period from 1949 to 1987 in Taiwan and 1992 in the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu islands during which the government declared martial law and suppressed and prosecuted political dissidents.

Taiwan ports deliver 2024 report card	Taiwan's nine ports recorded 690 million revenue tons in cargo handled and 13.92 million twenty-foot equivalent units in container throughput in 2024, creating record revenues of NT$22.8 billion (US$692.17 million) for Taiwan International Ports Corp. Ltd., the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said Jan. 9 in a press release. TIPC Chair Lee Hsien-yi praised the results, especially in a year of daunting challenges including a lower global economic growth rate, the Red Sea crisis and Russia-Ukraine war on the global front, as well as natural disasters with domestic impact such as October's Typhoon Krathon and the magnitude 7.2 earthquake that hit the eastern county of Hualien in April. Lee attributed the strong performance to the company's efforts to expand its core businesses while aggressively diversifying into other areas such as offshore wind power generation, waterfront development projects and various reinvestment strategies. The chair described Terminal 7 of Kaohsiung Port, the country's first smart, automated terminal, as vital to 2024's success in addition to being foundational for future trade: it can berth four 24,000-TEU container ships at the same time with an annual handling volume of 6.5 million TEUs. Other highlights included land reclamation at Taipei Port's logistics zone, a new wharf at Anping Port and passenger terminal upgrades at Suao Port and Hualien Port. Over the course of the year TIPC also introduced a raft of measures and artificial intelligence-based technologies to enhance power consumption management, ensure navigation safety, expedite logistics services and reduce carbon emissions, Lee added. Lee said key TIPC development projects for 2025 include renovations of Kaohsiung Port's Terminal 3 and Terminal 5, more land reclamation at Taipei Port and passenger clearance facility improvement at Penghu Port. He added that these efforts are expected to help increase local ports' total cargo handling volume by 3 percent, attract one million passenger arrivals, incur NT$3.37 billion in investment and create 1,300 new jobs in the process.

FSC announces 2nd edition of sustainable economic activities guidelines	The Financial Supervisory Commission announced the second edition of the reference guidelines for the recognition of sustainable economic activities, as well as recommendations on carbon reduction transformation plans and related matters Dec. 31, 2024. According to the FSC, the commission has worked with multiple ministries to revise the guidelines and roll them out, along with associated recommendations to help enterprises and financial institutions identify sustainable economic activities and bolster their communications. The new guidelines now include the waste removal and resource recycling industry, as well as the agriculture and forestry industry, while also nearly doubling the list of recognized sustainable general economic activities. They also offer a method for calculating the sustainability proportion, allowing financial institutions to judge whether they meet the guidelines' requirements in the areas of loans, investments, asset management and property insurance. The guidelines explain that sustainable economic activities must make real contributions to any of six environmental goals: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainability and conservation of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and biodiversity conservation and restoration. Further, the activities may not cause major harm to any of the six goals or violate social security laws. If the economic activity of an enterprise only fulfills two of the three conditions, but it has already formulated an improvement plan, it can be called &ldquo;in transition.&rdquo; The FSC's recommendations enable enterprises to build their own improvement plans and have taken inspiration from international standards and practices. The commission looks forward to seeing these tools help companies enhance their sustainability.

Deputy MODA minister attends AI summit in Belgium	Deputy Minister of Digital Affairs Lin Yi-jing attended the International Artificial Intelligence Summit held earlier this month in Brussels, Belgium to share the government's strategies in promoting this key sector. During his speech, Lin said the rapid development of AI technology has created tremendous possibilities for the global community and that harnessing the power of AI holds the key to the future. However, Lin cautioned that potential threats come together with breakthroughs. Lin said AI computation models are similar to human brain functions and are increasing speeds by a hundred-fold each year. He called on the free world to work in unity against potential AI endangerment of humanity. A concerted response will ensure the development of an AI ecosystem with good intentions to prevent the technology from abuse and manipulation, he added. Lin said AI's high costs and development mean that the technology is increasingly falling into the ownership of a few global high-tech powerhouses. He urged members of the global community to share technology and develop AI models in response to specific needs and circumstances. Citing Taiwan as an example, the deputy minister said the government is developing an AI model with local cultural and linguistic characteristics, and others catering to Taiwan's semiconductor industry, among other sectors. According to the MODA, Lin also took the opportunity to exchange views with other key participants in the event, such as U.S. AI Safety Institute Director Elizabeth Kelly and U.K. AI Safety Institute Director Oliver Ilott. Themed &ldquo;AI Equitable Access and Opportunity: AI for Inclusive Growth,&rdquo; the one-day event was organized by Forum Europe and involved panelists including Kenya Amb. to the EU Bitange Ndemo and Signe Ratso, deputy director-general for innovation, prosperity and international cooperation of the European Commission.

TAITRA outlines development strategies for 2025	Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) held a press event Dec. 26 in Taipei City to unveil its 2025 development strategies in response to new geopolitical challenges and economic uncertainties. During the event, TAITRA Chair James C.F. Huang said that given Taiwan's key position in the global supply chain, the inauguration of U.S. President Donald J. Trump will have a major effect on global tariffs, trade and logistics. The country's small- and medium-sized enterprises need to formulate new strategies since they will feel the greatest impact, he added. As a result, Huang said in 2025 TAITRA will step up research on geoeconomics and the U.S. market; promote the Five Trusted Industry Sectors unveiled by President Lai Ching-te in his inauguration speech in May; implement the Ministry of Economic Affairs' export promotion campaigns; and initiate a raft of events, such as trade shows at home and abroad, to help local firms stay ahead of technological development trends and tap into related business opportunities. Equally important, Huang said the council will continue to conduct geoeconomic surveys for its TAITRA Index, and include its global network for data collection. According to TAITRA, new initiatives for next year include the establishment of a trade center in Prague; additional staff at its Fukuoka office to promote the Taiwan Select brand; a Taiwan health industry exhibition center in Southeast Asia; a Taiwan Expo in the U.S. city of Dallas that focuses on artificial intelligence applications, advanced manufacturing and the health sector; and the launch of a new exhibition center in the central city of Taichung in the fourth quarter.

MOC launches initiative to preserve Taiwanese language	A plan to encourage families to speak Taiwanese in the home was announced by the Ministry of Culture Dec. 25 in Taipei City, highlighting the government's commitment to preserving the country's multilingual heritage. Prominent attendees at the launch ceremony included MOC Minister Li Yuan and Caring for Taiwan Foundation Chair Chou Ching-yu. Speaking at the event, Li voiced the hope that every national tongue would become widespread because language equality reflects the equity among different ethnic groups. Chou pointed out that a long-term focus on Mandarin has led to a gradual decrease in speakers of other national languages, adding that despite the passage of the Development of National Languages Act in 2019, Taiwanese does not have any specific law or organization to promote its use. The initiative is a response to an MOC survey conducted in 2020 that found a significant decline in Taiwanese as a first language among younger generations. Under the plan, households that comprise at least two members of different generations or are formed by a married couple can apply to become a Taiwanese-speaking family. Based on language proficiency, those who wish to improve their Taiwanese can register for the &ldquo;Taiwanese language learning family&rdquo; track, while those who are fluent can register for the &ldquo;Taiwanese culture family&rdquo; track, the MOC said, adding that status is granted after members complete required courses.

MOENV promotes plastic-reduction rules in hotel, accommodation sector	The Ministry of Environment held a news conference Dec. 24 to call attention to regulations coming into effect Jan. 1, 2025, to require hotels and other types of accommodation to use less plastic. According to the MOENV, operators will not be permitted to proactively provide six kinds of personal hygiene products: combs, razors, shaving foam, shower caps, toothbrushes and toothpaste. They are also required to put shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and lotion into large bottles starting no later than Jan. 1. Speaking at the event, Environment Minister Peng Chi-ming said the measure responds to the global demand for carbon and plastic reduction. He added that it also aligns with the sustainable development concept proposed by the 2024 Paris Olympics. To help operators comply, the MOENV said over 50 meetings will be held by the environmental bureaus of cities and counties around Taiwan, with various activities hosted and advertisements posted to expand public understanding of the measure. The ministry expects 460 million items to be saved each year, the equivalent of reducing carbon emissions by 2,500 metric tons.

Premier Cho pledges to raise Taiwan cancer survival rates by 2030	As part of President Lai Ching-te's policy goal of building a healthier Taiwan, a drive to reduce the country's cancer deaths by one-third by 2030 will be implemented, the Executive Yuan said Dec. 24. During a cross-ministerial cancer prevention meeting at the EY, Premier Cho Jung-Tai said this will be achieved through a three-pronged approach: improving early-stage screening, focusing on genetic testing and precision medicine, and establishing a NT$10 billion (US$306.09 million) fund to develop new cancer drugs. According to Cho, statistics released Dec. 19 by the Ministry of Health and Welfare showed that in 2022, more than 130,000 Taiwan citizens were diagnosed with cancer for the first time, up 8,500 from the year before. The MOHW attributed the increase to the fact that more individuals undertook screening and received treatment following the slowdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many causes contributed to cancer, the premier said MOHW findings acknowledged the importance of early screening, which allows patients time to seek treatment and thus improve survival rates. In particular, as chewing betel nut is a major cause of oral cancers, Cho said there should be clear laws to regulate the crops' consumption and manage the plantations. He directed the Ministry of Agriculture and other agencies to work together to review progress so far and propose measures, such as public awareness campaigns on its health hazards and guidelines to phase out betel nut plantations. Starting in 2025, the government will offer subsidies to screen for lung, breast, colon and cervical cancer and for human papillomavirus to an expanded demographic. These include a NT$4,000 subsidy every two years for low-dose computed tomography scan for lung cancer screening for heavy smokers aged 50-74 who consume at least 20 packs of cigarettes per year, as well as women aged 40-74 and men aged 45-74 whose direct family members have been diagnosed with lung cancer.

Taiwan’s GDP forecast to grow 3.1 percent in 2025	Taiwan's economy is projected to grow 3.1 percent in 2025 on the strength of reviving demand for electronic products and expanding high-speed computing and artificial intelligence applications, Academia Sinica said Dec. 23. According to AS, Taiwan's annual growth rates for real exports and imports of goods and services in 2025 are forecast at 6.53 percent and 7.17 percent, respectively, as the country's increasingly important role in the AI hardware supply chain drives a sustained rise in foreign trade. However, the institution cautioned that U.S. tariff policies may pose uncertainties for Taiwan's export performance. As for private investment, AS said the real annual growth rate is estimated at 5.46 percent due to robust demand for automation, AI-driven opportunities and low-carbon development trends, along with increasing investments from international corporations in Taiwan. Similarly, investment in public infrastructure is also expected to steadily increase, it added. Real private consumption is expected to see modest growth of 2.02 percent in 2025, AS said. Adjustments in minimum wage and military, government and education salaries, along with strong corporate profitability in 2024, are expected to support private consumption, though an increase could be mitigated by uncertainties such as heightened stock market volatility, it added. In addition, AS statistics showed that the unemployment rate for 2025 is projected at 3.26 percent, down from 3.37 percent in 2024, while the inflationary pressures are expected to persist next year. The global economic environment is anticipated to face higher uncertainty in 2025, with concerns spanning the intensity of U.S. trade protectionism and acceleration of supply chain restructuring and market fragmentation, AS said, adding that Taiwan must work to transform these challenges into opportunities.
