The NSTC and Academia Sinica jointly signed an academic cooperative agreement with the EMBC and European Molecular Biology Organization in 2012.

On behalf of the NSTC and Academia Sinica, James C. Liao, the institute's president, signed the associate member pact at the end of October during the EMBO's 60th anniversary meeting, where he delivered a speech on increasing carbon fixation. EMBO Director Fiona Watt remarked that more than a dozen outstanding scientists from Taiwan have been selected as EMBO Global Investigator Scholars and EMBO Young Investigator Scholars. She added that the arrangement would open more opportunities for joint efforts between Taiwan and European academics in life sciences. EMBC, founded in 1969, serves its 31 member nations as a cooperative platform for molecular biology research. Established in 1964, EMBO's main mission is to execute EMBC projects to enhance and stimulate the development of molecular biology both within and beyond Europe. Academia Sinica noted that Taiwan is the third nation to become an associate member, following Singapore and India.

Lai emphasizes strength through unity in National Day address	President Lai Ching-te delivered the National Day address in front of the Presidential Office Oct. 10 in Taipei City, vowing to make Taiwan a stronger force for regional peace, stability and prosperity. At the celebration of the 113rd anniversary of the founding of the ROC (Taiwan), Lai said the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other.

To this end, Lai pledged to safeguard lives and property by implementation of the four pillars of peace action plan; by further developing the economy and expanding investment in social care. He cited three government committees established at the Presidential Office: climate change, health promotion and whole-of-society defense resilience, which deal with challenges like extreme weather and advance net-zero transition by 2050. According to Lai, Taiwan is committed to strengthening resilience in national defense, economic livelihood, disaster prevention and democracy. The country is resolved to uphold cross-strait peace and stability and achieve global security and prosperity, he said, adding that Taiwan is willing to work with China on addressing global issues and called on Beijing to apply its influence to end conflicts like Russia's invasion of Ukraine and to shoulder international responsibility. The president went on to elaborate on ways to promote the country's economic development, achieve regional balance and ensure people's well-being across generations. The government will further develop the five trusted industry sectors, expedite improvements to the safety of the national road network and implement measures including childcare for ages 0-6 and long-term care, among other tasks, while combatting fraud and housing speculation, he said. Lai concluded by saying that the people of Taiwan share common convictions so their determination to defend national sovereignty and to protect their free and democratic way of life remain unchanged. The stronger the commitment of the Taiwan people, the greater the tenacity of democracy around the world, and vice versa, he added.

Alexander Tah-ray Yui, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., also attended the event, holding a dialogue with Keith Krach, former U.S. undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment, on ways to maintain cross-strait peace and security. Responses to the campaign for UN inclusion have been strong, with MOFA Minister Lin Chia-lung's op-ed calling on like-minded partners to unite against authoritarianism and support Taiwan's participation in global organizations, reported on 455 times by major media outlets from countries including Canada, Eswatini, France, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Poland, Sweden, Spain, the EU and the U.S., among others. A short film made by the ministry titled &ldquo;IC You,&rdquo; which showcases Taiwan's technology and semiconductor manufacturing prowess, has garnered 25.40 million views since its release, with a total of 2,922 social media campaign posts obtaining 48.378 million views and an animation titled &ldquo;United&mdash;Global Peace with Taiwan&rdquo; broadcasting in Time Square. The MOFA reiterated that U.N. Resolution 2758 did not mention Taiwan and must not to be used as a basis to exclude the country from taking part in U.N. special agencies and global organizations. Taiwan is committed to contributing to the global community and its exclusion is a loss for all and undermines achievement of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, the ministry said, urging the U.N. to stop succumbing to China's pressure and to include Taiwan to fulfill its principle of leaving no one behind.

President Lai receives German Marshall Fund delegation from the US	President Lai Ching-te said Oct. 4 that Taiwan is committed to enhancing resilience in the defense, economic and disaster prevention spheres as it works with like-minded democratic partners to counteract authoritarian expansionism. The president made the remarks while receiving a delegation from the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a Washington-based think tank. The group was led by Heather A. Conley, senior advisor to the board of trustees, and included Chair Christopher Schroeder and other senior staffers, as well as Francesco M. Tal&ograve;, former permanent representative of Italy to NATO, and Rajmund Andrzejczak, former chief of the general staff of the Polish Armed Forces. According to Lai, Taiwan is increasing its defense budget to safeguard regional stability and ensure the sustainable development of democracy as a result of its observation of China's persistent political intimidation and military aggression in the East and South China Seas in an attempt to change the rules-based international order. The president noted that the U.S. has also continued to coordinate with its allies to reiterate the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He took the opportunity to thank former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Jessica Lewis, in attendance with the GMF delegation, for her tremendous assistance in facilitating the U.S. government's provision of defense capabilities to Taiwan. Lai stated that he hopes to see Taiwan resolve the double taxation issue with the U.S. to further advance trade ties, and mentioned plans to conclude an investment agreement with the EU to bolster economic exchanges and cooperation. The president thanked the think tank for paying close attention to cross-strait issues, as evidenced by its research report saying that China has distorted UNGA Resolution 2758 and improperly linked it with its &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Such staunch support is sincerely appreciated by the government and people, he said. During her meeting with the group earlier the same day, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim said Typhoon Krathon and Hurricane Helene serve as reminders that society must strengthen its resilience to natural disasters and other challenges. She welcomed the delegates' visit and said Taiwan looks forward to working with its partners in the U.S. and Europe to expand cooperation and exchanges in bolstering social resilience and related issues.
