MOFA thanks US, Canada for supporting cross-strait peace, stability	The routine transit Oct. 20 of the Taiwan Strait by the U.S. Navy's guided-missile destroyer USS Higgins and Royal Canadian Navy's frigate HMCS Vancouver is sincerely appreciated by the government and people of Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Oct. 21. In a statement on its official website, the U.S. 7th Fleet said the move demonstrated the commitment by the two sides to upholding the principle of freedom of navigation for all nations. The Canadian Joint Operations Command tweeted that the activities promoted peace, resilience and security in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. 7th Fleet said the freedom of navigation and overflight on the high seas applied to their route in accordance with international law, and that the global community's navigational rights and freedoms in the strait should not be limited. The statement concluded with a rejection of any assertion of sovereignty or jurisdiction that is inconsistent with freedoms of navigation, overflight and other lawful uses of the sea and air. This marks the fourth joint transit of the two North American countries in the past two years and reflects the dedication of members of the free world to maintaining cross-strait peace, the MOFA said. The government of Taiwan will continue to enhance its self-defense capabilities against authoritarian expansion while expanding cooperation with its like-minded partners to defend the rules-based international order and ensure peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, the ministry added.

Lai emphasizes strength through unity in National Day address	President Lai Ching-te delivered the National Day address in front of the Presidential Office Oct. 10 in Taipei City, vowing to make Taiwan a stronger force for regional peace, stability and prosperity. At the celebration of the 113rd anniversary of the founding of the ROC (Taiwan), Lai said the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other.

The government will further develop the five trusted industry sectors, expedite improvements to the safety of the national road network and implement measures including childcare for ages 0-6 and long-term care, among other tasks, while combatting fraud and housing speculation, he said. Lai concluded by saying that the people of Taiwan share common convictions so their determination to defend national sovereignty and to protect their free and democratic way of life remain unchanged. The stronger the commitment of the Taiwan people, the greater the tenacity of democracy around the world, and vice versa, he added.

MOFA thanks allies, partners for backing Taiwan’s UN participation	Support from the global community for Taiwan's bid to participate in the activities, mechanisms and meetings of the U.N. is sincerely appreciated by the government of Taiwan, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Oct. 4. According to the MOFA, top-level officials from Taiwan's allies including Belize, Eswatini, Marshall Islands, Palau, Paraguay, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and Grenadines and Tuvalu spoke in support of Taiwan during the U.N. General Debate and Summit of the Future Sept. 20-30 in New York. Among them, Palau, Marshall Islands, St. Lucia and Tuvalu pointed out that the U.N. resolution 2758 did not exclude Taiwan from participating in U.N. specialized agencies, the ministry said. Leaders and high-level officials from like-minded partners stressed the importance of maintaining cross-strait peace and stability, the MOFA said, citing remarks made by U.S. President Joe Biden and Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs Penny Wong during the General Debate. Other similar sentiments were expressed by a joint statement released after the Group of Seven's foreign ministers' meeting at the high-level week of the UN General Assembly, the ministry added. The fact that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell condemned China's distortion and misuse of U.N. Resolution 2758 to suppress Taiwan during a congressional hearing and Caspar Veldkamp, minister of foreign affairs of the Netherlands, said during a congressional inquiry that the resolution does not involve Taiwan, are both deeply appreciated, the MOFA said. Other nations' parliamentarians also showed their support through various means, the MOFA said, citing a resolution passed by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China on UN Resolution 2758 in July. The MOFA also reported that the legislative branches of Australia, Guatemala and the Netherlands greenlighted motions voicing support of Taiwan based on the IPAC resolution. In UN inclusion-related activities, President Lai Ching-te delivered a video address to the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit, calling for global support of Taiwan's international participation. Alexander Tah-ray Yui, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., also attended the event, holding a dialogue with Keith Krach, former U.S. undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment, on ways to maintain cross-strait peace and security. Responses to the campaign for UN inclusion have been strong, with MOFA Minister Lin Chia-lung's op-ed calling on like-minded partners to unite against authoritarianism and support Taiwan's participation in global organizations, reported on 455 times by major media outlets from countries including Canada, Eswatini, France, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Poland, Sweden, Spain, the EU and the U.S., among others. A short film made by the ministry titled &ldquo;IC You,&rdquo; which showcases Taiwan's technology and semiconductor manufacturing prowess, has garnered 25.40 million views since its release, with a total of 2,922 social media campaign posts obtaining 48.378 million views and an animation titled &ldquo;United&mdash;Global Peace with Taiwan&rdquo; broadcasting in Time Square. The MOFA reiterated that U.N. Resolution 2758 did not mention Taiwan and must not to be used as a basis to exclude the country from taking part in U.N. special agencies and global organizations. Taiwan is committed to contributing to the global community and its exclusion is a loss for all and undermines achievement of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, the ministry said, urging the U.N. to stop succumbing to China's pressure and to include Taiwan to fulfill its principle of leaving no one behind.

President Lai receives German Marshall Fund delegation from the US	President Lai Ching-te said Oct. 4 that Taiwan is committed to enhancing resilience in the defense, economic and disaster prevention spheres as it works with like-minded democratic partners to counteract authoritarian expansionism. The president made the remarks while receiving a delegation from the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a Washington-based think tank. The group was led by Heather A. Conley, senior advisor to the board of trustees, and included Chair Christopher Schroeder and other senior staffers, as well as Francesco M. Tal&ograve;, former permanent representative of Italy to NATO, and Rajmund Andrzejczak, former chief of the general staff of the Polish Armed Forces. According to Lai, Taiwan is increasing its defense budget to safeguard regional stability and ensure the sustainable development of democracy as a result of its observation of China's persistent political intimidation and military aggression in the East and South China Seas in an attempt to change the rules-based international order. The president noted that the U.S. has also continued to coordinate with its allies to reiterate the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He took the opportunity to thank former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Jessica Lewis, in attendance with the GMF delegation, for her tremendous assistance in facilitating the U.S. government's provision of defense capabilities to Taiwan. Lai stated that he hopes to see Taiwan resolve the double taxation issue with the U.S. to further advance trade ties, and mentioned plans to conclude an investment agreement with the EU to bolster economic exchanges and cooperation. The president thanked the think tank for paying close attention to cross-strait issues, as evidenced by its research report saying that China has distorted UNGA Resolution 2758 and improperly linked it with its &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Such staunch support is sincerely appreciated by the government and people, he said. During her meeting with the group earlier the same day, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim said Typhoon Krathon and Hurricane Helene serve as reminders that society must strengthen its resilience to natural disasters and other challenges. She welcomed the delegates' visit and said Taiwan looks forward to working with its partners in the U.S. and Europe to expand cooperation and exchanges in bolstering social resilience and related issues.

Taiwan sets strictest air pollution regulations in Asia	The Ministry of Environment announced amendments to Taiwan's Air Quality Standards Sept. 30 to bring the country's regulations more in line with global practices and offer better health protections to the public. According to the MOENV, the new regulations lower the maximum hourly, daily and yearly levels of pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide. In particular, the daily average threshold of PM 2.5 has been cut from 35 micrograms per cubic meter to 30 mcg/m3 and the yearly average threshold has dropped from 15 mcg/m3 to 12 mcg/m3, making them the strictest limits in Asia, the ministry said. The changes also update rules for air quality readings to provide a more accurate reflection of conditions starting Jan. 1, 2025. The ministry highlighted that according to data from 2021 to 2023, Taiwan is expected to experience good air quality 40 percent of the time under the new standards, while the chance of moderate and unhealthy days for sensitive groups may increase. The MOENV said the amendments follow guidelines set by the World Health Organization and a study published in July by Miaoli County-based National Health Research Institutes that shows a high correlation between PM 2.5 concentration and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The move is also part of the new administration's response to public calls for more effective air quality controls, it added. Achieving targets will require collective efforts by all parties involved, especially those responsible for producing pollutants, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said, adding that the ministry will roll out follow-up projects to tackle airborne particulates. Peng said the government's net-zero carbon emission policy will help improve air quality in Taiwan, as reduction of carbon and air pollution goes hand in hand. He added that the ministry hopes to lower the PM 2.5 standard further to 10 or 5 mcg/m3 in the future.

Foreign Minister Lin calls for global unity to fight authoritarianism	Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung called on like-minded partners to unite against authoritarianism and support Taiwan's participation in global organizations. Lin made the remarks during a sit-down with 11 journalists from 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Europe and North America last month in Taipei City. The minister brought them up to speed on issues ranging from new norms in cross-strait relations and growing authoritarian threats in the region to Taiwan's global participation and the new administration's integrated diplomacy approach. According to the minister, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, an emerging alliance known as CRINK, are expanding collaboration and posing a threat to Taiwan and fellow democracies around the world. Given the interconnectedness of national economies, Taiwan's values-based diplomacy can strengthen mutual support among like-minded partners, he added. Lin asserted that China's attempts to invade, blockade or isolate Taiwan will impact global navigation and that Beijing's ambition extends beyond the first island chain. Facing such challenges, Taiwan is leaving no stone unturned in strengthening its defense capabilities, as evidenced by the defense budget's expansion to 2.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product, the minister said, adding that this figure is higher than that of most NATO member states and is expected to increase to 3.5 percent in the future. With regard to global participation, Lin linked Taiwan's continued U.N. exclusion to China's willful misinterpretation of U.N. Resolution 2758, which he said does not mention Taiwan or its international status. He urged the global body to look squarely at Taiwan's bid, adding that the country can contribute not only its semiconductor prowess, but also its understanding of China's behavior. The minister's remarks have since been published in global news outlets such as World View Television, The New York Sun and Real America's Voice from the U.S.; National Newswatch from Canada; The Australian from Australia; The Jerusalem Post from Isreal; Lusa from Portugal; Die Presse from Austria; and Rzeczpospolita from Poland.

MOFA thanks US for supportive statement, condemns China for suppressing Taiwan at UNGA79	The Sept. 27 remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken supporting cross-strait peace and stability is sincerely appreciated by the government and people of Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Sept. 28. According to a Sept. 27 press release by the U.S. State Department, Blinken made the remarks during his meeting with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi earlier the same day on the margins of the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York City. Blinken emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as raised concerns about China's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea, its support for Russia's defense industry base and war of aggression against Ukraine. The ministry welcomed the state secretary's unwavering support, and condemned China's persistent threats to the cross-strait status quo while the global community continues to voice concern for regional security and stability. In particular, the MOFA sternly condemned Wang's speech Sept. 28 at the general debate that the U.N. resolution 2758 has resolved once and for all the question of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan. The ministry said that the ROC (Taiwan) and China do not belong to each other, which is the current cross-strait status quo and a globally recognized fact. The said resolution does not mention Taiwan, nor does it confirm that Taiwan is part of China or authorize China to represent Taiwan at the U.N., the MOFA said, emphasizing that only the government elected by its people can represent Taiwan at the U.N. or other global venues. The MOFA called on China to stop misleading the world and urged the international community to heed Beijing's malicious attempts to use the resolution to pave way for its military aggression against Taiwan. As President Lai Ching-te said during his video speech at the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit, a stronger Taiwan is better able to promote democracy, peace and prosperity around the world. The government hopes that Taiwan and other democratic nations can jointly support the democratic umbrella and counter authoritarian aggression, Lai added. As a responsible global member, Taiwan will continue to strengthen its self-defense capabilities and work with the U.S. and other like-minded partners to defend the rules-based international order and ensure peace, stability and prosperity in the strait and the Indo-Pacific, the ministry said.

National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee holds inaugural meeting	President Lai Ching-te presided over the inaugural meeting of the National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee Sept. 26 in Taipei City, underscoring the government's commitment to enhancing civilian emergency preparedness. Delivering the opening remarks, Lai said climate change, large-scale natural disasters and authoritarian expansion pose challenges for both the country and the international community, adding that a more resilient Taiwan would make greater contributions to global democracy, peace and prosperity. The president highlighted three areas of focus to strengthen the country's response capabilities and expand government-civilian cooperation. The first is to prepare for worst-case scenarios. Comprehensive and proactive measures are essential for ensuring rapid reaction time and normal societal function in times of emergency, Lai said. Second, ordinary citizens should receive response and mobilization training to increase stockpiles of critical supplies and safeguard the operation of vital infrastructure, including the electric grid; finance, information security and transportation networks; and medical and evacuation facilities, the president added. Finally, the central and local governments must reinforce collaboration with civil organizations to identify problem areas and develop strategies to address them, Lai said. In selecting committee members, the government has taken background, experience, specialty, age and gender into careful consideration, the president said, adding that a diverse body will be better able to tackle the complexity of the task. Lai concluded by conveying confidence that robust determination and preparedness will deepen Taiwan's cooperation with like-minded partners in facing domestic and international concerns. The National Whole-of-Society Resilience Committee is one of three advisory groups announced by the president in June. The other two are the National Climate Change Committee and the Healthy Taiwan Promotion Committee.

MOENV promotes plastic reduction at Taipei baseball game	Deputy Minister Shen Chih-hsiu took part in a baseball game Sept. 26 in Taipei City to promote the government's plastic reduction campaign, the Ministry of Environment said. According to the MOENV, Shen threw the first pitch to start the Chinese Professional Baseball League game between the Wei Chuan Dragons and Uni-President Lions. Taiwan swimmer and Olympian Wang Kuan-hung, who is the ministry's recycling ambassador, was also present at the ceremony. Shen said the fifth session of the U.N. Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee will take place in late November this year in Busan, South Korea to address plastic pollution, showing that plastic reduction has attained global consensus. As a responsible international community member, Taiwan needs to be part of the worldwide trend. To this end, the MOENV launched a program in July 2022 to offer a NT$5 discount to consumers who bring their own cups to purchase beverages at retail outlets and also implemented a ban earlier this month on single-use plastic cups at beverage shops nationwide. Shen said the initiatives are expected to cut the use of 790 million disposable cups a year. Shen said other similar projects are in the pipeline, including encouraging the public to bring reusable bags or totes for grocery shopping, and a ban on disposable toiletries and bottled water at hotels starting Jan. 1, 2025. These measures will lead to the use of 65 million fewer plastic bags and the reduction of 2,000 tons of plastics. The deputy minister urged participants to be responsible consumers by bringing their own bottles or borrowing reusable cups when attending baseball games and other events. The game also offered environmentally conscious fans free drinks and beverage discounts.

MODA stages forum on submarine cable, internet data center development	Bolstering development of the submarine communication cable and internet data center sectors was the theme of a forum held by the Ministry of Digital Affairs Sept. 26 in Taipei City to promote Taiwan's digital resilience. Jointly organized with the state-sponsored Telecom Technology Center based in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, the one-day event focused on development strategies for the two sectors in Taiwan, the analysis of potential risks faced by local supply chain players and the sharing of security assessments and related guidance. The event involved local experts and officials, as well as their counterparts from Australia and Japan. Those in attendance included Chiueh Her-ming, deputy minister at MODA; Chiu Wei-chen, deputy executive secretary of the Office of Science and Technology Policy under the National Science and Technology Council; and Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association Deputy Representative Takashi Hattori. Participants discussed the risks associated with development in the two sectors from legal and geopolitical perspectives, analyzed standard procedures to ensure the security of Taiwan's submarine cables and data cloud centers; and reviewed measures to respond to and manage incidents at such facilities. According to the MODA, over 95 percent of international communication is conducted through 436 submarine cables around the world. As an island, Taiwan especially relies on such cables to communicate with its offshore counties and townships, as well as its global partners, the ministry added. The MODA said the country's geographic location and technological prowess set it in good stead as a potential global submarine cable hub, adding that high-tech powerhouses Google LLC and Microsoft Corp. have set up data centers in the country. Given the threats of natural disasters and geopolitical concerns, however, local firms also need to ensure effective emergency preparedness, the ministry said. The forum served as a platform to exchange views on global trends and share experiences to address related challenges, in order to strengthen the security and reliability of local infrastructure, and boost investors' confidence in Taiwan, the MODA said.

During the signing ceremony, Huang said the NPM is actively responding to the government's open data policies and the global trend for museums to enhance public access to their collections. The museum is committed to upholding transparency and will continue to introduce its collections to countries around the world, he added. Echoing Huang's remarks, Chen said Wikipedia volunteers need institutions like the NPM to provide credible research information for encyclopedia content. He anticipated that the current collaboration would allow more people to appreciate NPM collections in creative and vibrant ways, opening a new chapter for data openness in arts and culture.

President Lai addresses Concordia Annual Summit	President Lai Ching-te spoke to attendees of the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit via a recorded video message, pledging to build a stronger Taiwan while expressing his hope that democracies will jointly counter authoritarian aggression. Democracy around the world faces threats such as authoritarian expansion, Lai said, citing Russia's invasion of Ukraine and adding China's intensifying military intimidation in the Taiwan Strait and the East and South China Seas as examples. He specifically noted China's use of gray zone tactics, in addition to lawfare and the misrepresentation of history, to expand its power. Democratic Taiwan and authoritarian China are not subordinate to each other, Lai stressed during his explanation of Beijing's distortion of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758. The president also thanked the U.S. and the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China for opposing Beijing's misinterpretations and welcomed more countries to join in support of democracy worldwide. He went on to say that Taiwan's four pillars of peace are a plan to maintain the cross-strait peace and stability, adding that the country is committed to strengthening national defense, building economic security, deepening partnerships with democratic countries, and ensuring stable and principled cross-strait leadership. Alexander Tah-ray Yui, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., also attended the event, holding a dialogue with Keith Krach, former U.S. undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment. Their discussion focused on Taiwan's democratic resolve and ways to shape global security and peace through strategic cooperation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait is key to global economic growth and prosperity, Yui said. Taiwan is an indispensable partner in sustainable supply chains as it provides over 90 percent of global advanced semiconductor products, he added, calling on the international community to squarely face the country's improper exclusion from the U.N.'s specialized agencies and global organizations, and to incorporate its expertise and contributions into the process of sustainable international development. According to the Presidential Office, the summit was organized by New York-based nonprofit organization Concordia on the sidelines of the ongoing 79th U.N. General Assembly. Dignitaries giving speeches at the event included President Santiago Pe&ntilde;a Palacios of Paraguay and Theresa May, former prime minister of the U.K. (YCH-E) Write to Taiwan Today at ttonline@mofa.gov.tw	https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&post=259283	2024-09-26T00:00:00-07:00

U.S. President Biden delivered a speech Sept. 24 at the 79th edition of the United Nations General Assembly, where he reiterated a firm stance on maintaining Taiwan Strait stability while voicing opposition to unfair economic competition and military coercion in the South China Sea. He added that the U.S. would continue to strengthen its network of Indo-Pacific alliances and partnerships. On the same day, G7 foreign ministers also met during UNGA79's high-level week, where they reaffirmed that maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait is vital to ensure international security and prosperity. They also supported Taiwan to gain meaningful participation in global institutions either as a member, an observer or guest, the MOFA said. Prior to the G7 ministerial meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Japan Foreign Minister Kamikawa Yoko and ROK Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul held a trilateral meeting Sept. 23. The three reiterated the significance of cross-strait stability and called for peaceful resolution of issues while conveying strong opposition to any unilateral change of the status quo in the Indo-Pacific.

President Lai vows to strengthen civil defense in Taiwan	President Lai Ching-te said Sept. 24 that Taiwan is committed to enhancing civil defense capabilities so that its people have the knowledge and skills needed to protect themselves and their beloved country. Lai made the remarks while participating in a civil defense training organized by Academia Formosana in the central county of Nantou. Authorities and organizations at all levels are working to advance civil defense and natural disaster response, as evidenced by drills held on the National Disaster Prevention Day Sept. 21, Lai said. He further praised the AF-formulated plans to reduce potential casualties and property damage during disasters and conflict. Lai went on to reiterate his missions as president, noting that safeguarding the country's sovereignty is a top priority. He added that the ROC (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other, and that the future of Taiwan can only be decided by its 23 million people. Ensuring the safety of the country's people is equally important, Lai said, citing the country's enhanced national defense capabilities since former President Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016. His third mission is to boost the country's economy, Lai said. The president noted that the bulk of Taiwan's overseas investment is flowing to Japan, the U.S., New Southbound Policy target countries and those across Europe, adding that the country's investment in China accounted for only 11.4 percent of its total foreign investment last year, decreasing from 83.8 percent in 2010.

Taiwan reiterates bid for U.N. participation at GCTF workshop	Taiwan partnered up with Australia, Canada, Japan and the U.S. to hold a seminar on leveraging technology to achieve sustainable development Sept. 19 in New York City, underscoring the country's indispensable role in realizing the United Nations' sustainable development goals, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Organized under the Global Cooperation and Training Framework, the event attracted governmental officials and experts from over 10 countries and was presided over by Yanis Ben Amor, executive director of Columbia University's Center for Sustainable Development. Prominent attendees included Tom Chih-Chiang Lee, director-general of Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York; Charles C.

Speaking at the seminar, Lee said that the U.N.'s launch of the Summit of the Future, which aims to facilitate international collaboration in utilizing technology to advance the well-being of future generations, highlights the significance of Taiwan's inclusion in global bodies given that the country produces over 90 percent of the world's advanced chips. Despite the U.N.'s commitment to leave no one behind, it continues to shut out Taiwan's 23.5 million people, he added. According to the MOFA, there is a growing international consensus recognizing the importance of Taiwan in ensuring global welfare. This is evidenced by the joint statement released by Australia, India, Japan and the U.S. after their 4th Quadrilateral Security Dialogue that took place Sept. 21 in the U.S. state of Delaware, which stressed that maintaining cross-strait peace is vital to global prosperity. Similar sentiments were expressed in joint statements released Sept. 20 by Australia and the U.S. and Sept. 21 by Japan and the U.S. following leaders' meetings.

Taiwan stages APEC chemical hazard training program	The Training Program on Capacity Building for Chemical Emergency Preparedness under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation opened Sept. 23 in Kaohsiung City, to ensure a swift response to chemical incidents, reduce environmental impact and enhance human safety. Organized by the Ministry of Environment, the six-day event involves 25 representatives from eight APEC member economies including Malaysia, Peru, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, as well as non-member countries such as France and Poland. During his opening remarks, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said accelerating economic and trade development has led to an increase in the production and transportation of chemical substances. Thus, there is also an increase in the number of cross-border accidents involving those substances and a concomitant impact on economic stability, environmental sustainability and human safety, he added. Peng said scenario training helps APEC member economies enhance capabilities in key issues such as hazard identification, on-site detection and incident response. The government is looking forward to sharing experience and expertise in managing hazardous chemical substances with its partner countries and helping to create an effective response mechanism in the region, the minister added. According to the MOENV Chemicals Administration, the training program was proposed by Taiwan this year during the APEC Chemical Dialogue. It is taking place at the Southern Emergency Response Training Center for Toxic Substances, a globally recognized training facility, located inside National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology in southern Taiwan.

MOI Deputy Minister lauds national efforts to tackle starfish overpopulation	Deputy Minister of the Interior Tung Chien-hung praised public and private efforts to tackle the overpopulation of the crown-of-thorns starfish, underscoring Taiwan's commitment to marine conservation, the Ministry of the Interior said Sept. 19. Tung expressed his recognition while visiting Dongsha Atoll National Park, Taiwan's first marine national park and the largest protected marine area in the country. According to the MOI, after detecting the issue earlier this year, the ministry's National Park Service invited experts from the Cabinet-level Ocean Affairs Council, Academia Sinica and other organizations to form a volunteer task force to monitor and control the species in waters surrounding the Dongsha Islands and other risk areas. The first group deployed Aug. 23 and returned Aug. 29, the ministry said, adding that a total of 11,044 crown-of-thorns starfish have been removed as of Sept. 13. Tung thanked the volunteers for their hard work, which is essential in reducing the impact on coral, the starfish's food source. The seagrass bed around the Dongsha Islands is a natural carbon sink and forms a critical part of a blue carbon ecosystem that provides a habitat to sea creatures like the sicklefin lemon shark, he said, urging the NPS' Marine National Park Headquarters to continue striving to protect Taiwan's rich sea assets. The deputy minister took the opportunity to compliment the DANP's efforts to desalinate seawater using newly designed wells to prevent seaweed debris from damaging water pumping equipment. The park has also collaborated with the local government to establish a sustainable water circulation system in which wastewater is injected into groundwater after treatment, providing a friendly environment for migratory birds and contributing to biodiversity, he added. Tung further expressed appreciation to the OAC's Coast Guard Administration for protecting the national park amid ship groundings and oil spills, as well as driving away unauthorized foreign vessels. The renovation of Dongguang Hospital has also enhanced the national park's long-term management by improving the quality of medical care on the islands, he added.

MOFA thanks allies and like-minded nations for UN inclusion support	The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell's reiteration of his country's long-standing support of stability in the Taiwan Strait together with backing from ten allies for Taiwan's inclusion in the United Nations, are sincerely welcomed by the government and people of Taiwan, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sept. 20. During a Sept. 18 congressional hearing, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell voiced his disapproval of China's distortion and misuse of U.N. Resolution 2758 to suppress Taiwan and deny its legitimacy, the MOFA said. It added that it appreciated Campbell's remarks, which followed similar sentiments voiced for Taiwan from Mark Lambert, State Department China coordinator and deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs, and Daniel Kritenbrink, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. In addition, nine of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, including Belize, Eswatini, Guatemala, Palau, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and Grenadines, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands' permanent representatives to the UN also submitted a joint letter to U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, in which they strongly refuted China's distortion and misuse of U.N. Resolution 2758. Another diplomatic ally, Paraguay, sent a letter independently to convey support for Taiwan's participation in the international body. The MOFA also reported that recently both Australia and the Netherlands passed resolutions or motions which voiced a consensus that U.N. Resolution 2758 does not specifically mention Taiwan. It called on the international community to jointly oppose China's misinterpretation of the resolution by taking substantive action, adding that Taiwan would continue to work with like-minded countries to safeguard the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region.

Taiwan, EU partners join forces to promote sustainable ocean governance	The Ministries of Environment and Foreign Affairs teamed up with the European Economic and Trade Office and EU member states' offices in Taiwan to hold the annual beach cleanup Sept. 21 in New Taipei City in observance of International Coastal Cleanup Day and World Cleanup Day. According to the MOENV, the event involved around 170 participants, including MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming, Deputy Foreign Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu, EETO Head Lutz G&uuml;llner and other officials from EU partner countries stationed in Taiwan. They collected a total of 464 kilograms of waste at the Bali Beiti Beach. Peng said Taiwan and the EU are solid economic and trade partners with many shared values. The annual event reflects the commitment of the two sides to promoting the health of Taiwan's coastal areas while calling attention to the daunting challenges associated with climate change, he added. The minister said that since the government launched the Salute to the Seas project, the coastal waste dropped by 60 percent from 2,294 tons in 2019 to 940 tons in 2023 before reaching a new low of 686 tons as of the third quarter this year. An additional NT$5.9 billion (US$189 million) has been earmarked for the second phase of the project to be carried out by 15 agencies under nine councils and ministries, Peng added. One key development is the ban on single-use plastic cups at beverage shops that came into effect this month, Peng said, adding that the measure will lead to a reduction of 790 million disposable plastic cups each year. Echoing Peng's remarks, G&uuml;llner said the EU invests 350 million euros each year in marine protection and is proud to organize beach cleanup activities around the world, including its involvement in the Taiwan event for the sixth year. He welcomed Taiwan's efforts to restrict plastic use and emphasized that the EU will continue to work with global partners to promote sustainable ocean governance.
