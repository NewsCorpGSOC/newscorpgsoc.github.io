Premier Cho attends APG money laundering seminar	Premier Cho Jung-tai said that Taiwan is committed to collaboration with other nations to effectively combat crime and uphold global security and stability. Cho made the statement while attending the opening ceremony of the 2024 Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering assessor training workshop Oct. 21 in Taipei City. Taiwan joined the APGML as a founding member in 1997 and this was the first time that the country has held the five-day event, the premier said. During the seminar, experts from Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Taiwan shared knowledge and experience on prevention of money laundering, financing terrorism and dealing with large-scale destructive weapons. Cho also extended a sincere welcome to David Shannon, APG's acting executive secretary and participants from 17 countries. The government has placed strong emphasis on preventing money laundering and financing terrorism to safeguard society, shown by the fact that Taiwan ranked as having regular follow-up of such crime in APGML mutual evaluation in 2019. The premier said that to promote stricter governance and more effective law enforcement, new strategies would be adopted. These include legal adaptation, including the implementation of a Money Laundering Control Act and a Fraud Crime Prevention Act, to more efficiently prosecute such crime. A second strategy is control of criminal behavior through use of digital tools by agencies such as Coast Guard Administration, police stations, prosecutors' offices and other bodies. Educating the public on identification of disinformation as well as proactive measures by financial institutions to prevent scams is also vital. Global cooperation is also an effective tactic, as evidenced by recent seizure of transnational fraud call centers through joint investigations by Taiwan and the U.S. Prevention of money laundering is a common international goal shared by Taiwan and Cho concluded by expressing hope that the APGML would hold further events in Taiwan.

Lai emphasizes strength through unity in National Day address	President Lai Ching-te delivered the National Day address in front of the Presidential Office Oct. 10 in Taipei City, vowing to make Taiwan a stronger force for regional peace, stability and prosperity. At the celebration of the 113rd anniversary of the founding of the ROC (Taiwan), Lai said the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other.

The government will further develop the five trusted industry sectors, expedite improvements to the safety of the national road network and implement measures including childcare for ages 0-6 and long-term care, among other tasks, while combatting fraud and housing speculation, he said. Lai concluded by saying that the people of Taiwan share common convictions so their determination to defend national sovereignty and to protect their free and democratic way of life remain unchanged. The stronger the commitment of the Taiwan people, the greater the tenacity of democracy around the world, and vice versa, he added.

MOFA thanks allies, partners for backing Taiwan’s UN participation	Support from the global community for Taiwan's bid to participate in the activities, mechanisms and meetings of the U.N. is sincerely appreciated by the government of Taiwan, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Oct. 4. According to the MOFA, top-level officials from Taiwan's allies including Belize, Eswatini, Marshall Islands, Palau, Paraguay, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and Grenadines and Tuvalu spoke in support of Taiwan during the U.N. General Debate and Summit of the Future Sept. 20-30 in New York. Among them, Palau, Marshall Islands, St. Lucia and Tuvalu pointed out that the U.N. resolution 2758 did not exclude Taiwan from participating in U.N. specialized agencies, the ministry said. Leaders and high-level officials from like-minded partners stressed the importance of maintaining cross-strait peace and stability, the MOFA said, citing remarks made by U.S. President Joe Biden and Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs Penny Wong during the General Debate. Other similar sentiments were expressed by a joint statement released after the Group of Seven's foreign ministers' meeting at the high-level week of the UN General Assembly, the ministry added. The fact that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell condemned China's distortion and misuse of U.N. Resolution 2758 to suppress Taiwan during a congressional hearing and Caspar Veldkamp, minister of foreign affairs of the Netherlands, said during a congressional inquiry that the resolution does not involve Taiwan, are both deeply appreciated, the MOFA said. Other nations' parliamentarians also showed their support through various means, the MOFA said, citing a resolution passed by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China on UN Resolution 2758 in July. The MOFA also reported that the legislative branches of Australia, Guatemala and the Netherlands greenlighted motions voicing support of Taiwan based on the IPAC resolution. In UN inclusion-related activities, President Lai Ching-te delivered a video address to the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit, calling for global support of Taiwan's international participation. Alexander Tah-ray Yui, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., also attended the event, holding a dialogue with Keith Krach, former U.S. undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment, on ways to maintain cross-strait peace and security. Responses to the campaign for UN inclusion have been strong, with MOFA Minister Lin Chia-lung's op-ed calling on like-minded partners to unite against authoritarianism and support Taiwan's participation in global organizations, reported on 455 times by major media outlets from countries including Canada, Eswatini, France, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Poland, Sweden, Spain, the EU and the U.S., among others. A short film made by the ministry titled &ldquo;IC You,&rdquo; which showcases Taiwan's technology and semiconductor manufacturing prowess, has garnered 25.40 million views since its release, with a total of 2,922 social media campaign posts obtaining 48.378 million views and an animation titled &ldquo;United&mdash;Global Peace with Taiwan&rdquo; broadcasting in Time Square. The MOFA reiterated that U.N. Resolution 2758 did not mention Taiwan and must not to be used as a basis to exclude the country from taking part in U.N. special agencies and global organizations. Taiwan is committed to contributing to the global community and its exclusion is a loss for all and undermines achievement of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, the ministry said, urging the U.N. to stop succumbing to China's pressure and to include Taiwan to fulfill its principle of leaving no one behind.

President Lai receives German Marshall Fund delegation from the US	President Lai Ching-te said Oct. 4 that Taiwan is committed to enhancing resilience in the defense, economic and disaster prevention spheres as it works with like-minded democratic partners to counteract authoritarian expansionism. The president made the remarks while receiving a delegation from the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a Washington-based think tank. The group was led by Heather A. Conley, senior advisor to the board of trustees, and included Chair Christopher Schroeder and other senior staffers, as well as Francesco M. Tal&ograve;, former permanent representative of Italy to NATO, and Rajmund Andrzejczak, former chief of the general staff of the Polish Armed Forces. According to Lai, Taiwan is increasing its defense budget to safeguard regional stability and ensure the sustainable development of democracy as a result of its observation of China's persistent political intimidation and military aggression in the East and South China Seas in an attempt to change the rules-based international order. The president noted that the U.S. has also continued to coordinate with its allies to reiterate the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He took the opportunity to thank former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Jessica Lewis, in attendance with the GMF delegation, for her tremendous assistance in facilitating the U.S. government's provision of defense capabilities to Taiwan. Lai stated that he hopes to see Taiwan resolve the double taxation issue with the U.S. to further advance trade ties, and mentioned plans to conclude an investment agreement with the EU to bolster economic exchanges and cooperation. The president thanked the think tank for paying close attention to cross-strait issues, as evidenced by its research report saying that China has distorted UNGA Resolution 2758 and improperly linked it with its &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Such staunch support is sincerely appreciated by the government and people, he said. During her meeting with the group earlier the same day, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim said Typhoon Krathon and Hurricane Helene serve as reminders that society must strengthen its resilience to natural disasters and other challenges. She welcomed the delegates' visit and said Taiwan looks forward to working with its partners in the U.S. and Europe to expand cooperation and exchanges in bolstering social resilience and related issues.

Taiwan sets strictest air pollution regulations in Asia	The Ministry of Environment announced amendments to Taiwan's Air Quality Standards Sept. 30 to bring the country's regulations more in line with global practices and offer better health protections to the public. According to the MOENV, the new regulations lower the maximum hourly, daily and yearly levels of pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide. In particular, the daily average threshold of PM 2.5 has been cut from 35 micrograms per cubic meter to 30 mcg/m3 and the yearly average threshold has dropped from 15 mcg/m3 to 12 mcg/m3, making them the strictest limits in Asia, the ministry said. The changes also update rules for air quality readings to provide a more accurate reflection of conditions starting Jan. 1, 2025. The ministry highlighted that according to data from 2021 to 2023, Taiwan is expected to experience good air quality 40 percent of the time under the new standards, while the chance of moderate and unhealthy days for sensitive groups may increase. The MOENV said the amendments follow guidelines set by the World Health Organization and a study published in July by Miaoli County-based National Health Research Institutes that shows a high correlation between PM 2.5 concentration and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The move is also part of the new administration's response to public calls for more effective air quality controls, it added. Achieving targets will require collective efforts by all parties involved, especially those responsible for producing pollutants, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said, adding that the ministry will roll out follow-up projects to tackle airborne particulates. Peng said the government's net-zero carbon emission policy will help improve air quality in Taiwan, as reduction of carbon and air pollution goes hand in hand. He added that the ministry hopes to lower the PM 2.5 standard further to 10 or 5 mcg/m3 in the future.

Foreign Minister Lin calls for global unity to fight authoritarianism	Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung called on like-minded partners to unite against authoritarianism and support Taiwan's participation in global organizations. Lin made the remarks during a sit-down with 11 journalists from 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Europe and North America last month in Taipei City. The minister brought them up to speed on issues ranging from new norms in cross-strait relations and growing authoritarian threats in the region to Taiwan's global participation and the new administration's integrated diplomacy approach. According to the minister, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, an emerging alliance known as CRINK, are expanding collaboration and posing a threat to Taiwan and fellow democracies around the world. Given the interconnectedness of national economies, Taiwan's values-based diplomacy can strengthen mutual support among like-minded partners, he added. Lin asserted that China's attempts to invade, blockade or isolate Taiwan will impact global navigation and that Beijing's ambition extends beyond the first island chain. Facing such challenges, Taiwan is leaving no stone unturned in strengthening its defense capabilities, as evidenced by the defense budget's expansion to 2.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product, the minister said, adding that this figure is higher than that of most NATO member states and is expected to increase to 3.5 percent in the future. With regard to global participation, Lin linked Taiwan's continued U.N. exclusion to China's willful misinterpretation of U.N. Resolution 2758, which he said does not mention Taiwan or its international status. He urged the global body to look squarely at Taiwan's bid, adding that the country can contribute not only its semiconductor prowess, but also its understanding of China's behavior. The minister's remarks have since been published in global news outlets such as World View Television, The New York Sun and Real America's Voice from the U.S.; National Newswatch from Canada; The Australian from Australia; The Jerusalem Post from Isreal; Lusa from Portugal; Die Presse from Austria; and Rzeczpospolita from Poland.

This was the first time that medical personnel and mental health counselors accompanied contestants to such a competition. Additionally, administrators, advisors, consultants and interpreters also joined the group, Lai noted. Skills are the foundation for national competitiveness, the president said, adding that people from all walks of life created Taiwan's economic miracle. The president also took the opportunity to announce that starting from 2025 to 2028, the government would allocate NT$3.2 billion in subsidies to upgrade vocational schools' teaching facilities and introduce more guest lecturers. Artificial intelligence and information and communications-related courses would also be incorporated into the curriculum in vocational schools. The government, academic institutions and industry should collaborate to cultivate students' interdisciplinary expertise, Lai emphasized, adding that a substantial new project would also offer overseas training courses for students from Taiwan. Students will have more opportunity to receive training and exchange in other countries, which will stimulate innovation and growth for domestic industry, Lai concluded.

Accessibility at the heart of Taichung fine art museum’s work	A seminar on the inclusive and accessible operation of museums was staged Sept. 28 at the Taichung City-based National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts. Academics and experts from cultural agencies around Taiwan were invited to share their experience and expertise, the MOC said, adding that the event mainly focused on how to meet the audience's needs through the deployment of software and hardware elements. The second phase of an exhibit entitled &ldquo;Reconstructing the History of Art in Taiwan&rdquo; opened Sept. 7 to display fourteen works that address the topic posed in the event's subtitle: &ldquo;A Pluralistic Art History for Future Generations.&rdquo; The pieces, procured through the National Development Council' Forward-looking Infrastructure Development, are accompanied by a plethora of assistive and accessibility tools to welcome all guests to appreciate art: touch adaptations of visual works, audio descriptions, sign language guides and Braille. Speaking at the forum, Deputy Director Wang Jia-zheng of the NTMOFA said that the institution is devoted to the expansion of user-friendly museums, adding that the facility has accumulated substantive results in advancing access to culture over the past ten years. Wang continued that the current &ldquo;Future Generations&rdquo; exhibit showcases the museum's research on rebuilding Taiwan's art history as well as its achievements in collection, maintenance and preservation. He expressed hope that the exchanges at the symposium would facilitate equal access to art among different demographics. As the Ministry of Culture's demonstration museum since 2013 for offering services to guests with visual and hearing impairments, as well as those with other special needs, the MOC said the NTMOFA actively promotes cultural equality and inclusion. The museum has implemented a mode that provides people with equal cultural participation, not just by serving the underprivileged, but also by enhancing mutual understanding between diverse groups, the ministry added.

MOFA thanks US for supportive statement, condemns China for suppressing Taiwan at UNGA79	The Sept. 27 remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken supporting cross-strait peace and stability is sincerely appreciated by the government and people of Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Sept. 28. According to a Sept. 27 press release by the U.S. State Department, Blinken made the remarks during his meeting with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi earlier the same day on the margins of the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York City. Blinken emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as raised concerns about China's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea, its support for Russia's defense industry base and war of aggression against Ukraine. The ministry welcomed the state secretary's unwavering support, and condemned China's persistent threats to the cross-strait status quo while the global community continues to voice concern for regional security and stability. In particular, the MOFA sternly condemned Wang's speech Sept. 28 at the general debate that the U.N. resolution 2758 has resolved once and for all the question of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan. The ministry said that the ROC (Taiwan) and China do not belong to each other, which is the current cross-strait status quo and a globally recognized fact. The said resolution does not mention Taiwan, nor does it confirm that Taiwan is part of China or authorize China to represent Taiwan at the U.N., the MOFA said, emphasizing that only the government elected by its people can represent Taiwan at the U.N. or other global venues. The MOFA called on China to stop misleading the world and urged the international community to heed Beijing's malicious attempts to use the resolution to pave way for its military aggression against Taiwan. As President Lai Ching-te said during his video speech at the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit, a stronger Taiwan is better able to promote democracy, peace and prosperity around the world. The government hopes that Taiwan and other democratic nations can jointly support the democratic umbrella and counter authoritarian aggression, Lai added. As a responsible global member, Taiwan will continue to strengthen its self-defense capabilities and work with the U.S. and other like-minded partners to defend the rules-based international order and ensure peace, stability and prosperity in the strait and the Indo-Pacific, the ministry said.
