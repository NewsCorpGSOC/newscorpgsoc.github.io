Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Bloomberg News	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chih-chung Wu said Taiwan is committed to enhancing its self-defense capabilities and deepening security cooperation with the U.S. while urging like-minded partners to continue monitoring the cross-strait situation.

Guishan Island reopens to the public	Travelers are again allowed to visit Guishan Island off the coast of northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County, the Tourism Administration announced during a beach cleanup and tree-planting activity Feb. 28 on the island. According to the TA, Guishan Island is usually closed to the public from every Dec. 1 to Feb. 28 to allow the island's ecology to recuperate. However, extensive damage resulting from October 2024's Typhoon Kong-rey led the Northeast and Yilan Coast National Scenic Area Administration to announce an early closure Nov. 5 to effect repairs. The agency spent four months restoring facilities on the island to return it to pristine condition. TA Director-General Chou Yung-hui thanked the Coast Guard Administration and local fisheries and tourism promotion associations for their support in the process. Beginning March 1, up to 1,800 people per day will be allowed to register to visit the island Thursday through Tuesday, and only 100 will be granted permits to hike the interior. Wednesdays are reserved for researchers. The only active volcano in the country, Guishan Island is 10 kilometers off the coast of Toucheng Township. Popular activities include hiking the island's coast and peak, exploring an abandoned military tunnel, spotting dragonflies, and joining whale- and dolphin-watching tours.

Bonnie Glaser of GMF visits National Museum of Taiwan History	Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific Program at Washington, D.C.-based German Marshall Fund of the United States, visited the National Museum of Taiwan History Feb. 22 in the southern city of Tainan. The U.S. expert was in the country as head of a 14-member delegation from the think tank's Taiwan-U.S.-Europe Policy Program (TUPP). The international cohort of young scholars comprised specialists in the fields of artificial intelligence, commerce, information and communications technology, international politics and public health. According to the NMTH, this was Glaser's fifth visit to the museum since 2018 as head of a TUPP delegation. This year's attendees showed particular interest in the interactions between Indigenous and Han peoples, as well as Wangye beliefs. They were especially curious about the traditional costumes of the vanguard that leads parades in honor of these deities. During a sit-down at the venue, the visitors explored topics including responses to transitions of power in Taiwan, local museums' use of historical studies to organize exhibitions for domestic and international audiences, and methods of communicating effectively with patrons of all ages. Glaser said she continued to visit the NMTH because its permanent exhibits present historical perspectives that are relatable to patrons from home and abroad, adding that the museum's English tour guide services also help visitors from the western world better understand Taiwan. NMTH Director Chang Lung-chih said the museum reopened its permanent exhibition hall in 2021 to showcase Taiwan's connection with the world. In addition to highlighting the country's multiethnic history and experiences with colonialism, exhibitions at the site also focus on contemporary studies on topics such as Indigenous groups, maritime history, post-war social development, social movements and new migrants. Chang said the NMTH aspires to showcase Taiwan's soft power by becoming a museum for the world, adding that it also hopes to serve as a platform preserving the people's collective memory and promoting civic dialogue.

Lai attends ceremony marking 78th anniversary of 228 Incident	President Lai Ching-te pledged to expedite the opening of political archives to further the implementation of transitional justice on Feb. 28 in Taipei City. Lai made the remarks during a ceremony marking the 78th anniversary of the Feb. 28 Incident, during which he also offered condolences to victims and their surviving family members on behalf of the government. The incident occurred in 1947 amid protests of unjust treatment and calls for government reform. Military crackdowns in response to these protests claimed the lives of many civilians and ushered in decades of martial law. The incident had long been a taboo topic, the president noted, adding that it was not until after democratization that the government began to make apologies, offer compensation to victims and their families, and designate Feb. 28 as an annual day of remembrance. Lai continued by acknowledging that while considerable progress has been made toward justice, the search for historical truth takes intensive work. Last year he requested that the National Security Bureau prepare approximately one million documents from its records during the martial law period for submission to the National Development Council's National Archives Administration by June. The president added that the Ministry of Culture had also begun reviews of historical sites related to human rights violations to preserve them for posterity. He concluded with hopes that the annual memorial service not only honor victims and offer comfort to the families of the dead, but also reinforce the lessons of history so that they might not be repeated.

MOENV announces new regulations on HFCs	The Ministry of Environment announced two sets of regulations Feb. 25 governing hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), as the government continues to bring Taiwan's regulations into line with global standards. According to the MOENV, the move is in response to an amendment by the parties to the Montreal Protocol. Adopted in September of 1987, the landmark U.N. environmental treaty regulates the production and consumption of nearly 100 man-made chemicals referred to as ozone depleting substances. During their 28th meeting in October of 2016 in Kigali, Rwanda, the parties signed the Kigali Amendment to add HFCs to the list of controlled substances and approve a timeline for their gradual reduction by 80-85 percent by the late 2040s. The amendment has been ratified by more than 160 countries and territories so far, the MOENV added. HFCs are mainly used in electronic cleansing, fire extinguishing equipment, industrial processing and refrigeration. While they are considered substitutes for hydrochlorofluorocarbons, an ozone depleting substance, they also contain high global warming potential values. The ministry said under the new rules, production of 18 types of HFCs is banned immediately and starting July 1 this year, approval has to be obtained for the import and export of such products and mixtures containing the chemicals. The annual HFC consumption will be capped at the baseline level of 24,523.87 thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalents starting 2026, with the total amount gradually reduced to lower than 20 percent of the baseline level after 2045. The MOENV said the new rules, which are based on the country's Climate Change Response Act, underscore Taiwan commitment to working with global partners to mitigate climate change, adding that it will organize public hearing sessions soon to bring local firms up to speed on the matter.

Taiwan reports 2nd highest foreign trade in 2024	Taiwan recorded its second-best foreign trade numbers in 2024, thanks in part to continuous expansion of the global economy, the Ministry of Finance said Feb. 25. The MOF attributed the strong showing to factors like inflation mitigation and the recovery of economic resilience around the world, adding that global supply chain restructuring and expanding artificial intelligence applications greatly benefited local semiconductor and information communication technology sectors. According to the ministry, Taiwan's exports grew 9.9 percent to US$475 billion during the year, with figures reaching a new monthly high in August, along with a second peak in December. Imports surged 12.2 percent to US$394 billion as semiconductor firms ramped up investments in equipment to prepare for a booming global AI supply chain. A breakdown of the figures shows that electronic components and parts topped the export list, accounting for 37.3 percent of the total, followed by ICT and audiovisual products at 27.9 percent and basic metals at 6 percent. Taiwan's exports to the U.S. reached a record high of US$111.4 billion, up 46.1 percent over 2023. Exports to major trade partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations increased 15.1 percent to US$87.8 billion, also a record high. While China and Hong Kong remained the leading destination for local exports, the combined share dropped to 31.7 percent, the lowest in 23 years. The U.S. surpassed ASEAN members to take the second spot, with its share of 23.4 percent the highest in 24 years.

President Lai receives 228 Incident overseas victims’ families	President Lai Ching-te expressed hope Feb. 24 that Taiwan's 23 million people will unite to safeguard the country while maintaining the constitutional system of democracy, freedom, and human rights to continue Taiwan's development and prosperity.

When these demands went unmet, protests broke out around the country, prompting a military crackdown that resulted in many civilian deaths. The president first thanked the group for its longstanding work for speaking out in support of Taiwan, noting that this year is the 78th anniversary of the 228 Incident. The death of Taiwan social elites in the event including the first Taiwan prosecutor Wang Yu-lin and artist Chen Cheng-po caused incalculable losses to Taiwan society, he said, offering apologies again on behalf of the government. The government will spare no effort to do make amends for the 228 Incident, Lai said, citing remedial measures including admitting mistakes, offering apologies, making compensation, investigating the truth, restoring reputations, revoking judgments and setting up memorials and monuments. He added that government authorities are committed to pursuing transitional justice to seek the truth, bring justice and guarantee that such an incident will never happen again. Although this is an unfinished task, Lai said the government will declassify political archives and stressed that people must not forget history and understand the differences between democracy and authoritarianism to protect freedom. The government seeks to unite the country, protect public safety and never allow an event like the 228 Incident to happen again, Lai concluded. To this end, Taiwan's sovereignty must be safeguarded, he said, adding that the ROC (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other, Taiwan's sovereignty is inviolable and cannot be annexed, and that the country's future is to be determined by its 23 million people.

VP Hsiao receives German Marshall Fund delegation	Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim met with a delegation from U.S. headquartered German Marshall Fund's Taiwan-US-Europe Policy Program Feb. 20 in the Presidential Office in Taipei City. Hsiao said that in the face of challenges, Taiwan and its transatlantic partners need to continue dialogue and cooperation so that both can maintain economic prosperity, social resilience and enhance common interests. She added that the two sides share values such as freedom and democracy and thus should work together to face challenges. Hsiao noted that Taiwan has become an economy that contributes to global prosperity and plays a key role in the technology supply chain, however, work must continue to maintain this critical and irreplaceable leading position. She added that Taiwan attaches great importance to balanced growth in all walks of life and that use of artificial intelligence must benefit traditional industries and small and medium sized enterprises. Over the past two years, the U.S. has become Taiwan's largest overseas investment location with over 40 percent of overall foreign investment going to that destination, compared to 2010 when over 80 percent of foreign investment went to China. Hsiao said that adjustment and diversification in economics and trade ensures that Taiwan becomes a continuously prosperous and resilient society. The vice president further noted that one of President Lai's major policies is to institutionalize the concept of whole-of-society defense resilience.

OAC Minister vows to maintain Indo-Pacific peace, stability	The Cabinet-level Ocean Affairs Council Minister Kuan Bi-ling said Feb. 19 that the council is committed to working with its Indo-Pacific counterparts to safeguard peace, prosperity and stability in the region. Kuan made the remarks during an interview on a current affairs Yahoo TV program.

MOEA reveals ITRI’s advanced cooling solution for AI chips	The Ministry of Economic Affairs displayed the latest development in two-phase cooling technology for artificial intelligence chips Feb. 18 in Taipei City, highlighting government efforts to advance high-performance computing. Developed by Hsinchu County-based Industrial Technology Research Institute in northern Taiwan, the technology removes heat through rapid evaporation and condensation of a dielectric liquid. The expanded contact area between the coolant and the chips also accelerates heat conduction to elevate computing efficacy and stability. According to the MOEA, the two-phase cooling innovation can boost AI chip cooling capacity beyond 1,500 watts, compared to 1,000 watts with current single-phase technology. The ITRI-developed system has successfully applied for field verification from the global integrated circuit design heavyweight Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., the ministry said, adding that if adopted by global data centers, the cooling solution could reduce annual carbon emissions by 50 million tons. The success is a result of a 2014 MOEA project that encourages advanced industrial technology development, the ministry said. ITRI also receives support enabling it to work with enterprises such as New Taipei City-headquartered Aewin Technologies Co., Ltd. and Giga-Byte Technology Co., Ltd. to establish a complete supply chain pertinent to heat dissipation in order to drive growth in the country's AI sector. Such cooling technology further solidifies Taiwan's leadership in the global AI industry, the MOEA said, adding that the breakthrough will also create a sustainable computing environment while consolidating the country's key role in international green energy development.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Ukrainian media	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu called on the global community to stand with Taiwan to ensure global supply chain stability and international security integrity. Wu made the remarks during an interview with Tim Mak, founder of Kyiv-based publication Counteroffensive, for an article published Feb. 15 on military technology in Taiwan. Citing remarks by President Lai Ching-te, the Counteroffensive article said Taiwan aspires to become the Asian hub of drone supply chains for global democracies. Based on observations of the Russia-Ukraine war, Taiwan is developing affordable unmanned aerial vehicles, which are expected to play a key role in global confrontations. The article also said that since the late 20th century, the free world has taken the view that welcoming China and Russia into the flow of international trade would have a democratizing effect. Wu said the war has proven that such thinking is naive. The deputy minister said the appropriate strategic response should be to try to separate the so-called &ldquo;red supply chain&rdquo; and the democratic supply chain, adding that Taiwan's prowess in electronics manufacturing and semiconductor technology make it a key player in this regard. Through global supply chain restructuring, the country wants to ensure that local semiconductor technologies will not fall into the hands of Russia or other authoritarian regimes, Wu said, adding that an additional priority is the enhancement of Taiwan's self-defense. According to Counteroffensive, Taiwan is making progress in developing drones and asymmetrical tactics with its rich scientific knowledge. Wu called on the free world to include Taiwan in the global security network as a means to ensure regional and global peace and stability.

NHRM holds lectures on human rights during TIBE	The National Human Rights Museum staged four lectures Feb. 8-9 at Taipei International Book Exhibition in the capital, underscoring the facility's commitment to deepening education on civil liberties, according to the Ministry of Culture. The talks spanned literature creation, picture book publication, and TV and film production, the MOC said. The NHRM's display of research, publications and cultural products at its pavilion aimed to deepen the public's insight into human rights issues, it added. In one of the Feb. 8 lectures, Paiwan writer Liglav A-wu shared her process of portraying Taiwan's White Terror period through an Indigenous lens while serving as an artist in residence at NHRM. Since extant political files are not categorized by ethnic group, she painstakingly tracked down affected individuals from local tribes. A-wu noted that the interviews demonstrated the profound impact authoritarian rule had on native groups, adding that she hopes her work will help Indigenous people learn more about their history. Additionally, illustrator Cincin Chang expounded on her new book &ldquo;Giraffe President,&rdquo; which probes causes of collective trauma and strives to resolve intergenerational conflict. In the work, Chang explores how authoritarianism arises and becomes accepted by society. In response to an audience question on educating children, she emphasized the importance of media literacy, the MOC said. During a Feb. 9 event hosted by poet Hong Hong, fellow poets Hsiang Yang and Chen Yun-yuan introduced a selection of 180 poems on the White Terror period that are set to be published in the second half of the year. Hsiang said that how writers reflect social pain is of great significance, while Chen remarked that compared to prose and fiction, poetry is a better medium to portray subtle but omnipresent agony and violence of the era, the ministry concluded. The White Terror refers to a period from 1949 to 1992, during which the government declared martial law and suppressed and prosecuted political dissidents.
