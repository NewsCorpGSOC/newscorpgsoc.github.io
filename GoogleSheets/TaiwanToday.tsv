FSC announces 2nd edition of sustainable economic activities guidelines	The Financial Supervisory Commission announced the second edition of the reference guidelines for the recognition of sustainable economic activities, as well as recommendations on carbon reduction transformation plans and related matters Dec. 31, 2024. According to the FSC, the commission has worked with multiple ministries to revise the guidelines and roll them out, along with associated recommendations to help enterprises and financial institutions identify sustainable economic activities and bolster their communications. The new guidelines now include the waste removal and resource recycling industry, as well as the agriculture and forestry industry, while also nearly doubling the list of recognized sustainable general economic activities. They also offer a method for calculating the sustainability proportion, allowing financial institutions to judge whether they meet the guidelines' requirements in the areas of loans, investments, asset management and property insurance. The guidelines explain that sustainable economic activities must make real contributions to any of six environmental goals: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainability and conservation of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and biodiversity conservation and restoration. Further, the activities may not cause major harm to any of the six goals or violate social security laws. If the economic activity of an enterprise only fulfills two of the three conditions, but it has already formulated an improvement plan, it can be called &ldquo;in transition.&rdquo; The FSC's recommendations enable enterprises to build their own improvement plans and have taken inspiration from international standards and practices. The commission looks forward to seeing these tools help companies enhance their sustainability.

Cancer treatment certification enhances care quality	A mechanism certifying the quality of cancer diagnosis and treatment has successfully raised Taiwan's five-year cancer survival rate, according to the Health Promotion Administration under the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Launched by the HPA in 2008, the system evaluates medical institutions with 500 or more active cancer cases. To be certified, a hospital must have an interdisciplinary cancer committee that oversees all related affairs, including surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology and diagnostic imaging, to provide comprehensive and individualized care. Following the mechanism's establishment, the domestic cancer survival rate rose to 62.9 percent from 2018-2022, compared to 51.1 percent from 2006-2010, the HPA added. Additionally, the MOHW's National Health Insurance Administration (NHI) released the results of an initiative accelerating the digitization of cancer treatment records Dec. 30 at a news conference in Taipei City. It is hoped that the integration of patient data will enhance treatment efficacy and information transparency, help hospitals provide robust, holistic care, and provide a database for use in drug development, clinical trials and medical research, the ministry said. In his remarks, MOHW Minister Chiu Tai-yuan said that governmental agencies and medical personnel have been leaving no stone unturned in tackling the public health challenge of cancer. He thanked the NHI for optimizing digital hospital infrastructure as part of efforts to implement a national cancer prevention plan. In response, NHI Director Shih Chung-liang said that one of the keys to digital transformation is the interoperability of treatment information, which enables data sharing through cloud systems, enabling doctors to make more precise diagnoses and therapeutic plans and improving overall medical quality.

Public and private sectors collaborate to protect birds’ habitats	Taijiang National Park in the southern city of Tainan celebrated 15 years in operation with the heartwarming story of a black-faced spoonbill that returns to Annan District every fall after being rescued by park staff. At the end of February 2015 a group of sick birds was spotted by workers at Taijiang. The endangered creatures were sent to the Ministry of Agriculture's Taiwan Biodiversity Research Institute in the central county of Nantou for care. Six birds recovered and were released to the wild a few weeks later. By April of that year a juvenile of the group with the tag number T69 was registered as present in Liaoning province in northeastern China. The National Park Service said that it was logged at fishponds in Annan District every October, displaying a touching fidelity to its winter habitat. In recent years Taijiang has worked to promote an expanded eco-friendly habitat in the areas surrounding the park by cooperating with local fish farmers. Forty-seven farmers have joined the project to date, covering an area of 248.57 hectares. This mode of cooperation has simultaneously facilitated development of the fishery industry and ecological conservation, the NPS added. Park Director Shieh Wei-sung emphasized that since the establishment of the park in 2009, it has been dedicated to the maintenance of habitats in the protected areas while actively building relations with corporations, neighboring communities and nongovernmental organizations to gradually forge a public-private preservation network. He concluded that the facility would continue to incorporate sustainable resources from businesses and construct environmentally friendly habitats to provide safer and richer surroundings for all migratory birds.

Deputy MODA minister attends AI summit in Belgium	Deputy Minister of Digital Affairs Lin Yi-jing attended the International Artificial Intelligence Summit held earlier this month in Brussels, Belgium to share the government's strategies in promoting this key sector. During his speech, Lin said the rapid development of AI technology has created tremendous possibilities for the global community and that harnessing the power of AI holds the key to the future. However, Lin cautioned that potential threats come together with breakthroughs. Lin said AI computation models are similar to human brain functions and are increasing speeds by a hundred-fold each year. He called on the free world to work in unity against potential AI endangerment of humanity. A concerted response will ensure the development of an AI ecosystem with good intentions to prevent the technology from abuse and manipulation, he added. Lin said AI's high costs and development mean that the technology is increasingly falling into the ownership of a few global high-tech powerhouses.

MOC launches initiative to preserve Taiwanese language	A plan to encourage families to speak Taiwanese in the home was announced by the Ministry of Culture Dec. 25 in Taipei City, highlighting the government's commitment to preserving the country's multilingual heritage. Prominent attendees at the launch ceremony included MOC Minister Li Yuan and Caring for Taiwan Foundation Chair Chou Ching-yu. Speaking at the event, Li voiced the hope that every national tongue would become widespread because language equality reflects the equity among different ethnic groups. Chou pointed out that a long-term focus on Mandarin has led to a gradual decrease in speakers of other national languages, adding that despite the passage of the Development of National Languages Act in 2019, Taiwanese does not have any specific law or organization to promote its use. The initiative is a response to an MOC survey conducted in 2020 that found a significant decline in Taiwanese as a first language among younger generations. Under the plan, households that comprise at least two members of different generations or are formed by a married couple can apply to become a Taiwanese-speaking family. Based on language proficiency, those who wish to improve their Taiwanese can register for the &ldquo;Taiwanese language learning family&rdquo; track, while those who are fluent can register for the &ldquo;Taiwanese culture family&rdquo; track, the MOC said, adding that status is granted after members complete required courses.

NPM plans extensive centennial celebrations	The National Palace Museum held a press event Dec. 24 in Taipei City to announce its 2024 performance results and plans to celebrate its centennial anniversary next year. According to NPM Director Hsiao Tsung-huang, the main site has received 1.8 million visits so far this year, with visitors from outside Taiwan accounting for half the number. South Korea is the leading source of international patrons with 304,000 visits, followed by Japan with 295,000 visits. The Southern Branch has received more than 950,000 visits to date, mostly domestic. To mark the 100th anniversary, a special exhibition will be staged simultaneously at the main site and Southern Branch next October to showcase its development over the past 75 years in Taiwan. Highlights of the exhibition are to include a Buddhist sculpture dating from the North Wei dynasty (386-534 ) and a Guanyin Bodhisattva silk mandala from the Later Jin dynasty (936-946). The two pieces are both currently on loan to Japan's Kyushu National Museum and will return home for display at the main site. The NPM's three iconic national treasure paintings&mdash;&ldquo;Travelers Among Mountains and Streams&rdquo; by Fan Kuan (950-1032), &ldquo;Early Spring&rdquo; by Guo Xi (1023-1087) and &ldquo;Whispering Pines in Myriad Valleys&rdquo; by Li Tang (1049-1130) &mdash;will be on display at the Southern Branch for the first time. Other events include exhibitions on the ancient board game of go and Ukiyo-e from the NPM collection, as well as two others using the artificial intelligence technology to offer visitors an immersive experience on the beauty of classic calligraphy and rare books from the Sung Dynasty (960-1279). NPM Deputy Director Huang Yung-tai said construction of an administration building and a new library, part of the main site's expansion project, will be completed by the end of 2024. Huang added that a renovated building will be opened in June 2025 to serve as a new exhibition venue. With all these celebratory events and projects, the NPM expects visitor numbers to reach 2.5 million for the main site and 1 million for the Southern Branch in 2025.

MOENV promotes plastic-reduction rules in hotel, accommodation sector	The Ministry of Environment held a news conference Dec. 24 to call attention to regulations coming into effect Jan. 1, 2025, to require hotels and other types of accommodation to use less plastic. According to the MOENV, operators will not be permitted to proactively provide six kinds of personal hygiene products: combs, razors, shaving foam, shower caps, toothbrushes and toothpaste. They are also required to put shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and lotion into large bottles starting no later than Jan. 1. Speaking at the event, Environment Minister Peng Chi-ming said the measure responds to the global demand for carbon and plastic reduction. He added that it also aligns with the sustainable development concept proposed by the 2024 Paris Olympics. To help operators comply, the MOENV said over 50 meetings will be held by the environmental bureaus of cities and counties around Taiwan, with various activities hosted and advertisements posted to expand public understanding of the measure. The ministry expects 460 million items to be saved each year, the equivalent of reducing carbon emissions by 2,500 metric tons. In addition, the MOENV said it will provide subsidies for operators to cut the use of bottled water, in line with the country's sustainable tourism goals. Lin Hsin-jen, deputy director general of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Tourism Administration, stressed the importance of green tourism during the event. The TA has set aside funding to assist operators applying for environmentally friendly labels and sustainability certifications next year, he said, adding that the administration is committed to shaping Taiwan into a leading green tourism destination.

Premier Cho pledges to raise Taiwan cancer survival rates by 2030	As part of President Lai Ching-te's policy goal of building a healthier Taiwan, a drive to reduce the country's cancer deaths by one-third by 2030 will be implemented, the Executive Yuan said Dec. 24. During a cross-ministerial cancer prevention meeting at the EY, Premier Cho Jung-Tai said this will be achieved through a three-pronged approach: improving early-stage screening, focusing on genetic testing and precision medicine, and establishing a NT$10 billion (US$306.09 million) fund to develop new cancer drugs. According to Cho, statistics released Dec. 19 by the Ministry of Health and Welfare showed that in 2022, more than 130,000 Taiwan citizens were diagnosed with cancer for the first time, up 8,500 from the year before. The MOHW attributed the increase to the fact that more individuals undertook screening and received treatment following the slowdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many causes contributed to cancer, the premier said MOHW findings acknowledged the importance of early screening, which allows patients time to seek treatment and thus improve survival rates. In particular, as chewing betel nut is a major cause of oral cancers, Cho said there should be clear laws to regulate the crops' consumption and manage the plantations. He directed the Ministry of Agriculture and other agencies to work together to review progress so far and propose measures, such as public awareness campaigns on its health hazards and guidelines to phase out betel nut plantations. Starting in 2025, the government will offer subsidies to screen for lung, breast, colon and cervical cancer and for human papillomavirus to an expanded demographic. These include a NT$4,000 subsidy every two years for low-dose computed tomography scan for lung cancer screening for heavy smokers aged 50-74 who consume at least 20 packs of cigarettes per year, as well as women aged 40-74 and men aged 45-74 whose direct family members have been diagnosed with lung cancer.

Taiwan’s GDP forecast to grow 3.1 percent in 2025	Taiwan's economy is projected to grow 3.1 percent in 2025 on the strength of reviving demand for electronic products and expanding high-speed computing and artificial intelligence applications, Academia Sinica said Dec. 23. According to AS, Taiwan's annual growth rates for real exports and imports of goods and services in 2025 are forecast at 6.53 percent and 7.17 percent, respectively, as the country's increasingly important role in the AI hardware supply chain drives a sustained rise in foreign trade. However, the institution cautioned that U.S. tariff policies may pose uncertainties for Taiwan's export performance. As for private investment, AS said the real annual growth rate is estimated at 5.46 percent due to robust demand for automation, AI-driven opportunities and low-carbon development trends, along with increasing investments from international corporations in Taiwan. Similarly, investment in public infrastructure is also expected to steadily increase, it added. Real private consumption is expected to see modest growth of 2.02 percent in 2025, AS said. Adjustments in minimum wage and military, government and education salaries, along with strong corporate profitability in 2024, are expected to support private consumption, though an increase could be mitigated by uncertainties such as heightened stock market volatility, it added. In addition, AS statistics showed that the unemployment rate for 2025 is projected at 3.26 percent, down from 3.37 percent in 2024, while the inflationary pressures are expected to persist next year. The global economic environment is anticipated to face higher uncertainty in 2025, with concerns spanning the intensity of U.S. trade protectionism and acceleration of supply chain restructuring and market fragmentation, AS said, adding that Taiwan must work to transform these challenges into opportunities.

Taiwan, Japan ink MOU on plant varieties	Taiwan and Japan signed a memorandum of understanding on the mutual recognition of the two sides' plant varieties verification reports Dec. 19 in Tokyo, highlighting government work to deepen bilateral agricultural exchanges, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. Inked by Taiwan-Japan Relations Association Chair Su Jia-chyuan, and Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association Chair Mitsuo Ohashi, during the 48th Taiwan-Japan Economic and Trade Conference, the pact will help save the time and cost required to apply for variety rights on both sides, protect and benefit breeders while strengthening the bilateral development of agricultural intellectual property rights, the MOA said. Japan is the most important target market for Taiwan's agricultural exports, the ministry said, adding that following the signing of the MOU, the two partners will further discuss adopted species of verified plants, which is key for them to jointly advance relevant industry layouts and global competitiveness. According to the MOA, the MOU follows an administrative arrangement signed by Taiwan and EU authorities on the take-over distinctness, uniformity, and stability (DUS) report of Phalaenopsis and Doritaenopsis in 2019, and a Taiwan-Vietnam MOU on international cooperation in the field of plant variety examination and protection in 2021. As of the end of November, 17 Taiwan varieties have obtained overseas variety rights through such cooperation mechanisms, the ministry added. The MOA's statistics show that as of November, there are a total of 3,265 applications from home and abroad for Taiwan variety rights, with 2,735 applications, or 84 percent of the total, for flowers, which topped the list. This is followed by 210 applications for vegetables, or six percent; and 171 cases for fruit trees, or five percent. Plant variety rights not only protect breeders' rights, but also encourage the improvement of varieties and provide consumers with more diversified agricultural products, the MOA said. The ministry will continue to seek more international cooperation opportunities to apply for overseas variety rights for Taiwan's agricultural exports and enhance the country's agricultural competitiveness, it added.

Taiwan readies for carbon fee collection	The National Development Council said Dec. 19 that all relevant government agencies will work hand in hand to implement a carbon pricing system set to take effect in 2025, following a briefing by the Ministry of Environment on the new policy measure. According to three regulations drafted by the MOENV in August this year, during the initial stage the fees will be levied on about 281 power and gas suppliers and manufacturing firms that emit the equivalent of more than 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Starting Jan. 1, 2025, entities must calculate their annual greenhouse gas emissions and pay their carbon fees by the end of May the next year. Compared to the standard fee of NT$300 (US$9.18) per ton, there are also preferential rates to entities that submit self-determined reduction plans that include strategies such as a switching to low-carbon fuels, adopting negative emission technology, improving energy efficiency, using renewable energy or enhancing industrial processes. The NDC said the system aims to reduce carbon emissions and drive net-zero transition for Taiwan's industrial sector. If all relevant entities submit self-determined reduction plans, the NDC expects collective carbon emissions to be cut by 37 million tons by 2030, which will help achieve Taiwan's intended nationally determined contribution of carbon emissions. To this end, the MOENV has held seven briefings on carbon fee regulations and organized seminars with local governments throughout the country. The NDC said more measures are in the pipeline to enhance public consensus and bring Taiwan's regulations in line with global standards, so that the system will play a key role in driving green growth for a better future for all.

NSTC unveils new carbon capture, conversion technologies	A research team from National Taiwan University has successfully developed pioneering technologies in membrane-based carbon capture and electrochemical carbon conversion, according to the National Science and Technology Council Dec. 11. Supported by the NSTC's net-zero emission program, the NTU ZERO team comprises chemical engineering and chemistry experts from the Taipei City-based university. In particular, the team has established a pilot production machine capable of converting carbon dioxide into upstream chemical products, with a processing capacity of 50 kilograms of CO2 per day. According to the NSTC, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas currently produce most of Taiwan's energy supply, while thermal power generation accounts for 14 percent of the country's carbon emissions, with industrial emissions making up 55 percent of the total. Both the sources can utilize the new carbon capture technology for reuse or storage, the council added. Based on the NTU team's calculations, the efficiency of the most widely adopted carbon capture technology is only about 60 percent given its method and choice of absorbents. In comparison, the NTU team developed an innovative ultramicroporous metal-organic framework that can absorb CO2 with an estimated efficiency of nearly 90 percent. Equally impressive, the NSTC said the team has developed a high efficiency electrochemical process that can convert CO2 into syngas, formic acid, ethanol or ethylene, which are all higher-value chemical compounds with negative carbon footprints. Its low power consumption and high selectivity also reduce the energy and cost of subsequent product purification, the council added. The NSTC expects the positive development will inspire more domestic industries to invest in related initiatives and help contribute to the government's goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2025.
