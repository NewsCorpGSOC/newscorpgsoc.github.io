Taiwan granted ASF-free status by WOAH	Taiwan's declaration that it has eliminated African swine fever within its borders has been recognized by the World Organisation for Animal Health, demonstrating the country's progress in eradicating major animal-borne diseases, according to the Ministry of Agriculture Nov. 1. Detailed materials were submitted to the WOAH in July, and the organization added Taiwan to its roster of self-declared ASF-free locations Oct. 31, the MOA said, adding that the country joins Japan in being the only East Asian nations to have successfully stamped out the virus.

Premier Cho attends APG money laundering seminar	Premier Cho Jung-tai said that Taiwan is committed to collaboration with other nations to effectively combat crime and uphold global security and stability. Cho made the statement while attending the opening ceremony of the 2024 Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering assessor training workshop Oct. 21 in Taipei City. Taiwan joined the APGML as a founding member in 1997 and this was the first time that the country has held the five-day event, the premier said. During the seminar, experts from Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Taiwan shared knowledge and experience on prevention of money laundering, financing terrorism and dealing with large-scale destructive weapons. Cho also extended a sincere welcome to David Shannon, APG's acting executive secretary and participants from 17 countries. The government has placed strong emphasis on preventing money laundering and financing terrorism to safeguard society, shown by the fact that Taiwan ranked as having regular follow-up of such crime in APGML mutual evaluation in 2019. The premier said that to promote stricter governance and more effective law enforcement, new strategies would be adopted. These include legal adaptation, including the implementation of a Money Laundering Control Act and a Fraud Crime Prevention Act, to more efficiently prosecute such crime. A second strategy is control of criminal behavior through use of digital tools by agencies such as Coast Guard Administration, police stations, prosecutors' offices and other bodies. Educating the public on identification of disinformation as well as proactive measures by financial institutions to prevent scams is also vital. Global cooperation is also an effective tactic, as evidenced by recent seizure of transnational fraud call centers through joint investigations by Taiwan and the U.S. Prevention of money laundering is a common international goal shared by Taiwan and Cho concluded by expressing hope that the APGML would hold further events in Taiwan.

MOFA thanks allies, partners for backing Taiwan’s UN participation	Support from the global community for Taiwan's bid to participate in the activities, mechanisms and meetings of the U.N. is sincerely appreciated by the government of Taiwan, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Oct. 4. According to the MOFA, top-level officials from Taiwan's allies including Belize, Eswatini, Marshall Islands, Palau, Paraguay, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and Grenadines and Tuvalu spoke in support of Taiwan during the U.N. General Debate and Summit of the Future Sept. 20-30 in New York. Among them, Palau, Marshall Islands, St. Lucia and Tuvalu pointed out that the U.N. resolution 2758 did not exclude Taiwan from participating in U.N. specialized agencies, the ministry said. Leaders and high-level officials from like-minded partners stressed the importance of maintaining cross-strait peace and stability, the MOFA said, citing remarks made by U.S. President Joe Biden and Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs Penny Wong during the General Debate. Other similar sentiments were expressed by a joint statement released after the Group of Seven's foreign ministers' meeting at the high-level week of the UN General Assembly, the ministry added. The fact that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell condemned China's distortion and misuse of U.N. Resolution 2758 to suppress Taiwan during a congressional hearing and Caspar Veldkamp, minister of foreign affairs of the Netherlands, said during a congressional inquiry that the resolution does not involve Taiwan, are both deeply appreciated, the MOFA said. Other nations' parliamentarians also showed their support through various means, the MOFA said, citing a resolution passed by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China on UN Resolution 2758 in July. The MOFA also reported that the legislative branches of Australia, Guatemala and the Netherlands greenlighted motions voicing support of Taiwan based on the IPAC resolution. In UN inclusion-related activities, President Lai Ching-te delivered a video address to the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit, calling for global support of Taiwan's international participation. Alexander Tah-ray Yui, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., also attended the event, holding a dialogue with Keith Krach, former U.S. undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment, on ways to maintain cross-strait peace and security. Responses to the campaign for UN inclusion have been strong, with MOFA Minister Lin Chia-lung's op-ed calling on like-minded partners to unite against authoritarianism and support Taiwan's participation in global organizations, reported on 455 times by major media outlets from countries including Canada, Eswatini, France, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Poland, Sweden, Spain, the EU and the U.S., among others. A short film made by the ministry titled &ldquo;IC You,&rdquo; which showcases Taiwan's technology and semiconductor manufacturing prowess, has garnered 25.40 million views since its release, with a total of 2,922 social media campaign posts obtaining 48.378 million views and an animation titled &ldquo;United&mdash;Global Peace with Taiwan&rdquo; broadcasting in Time Square. The MOFA reiterated that U.N. Resolution 2758 did not mention Taiwan and must not to be used as a basis to exclude the country from taking part in U.N. special agencies and global organizations. Taiwan is committed to contributing to the global community and its exclusion is a loss for all and undermines achievement of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, the ministry said, urging the U.N. to stop succumbing to China's pressure and to include Taiwan to fulfill its principle of leaving no one behind.

President Lai receives German Marshall Fund delegation from the US	President Lai Ching-te said Oct. 4 that Taiwan is committed to enhancing resilience in the defense, economic and disaster prevention spheres as it works with like-minded democratic partners to counteract authoritarian expansionism. The president made the remarks while receiving a delegation from the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a Washington-based think tank. The group was led by Heather A. Conley, senior advisor to the board of trustees, and included Chair Christopher Schroeder and other senior staffers, as well as Francesco M. Tal&ograve;, former permanent representative of Italy to NATO, and Rajmund Andrzejczak, former chief of the general staff of the Polish Armed Forces. According to Lai, Taiwan is increasing its defense budget to safeguard regional stability and ensure the sustainable development of democracy as a result of its observation of China's persistent political intimidation and military aggression in the East and South China Seas in an attempt to change the rules-based international order. The president noted that the U.S. has also continued to coordinate with its allies to reiterate the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He took the opportunity to thank former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Jessica Lewis, in attendance with the GMF delegation, for her tremendous assistance in facilitating the U.S. government's provision of defense capabilities to Taiwan. Lai stated that he hopes to see Taiwan resolve the double taxation issue with the U.S. to further advance trade ties, and mentioned plans to conclude an investment agreement with the EU to bolster economic exchanges and cooperation. The president thanked the think tank for paying close attention to cross-strait issues, as evidenced by its research report saying that China has distorted UNGA Resolution 2758 and improperly linked it with its &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Such staunch support is sincerely appreciated by the government and people, he said. During her meeting with the group earlier the same day, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim said Typhoon Krathon and Hurricane Helene serve as reminders that society must strengthen its resilience to natural disasters and other challenges. She welcomed the delegates' visit and said Taiwan looks forward to working with its partners in the U.S. and Europe to expand cooperation and exchanges in bolstering social resilience and related issues.
