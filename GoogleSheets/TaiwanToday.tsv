President Lai attends World Cancer Day event	President Lai Ching-te attended a media event marking World Cancer Day, Feb. 4 in Taipei City. He reiterated the goal of reducing the cancer mortality rate by one third by 2030. Lai noted that for over four decades cancer has been the leading cause of death in the country and that annually over 50,000 citizens die of the disease. As a legislator in 2003, Lai was a member of the Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee and promoted the Cancer Control Act under which hospitals had a duty to report cancer cases. He also supported the National Cancer Prevention and Control Program which was launched in 2005 and has entered its fifth phase this year. After taking office last May, the president established the Healthy Taiwan Promotion Committee. Under the committee, specific measures implemented to prevent cancer include: an increase of funding for expanded screening programs; advancements in genetic testing and precision medicine; and next generation sequencing to target disease-appropriate medication, which has been covered by the national health insurance system since May 1, 2023. Lai concluded by lauding Taipei City-headquartered Hope Foundation For Cancer Care for their long-standing support for patients and families.

According to the Ministry of Culture, the 33rd edition of the annual event involves the participation of both publishing houses from home and abroad and government agencies to offer participants more engaging experiences. Among these, the Human Rights Discovery booth set up by New Taipei City-based National Human Rights Museum features literary works from its collection on political persecution in Taiwan. In particular, the main visual element is the xiezhi, a mythical single-horned creature that has become a symbol of justice for its innate ability to distinguish right from wrong. During the exhibition's run through Feb. 9, the NHRM will stage book promotion events including discussions with the authors, workshops on the country's White Terror period and talks on human rights issues. Equally impressive, the Cabinet-level Council of Indigenous Peoples' Oceanic Memories booth focuses on the intertwined origins, histories and cultural heritage of Indigenous peoples in the Pacific, as well as their shared resilience and creativity. Andrea Bowman, ambassador to the ROC (Taiwan) of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and head of the diplomatic corps in Taiwan, was among the guests of honor at the pavilion's launch. The booth features publications on the cultures, histories and related policymaking of Oceanian and Southeast Asian countries produced under a collaborative project with the MOC since 2018, important cultural relics from allies Palau and the Marshall Islands and five workshops on Austronesian affairs, the CIP said.

SBNPM holds exhibition on Taoist immortal Lu Dongbin	The Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum is holding an exhibition featuring calligraphy and artifacts relating to Lu Dongbin, one of the Taoism's Eight Immortals, showcasing various interpretations of the immortals from sophisticated literary depictions to popular images of longevity and prosperity. According to the SBNPM, the Lu Dongbin legend emerged in the early 11th century with accounts of his miraculous manifestations. His spiritual legacy encompasses both literary work and spiritual practice, including distinctive sword techniques for overcoming worldly desire and emotional attachment. Titled &ldquo;Tracing the Taoist Immortal Lu Dongbin in the NPM collection,&rdquo; the exhibition's most important piece is the transcription of verses relating to the immortal character by Dong Qichang (1555-1636). The scroll is a rendition of Lu's poetry with a commentary, the SBNPM said, adding that Dong's brushwork centers on controlled tip movements and fluid transitions, creating lines that possess both vigor and grace. Through slightly asymmetrical, yet balanced character structures, expansive composition spacing and the dramatic interplay of ink and empty space, the work ultimately creates an ethereal and transcendent visual experience, the museum noted. The SBNPM said that other highlights of the exhibition are objects decorated with images of the eight immortals, including a gourd-shaped vase in blue underglaze, a vase with polychrome decoration and a round carved-polychrome lacquer box.

During his opening remarks, Lai said knowledge is power and encouraged more people to take part in the event.

According to Li, Taiwan has a diverse, free and creative culture, and the exhibition provides an opportunity to engage in cultural exchange with Italy and other countries from around the world. Echoing Li's remarks, Paola Seghi, international relations manager of the Italian Publishers Association, said that participating in the event is an extraordinary chance since Asia is the second-biggest region the association sells publishing rights to following the European market.

Lai pledges to enhance Taiwan’s investment environment	President Lai Ching-te said Feb. 3 that the government is committed to promoting the Three Major Programs for Investing in Taiwan while sparing no effort to enhance the country's investment environment. The president made the remarks while attending a Lunar New Year event in Taipei City for Taiwan businesses operating in China. Lai first praised Taiwan's impressive economic growth rate of 4.2 percent last year, which surpassed those of the U.S. and EU countries. He said that the government's three investment programs&mdash;the action plan for welcoming overseas Taiwan businesses to return to invest, the action plan for accelerated investment by domestic corporations and the action plan for accelerated investment by small- and medium-sized enterprises&mdash;will be extended to 2027. The government is also promoting investment deduction measures to help more SMEs and startups, Lai said, adding that it is equally important to examine elements such as utilities, land, workforce and talent cultivation. The president also noted that the government is working hard to maintain the stability of the country's interest rates, exchange rate and inflation rate. As a president, Lai said he has three main missions, the first of which is to safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty, and vowed to uphold the Four Commitments proposed by former President Tsai Ing-wen. Second, the president bears the responsibility of protecting the lives and property of Taiwan's 23 million people, Lai said, stressing the importance of global peace. To this end, he cited the Four Pillars of Peace action plan, which involves strengthening national defense, building economic security, deepening partnerships with democratic countries, and maintaining stable and principled cross-strait leadership. The third mission is to improve the standard of living across the board, Lai said. He outlined a raft of measures spanning minimum wage increases, tax reductions, the national childcare policy for aged 0-6 and the Youth Overseas Dream Fund program, adding that the government will continue to care for the well-being of all segments of society while working with the private sector to bolster Taiwan's economic growth.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Italy’s Corriere Della Sera	Deputy Foreign Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu gave an interview to Massimo Franco of Italy's leading daily news media, Corriere Della Sera, in early January to stress the importance of a free and democratic Taiwan to global security. In an article published Jan. 26 by the media outlet, Wu compared Taiwan to 1938's Czechoslovakia, when it was the fifth largest industrial power in Europe and the tenth in the world. By taking over its industries through the Munich Agreement, Nazi Germany was able to pay for the start of the Second World War. This, Wu said, is what China wants to do with Taiwan: take over its semiconductor industry, which accounts for 90 percent of global production, and change the world. While Taiwan only has 12 diplomatic allies in the world, it maintains close political, economic and trade relationship with more than 100 countries, he said. Pointing out the production and technological leadership of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Wu said if Taiwan is invaded, factories around the world will shut down in weeks. Taiwan is fully aware of the threats and dangers from China and is preparing for the worst according to three guidelines: develop defensive capabilities; garner support from the free world; and make security in the Taiwan Strait an international rather than a regional issue. With regard to Taiwan-Vatican relations, Wu praised the Holy See as a unique religious entity with high moral standards, defending moral and religious freedom as an important mission. Based on diplomatic relations that have lasted more than 80 years, Taiwan will continue to maintain its close ties with the Holy See, Wu said.

Lai responds to pope’s World Day of Peace call	President Lai Ching-te sent a letter Jan. 31 to Pope Francis in response to his message marking the 58th World Day of Peace. In the letter, the president expressed support for the papal plea that the global community initiate a cultural shift that would bring an end to governing interpersonal and international relations through exploitation and oppression and herald true and lasting peace. According to Lai, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and convergence of authoritarian regimes threaten the rules-based international order and severely impact peace and stability both in the Indo-Pacific and around the world. Echoing the pope's belief that war means defeat for all, Lai said the international community has reached consensus on upholding cross-strait peace and stability, adding that Taiwan is committed to safeguarding its freedom, equality, democracy and respect for human rights. Taiwan is proactively implementing values-based diplomacy and the Diplomatic Allies Prosperity Project to accelerate the development of allied nations, Lai said, adding that the country helps alleviate poverty by strengthening basic infrastructure, transferring technology and cultivating talent. In response to the pope's call for a new global financial framework jointly addressing climate change, food crises and other challenges, Lai expressed hope that international organizations will stop excluding Taiwan for political reasons. Taiwan is willing and able to shoulder its international responsibility to contribute and share its valuable experience through global platforms, he added. The president concluded by saying that Taiwan will continue to collaborate with the Holy See to advance world peace through concrete action while jointly upholding the core values of justice, democracy, freedom and peace.

According to NMTL Director Chen Ying-fang, the illustrated book addresses issues spanning history, the environment, cultural assets and civic awareness, invoking universal values that resonate with readers. Its selection for the exhibition will serve as an excellent opportunity for global audiences to better understand Taiwan's vibrant literary landscape, she added. With a BA in theater arts from National Sun Yat-sen University and a masters in illustration from the U.K.'s Kingston University, Ballboss was also selected for the exhibition in 2019 and 2022. The artist said his latest work has special meaning to him due to the extensive field research and interviews he undertook to create it, adding that the Taiwanese version also presented a new challenge. Established in 1967 and considered one of the longest-running and most successful Bologna book fair initiatives, the exhibition attracted 21,870 submissions from 4,374 artists representing 89 countries and territories this year. The final selection came down to 76 artworks by 77 authors from 29 countries, and the winning works will be on display from March 31 to April 3, followed by a two-year global tour, the MOC said.

President Lai convenes 3rd National Climate Change Committee meeting	President Lai Ching-te convened the third meeting of the National Climate Change Committee at the Presidential Office Jan. 23 in Taipei City, reaffirming the administration's commitment to taking decisive climate change actions. Citing World Meteorological Organization statistics, Lai said 2024 was the warmest year in history and was marked with extreme weather conditions such as persistent high temperatures, severe droughts, strong winds and disastrous rainfalls. The ongoing wildfire in the U.S. city of Los Angeles also reflects the urgency of climate change adaptation, he added. As countries around the world get ready to update their 2035 nationally determined contributions starting in February, Taiwan is resolute in its determination to achieve its own carbon emission reduction goals, the president said. To this end, Cabinet agencies have worked diligently and consulted with experts to review progress of ongoing carbon reduction measures, Lai said, adding that the country's new targets have been set at 30-34 percent of 2005 levels for 2032 and 36-40 percent for 2035. The president went on to stress how important it is for the business sector and all other segments of society to work together to achieve these ambitious goals. He directed the Ministries of Education and Environment to roll out more climate change education initiatives in line with Taiwan&#39;s Climate Change Response Act. More public awareness projects are also required to promote a low-carbon lifestyle and reach social consensus on behavioral changes necessary to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 for the benefit of all, Lai added.

Vice Premier Cheng commits to sustainable tourism	Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun stressed Jan. 22 that tourism is an element of Taiwan's soft power and urged ministries and agencies to work together to bolster the country's sustainable tourism. The vice premier made the remarks at a tourism revitalization discussion held by the Executive Yuan in Taipei City. During the meeting, the Tourism Administration proposed two flagship plans. The first aims to attract more international tourists to Taiwan on the strength of the country's abundant culture and history, geology and landscape, as well as its significant ecological conservation, the TA said, adding that the administration will cooperate with the Ministries of Agriculture, Culture and the Interior to implement the plan.

Other notable successes are implementing law amendments and measures to promote bond and securities trading and market developments, and launching guidelines on artificial intelligence applications to bolster financial innovation and sustainability. The FSC said some of its policy priorities for 2025 are strengthening mechanisms to counter financial fraud, enhance risk management and corporate governance and ensure cybersecurity for banks and insurance firms. Additional primary issues are adjusting measures relating to mergers and acquisitions; channeling more market capital to the country's infrastructure projects; and enhancing protection for investors. The agency said it will roll out more regulatory measures to bolster financial innovation and sustainable development, so that the sector will continue to play a key role in driving economic growth for the benefit of all members of society.

Taiwan Pavilion design for Venice Architecture Biennale unveiled	The Taiwan Pavilion design for the Venice Architecture Biennale was unveiled Jan. 21 by the Ministry of Culture in southern Taiwan's Tainan City. Proposed by Tainan-based National Cheng Kung University with support from Taichung City-headquartered National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, the design is themed &ldquo;Non-Belief: Taiwan Intelligens of Precarity,&rdquo; the MOC said. Inspired by U.S. land artist Robert Smithson's &ldquo;Non-sites&rdquo; theory, which emphasizes absence, displacement and duality of landscape, the design aligns with the biennale's main theme of &ldquo;Intelligens. Natural. Artificial. Collective.,&rdquo; the ministry added.

A total of 16 architectural research documents and 12 models will also be displayed in the pavilion, the ministry said. The pavilion design also addresses issues such as the impact of Taiwan's high-speed rail construction and the establishment of solar panels on ecology, with the latter using Tainan's Qigu District as a case study, the MOC said, adding that it further examines the conflicts between architecture and other environmental aspects like culture. NTMFA Director Chen Kuang-yi said during the event that the biennale is an opportunity to show Taiwan's architectural prowess to the world and an opportunity to undertake exchange with the international community. It is expected that more people will understand Taiwan's spatial strategies and wisdom for globalization, she added.

Act on Wildlife Conservation amendments passed by Legislature	The Legislative Yuan passed amendments to the Act on Wildlife Conservation Jan. 21 in Taipei City, underscoring the government's respect for Taiwan's Indigenous heritage in its efforts to conserve wildlife, protect biodiversity and maintain the balance of natural ecosystems. The amendments, which involve nine clauses of the act, prohibit the use of steel-jaw traps, dynamite and other explosives to catch wild animals, the Ministry of Agriculture said, adding that any devices, equipment and medication used to illegally catch wild animals, as well as the catch and their products, will be confiscated. In addition, owners of protected animals bear the responsibility to report and recover lost animals, as well as pay for all associated costs if a government agency provides assistance. Stricter punishment is also imposed on those who fail to do so. According to the MOA, the amendments allow members of Indigenous groups to hunt wild animals for nonprofit purposes, including birth celebrations and other ritual ceremonies. In a move to decriminalize hunting without prior approval from relevant agencies, the amendments impose only administrative fines on Indigenous individuals for such violations and exonerate first-time offenders. Following the passage, the revised regulations governing the hunting and slaughtering of wild animals for cultural and ritual purposes by Indigenous groups are expected to take effect in 2026, the MOA added.

Premier Cho reaffirms commitment to safeguarding coastal security	Premier Cho Jung-tai said Jan. 20 that the government is sparing no effort to protect the safety of all Coast Guard Administration staff as they continue to safeguard Taiwan's coastal security and sovereignty. The premier made the remarks while visiting the base of the CGA's Northern Sector Flotilla at Taipei Port to express gratitude to personnel for sacrificing their Lunar New Year holidays for the people of Taiwan. According to Cho, given Taiwan's 1,200 kilometers of coastline, any breach along the shores would greatly compromise national security and lead to severe damage. The Northern Sector Flotilla is the largest among five such units in terms of personnel and patrol vessel numbers, and plays a leading role in monitoring the country's territorial waters from the shores of the northeastern county of Yilan to the northern county of Hsinchu, he added. The premier commended CGA staff for their tireless efforts in carrying out rescue missions, combating smuggling and ensuring maritime order and ecological conservation, citing as an example the 35-day mission over 17,000 kilometers by CG-5002 Hsinchu in 2024 to protect the rights of local fishermen. Cho said in the past two weeks he attended the ceremony marking the delivery of CG-611 Chang Bin, PP-10096 and PP-3525 and the naming of CG-612 Suao, as well as visiting a CGA command in the outlying Kinmen County.

At a time when authoritarian regimes continue to converge and present serious challenges to democracies around the world, Lai said free and democratic nations need to work in unity to expand their cooperation. A stronger Taiwan-U.S. partnership will be an even more powerful force in safeguarding peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, the president added.

Former U.S. President Reagan was a strong supporter and friend of Taiwan, Lai said, adding that the Six Assurances were proposed by Reagan in 1982 and the Taiwan Relations Act was passed by the U.S. Congress in 1979 and both have served as a firm basis for bilateral ties. Reagan's belief in peace through strength is vital at a time when authoritarian regimes are in the ascendant, Lai said. The rise of autocratic states shows the importance of unity between democracies to maintain rules-based international order, Lai added. Lai conveyed gratitude to Trulio and the foundation for backing Taiwan despite China's threats and anticipated furthering Taiwan-U.S. relations through working with the institute. He also thanked the foundation for the warm reception offered to former President Tsai Ing-wen during her stopover in California, April 2023. In response, Trulio said that the visit comes at a critical juncture as the U.S. prepares to transition to a new administration. The delegation has been impressed with Taiwan's vibrant democracy and its leading position in global economy and technology, he added. The robust two-way partnership and U.S. defense deterrence are indispensable to security across the Taiwan Strait, Truio noted. He concluded by anticipating that the two sides would continue to work together to fulfill mutual commitments to upholding democracy, freedom and stability.

NHRM, AS hold workshop on White Terror period	The National Human Rights Museum and Academia Sinica Institute of Taiwan History hosted a two-day workshop Jan. 9-10 on the White Terror period, highlighting government efforts to promote human rights research while bolstering public understanding of the country's past. The event was attended by over 100 people, including academics, experts, family members of surviving victims and victims themselves, as well as cultural and human rights workers. The first day's seminars focused on experience sharing by survivors and family members on their path of recovery, members of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan reflecting on their thoughts after reading government surveillance files on their communities, and cultural workers on their field surveys. The second day was a presentation of ten essays, which topics included the investigation process of political cases, and other cases involving Indigenous peoples, rural areas and military personnel. ITH Director Chung Shu-min mentioned at the event that a collection of papers presented in the last workshop is to be published soon. NHRM Deputy Director Chen Shu-man said in her remarks that it is the museum's responsibility to clarify the historical truth of the period and disseminate it through exhibitions and education. The museum's work also plays a vital role in realizing the country's transitional justice, she added. According to Chen, the two bodies have also been in cooperation since 2017 to compile and streamline White Terror period information resources into an online search platform called Taiwan Human Rights Memory Bank. The resources are categorized into the five main areas of people, events and cases, institutions and organizations, laws and systems, and search terms. The White Terror refers to a period from 1949 to 1987 in Taiwan and 1992 in the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu islands during which the government declared martial law and suppressed and prosecuted political dissidents.

Taiwan ports deliver 2024 report card	Taiwan's nine ports recorded 690 million revenue tons in cargo handled and 13.92 million twenty-foot equivalent units in container throughput in 2024, creating record revenues of NT$22.8 billion (US$692.17 million) for Taiwan International Ports Corp. Ltd., the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said Jan. 9 in a press release. TIPC Chair Lee Hsien-yi praised the results, especially in a year of daunting challenges including a lower global economic growth rate, the Red Sea crisis and Russia-Ukraine war on the global front, as well as natural disasters with domestic impact such as October's Typhoon Krathon and the magnitude 7.2 earthquake that hit the eastern county of Hualien in April. Lee attributed the strong performance to the company's efforts to expand its core businesses while aggressively diversifying into other areas such as offshore wind power generation, waterfront development projects and various reinvestment strategies. The chair described Terminal 7 of Kaohsiung Port, the country's first smart, automated terminal, as vital to 2024's success in addition to being foundational for future trade: it can berth four 24,000-TEU container ships at the same time with an annual handling volume of 6.5 million TEUs. Other highlights included land reclamation at Taipei Port's logistics zone, a new wharf at Anping Port and passenger terminal upgrades at Suao Port and Hualien Port. Over the course of the year TIPC also introduced a raft of measures and artificial intelligence-based technologies to enhance power consumption management, ensure navigation safety, expedite logistics services and reduce carbon emissions, Lee added. Lee said key TIPC development projects for 2025 include renovations of Kaohsiung Port's Terminal 3 and Terminal 5, more land reclamation at Taipei Port and passenger clearance facility improvement at Penghu Port. He added that these efforts are expected to help increase local ports' total cargo handling volume by 3 percent, attract one million passenger arrivals, incur NT$3.37 billion in investment and create 1,300 new jobs in the process.

Premier Cho receives USTBC delegation	Premier Cho Jung-tai received a delegation from the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council Jan. 7 in Taipei City, expressing anticipation of continued growth of the robust partnership with Washington under the new administration. Cho welcomed the second visit in six months by members of the Arlington-based entity and applauded their dedication to promoting bilateral business exchanges. The group included representatives from sectors spanning academia, finance, medical care, national defense and semiconductors, reflecting the diverse nature of the Taiwan-U.S. partnership, he added. According to Cho, the local economy averaged an annual growth rate of 3.2 percent between 2016 and 2023 despite the pandemic and geopolitical tension, with the 2024 figure estimated at 4.27 percent. To maintain fundamental strength in Taiwan's economy, Cho said the government has proposed a raft of major projects to balance national development, bolster investment from home and abroad, fast track infrastructure development and promote personnel cultivation.
