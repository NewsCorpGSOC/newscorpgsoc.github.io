TAITRA outlines development strategies for 2025	Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) held a press event Dec. 26 in Taipei City to unveil its 2025 development strategies in response to new geopolitical challenges and economic uncertainties. During the event, TAITRA Chair James C.F. Huang said that given Taiwan's key position in the global supply chain, the inauguration of U.S. President Donald J. Trump will have a major effect on global tariffs, trade and logistics. The country's small- and medium-sized enterprises need to formulate new strategies since they will feel the greatest impact, he added. As a result, Huang said in 2025 TAITRA will step up research on geoeconomics and the U.S. market; promote the Five Trusted Industry Sectors unveiled by President Lai Ching-te in his inauguration speech in May; implement the Ministry of Economic Affairs' export promotion campaigns; and initiate a raft of events, such as trade shows at home and abroad, to help local firms stay ahead of technological development trends and tap into related business opportunities. Equally important, Huang said the council will continue to conduct geoeconomic surveys for its TAITRA Index, and include its global network for data collection. According to TAITRA, new initiatives for next year include the establishment of a trade center in Prague; additional staff at its Fukuoka office to promote the Taiwan Select brand; a Taiwan health industry exhibition center in Southeast Asia; a Taiwan Expo in the U.S. city of Dallas that focuses on artificial intelligence applications, advanced manufacturing and the health sector; and the launch of a new exhibition center in the central city of Taichung in the fourth quarter.

MOC launches initiative to preserve Taiwanese language	A plan to encourage families to speak Taiwanese in the home was announced by the Ministry of Culture Dec. 25 in Taipei City, highlighting the government's commitment to preserving the country's multilingual heritage. Prominent attendees at the launch ceremony included MOC Minister Li Yuan and Caring for Taiwan Foundation Chair Chou Ching-yu. Speaking at the event, Li voiced the hope that every national tongue would become widespread because language equality reflects the equity among different ethnic groups. Chou pointed out that a long-term focus on Mandarin has led to a gradual decrease in speakers of other national languages, adding that despite the passage of the Development of National Languages Act in 2019, Taiwanese does not have any specific law or organization to promote its use. The initiative is a response to an MOC survey conducted in 2020 that found a significant decline in Taiwanese as a first language among younger generations. Under the plan, households that comprise at least two members of different generations or are formed by a married couple can apply to become a Taiwanese-speaking family. Based on language proficiency, those who wish to improve their Taiwanese can register for the &ldquo;Taiwanese language learning family&rdquo; track, while those who are fluent can register for the &ldquo;Taiwanese culture family&rdquo; track, the MOC said, adding that status is granted after members complete required courses.

MOENV promotes plastic-reduction rules in hotel, accommodation sector	The Ministry of Environment held a news conference Dec. 24 to call attention to regulations coming into effect Jan. 1, 2025, to require hotels and other types of accommodation to use less plastic. According to the MOENV, operators will not be permitted to proactively provide six kinds of personal hygiene products: combs, razors, shaving foam, shower caps, toothbrushes and toothpaste. They are also required to put shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and lotion into large bottles starting no later than Jan. 1. Speaking at the event, Environment Minister Peng Chi-ming said the measure responds to the global demand for carbon and plastic reduction. He added that it also aligns with the sustainable development concept proposed by the 2024 Paris Olympics. To help operators comply, the MOENV said over 50 meetings will be held by the environmental bureaus of cities and counties around Taiwan, with various activities hosted and advertisements posted to expand public understanding of the measure. The ministry expects 460 million items to be saved each year, the equivalent of reducing carbon emissions by 2,500 metric tons.

Premier Cho pledges to raise Taiwan cancer survival rates by 2030	As part of President Lai Ching-te's policy goal of building a healthier Taiwan, a drive to reduce the country's cancer deaths by one-third by 2030 will be implemented, the Executive Yuan said Dec. 24. During a cross-ministerial cancer prevention meeting at the EY, Premier Cho Jung-Tai said this will be achieved through a three-pronged approach: improving early-stage screening, focusing on genetic testing and precision medicine, and establishing a NT$10 billion (US$306.09 million) fund to develop new cancer drugs. According to Cho, statistics released Dec. 19 by the Ministry of Health and Welfare showed that in 2022, more than 130,000 Taiwan citizens were diagnosed with cancer for the first time, up 8,500 from the year before. The MOHW attributed the increase to the fact that more individuals undertook screening and received treatment following the slowdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many causes contributed to cancer, the premier said MOHW findings acknowledged the importance of early screening, which allows patients time to seek treatment and thus improve survival rates. In particular, as chewing betel nut is a major cause of oral cancers, Cho said there should be clear laws to regulate the crops' consumption and manage the plantations. He directed the Ministry of Agriculture and other agencies to work together to review progress so far and propose measures, such as public awareness campaigns on its health hazards and guidelines to phase out betel nut plantations. Starting in 2025, the government will offer subsidies to screen for lung, breast, colon and cervical cancer and for human papillomavirus to an expanded demographic. These include a NT$4,000 subsidy every two years for low-dose computed tomography scan for lung cancer screening for heavy smokers aged 50-74 who consume at least 20 packs of cigarettes per year, as well as women aged 40-74 and men aged 45-74 whose direct family members have been diagnosed with lung cancer.

Taiwan’s GDP forecast to grow 3.1 percent in 2025	Taiwan's economy is projected to grow 3.1 percent in 2025 on the strength of reviving demand for electronic products and expanding high-speed computing and artificial intelligence applications, Academia Sinica said Dec. 23. According to AS, Taiwan's annual growth rates for real exports and imports of goods and services in 2025 are forecast at 6.53 percent and 7.17 percent, respectively, as the country's increasingly important role in the AI hardware supply chain drives a sustained rise in foreign trade. However, the institution cautioned that U.S. tariff policies may pose uncertainties for Taiwan's export performance. As for private investment, AS said the real annual growth rate is estimated at 5.46 percent due to robust demand for automation, AI-driven opportunities and low-carbon development trends, along with increasing investments from international corporations in Taiwan. Similarly, investment in public infrastructure is also expected to steadily increase, it added. Real private consumption is expected to see modest growth of 2.02 percent in 2025, AS said. Adjustments in minimum wage and military, government and education salaries, along with strong corporate profitability in 2024, are expected to support private consumption, though an increase could be mitigated by uncertainties such as heightened stock market volatility, it added. In addition, AS statistics showed that the unemployment rate for 2025 is projected at 3.26 percent, down from 3.37 percent in 2024, while the inflationary pressures are expected to persist next year. The global economic environment is anticipated to face higher uncertainty in 2025, with concerns spanning the intensity of U.S. trade protectionism and acceleration of supply chain restructuring and market fragmentation, AS said, adding that Taiwan must work to transform these challenges into opportunities.

Taiwan readies for carbon fee collection	The National Development Council said Dec. 19 that all relevant government agencies will work hand in hand to implement a carbon pricing system set to take effect in 2025, following a briefing by the Ministry of Environment on the new policy measure. According to three regulations drafted by the MOENV in August this year, during the initial stage the fees will be levied on about 281 power and gas suppliers and manufacturing firms that emit the equivalent of more than 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Starting Jan. 1, 2025, entities must calculate their annual greenhouse gas emissions and pay their carbon fees by the end of May the next year. Compared to the standard fee of NT$300 (US$9.18) per ton, there are also preferential rates to entities that submit self-determined reduction plans that include strategies such as a switching to low-carbon fuels, adopting negative emission technology, improving energy efficiency, using renewable energy or enhancing industrial processes. The NDC said the system aims to reduce carbon emissions and drive net-zero transition for Taiwan's industrial sector. If all relevant entities submit self-determined reduction plans, the NDC expects collective carbon emissions to be cut by 37 million tons by 2030, which will help achieve Taiwan's intended nationally determined contribution of carbon emissions. To this end, the MOENV has held seven briefings on carbon fee regulations and organized seminars with local governments throughout the country. The NDC said more measures are in the pipeline to enhance public consensus and bring Taiwan's regulations in line with global standards, so that the system will play a key role in driving green growth for a better future for all.

Taiwan hosts international conference on eliminating hepatitis C	Taiwan staged the 2024 International Conference on Elimination of Hepatitis C Dec. 12 in Taipei City, highlighting the government's commitment to working with global partners to eradicate the disease by 2025. Organized by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the event was attended by academics and experts from Australia, Japan, the U.K., the U.S. and Europe. It included four sessions, with the former vice president and current Academica Sinica academician Chen Chien-jen giving a keynote speech on Taiwan's strategies to eliminate liver diseases, and Chien Rong-nan, professor at New Taipei City-based Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and University, addressing the domestic status of hepatitis C eradication during the first session. Philippa Easterbrook, professor at the Imperial College in London, and John Ward, director of the U.S.-headquartered Coalition for Global Hepatitis Elimination, discussed the progress of elimination efforts in Asia and around the world during the second session, while Taiwan participants introduced the country's measures to treat high-risk groups during the third and experts from home and abroad shared best practices for combating the disease at the city, county and community levels in the last session. MOHW Minister Chiu Tai-yuan said during his opening remarks that both hepatitis B and C cause around 11,000 deaths in Taiwan every year from chronic inflammation and other liver complications. The government is sparing no effort in adopting precision prevention, localization strategies and one-stop services to provide comprehensive and effective screening and treatment, he added. Such work has been bolstered by the coverage of hepatitis C treatment under the National Health Insurance system starting in 2003 and the continued expansion of publicly funded screenings, Chiu said, adding that funding for the latter was raised again earlier this year, with over 6.66 million people receiving the test as of June. Echoing his remarks, Wu Chao-chun, director-general of the MOHW's Health Promotion Administration, said that Taiwan is performing well in the indicators proposed by the World Health Organization, including the current diagnosis and treatment rates, as well as blood transfusion and injection safety. He expressed hope that the country would eliminate the virus by 2025, earlier than the WHO's 2030 goal, and share its experience with the world.

NSTC unveils new carbon capture, conversion technologies	A research team from National Taiwan University has successfully developed pioneering technologies in membrane-based carbon capture and electrochemical carbon conversion, according to the National Science and Technology Council Dec. 11. Supported by the NSTC's net-zero emission program, the NTU ZERO team comprises chemical engineering and chemistry experts from the Taipei City-based university. In particular, the team has established a pilot production machine capable of converting carbon dioxide into upstream chemical products, with a processing capacity of 50 kilograms of CO2 per day. According to the NSTC, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas currently produce most of Taiwan's energy supply, while thermal power generation accounts for 14 percent of the country's carbon emissions, with industrial emissions making up 55 percent of the total. Both the sources can utilize the new carbon capture technology for reuse or storage, the council added. Based on the NTU team's calculations, the efficiency of the most widely adopted carbon capture technology is only about 60 percent given its method and choice of absorbents. In comparison, the NTU team developed an innovative ultramicroporous metal-organic framework that can absorb CO2 with an estimated efficiency of nearly 90 percent. Equally impressive, the NSTC said the team has developed a high efficiency electrochemical process that can convert CO2 into syngas, formic acid, ethanol or ethylene, which are all higher-value chemical compounds with negative carbon footprints. Its low power consumption and high selectivity also reduce the energy and cost of subsequent product purification, the council added. The NSTC expects the positive development will inspire more domestic industries to invest in related initiatives and help contribute to the government's goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2025.

According to the EY, the plan aims to promote public-private partnerships, enhance investment conditions for public infrastructure and expand financial products related to public construction projects. The EY said a special task force will set up a mechanism for the government and private sector to jointly propose projects while easing relevant policy and regulatory barriers. The force is expected to facilitate communication between public and private entities, while dedicated meetings will coordinate ministry and agency efforts and provide opportunities for experts to submit suggestions, it added. Several potential projects, such as the development of the O9 station of Kaohsiung Metro's Orange Line, have been selected as priorities, the EY said, adding that the amount of private investment in public construction countrywide is expected to reach NT$682.9 billion (US$21 billion) over the next four years and will create 126,000 job opportunities. The government is also incentivizing the insurance industry to invest in public infrastructure private equity funds, the EY said, explaining that the Financial Supervisory Commission has reduced the risk of direct investment and increased the investment limit for strategic industries with public infrastructure elements. Additionally, the EY encouraged the issuance of NT$510 billion-NT$610 billion sustainable bonds and Real Estate Investment Trust shares, the latter of which are projected to pour NT$45 billion into public construction by the end of 2028. First presented by the EY's Economic Development Committee in July, the plan aims to channel NT$3-4 trillion of domestic and international capital into Taiwan's major infrastructure projects.

President Lai receives Oklahoma Gov. Stitt	President Lai Ching-te received a delegation led by Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt at the Presidential Office Dec. 9 in Taipei City and pledged to keep expanding economic and trade partnership with the U.S. state.

He also invited the delegation members to visit Taiwan again in the future. In response, Stitt called Taiwan an economic success story, adding that its high-tech economy, R&amp;D, and electronics and metal manufacturing sectors are well known and respected around the world. The governor said he was delighted to host a group of industry representatives from Taiwan to discuss collaboration in the aerospace sector in April and welcomed the memorandums of understanding to explore new partnerships concluded by the drone and unmanned aircraft systems delegation from his state to Taiwan two months ago.

Taiwan welcomes 7 million foreign visitors to date	More than 7 million foreign nationals have visited Taiwan as of Dec. 3 this year, with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Tourism Administration expecting the upward trend to continue for the rest of the year. TA statistics shows that Japan is back as the leading source of travelers and accounts for 1.18 million arrivals, followed by Hong Kong and Macau with 1.16 million arrivals, and South Korea with nearly 0.9 million visits. Thanks to additional flights on existing routes and new ones, as well as a variety of promotion campaigns, the U.S. is now the fourth largest traveler source with nearly 0.6 million arrivals, surpassing pre-pandemic numbers. The agency attributed the strong performances to the success of key policy initiatives promoting Taiwan as a top vacation destination. Some examples include the establishment of offices so far this year in Jakarta, Mumbai, Paris and Vancouver. The TA said a new tourism information center will open for business Dec. 20 in Manila, while two new ones are being planned for Seattle and Sydney next year. Seven travel sites and two firms from Taiwan are among the 2024 Green Destinations Top 100 Stories presented by the Netherlands-based Green Destinations Foundation, the TA said. To build on these results, the government will continue to create low-carbon travel destinations and promote Taiwan as a top choice for green and sustainable tourism. Tourism is a key sector in government strategy, with new promotional initiatives such as the &ldquo;Taiwan, Waves of Wonder&rdquo; overseas campaign, subsidies for domestic travel and joint promotional projects with local governments. Based on all these factors, the TA expects to see the sector create NT$1 trillion (US$30.86 billion) in output by 2028.

Lai received warmly in Marshall Islands by president, Nitijela	President Lai Ching-te met with Marshall Islands President Hilda C. Heine and ministers Dec. 3 during the first stop of his seven-day trip to Taiwan's Pacific allies. Lai first thanked Heine for speaking up for Taiwan at this year's Pacific Islands Forum, U.N. General Assembly and the 29th Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Taiwan and the Marshall Islands enjoy close cooperation on projects in areas ranging from climate change adaptation to women's empowerment, he said, pledging to further deepen bilateral collaborations across the board. In response, Heine said Lai's visit demonstrated the robust ties between the two countries. She reaffirmed that the Marshall Islands will continue to voice support of Taiwan in the U.N. and other international organizations. At a state banquet hosted by Heine, Lai announced an additional US$500,000 in funding for the ROC (Taiwan)-RMI Presidents' Scholarship program. Earlier the same day, Lai delivered an address to the Nitijela, the parliament of the Marshall Islands, and shared that Taiwan would provide a loan to the country intended to improve local air services. During his speech, he emphasized that the two countries share a rich Austronesian culture and both value freedom and democracy. He went on to express his hope that the two countries will continue working together to combat climate change, citing a memorandum of understanding for the establishment of the Taiwan-Marshall Islands Adaptation and Contingency Fund for Climate Change signed by the two sides last year. The president also joined the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Majuro Hospital AI and Telemedicine Center, which will be operated with support from Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, and joined a market showcasing agricultural produce cultivated with help from the Taiwan technical mission in the Pacific ally.

Techno art exhibition kicks off at NTMFA	The 2024 International Techno Art Exhibition has brought together 12 artists to explore the liberation of human consciousness via digital technology, and is underway through March 2, 2025, at the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in the central city of Taichung. During the Nov. 30 opening ceremony Deputy Culture Minister Lee Ching-hwi said an increasing number of artists are intrigued by the rapid development of artificial intelligence and have begun to take inspiration from the technology and incorporate it into their works. Some are intrigued by the question of whether AI has a soul, she said, adding that such reflective thinking is key to artistic creation. This exhibition, &ldquo;Right Where It Belongs,&rdquo; provides a venue for the public to engage with AI and the future that it promises, Lee continued, adding that it is also important that as people move toward the future, they attend to the reminders from the artists&#39; creations to not leave the past behind. According to the organizer, the exhibition is inspired by technium, an idea proposed by Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired magazine. This cutting-edge concept and hypothesis is concerned with the integration of the artificial and natural worlds from a technical perspective, and regards technology as an evolving extension of the human mind. &ldquo;Exploration and Exploitation&rdquo; by New Taipei City-based Simple Noodle Art is one of the works on display. It features an interactive system that uses AI technology to modify its output based on the audience's visual responses to the video being displayed, and asks whether AI exacerbates social divisions when faced with the dilemma of exploring or exploiting humans. The event also includes side events such as two workshops, a forum, an artistic talk and guided tours of the museum, the organizers said.

MOFA thanks UK House of Commons for support of Taiwan	A motion passed by the U.K. House of Commons affirming that U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan is deeply appreciated by the government and people, both the Presidential Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Nov. 29. Proposed by Blair McDougall, a member of the lower house's Foreign Affairs Committee, the motion was jointly signed by cross-party MPs including Sarah Champion, co-chair of the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group, and Iain Duncan Smith, co-chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, among others. According to the motion, UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan, and neither does it address the political status of Taiwan, nor establish The People's Republic of China's sovereignty over Taiwan. It is silent both on the status of Taiwan in the U.N. and on Taiwan participation in UN agencies, while stating clearly that nothing in law prevents the participation of Taiwan in international organizations. The motion further condemned efforts made by PRC representatives to distort the meaning of the resolution as well as their alteration of historic documents. Catherine West, parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, said that UNGA Resolution 2758 should not be utilized to exclude Taiwan from meaningful engagement in global mechanisms, adding that the U.K. opposes any attempt to misinterpret the resolution, which is not in the interests of the people of Taiwan, the U.K. nor the world. In response, the PO said the motion expressly refutes China's distortion of the resolution and denounces Beijing's attempts to restrict Taiwan's global presence. It demonstrates the international community's support of Taiwan's democratic values, the office said, adding that the country will continue to work with other democracies to defend the core values of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. The current motion followed a similar resolution greenlighted by the IPAC during its annual meeting in July, and motions passed by the European Parliament and legislative branches in Australia, Canada, Guatemala and the Netherlands, according the MOFA.

MOFA highlights success of Taiwan NGOs’ UNFCCC participation	Taiwan's delegation has achieved great success participating as an NGO observer at the 29th Conference of the Parties of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change held Nov. 11-22 in Baku, Azerbaijan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Nov. 29. According to the MOFA, the Taiwan delegation was organized by the Ministry of Environment and comprised representatives from the public and private sectors. Embracing the principles of professionalism, pragmatism and contributing to global well-being, the group accomplished all its objectives with impressive results.

In line with Taiwan's integrated diplomacy strategy and policy goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, the delegation held 37 high-level bilateral meetings and expert discussions with representatives from allies, like-minded partners and international organizations. These events yielded extensive exchanges on topics spanning carbon diplomacy, carbon pricing, climate change policy, climate governance and energy transition while canvassing support for Taiwan's UNFCCC bid. Equally important, the delegation held banquets with allies, during which they shared views on carbon rights and climate change adaptation strategies to promote mutual prosperity. The group was also invited to demonstrate how Taiwan leveraged its high-tech prowess to expand climate partnership at the Palau Pavilion, as well as helping organize side events for four Taiwan NGOs and four allied countries. Combined with Taiwan's COP29 campaign, these activities have garnered extensive coverage by mainstream and new media, the MOFA said. Such coverage includes 196 news stories on an op-ed by Minister of Environment Peng Chi-ming, interviews with Taiwan's representatives stationed abroad and letters to the editors from the country's representatives based overseas.
