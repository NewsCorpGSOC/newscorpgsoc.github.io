Techno art exhibition kicks off at NTMFA	The 2024 International Techno Art Exhibition has brought together 12 artists to explore the liberation of human consciousness via digital technology, and is underway through March 2, 2025, at the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in the central city of Taichung. During the Nov. 30 opening ceremony Deputy Culture Minister Lee Ching-hwi said an increasing number of artists are intrigued by the rapid development of artificial intelligence and have begun to take inspiration from the technology and incorporate it into their works. Some are intrigued by the question of whether AI has a soul, she said, adding that such reflective thinking is key to artistic creation. This exhibition, &ldquo;Right Where It Belongs,&rdquo; provides a venue for the public to engage with AI and the future that it promises, Lee continued, adding that it is also important that as people move toward the future, they attend to the reminders from the artists&#39; creations to not leave the past behind. According to the organizer, the exhibition is inspired by technium, an idea proposed by Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired magazine. This cutting-edge concept and hypothesis is concerned with the integration of the artificial and natural worlds from a technical perspective, and regards technology as an evolving extension of the human mind. &ldquo;Exploration and Exploitation&rdquo; by New Taipei City-based Simple Noodle Art is one of the works on display. It features an interactive system that uses AI technology to modify its output based on the audience's visual responses to the video being displayed, and asks whether AI exacerbates social divisions when faced with the dilemma of exploring or exploiting humans. The event also includes side events such as two workshops, a forum, an artistic talk and guided tours of the museum, the organizers said.

MOFA thanks UK House of Commons for support of Taiwan	A motion passed by the U.K. House of Commons affirming that U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan is deeply appreciated by the government and people, both the Presidential Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Nov. 29. Proposed by Blair McDougall, a member of the lower house's Foreign Affairs Committee, the motion was jointly signed by cross-party MPs including Sarah Champion, co-chair of the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group, and Iain Duncan Smith, co-chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, among others. According to the motion, UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan, and neither does it address the political status of Taiwan, nor establish The People's Republic of China's sovereignty over Taiwan. It is silent both on the status of Taiwan in the U.N. and on Taiwan participation in UN agencies, while stating clearly that nothing in law prevents the participation of Taiwan in international organizations. The motion further condemned efforts made by PRC representatives to distort the meaning of the resolution as well as their alteration of historic documents. Catherine West, parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, said that UNGA Resolution 2758 should not be utilized to exclude Taiwan from meaningful engagement in global mechanisms, adding that the U.K. opposes any attempt to misinterpret the resolution, which is not in the interests of the people of Taiwan, the U.K. nor the world. In response, the PO said the motion expressly refutes China's distortion of the resolution and denounces Beijing's attempts to restrict Taiwan's global presence. It demonstrates the international community's support of Taiwan's democratic values, the office said, adding that the country will continue to work with other democracies to defend the core values of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. The current motion followed a similar resolution greenlighted by the IPAC during its annual meeting in July, and motions passed by the European Parliament and legislative branches in Australia, Canada, Guatemala and the Netherlands, according the MOFA.

In addition to making the case for Taiwan's UNFCCC participation through speeches or statements, the country's diplomatic allies sent a joint letter to UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell to voice their support. In response, the MOFA expressed its sincere appreciation for their recognition of Taiwan's commitment to addressing climate change. In line with Taiwan's integrated diplomacy strategy and policy goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, the delegation held 37 high-level bilateral meetings and expert discussions with representatives from allies, like-minded partners and international organizations. These events yielded extensive exchanges on topics spanning carbon diplomacy, carbon pricing, climate change policy, climate governance and energy transition while canvassing support for Taiwan's UNFCCC bid. Equally important, the delegation held banquets with allies, during which they shared views on carbon rights and climate change adaptation strategies to promote mutual prosperity. The group was also invited to demonstrate how Taiwan leveraged its high-tech prowess to expand climate partnership at the Palau Pavilion, as well as helping organize side events for four Taiwan NGOs and four allied countries. Combined with Taiwan's COP29 campaign, these activities have garnered extensive coverage by mainstream and new media, the MOFA said. Such coverage includes 196 news stories on an op-ed by Minister of Environment Peng Chi-ming, interviews with Taiwan's representatives stationed abroad and letters to the editors from the country's representatives based overseas. The promotional video &ldquo;Our Pale Blue Dot&rdquo; was viewed 12.5 million times, while related social media posts received 31.61 million views.

Vice premier reaffirms government commitment to net-zero transition	Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said Nov. 27 that the government is promoting energy transition and green growth strategies to drive Taiwan's economy through innovation while establishing the country as a provider of innovative and sustainable solutions. The vice premier made the remarks during an event organized by Taipei City-based financial magazine Business Weekly to honor 100 local firms for their carbon competitiveness. Cheng commended the magazine for launching the annual rankings in 2022, saying that they have been instrumental not just in encouraging the reduction of carbon emissions in Taiwan, but in helping enterprises break the traditional pattern of thought that sees carbon reduction as a cost burden that reduces corporate competitiveness. The vice premier also noted a positive trend in the past three years, as companies began to adopt more innovative approaches. She added that the latest list shows a decoupling of carbon emissions from profitability growth. Cheng also commended the honorees for working to enhance their energy efficiency, invest in energy storage equipment and help suppliers map out carbon reduction measures, among other initiatives. The vice premier said the carbon fee system proposed by the Ministry of Environment will take effect Jan. 1, 2025, adding that this expense will be deductible from the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism tariffs imposed on non-EU exporters. The government will continue to implement other measures, such as a carbon trading mechanism, in line with global practices to help the private sector move toward green manufacturing, circular economy and low-carbon transition, she said.

MOENV reaffirms government commitment to plastic reduction	The government is working across all sectors to formulate plastic reduction policy measures in line with global standards, the Ministry of Environment said in a statement Nov. 25. The ministry's remarks came following the opening of the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee of the UN Environment Program the same day in Busan, South Korea. The seven-day event aims to develop an international legally binding instrument by 2024 to address the full plastic lifecycle, including production, design and disposal. During a press event in Taipei City, MOENV Minister Peng Chi-ming said the ministry is closely monitoring INC-5's progress, and will review the government's 2018 plastic reduction goals and set new targets accordingly. The ministry is working on a bill to integrate the Waste Disposal Act and Resource Recycling Act for reuse of plastics in the circular economy, he added. According to the MOENV's Resource Circulation Administration, the UN plastics treaty seeks to reduce consumption of single-use plastics and develop replacements, as well as establish specific design requirements for plastic products that lead to an increase in their recyclability, among other goals. Following the future implementation of the treaty, the administration will take inventory of current regulations and formulate new measures in response. As part of this work, the MOENV set up a plastics alliance earlier this year to coordinate public and private sector action, formulate policy guidelines and offer technical support for local firms adapting to the global plastics treaty, the ministry said.

Taiwan novel wins US National Book Award	&ldquo;Taiwan Travelogue,&rdquo; a Mandarin-language novel written by Yang Shuang-zi and translated into English by Lin King, has won the National Book Award for Translated Literature presented by the U.S.-based National Book Foundation, the Ministry of Culture said Nov. 21. Set in 1938 during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945), the novel is a bittersweet love story between a Japanese novelist and her Taiwanese interpreter. It was recognized for its artful exploration of language, history and power. According to the MOC, the novel was a sensation when the Mandarin edition was published in 2020. It won Taiwan's highest literary honor, the Golden Tripod Award, the following year. The English translation was made possible with MOC support, and it became the first literary work from Taiwan to win the National Book Award for Translated Literature, the highest award of its kind in the U.S. The Japanese translation also won Japan's 2024 Best Translation Award, another first for Taiwan. In her acceptance speech, Yang said that Taiwan has continuously faced the threat of invasion by another powerful nation for more than a century, contributing to the Taiwanese people's complicated relationship with their national and ethnic identity. Writing about the past is a means of moving toward the future and examining what it means to be Taiwanese, she added. Yang also thanked the MOC for supporting her project from its inception in 2018 to the publication of the English translation in the U.S. this November. Born in the U.S. and raised in Taiwan, King said the novel explores the essence of translated literature, adding that the English version aims to convey the spirit of the original story rather than offering a Westernized adaptation. The MOC said it is planning a series of book tours involving Yang and King to promote the novel in New York, Los Angeles and Houston next year.

President Lai receives Czech parliamentary delegation	President Lai Ching-te said Nov. 12 that Taiwan is committed to furthering bilateral collaboration with Czechia in areas spanning culture, cyber security and semiconductors. Lai made the remarks while greeting a delegation from the Chamber of Deputies' Czech Republic-Taiwan Parliamentary Platform led by its chair Marek Benda at the Presidential Office in Taipei City. Taiwan and Czechia both value freedom and democracy, which motivates them to face the challenges of authoritarian expansion together, Lai said. The two sides enjoy a growing relationship, he added, citing visits by Senate President Milo&scaron; Vystrčil and COD Speaker Mark&eacute;ta Pekarov&aacute; Adamov&aacute; in recent years. The strength of the countries' bilateral ties are also evident in Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim's trip to Czechia earlier this year, and former President Tsai Ing-wen's attendance at the Forum 2000 Conference last month, Lai said, adding that the opening of the Czech Centre Taipei in June, baseball exhibition games between national teams earlier this month and the launch of Taipei-Prague direct flights last year further demonstrate the close bilateral cooperation. The president concluded by encouraging delegation members in their efforts to gain a deeper understanding of Taiwan and explore opportunities for bilateral collaboration during their stay. Benda expressed similar sentiments in his response and added that Taiwan's National Palace Museum and the National Museum in Prague have arranged to work together on a large-scale exhibition next year. He agreed with Lai on the importance of boosting exchanges in the semiconductor industry and expressed his hope to advance mutually beneficial economic collaboration. The chair went on to say that cross-strait peace and stability is critical to ensuring the safety of transportation routes throughout Southeast Asia, adding that he and other delegation members fundamentally reject China's military intimidation and its continued distortion of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758. (YCH-E) Write to Taiwan Today at ttonline@mofa.gov.tw	https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&post=261613	2024-11-13T00:00:00-08:00	
Taiwan students rank high in ICILS survey	Taiwan's eighth graders delivered strong performances in the 2023 International Computer and Information Literacy Study recently released by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, the Ministry of Education said Nov. 12. First conducted in 2013 and held every five years, the ICILS is designed to measure the capacity of eighth grade students to use information and communications technology productively beyond the basic use of digital technology. It tests students in computational thinking and computer and information literacy. According to the MOE, this is the first time that Taiwan has taken part in the survey, which involved more than 130,000 students and 60,000 plus teachers in 34 countries and territories. In the 2023 ICILS cycle, 5,112 local students took the computational thinking test and received an average score of 548 points. Just over 50 percent reached or surpassed level 3, indicating that they possess the ability to solve complex problems independently. The global averages are 483 points and 29 percent, respectively. In terms of computer and information literacy, local students averaged 515 points, trailing only their peers from South Korea, Czechia and Denmark. Sixty-four percent of test takers achieved level 2 scores or higher, surpassing the global average of 49 percent to demonstrate their creativity and skill when addressing information and communications technology problems, as well as their ability to communicate clearly on the subject. Consistent with global trends, girls outperformed boys in the computer and information literacy test, though computational thinking test results showed no measurable difference. The MOE also noted that while students' test scores are generally related to their family background, these differences are less pronounced in Taiwan. The MOE said the results reflect the success of Taiwan's digital education, adding that the government will continue to implement policies to support the digital literacy of the country's youth so that they can successfully pursue lifelong education and meet future challenges.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Canada’s The Globe and Mail	The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu said Taiwan is committed to enhancing ongoing partnership with the U.S. while strengthening cooperation with President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration. Wu made the remarks during an interview with Steven Chase for an article published Nov. 9 in Toronto-based daily newspaper The Globe and Mail. Taiwan is confident Trump will not abandon the Asian democracy to China because it plays a key role in the U.S. supply chain for cutting-edge semiconductor chips, Wu said, adding that he believes the U.S. would act to protect its national interests in the event of a cross-strait conflict.

Wu took the opportunity to thank Canada for backing Taiwan, most recently reflected in the House of Commons' passage of a motion rejecting a public relations campaign by China Nov. 6. The motion stated that U.N. Resolution 2758 neither establishes the People's Republic of China's sovereignty over Taiwan nor addresses Taiwan's participation in U.N. specialized agencies, the MOFA said, adding that the Canadian lower house also expressed support for Taiwan's meaningful engagement in international organizations.
