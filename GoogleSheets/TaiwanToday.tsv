VP Hsiao receives German Marshall Fund delegation	Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim met with a delegation from U.S. headquartered German Marshall Fund's Taiwan-US-Europe Policy Program Feb. 20 in the Presidential Office in Taipei City. Hsiao said that in the face of challenges, Taiwan and its transatlantic partners need to continue dialogue and cooperation so that both can maintain economic prosperity, social resilience and enhance common interests. She added that the two sides share values such as freedom and democracy and thus should work together to face challenges. Hsiao noted that Taiwan has become an economy that contributes to global prosperity and plays a key role in the technology supply chain, however, work must continue to maintain this critical and irreplaceable leading position. She added that Taiwan attaches great importance to balanced growth in all walks of life and that use of artificial intelligence must benefit traditional industries and small and medium sized enterprises. Over the past two years, the U.S. has become Taiwan's largest overseas investment location with over 40 percent of overall foreign investment going to that destination, compared to 2010 when over 80 percent of foreign investment went to China. Hsiao said that adjustment and diversification in economics and trade ensures that Taiwan becomes a continuously prosperous and resilient society. The vice president further noted that one of President Lai's major policies is to institutionalize the concept of whole-of-society defense resilience. This issue has been discussed with many American partners over the years and in future will involve the private sector and other partners as, in the face of increasingly serious compound threats, it is critical to strengthen social resilience.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Ukrainian media	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu called on the global community to stand with Taiwan to ensure global supply chain stability and international security integrity. Wu made the remarks during an interview with Tim Mak, founder of Kyiv-based publication Counteroffensive, for an article published Feb. 15 on military technology in Taiwan. Citing remarks by President Lai Ching-te, the Counteroffensive article said Taiwan aspires to become the Asian hub of drone supply chains for global democracies. Based on observations of the Russia-Ukraine war, Taiwan is developing affordable unmanned aerial vehicles, which are expected to play a key role in global confrontations. The article also said that since the late 20th century, the free world has taken the view that welcoming China and Russia into the flow of international trade would have a democratizing effect. Wu said the war has proven that such thinking is naive. The deputy minister said the appropriate strategic response should be to try to separate the so-called &ldquo;red supply chain&rdquo; and the democratic supply chain, adding that Taiwan's prowess in electronics manufacturing and semiconductor technology make it a key player in this regard. Through global supply chain restructuring, the country wants to ensure that local semiconductor technologies will not fall into the hands of Russia or other authoritarian regimes, Wu said, adding that an additional priority is the enhancement of Taiwan's self-defense. According to Counteroffensive, Taiwan is making progress in developing drones and asymmetrical tactics with its rich scientific knowledge. Wu called on the free world to include Taiwan in the global security network as a means to ensure regional and global peace and stability.

Indian MICE tour arrives in Taiwan	The first of six incentive travel groups from India arrived in Taiwan Feb. 9 for a five-day visit, providing a boost to the local tourism sector and reflecting the success of government efforts to promote the country as a major destination. According to the Tourism Administration under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the groups comprise around 800 Mumbai-based Asian Paints employees and their family members.

During their stay, the group will experience Taiwan's tea culture in Taipei City's Maokong area and visit major tourist attractions such as the historic Dadaocheng neighborhood, Ximending shopping district, Taipei 101 and Taipei Zoo, as well as travel to the northeastern county of Yilan for beach activities. The TA expects the six groups to generate at least NT$30 million (US$914,578) in revenue for the local economy. The TA said that India's enormous population, rising economic power and post-pandemic tourism surge led to around 30 million departures in 2024, reflecting the South Asian country's promise as a valuable source of foreign visitors. This potential prompted the TA to launch the Taiwan Tourism Information Center in Mumbai in February 2024 and initiate a raft of promotional campaigns, such as staging business sessions with local travel agencies and inviting media outlets and social media influencers to visit Taiwan, the agency said, adding that Axplore Travelplus was among the MICE service providers that visited Taiwan last June. In addition to ongoing promotions in major target markets such as Japan, South Korea, North America, Western Europe and Southeast Asia, the TA expects the new TTICs set up in Jakarta, Paris, Vancouver and Manila last year to begin to pay dividends, adding that it plans to upgrade the Mumbai center to a regional office by the end of 2025.

NHRM holds lectures on human rights during TIBE	The National Human Rights Museum staged four lectures Feb. 8-9 at Taipei International Book Exhibition in the capital, underscoring the facility's commitment to deepening education on civil liberties, according to the Ministry of Culture. The talks spanned literature creation, picture book publication, and TV and film production, the MOC said. The NHRM's display of research, publications and cultural products at its pavilion aimed to deepen the public's insight into human rights issues, it added. In one of the Feb. 8 lectures, Paiwan writer Liglav A-wu shared her process of portraying Taiwan's White Terror period through an Indigenous lens while serving as an artist in residence at NHRM. Since extant political files are not categorized by ethnic group, she painstakingly tracked down affected individuals from local tribes. A-wu noted that the interviews demonstrated the profound impact authoritarian rule had on native groups, adding that she hopes her work will help Indigenous people learn more about their history. Additionally, illustrator Cincin Chang expounded on her new book &ldquo;Giraffe President,&rdquo; which probes causes of collective trauma and strives to resolve intergenerational conflict. In the work, Chang explores how authoritarianism arises and becomes accepted by society. In response to an audience question on educating children, she emphasized the importance of media literacy, the MOC said. During a Feb. 9 event hosted by poet Hong Hong, fellow poets Hsiang Yang and Chen Yun-yuan introduced a selection of 180 poems on the White Terror period that are set to be published in the second half of the year. Hsiang said that how writers reflect social pain is of great significance, while Chen remarked that compared to prose and fiction, poetry is a better medium to portray subtle but omnipresent agony and violence of the era, the ministry concluded. The White Terror refers to a period from 1949 to 1992, during which the government declared martial law and suppressed and prosecuted political dissidents.

Taiwan launches carbon pricing system	The Ministry of Environment reiterated that a carbon pricing system will be implemented this year, underscoring government commitment to promoting a sustainable environment. The ministry noted that in May 2026, entities must pay carbon fees based on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions in 2024, adding that according to a survey, around 80 percent of agencies are set to submit applications for Designated Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goal for Entities Subject to Carbon Fees and Self-determined Reduction Plans. The MOENV noted that entities that file applications for self-determined reduction plans before the end of June this year will be eligible for carbon fee discount rates next year. The main goal of the pricing system is to expedite CO2 reduction while facilitating industry transition to low carbon energy, the ministry said and added that 12 seminars on low carbon policy have been held either by the MOENV or jointly by MOENV and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with nearly 4,000 people participating either in person or online. To review the self-determined reduction proposals, the MOENV will invite representatives from central governmental agencies to form a panel, who will finalize evaluations within three months. The panelists will meet monthly, the MOENV added. To lessen the financial burden on entities that implement self-determined reduction plans, the MOEA has added measures in the Statute for Industrial Revolution to reimburse investment for energy efficiency practices. The ministry has also devised supportive mechanisms to offer assistance and counseling regarding low carbon technology.

New stamp collection pays tribute to artistic pioneers	A set of stamps featuring the works of four 20th century painters will be released Feb. 12 to showcase Taiwan's achievements in fine arts, according to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Chunghwa Post Co. Ltd. According to Chunghwa Post, this year's collection features works held at the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts based in central Taiwan's Taichung City. Similar sets of stamps have been published since 2002. Chen Cheng-po's 1935 oil painting &ldquo;Tamsui Landscape (Tamsui)&rdquo; depicts the small historic town in what is now New Taipei City during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945). The artist created a rich sense of spatial depth by layering in buildings on a hillside, roofs of varied heights and winding paths. &ldquo;Yehliu Scenery,&rdquo; an oil painting completed in 1969 by Chen Hui-kun, features a striking contrast between the yellow-brown rock formations and the deep blue water. The contours of the rocks and coastline are smoothly outlined in dark brown, while the sky is rendered with lighter blues and white to evoke the vastness of the seascape. Another stamp shows &ldquo;A Sea of Clouds at Alishan&rdquo; by Liao Chi-chun. The 1953 oil painting's layers of soft pink clouds drift toward a distant horizon, while trees and other greenery in the foreground provide a lush resting place for the eye. &ldquo;Mt. Jade Covered in Snow,&rdquo; a watercolor and ink work on paper completed in 1989 by Ma Pai-sui, consists of 14 individual small paintings that stand alone as complete works. When assembled, they form a single large composition that gives the effect of viewing the magnificent mountain through a window.

Taiwan to raise national computing power	The National Science and Technology Council is building a high-speed computer system to drive research and development of generative artificial intelligence and related business applications in Taiwan, according to the Executive Yuan. After a briefing from the NSTC at the EY Feb. 6 in Taipei City, Premier Cho Jung-tai said computing power plays a key role in promoting industrial digital transformation, personnel cultivation and economic growth. To fulfill President Lai Ching-te's vision of building Taiwan into an AI nation, it is imperative to develop sovereign AI and a complete digital ecosystem, he added. To achieve this policy goal, Cho said the development of high-speed computers, data centers and cloud service platforms, among other digital infrastructure, is to be prioritized. In particular, the premier said government focus will be on creating computing structures more suitable for large language model services and applications development. This will secure Taiwan's global competitiveness and key strategic position while helping create more job opportunities in the process, bolstering prosperity and benefiting domestic small and medium-sized enterprises and startups for more balanced regional development, he added. It is also important to engage the private sector to promote AI and introduce it to all aspects of the business sector, Cho said. This will ensure inclusive and sustainable growth of the digital economy, so that AI innovations can benefit all segments of society, the premier added. According to the NSTC, Taiwan ranked 11th in the world in terms of computing power based on the data released by Top500 project in November 2024. The initiative to create a New Silicon Valley in southern Taiwan unveiled by the Executive Yuan earlier this year will play a key role in bolstering Taiwan's computing capabilities, the NSTC said.

Hakka Bombing of the Dragon underway in Miaoli	The Hakka tradition known as Bombing of the Dragon is being held at the Yuqing Temple in northern Taiwan's Miaoli County, the Hakka Affairs Council said Feb. 6. According to HAC Deputy Minister Fan Tso-ming, there are four well-known events around Taiwan to celebrate the Lantern Festival. He said participating in activities like the Bombing of the Dragon, especially in central Taiwan and as it is the first Hakka celebration after the Lunar New Year, helps sustain Hakka communities' economic development. Fan joined other guests to dot the eyes of 13 dragon models, the HAC said, further expressing the wish for the central and local governments to continue to work together to promote Hakka culture. The Bombing of the Dragon in Miaoli originates from dragon dances, according to the Ministry of the Interior. Traditionally, after worshipping ancestors and before leaving home again for work at the time of the Lantern Festival, Hakka people pray to be immune from disaster and for abundant harvest in the new year, and the activities around the dragon are part of this desire, the HAC said. Activities around the dragon are divided into six stages: first the making of the dragon before the Lunar New Year. Then on the ninth day of the first lunar month, the dragon has its eyes dotted with pupils in a ceremony to symbolize the divine spirit entering the mythical beast to bless the people and start the festival. The final four stages take place on the day of the Lantern Festival, namely welcoming, walking with and throwing fireworks at the dragon, and then the return of the dragon to the heavens. The Bombing of the Dragon was launched in 1998 in Miaoli, and this year will be held from Feb. 6 through Feb. 14, the HAC added.

Taiwan campus redesign projects win global recognition	Several Taiwan campus redesign projects have won global recognition, thanks to the Design Movement on Campus initiative launched by the Ministry of Education and implemented by Taiwan Design Research Institute since 2019. According to the MOE, 91 such projects have been completed so far under the aesthetic education campaign. Among these, the campus renovation at Zhongfeng Elementary School in the central county of Nantou was a 2024 winner of Japan's prestigious Good Design Award in the public facility, civil structure and landscape category. The project gave the school's oldest trees a new lease on life as an outdoor classroom. According to the jury, the design offers a soft physical connection with nature; serves as a space for gathering, reading or staging performances; and inspires children to use the site in innovative ways. Also recognized was Taipei Municipal Fuxing High School, which recently featured in a TV program by Japan media outlet NHK for building campus kennels to house stray dogs and cats as part of the school's life education program, the MOE said. Equally impressive, Hudong Elementary School in the central county of Changhua transformed a dim space into a bright, multifunctional rhythm classroom dubbed the Light Room/Roof. The project has won Taiwan's Golden Pin Design Award and Japan's Good Design Award, as well as featuring in an article in Thailand's leading creative magazine Art4d. The MOE said the success of the campus redesign movement has also caught the attention of British design magazine Wallpaper*, which ran an article featuring several other projects, including a new storage and seating system transformed from an outdated special needs classroom at Sinhua Elementary School in the southern city of Tainan.

Taiwan gears up cancer prevention efforts	To implement further cancer prevention in Taiwan, the government is investing in developing better treatment and offering more support to patients and their families, the Ministry of Health and Welfare said Feb. 4. The MOHW made the remarks in a statement marking World Cancer Day, an initiative led by Geneva-based Union for International Cancer Control to raise awareness of the disease and encourage its prevention, detection and treatment. The campaign theme for 2025-2027 is &ldquo;United by Unique,&rdquo; which focuses on unity and support for a shift of health systems towards people-centered care. According to the ministry, the Health Promotion Administration has been working with Taipei City-based Hope Foundation for Cancer Care to subsidize the establishment of cancer resource centers in Taiwan since 2000. To date, 105 hospitals around the country have set up such facilities, which serve as key network hubs for patients searching for treatment and related information for their specific needs. Citing statistics released Dec. 19, 2024, by the HPA, the MOHW said 130,293 people were diagnosed with cancer in 2022, an increase of 8,531 new cases from the year before. The five-year survival rate was 62.9 percent between 2018 and 2022, up from 51.1 percent between 2016 and 2000, it added. The HPA statistics also show lung, colon and breast cancer as the three leading diseases in that order for both men and women combined, with a standardized incidence rate of 323.3 people per 100,000 population. The ministry said this shows that patients coexist with cancer for a longer period of time and reflects an increased need to offer them more comprehensive care. While the primary goal of treatment has been on treatment, the MOHW said it is equally important to address the psychological and social needs of the patients themselves and their families. Cancer resource centers play a key role in this regard, the MOHW said, adding that it will continue to implement more projects to offer better people-centered care and services.

Taiwan tiger grouper shipment en route to Japan	The first shipment of Taiwan tiger groupers is heading to Japan after gaining approval for export last October, spotlighting government efforts to expand into new markets, the Ministry of Agriculture said Feb. 5. According to the MOA, the batch was procured by Osaka-based West Japan Railway Co. and will be sold in its Rail Kitchen Chikugo, as well as its hotels and supermarkets in Hokkaido and Kyoto prefectures and the Kyushu region. During the news conference announcing the shipment, MOA Minister Chen Junne-jih said the ministry provided rigorous evidence of the product's safety during several bilateral economic and trade conferences. The export approval reflects Japanese recognition of the groupers' quality, breeding management and water quality monitoring, Chen noted, adding that the development marks a milestone in access to the global market for Taiwan fishery products. The ministry will continue to promote domestically raised tiger groupers by ensuring a stable supply and enhancing Japanese consumers' awareness of Taiwan products, Chen said, adding that the MOA's Fisheries Agency will help more local businesses obtain export approval to Japan, while the Fisheries Research Institute will keep monitoring the breeding environment to ensure quality. The minister went on to say that the MOA will conduct market surveys, launch small sampler fish meat packages and hold promotional activities in Japan. Pingtung County Magistrate Chou Chun-mi noted that the southern Taiwan county is the largest grouper breeding area in the country, with an annual output of 7,206 metric tons and an annual output value of NT$1.89 billion (US$57.5 million). This latest shipment follows that of yellow groupers to Japan in 2023, she said.

Equally impressive, the Cabinet-level Council of Indigenous Peoples' Oceanic Memories booth focuses on the intertwined origins, histories and cultural heritage of Indigenous peoples in the Pacific, as well as their shared resilience and creativity. Andrea Bowman, ambassador to the ROC (Taiwan) of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and head of the diplomatic corps in Taiwan, was among the guests of honor at the pavilion's launch. The booth features publications on the cultures, histories and related policymaking of Oceanian and Southeast Asian countries produced under a collaborative project with the MOC since 2018, important cultural relics from allies Palau and the Marshall Islands and five workshops on Austronesian affairs, the CIP said.

SBNPM holds exhibition on Taoist immortal Lu Dongbin	The Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum is holding an exhibition featuring calligraphy and artifacts relating to Lu Dongbin, one of the Taoism's Eight Immortals, showcasing various interpretations of the immortals from sophisticated literary depictions to popular images of longevity and prosperity. According to the SBNPM, the Lu Dongbin legend emerged in the early 11th century with accounts of his miraculous manifestations. His spiritual legacy encompasses both literary work and spiritual practice, including distinctive sword techniques for overcoming worldly desire and emotional attachment. Titled &ldquo;Tracing the Taoist Immortal Lu Dongbin in the NPM collection,&rdquo; the exhibition's most important piece is the transcription of verses relating to the immortal character by Dong Qichang (1555-1636). The scroll is a rendition of Lu's poetry with a commentary, the SBNPM said, adding that Dong's brushwork centers on controlled tip movements and fluid transitions, creating lines that possess both vigor and grace. Through slightly asymmetrical, yet balanced character structures, expansive composition spacing and the dramatic interplay of ink and empty space, the work ultimately creates an ethereal and transcendent visual experience, the museum noted. The SBNPM said that other highlights of the exhibition are objects decorated with images of the eight immortals, including a gourd-shaped vase in blue underglaze, a vase with polychrome decoration and a round carved-polychrome lacquer box.

President Lai opens Taipei International Book Exhibition	President Lai Ching-te kicked off the 2025 Taipei International Book Exhibition Feb. 4 in Taipei City, highlighting the government's commitment to promoting Taiwan's publishing industry, the Ministry of Culture said. During his opening remarks, Lai said knowledge is power and encouraged more people to take part in the event. He invited readers to immerse themselves in the myriad cultures showcased by 504 publishing companies from 29 countries. Following his address, MOC Minister Li Yuan noted that as this year's guest of honor, Italy is presenting art by young cartoonists and illustrators, as well as children's literature and illustrated books, while 11 Italian authors are set to attend TIBE seminars. A collaborative creation inspired by Italian writer Italo Calvino's &ldquo;If on a Winter's Night a Traveler&rdquo; is also on display in the event's digital pavilion, he added. The minister went on to add that the MOC will launch a raft of measures to support the domestic publishing sector, citing an international book fair for children and young adults, promotions of Taiwan's graphic novels and the Books From Taiwan project, the latter of which invites global buyers to the country. According to Li, Taiwan has a diverse, free and creative culture, and the exhibition provides an opportunity to engage in cultural exchange with Italy and other countries from around the world. Echoing Li's remarks, Paola Seghi, international relations manager of the Italian Publishers Association, said that participating in the event is an extraordinary chance since Asia is the second-biggest region the association sells publishing rights to following the European market. The president also took the opportunity to present awards to winners of the Taipei International Book Exhibition Book Prize and the Golden Butterfly Awards for book design during the opening ceremony. Launched in 1987 by the Taipei Book Fair Foundation under the auspices of the MOC, TIBE is the leading event of its kind in Asia and one of the world's largest such events alongside the Frankfurt Book Fair, Bologna Children's Book Fair and BookExpo America.

Lai pledges to enhance Taiwan’s investment environment	President Lai Ching-te said Feb. 3 that the government is committed to promoting the Three Major Programs for Investing in Taiwan while sparing no effort to enhance the country's investment environment. The president made the remarks while attending a Lunar New Year event in Taipei City for Taiwan businesses operating in China. Lai first praised Taiwan's impressive economic growth rate of 4.2 percent last year, which surpassed those of the U.S. and EU countries. He said that the government's three investment programs&mdash;the action plan for welcoming overseas Taiwan businesses to return to invest, the action plan for accelerated investment by domestic corporations and the action plan for accelerated investment by small- and medium-sized enterprises&mdash;will be extended to 2027. The government is also promoting investment deduction measures to help more SMEs and startups, Lai said, adding that it is equally important to examine elements such as utilities, land, workforce and talent cultivation. The president also noted that the government is working hard to maintain the stability of the country's interest rates, exchange rate and inflation rate. As a president, Lai said he has three main missions, the first of which is to safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty, and vowed to uphold the Four Commitments proposed by former President Tsai Ing-wen. Second, the president bears the responsibility of protecting the lives and property of Taiwan's 23 million people, Lai said, stressing the importance of global peace. To this end, he cited the Four Pillars of Peace action plan, which involves strengthening national defense, building economic security, deepening partnerships with democratic countries, and maintaining stable and principled cross-strait leadership. The third mission is to improve the standard of living across the board, Lai said. He outlined a raft of measures spanning minimum wage increases, tax reductions, the national childcare policy for aged 0-6 and the Youth Overseas Dream Fund program, adding that the government will continue to care for the well-being of all segments of society while working with the private sector to bolster Taiwan's economic growth.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Italy’s Corriere Della Sera	Deputy Foreign Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu gave an interview to Massimo Franco of Italy's leading daily news media, Corriere Della Sera, in early January to stress the importance of a free and democratic Taiwan to global security. In an article published Jan. 26 by the media outlet, Wu compared Taiwan to 1938's Czechoslovakia, when it was the fifth largest industrial power in Europe and the tenth in the world. By taking over its industries through the Munich Agreement, Nazi Germany was able to pay for the start of the Second World War. This, Wu said, is what China wants to do with Taiwan: take over its semiconductor industry, which accounts for 90 percent of global production, and change the world. While Taiwan only has 12 diplomatic allies in the world, it maintains close political, economic and trade relationship with more than 100 countries, he said. Pointing out the production and technological leadership of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Wu said if Taiwan is invaded, factories around the world will shut down in weeks. Taiwan is fully aware of the threats and dangers from China and is preparing for the worst according to three guidelines: develop defensive capabilities; garner support from the free world; and make security in the Taiwan Strait an international rather than a regional issue. With regard to Taiwan-Vatican relations, Wu praised the Holy See as a unique religious entity with high moral standards, defending moral and religious freedom as an important mission. Based on diplomatic relations that have lasted more than 80 years, Taiwan will continue to maintain its close ties with the Holy See, Wu said.

Lai responds to pope’s World Day of Peace call	President Lai Ching-te sent a letter Jan. 31 to Pope Francis in response to his message marking the 58th World Day of Peace. In the letter, the president expressed support for the papal plea that the global community initiate a cultural shift that would bring an end to governing interpersonal and international relations through exploitation and oppression and herald true and lasting peace. According to Lai, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and convergence of authoritarian regimes threaten the rules-based international order and severely impact peace and stability both in the Indo-Pacific and around the world. Echoing the pope's belief that war means defeat for all, Lai said the international community has reached consensus on upholding cross-strait peace and stability, adding that Taiwan is committed to safeguarding its freedom, equality, democracy and respect for human rights. Taiwan is proactively implementing values-based diplomacy and the Diplomatic Allies Prosperity Project to accelerate the development of allied nations, Lai said, adding that the country helps alleviate poverty by strengthening basic infrastructure, transferring technology and cultivating talent. In response to the pope's call for a new global financial framework jointly addressing climate change, food crises and other challenges, Lai expressed hope that international organizations will stop excluding Taiwan for political reasons. Taiwan is willing and able to shoulder its international responsibility to contribute and share its valuable experience through global platforms, he added. The president concluded by saying that Taiwan will continue to collaborate with the Holy See to advance world peace through concrete action while jointly upholding the core values of justice, democracy, freedom and peace.

Taiwan artist to be featured in Illustrators Exhibition at Bologna Children’s Book Fair	&ldquo;Perhaps Trees Remember&rdquo; by Taiwan artist Ballboss has been selected to feature in the Illustrators Exhibition at the 2025 Bologna Children's Book Fair set to kick off March 31 in the Italian city, according to the Ministry of Culture. Published in December 2024 by Tainan City-based National Museum of Taiwan Literature in both Mandarin and Taiwanese, the book documents a community cultural asset preservation campaign that collected local stories and historical materials to set up the Taiwan Literature Base, which is housed in a compound in Taipei City dating from the Japanese colonial era (1895-1945). According to NMTL Director Chen Ying-fang, the illustrated book addresses issues spanning history, the environment, cultural assets and civic awareness, invoking universal values that resonate with readers. Its selection for the exhibition will serve as an excellent opportunity for global audiences to better understand Taiwan's vibrant literary landscape, she added. With a BA in theater arts from National Sun Yat-sen University and a masters in illustration from the U.K.'s Kingston University, Ballboss was also selected for the exhibition in 2019 and 2022. The artist said his latest work has special meaning to him due to the extensive field research and interviews he undertook to create it, adding that the Taiwanese version also presented a new challenge. Established in 1967 and considered one of the longest-running and most successful Bologna book fair initiatives, the exhibition attracted 21,870 submissions from 4,374 artists representing 89 countries and territories this year. The final selection came down to 76 artworks by 77 authors from 29 countries, and the winning works will be on display from March 31 to April 3, followed by a two-year global tour, the MOC said.

President Lai convenes 3rd National Climate Change Committee meeting	President Lai Ching-te convened the third meeting of the National Climate Change Committee at the Presidential Office Jan. 23 in Taipei City, reaffirming the administration's commitment to taking decisive climate change actions. Citing World Meteorological Organization statistics, Lai said 2024 was the warmest year in history and was marked with extreme weather conditions such as persistent high temperatures, severe droughts, strong winds and disastrous rainfalls. The ongoing wildfire in the U.S. city of Los Angeles also reflects the urgency of climate change adaptation, he added. As countries around the world get ready to update their 2035 nationally determined contributions starting in February, Taiwan is resolute in its determination to achieve its own carbon emission reduction goals, the president said. To this end, Cabinet agencies have worked diligently and consulted with experts to review progress of ongoing carbon reduction measures, Lai said, adding that the country's new targets have been set at 30-34 percent of 2005 levels for 2032 and 36-40 percent for 2035. The president went on to stress how important it is for the business sector and all other segments of society to work together to achieve these ambitious goals. He directed the Ministries of Education and Environment to roll out more climate change education initiatives in line with Taiwan&#39;s Climate Change Response Act. More public awareness projects are also required to promote a low-carbon lifestyle and reach social consensus on behavioral changes necessary to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 for the benefit of all, Lai added.

Vice Premier Cheng commits to sustainable tourism	Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun stressed Jan. 22 that tourism is an element of Taiwan's soft power and urged ministries and agencies to work together to bolster the country's sustainable tourism. The vice premier made the remarks at a tourism revitalization discussion held by the Executive Yuan in Taipei City. During the meeting, the Tourism Administration proposed two flagship plans. The first aims to attract more international tourists to Taiwan on the strength of the country's abundant culture and history, geology and landscape, as well as its significant ecological conservation, the TA said, adding that the administration will cooperate with the Ministries of Agriculture, Culture and the Interior to implement the plan. Equally important is a plan focusing on sustainable tourism, the TA said. The administration will adopt measures including improving infrastructure in 50 national scenic areas and focusing on tourist spots in southern cities of Kaohsiung and Tainan, the northern city of Taoyuan and its neighboring Miaoli County, the northeastern county of Yilan and the eastern county of Hualien, it added. According to Cheng, tourism plays a key role in the National Project of Hope proposed by President Lai Ching-te, and personnel cultivation is of great importance. She instructed the TA to help establish an academy for tourism within one year to conduct market research and surveys while nurturing professional personnel. Due to ongoing personnel demand from the tourism sector, Cheng cited measures like relaxing policies to allow more foreign and overseas Taiwan students to stay and work in the country after graduation. She also asked the TA to cooperate with the Ministry of Labor to encourage diverse groups such as elders and women seeking re-employment to take jobs in the tourism industry while expressing a desire to shape Taiwan into a country friendly to young travelers.
