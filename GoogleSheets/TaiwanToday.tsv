Taiwan novel wins US National Book Award	&ldquo;Taiwan Travelogue,&rdquo; a Mandarin-language novel written by Yang Shuang-zi and translated into English by Lin King, has won the National Book Award for Translated Literature presented by the U.S.-based National Book Foundation, the Ministry of Culture said Nov. 21. Set in 1938 during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945), the novel is a bittersweet love story between a Japanese novelist and her Taiwanese interpreter. It was recognized for its artful exploration of language, history and power. According to the MOC, the novel was a sensation when the Mandarin edition was published in 2020. It won Taiwan's highest literary honor, the Golden Tripod Award, the following year. The English translation was made possible with MOC support, and it became the first literary work from Taiwan to win the National Book Award for Translated Literature, the highest award of its kind in the U.S. The Japanese translation also won Japan's 2024 Best Translation Award, another first for Taiwan. In her acceptance speech, Yang said that Taiwan has continuously faced the threat of invasion by another powerful nation for more than a century, contributing to the Taiwanese people's complicated relationship with their national and ethnic identity. Writing about the past is a means of moving toward the future and examining what it means to be Taiwanese, she added. Yang also thanked the MOC for supporting her project from its inception in 2018 to the publication of the English translation in the U.S. this November. Born in the U.S. and raised in Taiwan, King said the novel explores the essence of translated literature, adding that the English version aims to convey the spirit of the original story rather than offering a Westernized adaptation. The MOC said it is planning a series of book tours involving Yang and King to promote the novel in New York, Los Angeles and Houston next year.

President Lai receives Czech parliamentary delegation	President Lai Ching-te said Nov. 12 that Taiwan is committed to furthering bilateral collaboration with Czechia in areas spanning culture, cyber security and semiconductors. Lai made the remarks while greeting a delegation from the Chamber of Deputies' Czech Republic-Taiwan Parliamentary Platform led by its chair Marek Benda at the Presidential Office in Taipei City. Taiwan and Czechia both value freedom and democracy, which motivates them to face the challenges of authoritarian expansion together, Lai said. The two sides enjoy a growing relationship, he added, citing visits by Senate President Milo&scaron; Vystrčil and COD Speaker Mark&eacute;ta Pekarov&aacute; Adamov&aacute; in recent years. The strength of the countries' bilateral ties are also evident in Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim's trip to Czechia earlier this year, and former President Tsai Ing-wen's attendance at the Forum 2000 Conference last month, Lai said, adding that the opening of the Czech Centre Taipei in June, baseball exhibition games between national teams earlier this month and the launch of Taipei-Prague direct flights last year further demonstrate the close bilateral cooperation. The president concluded by encouraging delegation members in their efforts to gain a deeper understanding of Taiwan and explore opportunities for bilateral collaboration during their stay. Benda expressed similar sentiments in his response and added that Taiwan's National Palace Museum and the National Museum in Prague have arranged to work together on a large-scale exhibition next year. He agreed with Lai on the importance of boosting exchanges in the semiconductor industry and expressed his hope to advance mutually beneficial economic collaboration. The chair went on to say that cross-strait peace and stability is critical to ensuring the safety of transportation routes throughout Southeast Asia, adding that he and other delegation members fundamentally reject China's military intimidation and its continued distortion of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758. (YCH-E) Write to Taiwan Today at ttonline@mofa.gov.tw	https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&post=261613	2024-11-13T00:00:00-08:00	
Taiwan students rank high in ICILS survey	Taiwan's eighth graders delivered strong performances in the 2023 International Computer and Information Literacy Study recently released by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, the Ministry of Education said Nov. 12. First conducted in 2013 and held every five years, the ICILS is designed to measure the capacity of eighth grade students to use information and communications technology productively beyond the basic use of digital technology. It tests students in computational thinking and computer and information literacy. According to the MOE, this is the first time that Taiwan has taken part in the survey, which involved more than 130,000 students and 60,000 plus teachers in 34 countries and territories. In the 2023 ICILS cycle, 5,112 local students took the computational thinking test and received an average score of 548 points. Just over 50 percent reached or surpassed level 3, indicating that they possess the ability to solve complex problems independently. The global averages are 483 points and 29 percent, respectively. In terms of computer and information literacy, local students averaged 515 points, trailing only their peers from South Korea, Czechia and Denmark. Sixty-four percent of test takers achieved level 2 scores or higher, surpassing the global average of 49 percent to demonstrate their creativity and skill when addressing information and communications technology problems, as well as their ability to communicate clearly on the subject. Consistent with global trends, girls outperformed boys in the computer and information literacy test, though computational thinking test results showed no measurable difference. The MOE also noted that while students' test scores are generally related to their family background, these differences are less pronounced in Taiwan. The MOE said the results reflect the success of Taiwan's digital education, adding that the government will continue to implement policies to support the digital literacy of the country's youth so that they can successfully pursue lifelong education and meet future challenges.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Canada’s The Globe and Mail	The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu said Taiwan is committed to enhancing ongoing partnership with the U.S. while strengthening cooperation with President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration. Wu made the remarks during an interview with Steven Chase for an article published Nov. 9 in Toronto-based daily newspaper The Globe and Mail. Taiwan is confident Trump will not abandon the Asian democracy to China because it plays a key role in the U.S. supply chain for cutting-edge semiconductor chips, Wu said, adding that he believes the U.S. would act to protect its national interests in the event of a cross-strait conflict. According to Wu, Taiwan produces more than 60 percent of the world's integrated circuits and over 90 percent of the most advanced chips, which are required in core technologies from smartphones to medical devices. The country also provides 100 percent of the global supply of chips used in artificial intelligence, he said, adding that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is a world leader in semiconductor production. The deputy minister described Taiwan's strategy as a &ldquo;not today&rdquo; policy regarding possible attacks from China. He added that Taiwan will continue to strengthen its self-defense while working with like-minded partners including Japan and the U.S. to safeguard regional peace and stability. Wu took the opportunity to thank Canada for backing Taiwan, most recently reflected in the House of Commons' passage of a motion rejecting a public relations campaign by China Nov. 6. The motion stated that U.N. Resolution 2758 neither establishes the People's Republic of China's sovereignty over Taiwan nor addresses Taiwan's participation in U.N. specialized agencies, the MOFA said, adding that the Canadian lower house also expressed support for Taiwan's meaningful engagement in international organizations.
