Taiwan video wins gold at Japanese tourism awards	A promotional short produced by Taiwan's Tourism Administration for the upcoming World Bird Fair took gold for documentaries at this year's Japan World's Tourism Film Festival, the agency said March 20. According to the TA, &ldquo;Birding in Taiwan&rdquo; was shot from the perspectives of birds and birders to highlight the ancient forests and towering peaks of Dasyueshan National Forest Recreation Area, one of the country's most iconic birdwatching destinations due to its incredibly rich avian ecology. Given its diverse terrain, Taiwan is not only home to hundreds of bird species, including 32 that are endemic, but also serves as a resting point for numerous migratory and transient birds from late March to early April, the film said. The documentary showcases several iconic species, including the mikado pheasant, Taiwan barbet, Taiwan rosefinch and Taiwan vivid niltava. The TA said the film also shows the amount of effort going into the promotion of Taiwan as a haven for birdwatchers around the world. As the country is set to host the first ever World Bird Fair this coming September, the agency expects the prize-winning production to draw more visitors from abroad. Several other local productions were also recognized during the event. &ldquo;Chill Chiayi City&rdquo; produced by Chiayi City Government won a gold medal in the Asian Competition category, a silver in the Tourism Destinations Cities category, as well as the Asian Grand Prix; and &ldquo;Kenting&rdquo; by Kenting National Park Administration, &ldquo;Mountains Forests and Islands&rdquo; by Chiayi County Government, and &ldquo;Liugui Unveiled&rdquo; by Maolin National Scenic Area Administration all won gold in the Asian Competition category.

Lai vows to enhance Taiwan-US economic partnership at AmCham Taiwan’s Hsieh Nien Fan	President Lai Ching-te said March 20 that Taiwan is committed to enhancing its mutually beneficial economic and trade partnership with the U.S. while jointly building non-red supply chains to advance peace, prosperity and stability. Lai made the remarks during the annual Hsieh Nien Fan banquet hosted in Taipei City by the American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan to thank Taiwan government officials for supporting the international business community. The president first cited the 2025 Business Climate Survey published by AmCham in January as evidence of Taiwan's ideal investment environment. The survey showed that 90 percent of business respondents are planning to maintain or expand their investment in the country. The U.S. is a major source of investment, accounting for 11.5 percent of Taiwan's total foreign investment last year, Lai said, adding that high-tech heavyweights such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and Nvidia Corp. have also been expanding their presence in the country. The president went on to say that Taiwan's direct and indirect investment in the U.S. accounted for over 40 percent of its total outbound investment last year, making the U.S. the largest investment destination. He added that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s recent announcement of increased investment in the U.S. will be followed by many other industries. Taiwan is an indispensable partner to the U.S. as the latter moves to become a global artificial intelligence hub, Lai said. The country will continue to promote the five trusted industry sectors to drive economic development while coordinating relevant government agencies and aligning with international standards to foster a friendlier investment environment, he added. The government will further deepen Taiwan-U.S. trade relations, Lai said, adding that it is going to expand imports of agricultural and industrial products and natural gas from the U.S. The president further urged AmCham to support negotiations to resolve double taxation issues and remove tax barriers to bilateral investment and trade. Lai concluded by saying that maintaining regional and global security and stability is essential to economic prosperity. He took the opportunity to thank U.S. President Donald Trump and Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba for releasing a joint leaders' statement backing cross-strait peace and stability, adding that Taiwan will continue to uphold the values of freedom and democracy by enhancing its self-defense capabilities and cooperating with the U.S. in the defense sector.

Taiwan set to be granted CSF-free status by WOAH	Taiwan's submission to be recognized as Classical Swine Fever-free has been accepted by the World Organisation for Animal Health, the Ministry of Agriculture said March 19. This positive development represents global recognition of government measures to eradicate major animal-borne diseases and bodes well for efforts to promote the country's pork exports, the ministry added. According to the MOA, CSF is a highly contagious and deadly disease that poses a tremendous threat to the pig farming industry. A raft of control measures, including vaccination, monitoring, reporting and biosecurity enhancement, have been implemented since Taiwan eradicated its last case in 2005, the ministry said, adding that CSF vaccines have not been administered since July 2023. At the same time, the government has stepped up border control measures, such as stricter inspections of airport luggage and international post, stronger crackdowns on smuggling and expanded public awareness campaigns. Through these efforts, Taiwan's application to be recognized as CSF-free was accepted by the WOAH Scientific Commission Feb. 20. The case is expected to be formally approved during the WOAH's General Session of the World Assembly of Delegates this May, which will make Taiwan the only country in Asia to be declared free of African Swine Fever, foot-and-mouth disease and CSF. The MOA expects the recognition to open new opportunities to export local pork and help exporters negotiate more favorable trade terms, resulting in a great boost for Taiwan's pork industry. The government will continue to enforce strict border controls and work closely with farmers to preserve its CSF-free status, the ministry added.

Vice Premier Cheng vows to advance Taiwan’s UAV industry	Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said March 15 that the government is committed to supporting Taiwan's unmanned aerial vehicle development with the goal of transforming the country into a regional UAV manufacturing hub while cementing its place in democratic supply chains. The vice premier made the remarks during a visit to the Asia UAV AI Innovation Application R&amp;D Center in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan. She exchanged ideas with representatives from over 20 drone enterprises during her trip.

One measure aims to increase domestic and foreign demand, she noted, adding that Taiwan has already signed cooperative agreements with countries such as Czechia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and the U.S. to boost international orders. Another measure provides tax incentives to encourage technological innovations for key components and promotes investment by the National Development Fund to drive mass production, Cheng said. Equally important is to establish an industry ecosystem and manufacturing clusters, she added, citing a plan by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Chiayi County Government to build another hall at the R&amp;D center and the ongoing construction of an aerospace park in the county's Minxiong Township. These are complemented by efforts to enhance cybersecurity and whole-of-society resilience, the vice premier explained. The government will continue offering subsidies to help local enterprises align with international cybersecurity standards and regulating exclusive airspace for sandbox testing, she said, adding that drone development is anticipated to strengthen democratic resilience, disaster prevention, the economy and national defense.

Deputy foreign minister gives interview to The Japan Times	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chih-chung Wu said the government is committed to ensuring Indo-Pacific peace and stability while expanding exchanges with Japan. Wu made the remarks during an interview earlier this month in Taipei City with Gabriel Dominguez for two online articles published March 11 and 12 in the English edition of The Japan Times. According to Wu, Taiwan and Japan share the same beliefs and values, as well as close cultural, people-to-people and trade exchanges. The outpouring of assistance from Taiwan's people in the wake of Japan's Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011 further underscores the strong bond between the two sides, he said. The deputy minister stressed that a peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific is in Japan's interest, adding that Taiwan welcomed the Taiwan Strait transit of a Japan Self-Defense Forces vessel in February. The move highlighted Japan's role as a key regional stakeholder, he said. It is critical that Japan continue strengthening its defense capabilities in response to regional developments and supporting exchanges with Taiwan, Wu said, expressing the hope of more higher-level interactions and bilateral cooperation going forward. Wu went on to say that the Trump administration's efforts to defend its interests in the Asia-Pacific are in line with Taiwan's resolution to safeguard its national interests. The two are important partners, as evidenced by the major investment by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in the U.S. and Taiwan's position as the country's seventh-largest trade partner, he said, adding that the government will continue to deepen trade and security relations with Washington. The deputy minister also emphasized that Taiwan's and Ukraine's situations differ in that the government has been doing its utmost to enhance its self-defense capabilities for years. He said cross-strait developments have a huge impact on the global economy given the local semiconductor sector's significance in global supply chains. As a responsible stakeholder in the international community, Taiwan will continue to avoid provocative actions to prevent giving China any excuse to escalate tensions in the strait, he said, adding that the government looks forward to deepening exchanges with Japan and other like-minded partners to contribute to regional peace and stability.

Taiwan steps up carbon capture to meet net-zero emission goals	The Ministry of Environment has approved four projects to increase carbon sequestration as part of the agency's efforts to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions. According to the MOENV, the plans involve afforestation, enhancing the carbon capture capacity of depleted and bamboo forests and upgrading the management of mature forests. Carbon sequestration refers to the natural or artificial process of absorbing and storing greenhouse gases from the environment. To reach the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, the government is establishing carbon sinks as one of its 12 major strategies, the ministry said. Under the projects, nonforest or deforested land larger than 0.5 hectares with less than 40 percent soil disturbance for flat areas and less than 33 percent for sloped areas is targeted for tree planting, the MOENV said, adding that the planting cannot disrupt existing agricultural operations. Additionally, forests that have maintained tree cover over the last 20 years with lower than average carbon storage capacity and no commercial logging activities will be thinned in the initial stages to reduce resource competition and encourage healthy growth. For land that already meets the definition of a mature forest, the initiative aims to optimize stand density with selective harvesting of timber products. Similarly, bamboo forests with growth more than five years old will be harvested to renew carbon sink capacity. Entities willing to join in any of the projects must submit plans for review in accordance with the MOENV's regulations, the ministry concluded.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to French media	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chih-chung Wu said peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait are key to maintaining regional security and prosperity. Wu made the remarks during an interview last month in Taipei City with Bernard de la Billardi&egrave;re, host of the news show Enqu&ecirc;te Exclusive, for a documentary aired March 9 on the French TV channel M6. According to Wu, Taiwan produces 60 percent of chips and nearly 95 percent of high-end semiconductors for the world, making it an indispensable player in the global semiconductor supply chain. The country is committed to maintaining the cross-strait status quo, reducing risk of confrontation and promoting regional and global peace and prosperity, the deputy minister added. Wu stressed that the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; means that Taiwan has never been part of China, adding that any unilateral attempts by Beijing to change the status quo through military action will be considered invasion. While Taiwan has official relations with only 12 countries, it has 111 overseas offices around the world and sees itself as &ldquo;sui generis,&rdquo; meaning unique, the minister said. The country is a robust democracy with a well-run government, thriving society and economy, he said, adding that Taiwan's people enjoy high living standards and free media, while the government engages extensively with the world through a pragmatic approach. In terms of Taiwan-U.S. relations, Wu said the Indo-Pacific is part of U.S. interests. The ongoing drills undertaken by France and the Philippines in the South China Sea and continuous military maneuvers in the region by major countries all highlight the strategic importance of Taiwan. The government hopes to strengthen its bonds with members of the free world through cooperation in the semiconductor sector so as to ensure regional peace and stability and promote global security and prosperity, Wu said.

MAC deputy minister condemns China’s misinterpretation of UNGA Resolution 2758	Mainland Affairs Council Deputy Minister Shen Yu-chung rebuked China's spurious claims regarding U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758, stressing that the resolution makes no mention of Taiwan throughout its entire text. The resolution neither states that Taiwan is a part of the People's Republic of China nor does it authorize China to represent Taiwan in the U.N., Shen said, adding that the PRC didn't even exist when the Cairo Declaration was issued in 1943, which specified that Taiwan and the outlying Penghu Islands were among the Japanese-held territories to be restored to the ROC. The deputy minister made the remarks earlier this month while attending a seminar analyzing China's 2025 Two Sessions and the launch ceremony of a China and regional development research center at Tunghai University in central Taiwan's Taichung City. According to Shen, China's government reports show that both its budget deficit and deflationary pressure are increasing. However, Beijing continues to hike military spending, which has drawn attention from neighboring countries and democracies around the world, he said. Other academics participating in the event suggested that the government continue monitoring the Two Sessions to gain deeper insight into China's decision-making process, stability maintenance policies and changes in its international Taiwan strategy. They added that the government should pay close attention to the Fujian demonstration zone, which aims to advance cross-strait development through transportation infrastructure and economic and trade exchanges. Recommendations also included that the government should keep an eye on the impact of Chinese businesses on Taiwan enterprises and Beijing's attempts to drum up support for unification among Taiwan's youth while cultivating more China studies experts, according to the MAC.

Guishan Island reopens to the public	Travelers are again allowed to visit Guishan Island off the coast of northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County, the Tourism Administration announced during a beach cleanup and tree-planting activity Feb. 28 on the island. According to the TA, Guishan Island is usually closed to the public from every Dec. 1 to Feb. 28 to allow the island's ecology to recuperate. However, extensive damage resulting from October 2024's Typhoon Kong-rey led the Northeast and Yilan Coast National Scenic Area Administration to announce an early closure Nov. 5 to effect repairs. The agency spent four months restoring facilities on the island to return it to pristine condition. TA Director-General Chou Yung-hui thanked the Coast Guard Administration and local fisheries and tourism promotion associations for their support in the process. Beginning March 1, up to 1,800 people per day will be allowed to register to visit the island Thursday through Tuesday, and only 100 will be granted permits to hike the interior. Wednesdays are reserved for researchers. The only active volcano in the country, Guishan Island is 10 kilometers off the coast of Toucheng Township. Popular activities include hiking the island's coast and peak, exploring an abandoned military tunnel, spotting dragonflies, and joining whale- and dolphin-watching tours.

Bonnie Glaser of GMF visits National Museum of Taiwan History	Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific Program at Washington, D.C.-based German Marshall Fund of the United States, visited the National Museum of Taiwan History Feb. 22 in the southern city of Tainan. The U.S. expert was in the country as head of a 14-member delegation from the think tank's Taiwan-U.S.-Europe Policy Program (TUPP). The international cohort of young scholars comprised specialists in the fields of artificial intelligence, commerce, information and communications technology, international politics and public health. According to the NMTH, this was Glaser's fifth visit to the museum since 2018 as head of a TUPP delegation. This year's attendees showed particular interest in the interactions between Indigenous and Han peoples, as well as Wangye beliefs. They were especially curious about the traditional costumes of the vanguard that leads parades in honor of these deities. During a sit-down at the venue, the visitors explored topics including responses to transitions of power in Taiwan, local museums' use of historical studies to organize exhibitions for domestic and international audiences, and methods of communicating effectively with patrons of all ages. Glaser said she continued to visit the NMTH because its permanent exhibits present historical perspectives that are relatable to patrons from home and abroad, adding that the museum's English tour guide services also help visitors from the western world better understand Taiwan. NMTH Director Chang Lung-chih said the museum reopened its permanent exhibition hall in 2021 to showcase Taiwan's connection with the world. In addition to highlighting the country's multiethnic history and experiences with colonialism, exhibitions at the site also focus on contemporary studies on topics such as Indigenous groups, maritime history, post-war social development, social movements and new migrants. Chang said the NMTH aspires to showcase Taiwan's soft power by becoming a museum for the world, adding that it also hopes to serve as a platform preserving the people's collective memory and promoting civic dialogue.

Lai attends ceremony marking 78th anniversary of 228 Incident	President Lai Ching-te pledged to expedite the opening of political archives to further the implementation of transitional justice on Feb. 28 in Taipei City. Lai made the remarks during a ceremony marking the 78th anniversary of the Feb. 28 Incident, during which he also offered condolences to victims and their surviving family members on behalf of the government. The incident occurred in 1947 amid protests of unjust treatment and calls for government reform. Military crackdowns in response to these protests claimed the lives of many civilians and ushered in decades of martial law. The incident had long been a taboo topic, the president noted, adding that it was not until after democratization that the government began to make apologies, offer compensation to victims and their families, and designate Feb. 28 as an annual day of remembrance. Lai continued by acknowledging that while considerable progress has been made toward justice, the search for historical truth takes intensive work. Last year he requested that the National Security Bureau prepare approximately one million documents from its records during the martial law period for submission to the National Development Council's National Archives Administration by June. The president added that the Ministry of Culture had also begun reviews of historical sites related to human rights violations to preserve them for posterity. He concluded with hopes that the annual memorial service not only honor victims and offer comfort to the families of the dead, but also reinforce the lessons of history so that they might not be repeated.

MOENV announces new regulations on HFCs	The Ministry of Environment announced two sets of regulations Feb. 25 governing hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), as the government continues to bring Taiwan's regulations into line with global standards. According to the MOENV, the move is in response to an amendment by the parties to the Montreal Protocol. Adopted in September of 1987, the landmark U.N. environmental treaty regulates the production and consumption of nearly 100 man-made chemicals referred to as ozone depleting substances. During their 28th meeting in October of 2016 in Kigali, Rwanda, the parties signed the Kigali Amendment to add HFCs to the list of controlled substances and approve a timeline for their gradual reduction by 80-85 percent by the late 2040s. The amendment has been ratified by more than 160 countries and territories so far, the MOENV added. HFCs are mainly used in electronic cleansing, fire extinguishing equipment, industrial processing and refrigeration. While they are considered substitutes for hydrochlorofluorocarbons, an ozone depleting substance, they also contain high global warming potential values. The ministry said under the new rules, production of 18 types of HFCs is banned immediately and starting July 1 this year, approval has to be obtained for the import and export of such products and mixtures containing the chemicals. The annual HFC consumption will be capped at the baseline level of 24,523.87 thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalents starting 2026, with the total amount gradually reduced to lower than 20 percent of the baseline level after 2045. The MOENV said the new rules, which are based on the country's Climate Change Response Act, underscore Taiwan commitment to working with global partners to mitigate climate change, adding that it will organize public hearing sessions soon to bring local firms up to speed on the matter.

Taiwan reports 2nd highest foreign trade in 2024	Taiwan recorded its second-best foreign trade numbers in 2024, thanks in part to continuous expansion of the global economy, the Ministry of Finance said Feb. 25. The MOF attributed the strong showing to factors like inflation mitigation and the recovery of economic resilience around the world, adding that global supply chain restructuring and expanding artificial intelligence applications greatly benefited local semiconductor and information communication technology sectors. According to the ministry, Taiwan's exports grew 9.9 percent to US$475 billion during the year, with figures reaching a new monthly high in August, along with a second peak in December. Imports surged 12.2 percent to US$394 billion as semiconductor firms ramped up investments in equipment to prepare for a booming global AI supply chain. A breakdown of the figures shows that electronic components and parts topped the export list, accounting for 37.3 percent of the total, followed by ICT and audiovisual products at 27.9 percent and basic metals at 6 percent. Taiwan's exports to the U.S. reached a record high of US$111.4 billion, up 46.1 percent over 2023. Exports to major trade partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations increased 15.1 percent to US$87.8 billion, also a record high. While China and Hong Kong remained the leading destination for local exports, the combined share dropped to 31.7 percent, the lowest in 23 years. The U.S. surpassed ASEAN members to take the second spot, with its share of 23.4 percent the highest in 24 years. Despite geopolitical risk and uncertainties stemming from the tariff policies of the U.S. new administration, the MOF expected recovering global trade and expanding investment in AI applications by global cloud service providers to continue to benefit Taiwan's exporters.

President Lai receives 228 Incident overseas victims’ families	President Lai Ching-te expressed hope Feb. 24 that Taiwan's 23 million people will unite to safeguard the country while maintaining the constitutional system of democracy, freedom, and human rights to continue Taiwan's development and prosperity. Lai made the remarks when meeting with the 228 Incident overseas victims' families homecoming group at the Presidential Office in Taipei City. The 228 Incident occurred in 1947 after the Japanese colonial government's withdrawal in late 1945 and followed calls for government reform. When these demands went unmet, protests broke out around the country, prompting a military crackdown that resulted in many civilian deaths. The president first thanked the group for its longstanding work for speaking out in support of Taiwan, noting that this year is the 78th anniversary of the 228 Incident. The death of Taiwan social elites in the event including the first Taiwan prosecutor Wang Yu-lin and artist Chen Cheng-po caused incalculable losses to Taiwan society, he said, offering apologies again on behalf of the government. The government will spare no effort to do make amends for the 228 Incident, Lai said, citing remedial measures including admitting mistakes, offering apologies, making compensation, investigating the truth, restoring reputations, revoking judgments and setting up memorials and monuments. He added that government authorities are committed to pursuing transitional justice to seek the truth, bring justice and guarantee that such an incident will never happen again. Although this is an unfinished task, Lai said the government will declassify political archives and stressed that people must not forget history and understand the differences between democracy and authoritarianism to protect freedom. The government seeks to unite the country, protect public safety and never allow an event like the 228 Incident to happen again, Lai concluded. To this end, Taiwan's sovereignty must be safeguarded, he said, adding that the ROC (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other, Taiwan's sovereignty is inviolable and cannot be annexed, and that the country's future is to be determined by its 23 million people.

President Lai receives British parliamentary delegation	President Lai Ching-te welcomed a delegation from the British-Taiwan All-Party Parliamentary Group to the Presidential Office Feb. 18 in Taipei City, anticipating expansion of relations and jointly ensuring regional and global peace and stability. The group is led by APPG Chair Sarah Champion and comprises Lord Purvis of Tweed and MPs Ben Spencer, Helena Dollimore, Noah Law and David Reed. According to the president, Taiwan-U.K. relations have gone from strength to strength in recent years. He thanked delegation members, the U.K. parliament and government for continuing to support Taiwan through a variety of means. Lai praised the success of the Taiwan-UK Enhanced Trade Partnership, the first formal economic and trade framework between Taiwan and a European country. It is hoped that the two sides will swiftly sign investment, digital trade, energy and net-zero transition arrangements to expand bilateral cooperative exchanges, he said. Lai anticipated that the U.K. would continue to support Taiwan's accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, so that the two sides can work to build further resilient global supply chains to promote global prosperity and development. In response, Champion said the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China conference held in Taiwan last July was significant, with legislators from 23 countries showing support for Taiwan. She said she was proud that the U.K. parliament supported the clear motion that the UNGA Resolution 2758 was specific to China and only to China, adding that it was an important and powerful recognition. The MP said that maintaining Taiwan's sovereignty is a common interest for the U.K. and the world. Noting that the U.S. has come out strongly in support of Taiwan, she encourages other countries around the world to do the same. With the 27th Taiwan-U.K. trade talks set to take place soon, she expects further development in the partnership.
