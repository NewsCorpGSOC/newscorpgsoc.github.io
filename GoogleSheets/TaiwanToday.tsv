Vice Premier Cheng reaffirms commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050	Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said Jan. 22 that Taiwan is committed to achieving net-zero emissions in 2050 by reducing carbon at the source, launching innovative sustainability measures and encouraging civil society to take an active role. The vice premier made the remarks while attending the presentation of a sandbox experiment organized by the Cabinet-level National Science and Technology Council in Taipei City. The event involved 35 citizen groups showcasing results of two-year projects addressing challenges in areas such as circular economy, low-carbon agriculture and sustainable energy. Cheng first praised the achievements of the Net-Zero Science and Technology Program launched by the NSTC in 2023 and reaffirmed the net-zero transition vision outlined in President Lai Ching-te's National Project of Hope. She added that the Executive Yuan is set to propose National Determined Contributions, which include carbon emission goals for 2030, 2032 and 2035, in a National Climate Change Committee meeting Jan. 23. According to Cheng, the Ministry of Environment has recently announced that by 2030 carbon emissions are slated to drop by about 28 percent compared to 2005 levels. To meet this target, ministries and agencies must optimize ongoing projects under the 12 Key Strategies action plan, she said, adding that a special task force will work with the NSTC to formulate a flagship carbon reduction action plan. Such blueprints aim to reduce carbon emissions in the agricultural, commerce and housing, energy, environment, manufacturing, and transportation sectors in line with the Climate Change Response Act, Cheng said. She added that the government will additionally launch measures encouraging financial and technological innovations, establishing a carbon credit pricing mechanism, promoting regulatory adjustments and expanding relevant personnel cultivation to attain national goals. Citizen participation and community-driven action are indispensable to carbon reduction efforts, Cheng said, expressing her hope of shaping a Taiwan model of climate change governance to raise the country's profile on the global stage.

Act on Wildlife Conservation amendments passed by Legislature	The Legislative Yuan passed amendments to the Act on Wildlife Conservation Jan. 21 in Taipei City, underscoring the government's respect for Taiwan's Indigenous heritage in its efforts to conserve wildlife, protect biodiversity and maintain the balance of natural ecosystems. The amendments, which involve nine clauses of the act, prohibit the use of steel-jaw traps, dynamite and other explosives to catch wild animals, the Ministry of Agriculture said, adding that any devices, equipment and medication used to illegally catch wild animals, as well as the catch and their products, will be confiscated. In addition, owners of protected animals bear the responsibility to report and recover lost animals, as well as pay for all associated costs if a government agency provides assistance. Stricter punishment is also imposed on those who fail to do so. According to the MOA, the amendments allow members of Indigenous groups to hunt wild animals for nonprofit purposes, including birth celebrations and other ritual ceremonies. In a move to decriminalize hunting without prior approval from relevant agencies, the amendments impose only administrative fines on Indigenous individuals for such violations and exonerate first-time offenders. Following the passage, the revised regulations governing the hunting and slaughtering of wild animals for cultural and ritual purposes by Indigenous groups are expected to take effect in 2026, the MOA added.

MOHW diversifies care for dementia patients	The Ministry of Health and Welfare said Jan. 20 that the ministry is committed to diversifying services for dementia patients in accordance with condition severity to provide the most appropriate and professional care. According to the MOHW, the Long-term Care Plan 2.0 launched in 2017 has stipulated that dementia patients of extremely mild, mild, moderate and severe symptoms shall be taken into care by facilities in line with their severity. Those with extremely mild and mild symptoms are encouraged to go to dementia care stations to participate in activities to stimulate cognition and thus mitigate symptoms, the ministry said.

Premier Cho reaffirms commitment to safeguarding coastal security	Premier Cho Jung-tai said Jan. 20 that the government is sparing no effort to protect the safety of all Coast Guard Administration staff as they continue to safeguard Taiwan's coastal security and sovereignty. The premier made the remarks while visiting the base of the CGA's Northern Sector Flotilla at Taipei Port to express gratitude to personnel for sacrificing their Lunar New Year holidays for the people of Taiwan. According to Cho, given Taiwan's 1,200 kilometers of coastline, any breach along the shores would greatly compromise national security and lead to severe damage. The Northern Sector Flotilla is the largest among five such units in terms of personnel and patrol vessel numbers, and plays a leading role in monitoring the country's territorial waters from the shores of the northeastern county of Yilan to the northern county of Hsinchu, he added. The premier commended CGA staff for their tireless efforts in carrying out rescue missions, combating smuggling and ensuring maritime order and ecological conservation, citing as an example the 35-day mission over 17,000 kilometers by CG-5002 Hsinchu in 2024 to protect the rights of local fishermen. Cho said in the past two weeks he attended the ceremony marking the delivery of CG-611 Chang Bin, PP-10096 and PP-3525 and the naming of CG-612 Suao, as well as visiting a CGA command in the outlying Kinmen County.

President Lai receives former US VP Pence	President Lai Ching-te received former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence at the Presidential Office Jan. 17 in Taipei City, expressing hope to see an even stronger partnership forged to maintain regional and global peace and stability. Praising Pence as an outstanding political leader, Lai said the former VP spoke in support of Taiwan's international participation on numerous occasions at international venues. His contributions to the Taiwan-U.S. ties are sincerely appreciated by the government and people, Lai added. According to Lai, during his tenure, the former VP actively helped strengthen bilateral security cooperation and facilitate the normalization of military sales to Taiwan, deepen economic partnership and closely monitor military threats and diplomatic isolation faced by Taiwan. At a time when authoritarian regimes continue to converge and present serious challenges to democracies around the world, Lai said free and democratic nations need to work in unity to expand their cooperation. A stronger Taiwan-U.S. partnership will be an even more powerful force in safeguarding peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, the president added. Lai welcomed the first visit by Pence and his wife to Taiwan, an event of significance, and expressed anticipation for continued work with the new U.S. administration and Congress to advance two-way exchanges in economy, trade and industry. In response, Pence said it was an honor for him to visit Taiwan to reaffirm the strong and longstanding bond of friendship between the two peoples. The shared values of freedom, the rule of law and respect for human rights bind the two sides together in a partnership that transcends geographic boundaries and cultures, he stated. The U.S. is a Pacific nation committed to the status quo that has created an environment of extraordinary growth and prosperity, and the U.S., Taiwan and other regional allies all want to maintain that stability. Washington recognizes China as the element wanting to change the status quo, and the American people are deeply concerned about China's increasingly aggressive posture in the region. Just as Taiwan will never surrender its freedom, Pence said he will continue to be a voice for a strong U.S.-Taiwan relationship in the defense and for the benefit of Taiwan, the U.S. and the free world.

The ceremony was hosted by Fang Jui-wen, deputy director-general of the MOE's Sports Administration, and NTU Executive Vice President Chang Shan-chwen.

Through an exclusive channel, athletes can seek diagnoses and receive immediate services like computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging so they can return to training as soon as possible, the ministry said. NTU was designated as a regional center under an MOE initiative subsidizing the hiring of athletic trainers at educational institutions starting in 2013, the ministry said, adding that the initiative granted regional centers the authority to assess and assist athletic trainers while integrating medial resources and promoting injury prevention and care education. During his remarks, Fang said the LOI exemplified interdisciplinary public-private collaboration to establish a medical care network for promising young athletic talent. He also thanked NTU for combining the expertise of medical institutions and urged more facilities to take part.

President Lai receives Reagan Foundation delegation	President Lai Ching-te said Jan. 9 that Taiwan would implement the Four Pillars of Peace action plan to ensure regional peace and contribute to global prosperity. Lai met with a delegation from the California-based Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute led by its president, David Trulio, at the Presidential Office in Taipei City. Former U.S. President Reagan was a strong supporter and friend of Taiwan, Lai said, adding that the Six Assurances were proposed by Reagan in 1982 and the Taiwan Relations Act was passed by the U.S. Congress in 1979 and both have served as a firm basis for bilateral ties. Reagan's belief in peace through strength is vital at a time when authoritarian regimes are in the ascendant, Lai said. The rise of autocratic states shows the importance of unity between democracies to maintain rules-based international order, Lai added. Lai conveyed gratitude to Trulio and the foundation for backing Taiwan despite China's threats and anticipated furthering Taiwan-U.S. relations through working with the institute. He also thanked the foundation for the warm reception offered to former President Tsai Ing-wen during her stopover in California, April 2023. In response, Trulio said that the visit comes at a critical juncture as the U.S. prepares to transition to a new administration. The delegation has been impressed with Taiwan's vibrant democracy and its leading position in global economy and technology, he added. The robust two-way partnership and U.S. defense deterrence are indispensable to security across the Taiwan Strait, Truio noted. He concluded by anticipating that the two sides would continue to work together to fulfill mutual commitments to upholding democracy, freedom and stability.

NHRM, AS hold workshop on White Terror period	The National Human Rights Museum and Academia Sinica Institute of Taiwan History hosted a two-day workshop Jan. 9-10 on the White Terror period, highlighting government efforts to promote human rights research while bolstering public understanding of the country's past. The event was attended by over 100 people, including academics, experts, family members of surviving victims and victims themselves, as well as cultural and human rights workers. The first day's seminars focused on experience sharing by survivors and family members on their path of recovery, members of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan reflecting on their thoughts after reading government surveillance files on their communities, and cultural workers on their field surveys. The second day was a presentation of ten essays, which topics included the investigation process of political cases, and other cases involving Indigenous peoples, rural areas and military personnel. ITH Director Chung Shu-min mentioned at the event that a collection of papers presented in the last workshop is to be published soon. NHRM Deputy Director Chen Shu-man said in her remarks that it is the museum's responsibility to clarify the historical truth of the period and disseminate it through exhibitions and education. The museum's work also plays a vital role in realizing the country's transitional justice, she added. According to Chen, the two bodies have also been in cooperation since 2017 to compile and streamline White Terror period information resources into an online search platform called Taiwan Human Rights Memory Bank. The resources are categorized into the five main areas of people, events and cases, institutions and organizations, laws and systems, and search terms. The White Terror refers to a period from 1949 to 1987 in Taiwan and 1992 in the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu islands during which the government declared martial law and suppressed and prosecuted political dissidents.

Taiwan ports deliver 2024 report card	Taiwan's nine ports recorded 690 million revenue tons in cargo handled and 13.92 million twenty-foot equivalent units in container throughput in 2024, creating record revenues of NT$22.8 billion (US$692.17 million) for Taiwan International Ports Corp. Ltd., the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said Jan. 9 in a press release. TIPC Chair Lee Hsien-yi praised the results, especially in a year of daunting challenges including a lower global economic growth rate, the Red Sea crisis and Russia-Ukraine war on the global front, as well as natural disasters with domestic impact such as October's Typhoon Krathon and the magnitude 7.2 earthquake that hit the eastern county of Hualien in April. Lee attributed the strong performance to the company's efforts to expand its core businesses while aggressively diversifying into other areas such as offshore wind power generation, waterfront development projects and various reinvestment strategies. The chair described Terminal 7 of Kaohsiung Port, the country's first smart, automated terminal, as vital to 2024's success in addition to being foundational for future trade: it can berth four 24,000-TEU container ships at the same time with an annual handling volume of 6.5 million TEUs. Other highlights included land reclamation at Taipei Port's logistics zone, a new wharf at Anping Port and passenger terminal upgrades at Suao Port and Hualien Port. Over the course of the year TIPC also introduced a raft of measures and artificial intelligence-based technologies to enhance power consumption management, ensure navigation safety, expedite logistics services and reduce carbon emissions, Lee added. Lee said key TIPC development projects for 2025 include renovations of Kaohsiung Port's Terminal 3 and Terminal 5, more land reclamation at Taipei Port and passenger clearance facility improvement at Penghu Port. He added that these efforts are expected to help increase local ports' total cargo handling volume by 3 percent, attract one million passenger arrivals, incur NT$3.37 billion in investment and create 1,300 new jobs in the process.

FSC announces 2nd edition of sustainable economic activities guidelines	The Financial Supervisory Commission announced the second edition of the reference guidelines for the recognition of sustainable economic activities, as well as recommendations on carbon reduction transformation plans and related matters Dec. 31, 2024. According to the FSC, the commission has worked with multiple ministries to revise the guidelines and roll them out, along with associated recommendations to help enterprises and financial institutions identify sustainable economic activities and bolster their communications. The new guidelines now include the waste removal and resource recycling industry, as well as the agriculture and forestry industry, while also nearly doubling the list of recognized sustainable general economic activities. They also offer a method for calculating the sustainability proportion, allowing financial institutions to judge whether they meet the guidelines' requirements in the areas of loans, investments, asset management and property insurance. The guidelines explain that sustainable economic activities must make real contributions to any of six environmental goals: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainability and conservation of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and biodiversity conservation and restoration. Further, the activities may not cause major harm to any of the six goals or violate social security laws. If the economic activity of an enterprise only fulfills two of the three conditions, but it has already formulated an improvement plan, it can be called &ldquo;in transition.&rdquo; The FSC's recommendations enable enterprises to build their own improvement plans and have taken inspiration from international standards and practices. The commission looks forward to seeing these tools help companies enhance their sustainability.

Deputy MODA minister attends AI summit in Belgium	Deputy Minister of Digital Affairs Lin Yi-jing attended the International Artificial Intelligence Summit held earlier this month in Brussels, Belgium to share the government's strategies in promoting this key sector. During his speech, Lin said the rapid development of AI technology has created tremendous possibilities for the global community and that harnessing the power of AI holds the key to the future. However, Lin cautioned that potential threats come together with breakthroughs. Lin said AI computation models are similar to human brain functions and are increasing speeds by a hundred-fold each year. He called on the free world to work in unity against potential AI endangerment of humanity. A concerted response will ensure the development of an AI ecosystem with good intentions to prevent the technology from abuse and manipulation, he added. Lin said AI's high costs and development mean that the technology is increasingly falling into the ownership of a few global high-tech powerhouses. He urged members of the global community to share technology and develop AI models in response to specific needs and circumstances. Citing Taiwan as an example, the deputy minister said the government is developing an AI model with local cultural and linguistic characteristics, and others catering to Taiwan's semiconductor industry, among other sectors. According to the MODA, Lin also took the opportunity to exchange views with other key participants in the event, such as U.S. AI Safety Institute Director Elizabeth Kelly and U.K. AI Safety Institute Director Oliver Ilott.

TAITRA outlines development strategies for 2025	Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) held a press event Dec. 26 in Taipei City to unveil its 2025 development strategies in response to new geopolitical challenges and economic uncertainties. During the event, TAITRA Chair James C.F. Huang said that given Taiwan's key position in the global supply chain, the inauguration of U.S. President Donald J. Trump will have a major effect on global tariffs, trade and logistics. The country's small- and medium-sized enterprises need to formulate new strategies since they will feel the greatest impact, he added. As a result, Huang said in 2025 TAITRA will step up research on geoeconomics and the U.S. market; promote the Five Trusted Industry Sectors unveiled by President Lai Ching-te in his inauguration speech in May; implement the Ministry of Economic Affairs' export promotion campaigns; and initiate a raft of events, such as trade shows at home and abroad, to help local firms stay ahead of technological development trends and tap into related business opportunities. Equally important, Huang said the council will continue to conduct geoeconomic surveys for its TAITRA Index, and include its global network for data collection. According to TAITRA, new initiatives for next year include the establishment of a trade center in Prague; additional staff at its Fukuoka office to promote the Taiwan Select brand; a Taiwan health industry exhibition center in Southeast Asia; a Taiwan Expo in the U.S. city of Dallas that focuses on artificial intelligence applications, advanced manufacturing and the health sector; and the launch of a new exhibition center in the central city of Taichung in the fourth quarter.

MOC launches initiative to preserve Taiwanese language	A plan to encourage families to speak Taiwanese in the home was announced by the Ministry of Culture Dec. 25 in Taipei City, highlighting the government's commitment to preserving the country's multilingual heritage. Prominent attendees at the launch ceremony included MOC Minister Li Yuan and Caring for Taiwan Foundation Chair Chou Ching-yu. Speaking at the event, Li voiced the hope that every national tongue would become widespread because language equality reflects the equity among different ethnic groups. Chou pointed out that a long-term focus on Mandarin has led to a gradual decrease in speakers of other national languages, adding that despite the passage of the Development of National Languages Act in 2019, Taiwanese does not have any specific law or organization to promote its use. The initiative is a response to an MOC survey conducted in 2020 that found a significant decline in Taiwanese as a first language among younger generations. Under the plan, households that comprise at least two members of different generations or are formed by a married couple can apply to become a Taiwanese-speaking family. Based on language proficiency, those who wish to improve their Taiwanese can register for the &ldquo;Taiwanese language learning family&rdquo; track, while those who are fluent can register for the &ldquo;Taiwanese culture family&rdquo; track, the MOC said, adding that status is granted after members complete required courses.

MOENV promotes plastic-reduction rules in hotel, accommodation sector	The Ministry of Environment held a news conference Dec. 24 to call attention to regulations coming into effect Jan. 1, 2025, to require hotels and other types of accommodation to use less plastic. According to the MOENV, operators will not be permitted to proactively provide six kinds of personal hygiene products: combs, razors, shaving foam, shower caps, toothbrushes and toothpaste. They are also required to put shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and lotion into large bottles starting no later than Jan. 1. Speaking at the event, Environment Minister Peng Chi-ming said the measure responds to the global demand for carbon and plastic reduction. He added that it also aligns with the sustainable development concept proposed by the 2024 Paris Olympics. To help operators comply, the MOENV said over 50 meetings will be held by the environmental bureaus of cities and counties around Taiwan, with various activities hosted and advertisements posted to expand public understanding of the measure. The ministry expects 460 million items to be saved each year, the equivalent of reducing carbon emissions by 2,500 metric tons. In addition, the MOENV said it will provide subsidies for operators to cut the use of bottled water, in line with the country's sustainable tourism goals. Lin Hsin-jen, deputy director general of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Tourism Administration, stressed the importance of green tourism during the event.

Premier Cho pledges to raise Taiwan cancer survival rates by 2030	As part of President Lai Ching-te's policy goal of building a healthier Taiwan, a drive to reduce the country's cancer deaths by one-third by 2030 will be implemented, the Executive Yuan said Dec. 24. During a cross-ministerial cancer prevention meeting at the EY, Premier Cho Jung-Tai said this will be achieved through a three-pronged approach: improving early-stage screening, focusing on genetic testing and precision medicine, and establishing a NT$10 billion (US$306.09 million) fund to develop new cancer drugs. According to Cho, statistics released Dec. 19 by the Ministry of Health and Welfare showed that in 2022, more than 130,000 Taiwan citizens were diagnosed with cancer for the first time, up 8,500 from the year before. The MOHW attributed the increase to the fact that more individuals undertook screening and received treatment following the slowdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many causes contributed to cancer, the premier said MOHW findings acknowledged the importance of early screening, which allows patients time to seek treatment and thus improve survival rates. In particular, as chewing betel nut is a major cause of oral cancers, Cho said there should be clear laws to regulate the crops' consumption and manage the plantations. He directed the Ministry of Agriculture and other agencies to work together to review progress so far and propose measures, such as public awareness campaigns on its health hazards and guidelines to phase out betel nut plantations. Starting in 2025, the government will offer subsidies to screen for lung, breast, colon and cervical cancer and for human papillomavirus to an expanded demographic. These include a NT$4,000 subsidy every two years for low-dose computed tomography scan for lung cancer screening for heavy smokers aged 50-74 who consume at least 20 packs of cigarettes per year, as well as women aged 40-74 and men aged 45-74 whose direct family members have been diagnosed with lung cancer.

Taiwan’s GDP forecast to grow 3.1 percent in 2025	Taiwan's economy is projected to grow 3.1 percent in 2025 on the strength of reviving demand for electronic products and expanding high-speed computing and artificial intelligence applications, Academia Sinica said Dec. 23. According to AS, Taiwan's annual growth rates for real exports and imports of goods and services in 2025 are forecast at 6.53 percent and 7.17 percent, respectively, as the country's increasingly important role in the AI hardware supply chain drives a sustained rise in foreign trade. However, the institution cautioned that U.S. tariff policies may pose uncertainties for Taiwan's export performance. As for private investment, AS said the real annual growth rate is estimated at 5.46 percent due to robust demand for automation, AI-driven opportunities and low-carbon development trends, along with increasing investments from international corporations in Taiwan. Similarly, investment in public infrastructure is also expected to steadily increase, it added. Real private consumption is expected to see modest growth of 2.02 percent in 2025, AS said. Adjustments in minimum wage and military, government and education salaries, along with strong corporate profitability in 2024, are expected to support private consumption, though an increase could be mitigated by uncertainties such as heightened stock market volatility, it added. In addition, AS statistics showed that the unemployment rate for 2025 is projected at 3.26 percent, down from 3.37 percent in 2024, while the inflationary pressures are expected to persist next year. The global economic environment is anticipated to face higher uncertainty in 2025, with concerns spanning the intensity of U.S. trade protectionism and acceleration of supply chain restructuring and market fragmentation, AS said, adding that Taiwan must work to transform these challenges into opportunities.

Echoing this view, Lai said that Taiwan had been subject to various colonial powers in the past and now, as the country's president, he hoped to unite all citizens for autonomy. Lai concluded with hope that more authors would explore themes of Taiwan identity in their work. Previously, on Dec. 16, Premier Cho Jung-tai also presented the author and translator with medals and NT$300,000 (US$ 9,174) in the Executive Yuan. Cho noted that land is the origin of culture as well as the catalyst for creativity and that authors' affection and nostalgia for home often brings about exceptional literary creation. The National Book Award encompasses five categories, one of which, the award for translated literature, acknowledges English versions of outstanding literature, and is open to global authors and translators, the Ministry of Culture added.
