Bonnie Glaser of GMF visits National Museum of Taiwan History	Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific Program at Washington, D.C.-based German Marshall Fund of the United States, visited the National Museum of Taiwan History Feb. 22 in the southern city of Tainan. The U.S. expert was in the country as head of a 14-member delegation from the think tank's Taiwan-U.S.-Europe Policy Program (TUPP).

According to the NMTH, this was Glaser's fifth visit to the museum since 2018 as head of a TUPP delegation. This year's attendees showed particular interest in the interactions between Indigenous and Han peoples, as well as Wangye beliefs. They were especially curious about the traditional costumes of the vanguard that leads parades in honor of these deities. During a sit-down at the venue, the visitors explored topics including responses to transitions of power in Taiwan, local museums' use of historical studies to organize exhibitions for domestic and international audiences, and methods of communicating effectively with patrons of all ages. Glaser said she continued to visit the NMTH because its permanent exhibits present historical perspectives that are relatable to patrons from home and abroad, adding that the museum's English tour guide services also help visitors from the western world better understand Taiwan.

Lai attends ceremony marking 78th anniversary of 228 Incident	President Lai Ching-te pledged to expedite the opening of political archives to further the implementation of transitional justice on Feb. 28 in Taipei City. Lai made the remarks during a ceremony marking the 78th anniversary of the Feb. 28 Incident, during which he also offered condolences to victims and their surviving family members on behalf of the government. The incident occurred in 1947 amid protests of unjust treatment and calls for government reform. Military crackdowns in response to these protests claimed the lives of many civilians and ushered in decades of martial law. The incident had long been a taboo topic, the president noted, adding that it was not until after democratization that the government began to make apologies, offer compensation to victims and their families, and designate Feb. 28 as an annual day of remembrance. Lai continued by acknowledging that while considerable progress has been made toward justice, the search for historical truth takes intensive work. Last year he requested that the National Security Bureau prepare approximately one million documents from its records during the martial law period for submission to the National Development Council's National Archives Administration by June. The president added that the Ministry of Culture had also begun reviews of historical sites related to human rights violations to preserve them for posterity. He concluded with hopes that the annual memorial service not only honor victims and offer comfort to the families of the dead, but also reinforce the lessons of history so that they might not be repeated.

MOENV announces new regulations on HFCs	The Ministry of Environment announced two sets of regulations Feb. 25 governing hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), as the government continues to bring Taiwan's regulations into line with global standards. According to the MOENV, the move is in response to an amendment by the parties to the Montreal Protocol. Adopted in September of 1987, the landmark U.N. environmental treaty regulates the production and consumption of nearly 100 man-made chemicals referred to as ozone depleting substances. During their 28th meeting in October of 2016 in Kigali, Rwanda, the parties signed the Kigali Amendment to add HFCs to the list of controlled substances and approve a timeline for their gradual reduction by 80-85 percent by the late 2040s. The amendment has been ratified by more than 160 countries and territories so far, the MOENV added. HFCs are mainly used in electronic cleansing, fire extinguishing equipment, industrial processing and refrigeration. While they are considered substitutes for hydrochlorofluorocarbons, an ozone depleting substance, they also contain high global warming potential values. The ministry said under the new rules, production of 18 types of HFCs is banned immediately and starting July 1 this year, approval has to be obtained for the import and export of such products and mixtures containing the chemicals. The annual HFC consumption will be capped at the baseline level of 24,523.87 thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalents starting 2026, with the total amount gradually reduced to lower than 20 percent of the baseline level after 2045. The MOENV said the new rules, which are based on the country's Climate Change Response Act, underscore Taiwan commitment to working with global partners to mitigate climate change, adding that it will organize public hearing sessions soon to bring local firms up to speed on the matter.

Taiwan reports 2nd highest foreign trade in 2024	Taiwan recorded its second-best foreign trade numbers in 2024, thanks in part to continuous expansion of the global economy, the Ministry of Finance said Feb. 25. The MOF attributed the strong showing to factors like inflation mitigation and the recovery of economic resilience around the world, adding that global supply chain restructuring and expanding artificial intelligence applications greatly benefited local semiconductor and information communication technology sectors.

Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to Ukrainian media	Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu called on the global community to stand with Taiwan to ensure global supply chain stability and international security integrity. Wu made the remarks during an interview with Tim Mak, founder of Kyiv-based publication Counteroffensive, for an article published Feb. 15 on military technology in Taiwan. Citing remarks by President Lai Ching-te, the Counteroffensive article said Taiwan aspires to become the Asian hub of drone supply chains for global democracies. Based on observations of the Russia-Ukraine war, Taiwan is developing affordable unmanned aerial vehicles, which are expected to play a key role in global confrontations. The article also said that since the late 20th century, the free world has taken the view that welcoming China and Russia into the flow of international trade would have a democratizing effect. Wu said the war has proven that such thinking is naive. The deputy minister said the appropriate strategic response should be to try to separate the so-called &ldquo;red supply chain&rdquo; and the democratic supply chain, adding that Taiwan's prowess in electronics manufacturing and semiconductor technology make it a key player in this regard. Through global supply chain restructuring, the country wants to ensure that local semiconductor technologies will not fall into the hands of Russia or other authoritarian regimes, Wu said, adding that an additional priority is the enhancement of Taiwan's self-defense. According to Counteroffensive, Taiwan is making progress in developing drones and asymmetrical tactics with its rich scientific knowledge. Wu called on the free world to include Taiwan in the global security network as a means to ensure regional and global peace and stability.

Indian MICE tour arrives in Taiwan	The first of six incentive travel groups from India arrived in Taiwan Feb. 9 for a five-day visit, providing a boost to the local tourism sector and reflecting the success of government efforts to promote the country as a major destination. According to the Tourism Administration under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the groups comprise around 800 Mumbai-based Asian Paints employees and their family members. The arrangements were made by Axplore Travelplus, a Mumbai-based agency that specializes in meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) tourism. During their stay, the group will experience Taiwan's tea culture in Taipei City's Maokong area and visit major tourist attractions such as the historic Dadaocheng neighborhood, Ximending shopping district, Taipei 101 and Taipei Zoo, as well as travel to the northeastern county of Yilan for beach activities. The TA expects the six groups to generate at least NT$30 million (US$914,578) in revenue for the local economy. The TA said that India's enormous population, rising economic power and post-pandemic tourism surge led to around 30 million departures in 2024, reflecting the South Asian country's promise as a valuable source of foreign visitors. This potential prompted the TA to launch the Taiwan Tourism Information Center in Mumbai in February 2024 and initiate a raft of promotional campaigns, such as staging business sessions with local travel agencies and inviting media outlets and social media influencers to visit Taiwan, the agency said, adding that Axplore Travelplus was among the MICE service providers that visited Taiwan last June. In addition to ongoing promotions in major target markets such as Japan, South Korea, North America, Western Europe and Southeast Asia, the TA expects the new TTICs set up in Jakarta, Paris, Vancouver and Manila last year to begin to pay dividends, adding that it plans to upgrade the Mumbai center to a regional office by the end of 2025.

The devices are a collaboration between Chang and Tamkang University that incorporate artificial intelligence technology into the traditional art of writing with a brush, the MOC said. Speaking at the show's launch Feb. 13 in Tokyo, TECRO Representative Lee Yi-yang noted that Chang has shown a deep commitment to the promotion and teaching of calligraphy, cultivating numerous talented people in the field. Chang said that the traditional methods of calligraphy have limits, and explained that he has been working with Tamkang to devise modern developments for 24 years. He demonstrated the e-pen's functions with assistance from Lee and Rokuta Shimono, a councilor of the National Diet of Japan. Chang is set to lead a seminar at the end of the month in which he will expound on the evolution of calligraphy and offer demonstrations of e-pens, the MOC said.

Indian MICE tour arrives in Taiwan	The first of six incentive travel groups from India arrived in Taiwan Feb. 9 for a five-day visit, providing a boost to the local tourism sector and reflecting the success of government efforts to promote the country as a major destination. According to the Tourism Administration under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the groups comprise around 800 Mumbai-based Asian Paints employees and their family members. The arrangements were made by Axplore Travelplus, a Mumbai-based agency that specializes in meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) tourism. During their stay, the group will experience Taiwan's tea culture in Taipei City's Maokong area and visit major tourist attractions such as the historic Dadaocheng neighborhood, Ximending shopping district, Taipei 101 and Taipei Zoo, as well as travel to the northeastern county of Yilan for beach activities. The TA expects the six groups to generate at least NT$30 million (US$914,578) in revenue for the local economy. The TA said that India's enormous population, rising economic power and post-pandemic tourism surge led to around 30 million departures in 2024, reflecting the South Asian country's promise as a valuable source of foreign visitors. This potential prompted the TA to launch the Taiwan Tourism Information Center in Mumbai in February 2024 and initiate a raft of promotional campaigns, such as staging business sessions with local travel agencies and inviting media outlets and social media influencers to visit Taiwan, the agency said, adding that Axplore Travelplus was among the MICE service providers that visited Taiwan last June. In addition to ongoing promotions in major target markets such as Japan, South Korea, North America, Western Europe and Southeast Asia, the TA expects the new TTICs set up in Jakarta, Paris, Vancouver and Manila last year to begin to pay dividends, adding that it plans to upgrade the Mumbai center to a regional office by the end of 2025.

Taiwan economy forecast to grow 3 percent in 2025	Premier Cho Jung-tai said the government is committed to stabilizing commodity prices and creating diverse job opportunities to fulfill its goal of fostering an innovative economy and inclusive growth. Cho made the remarks following a briefing on current economic conditions and future prospects made by the Cabinet-level National Development Council Feb. 13 in Taipei City.

According to the premier, last year private sector domestic investment exceeded NT$5 trillion (US$152.7 billion), while overall export volume hit nearly US$500 billion, the second highest in history. The economy is projected to grow 3 percent in 2025, Cho said, adding that he has directed government agencies to continue encouraging businesses at home and abroad to invest in the country. Additionally, the government will keep advancing the five trusted industry sectors of AI, military, next-generation communications, security and surveillance, and semiconductors, as well as the six major regional flagship programs and other projects under the Executive Yuan's Economic Development Committee to ensure the country's central position in global supply chains, optimize the domestic investment climate and enhance economic resilience and industry competitiveness.

NHRM holds lectures on human rights during TIBE	The National Human Rights Museum staged four lectures Feb. 8-9 at Taipei International Book Exhibition in the capital, underscoring the facility's commitment to deepening education on civil liberties, according to the Ministry of Culture. The talks spanned literature creation, picture book publication, and TV and film production, the MOC said. The NHRM's display of research, publications and cultural products at its pavilion aimed to deepen the public's insight into human rights issues, it added. In one of the Feb. 8 lectures, Paiwan writer Liglav A-wu shared her process of portraying Taiwan's White Terror period through an Indigenous lens while serving as an artist in residence at NHRM. Since extant political files are not categorized by ethnic group, she painstakingly tracked down affected individuals from local tribes. A-wu noted that the interviews demonstrated the profound impact authoritarian rule had on native groups, adding that she hopes her work will help Indigenous people learn more about their history. Additionally, illustrator Cincin Chang expounded on her new book &ldquo;Giraffe President,&rdquo; which probes causes of collective trauma and strives to resolve intergenerational conflict. In the work, Chang explores how authoritarianism arises and becomes accepted by society. In response to an audience question on educating children, she emphasized the importance of media literacy, the MOC said. During a Feb. 9 event hosted by poet Hong Hong, fellow poets Hsiang Yang and Chen Yun-yuan introduced a selection of 180 poems on the White Terror period that are set to be published in the second half of the year. Hsiang said that how writers reflect social pain is of great significance, while Chen remarked that compared to prose and fiction, poetry is a better medium to portray subtle but omnipresent agony and violence of the era, the ministry concluded. The White Terror refers to a period from 1949 to 1992, during which the government declared martial law and suppressed and prosecuted political dissidents.

Taiwan shorts shine at Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival	The short film &ldquo;Tayal Forest Club&rdquo; has won the International Jury Special Mention award at the 2025 Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival, according to the Ministry of Culture. During the 47th edition of the annual festival held at the French city from Jan. 31 to Feb. 8, the Taiwan short film was selected from 64 entries for the international award, an encouraging development that bodes well for local productions to compete for global recognition in the new year, the MOC said. The film was directed by Laha Mebow, Taiwan's first Indigenous female film director, who also won the 2022 Golden Horse Award, the highest honor for movies in Taiwan, for best director with &ldquo;Gaga,&rdquo; a comedy about a granddaughter returning from abroad. The 18-minute short is the coming-of-age tale of two Indigenous youths as they take on a nightfall outing in the dense and mountainous Atayal homelands. Before they can find a way home, the pair must first learn lessons that the land has to offer. In addition to the two protagonists' relationship, ancestral spirits, dense forest and subtle climate changes in the mountainous Atayal tribal village create fascinating images on the big screen, the MOC said. &ldquo;The Fishbowl Girl,&rdquo; a short film about lesbians directed by Wu Hung-yi, was shortlisted for the festival's international competition, while &ldquo;The Eye and I,&rdquo; an experimental animation jointly produced by Huang Hsin-chien from Taiwan and Jean Michel Jarre from France, was also selected for screening at the XR Panorama. Launched in 1979, the French festival is widely hailed as the leading events of its kind in the world, or the Oscars of short films. The 2025 edition involved 170,000 patrons and 4,000 filmmakers, with around 8,400 films from 50 countries and territories around the world taking part.

New stamp collection pays tribute to artistic pioneers	A set of stamps featuring the works of four 20th century painters will be released Feb. 12 to showcase Taiwan's achievements in fine arts, according to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Chunghwa Post Co. Ltd. According to Chunghwa Post, this year's collection features works held at the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts based in central Taiwan's Taichung City. Similar sets of stamps have been published since 2002. Chen Cheng-po's 1935 oil painting &ldquo;Tamsui Landscape (Tamsui)&rdquo; depicts the small historic town in what is now New Taipei City during Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945). The artist created a rich sense of spatial depth by layering in buildings on a hillside, roofs of varied heights and winding paths. &ldquo;Yehliu Scenery,&rdquo; an oil painting completed in 1969 by Chen Hui-kun, features a striking contrast between the yellow-brown rock formations and the deep blue water. The contours of the rocks and coastline are smoothly outlined in dark brown, while the sky is rendered with lighter blues and white to evoke the vastness of the seascape. Another stamp shows &ldquo;A Sea of Clouds at Alishan&rdquo; by Liao Chi-chun. The 1953 oil painting's layers of soft pink clouds drift toward a distant horizon, while trees and other greenery in the foreground provide a lush resting place for the eye. &ldquo;Mt. Jade Covered in Snow,&rdquo; a watercolor and ink work on paper completed in 1989 by Ma Pai-sui, consists of 14 individual small paintings that stand alone as complete works. When assembled, they form a single large composition that gives the effect of viewing the magnificent mountain through a window.

Taiwan to raise national computing power	The National Science and Technology Council is building a high-speed computer system to drive research and development of generative artificial intelligence and related business applications in Taiwan, according to the Executive Yuan. After a briefing from the NSTC at the EY Feb. 6 in Taipei City, Premier Cho Jung-tai said computing power plays a key role in promoting industrial digital transformation, personnel cultivation and economic growth. To fulfill President Lai Ching-te's vision of building Taiwan into an AI nation, it is imperative to develop sovereign AI and a complete digital ecosystem, he added. To achieve this policy goal, Cho said the development of high-speed computers, data centers and cloud service platforms, among other digital infrastructure, is to be prioritized. In particular, the premier said government focus will be on creating computing structures more suitable for large language model services and applications development. This will secure Taiwan's global competitiveness and key strategic position while helping create more job opportunities in the process, bolstering prosperity and benefiting domestic small and medium-sized enterprises and startups for more balanced regional development, he added. It is also important to engage the private sector to promote AI and introduce it to all aspects of the business sector, Cho said. This will ensure inclusive and sustainable growth of the digital economy, so that AI innovations can benefit all segments of society, the premier added. According to the NSTC, Taiwan ranked 11th in the world in terms of computing power based on the data released by Top500 project in November 2024. The initiative to create a New Silicon Valley in southern Taiwan unveiled by the Executive Yuan earlier this year will play a key role in bolstering Taiwan's computing capabilities, the NSTC said.

Hakka Bombing of the Dragon underway in Miaoli	The Hakka tradition known as Bombing of the Dragon is being held at the Yuqing Temple in northern Taiwan's Miaoli County, the Hakka Affairs Council said Feb. 6. According to HAC Deputy Minister Fan Tso-ming, there are four well-known events around Taiwan to celebrate the Lantern Festival. He said participating in activities like the Bombing of the Dragon, especially in central Taiwan and as it is the first Hakka celebration after the Lunar New Year, helps sustain Hakka communities' economic development. Fan joined other guests to dot the eyes of 13 dragon models, the HAC said, further expressing the wish for the central and local governments to continue to work together to promote Hakka culture. The Bombing of the Dragon in Miaoli originates from dragon dances, according to the Ministry of the Interior. Traditionally, after worshipping ancestors and before leaving home again for work at the time of the Lantern Festival, Hakka people pray to be immune from disaster and for abundant harvest in the new year, and the activities around the dragon are part of this desire, the HAC said. Activities around the dragon are divided into six stages: first the making of the dragon before the Lunar New Year. Then on the ninth day of the first lunar month, the dragon has its eyes dotted with pupils in a ceremony to symbolize the divine spirit entering the mythical beast to bless the people and start the festival. The final four stages take place on the day of the Lantern Festival, namely welcoming, walking with and throwing fireworks at the dragon, and then the return of the dragon to the heavens. The Bombing of the Dragon was launched in 1998 in Miaoli, and this year will be held from Feb. 6 through Feb. 14, the HAC added.

Taiwan campus redesign projects win global recognition	Several Taiwan campus redesign projects have won global recognition, thanks to the Design Movement on Campus initiative launched by the Ministry of Education and implemented by Taiwan Design Research Institute since 2019. According to the MOE, 91 such projects have been completed so far under the aesthetic education campaign. Among these, the campus renovation at Zhongfeng Elementary School in the central county of Nantou was a 2024 winner of Japan's prestigious Good Design Award in the public facility, civil structure and landscape category. The project gave the school's oldest trees a new lease on life as an outdoor classroom. According to the jury, the design offers a soft physical connection with nature; serves as a space for gathering, reading or staging performances; and inspires children to use the site in innovative ways. Also recognized was Taipei Municipal Fuxing High School, which recently featured in a TV program by Japan media outlet NHK for building campus kennels to house stray dogs and cats as part of the school's life education program, the MOE said. Equally impressive, Hudong Elementary School in the central county of Changhua transformed a dim space into a bright, multifunctional rhythm classroom dubbed the Light Room/Roof. The project has won Taiwan's Golden Pin Design Award and Japan's Good Design Award, as well as featuring in an article in Thailand's leading creative magazine Art4d. The MOE said the success of the campus redesign movement has also caught the attention of British design magazine Wallpaper*, which ran an article featuring several other projects, including a new storage and seating system transformed from an outdated special needs classroom at Sinhua Elementary School in the southern city of Tainan.

Taiwan gears up cancer prevention efforts	To implement further cancer prevention in Taiwan, the government is investing in developing better treatment and offering more support to patients and their families, the Ministry of Health and Welfare said Feb. 4. The MOHW made the remarks in a statement marking World Cancer Day, an initiative led by Geneva-based Union for International Cancer Control to raise awareness of the disease and encourage its prevention, detection and treatment. The campaign theme for 2025-2027 is &ldquo;United by Unique,&rdquo; which focuses on unity and support for a shift of health systems towards people-centered care. According to the ministry, the Health Promotion Administration has been working with Taipei City-based Hope Foundation for Cancer Care to subsidize the establishment of cancer resource centers in Taiwan since 2000. To date, 105 hospitals around the country have set up such facilities, which serve as key network hubs for patients searching for treatment and related information for their specific needs. Citing statistics released Dec. 19, 2024, by the HPA, the MOHW said 130,293 people were diagnosed with cancer in 2022, an increase of 8,531 new cases from the year before. The five-year survival rate was 62.9 percent between 2018 and 2022, up from 51.1 percent between 2016 and 2000, it added. The HPA statistics also show lung, colon and breast cancer as the three leading diseases in that order for both men and women combined, with a standardized incidence rate of 323.3 people per 100,000 population. The ministry said this shows that patients coexist with cancer for a longer period of time and reflects an increased need to offer them more comprehensive care. While the primary goal of treatment has been on treatment, the MOHW said it is equally important to address the psychological and social needs of the patients themselves and their families. Cancer resource centers play a key role in this regard, the MOHW said, adding that it will continue to implement more projects to offer better people-centered care and services.

Taiwan tiger grouper shipment en route to Japan	The first shipment of Taiwan tiger groupers is heading to Japan after gaining approval for export last October, spotlighting government efforts to expand into new markets, the Ministry of Agriculture said Feb. 5. According to the MOA, the batch was procured by Osaka-based West Japan Railway Co. and will be sold in its Rail Kitchen Chikugo, as well as its hotels and supermarkets in Hokkaido and Kyoto prefectures and the Kyushu region. During the news conference announcing the shipment, MOA Minister Chen Junne-jih said the ministry provided rigorous evidence of the product's safety during several bilateral economic and trade conferences. The export approval reflects Japanese recognition of the groupers' quality, breeding management and water quality monitoring, Chen noted, adding that the development marks a milestone in access to the global market for Taiwan fishery products. The ministry will continue to promote domestically raised tiger groupers by ensuring a stable supply and enhancing Japanese consumers' awareness of Taiwan products, Chen said, adding that the MOA's Fisheries Agency will help more local businesses obtain export approval to Japan, while the Fisheries Research Institute will keep monitoring the breeding environment to ensure quality. The minister went on to say that the MOA will conduct market surveys, launch small sampler fish meat packages and hold promotional activities in Japan. Pingtung County Magistrate Chou Chun-mi noted that the southern Taiwan county is the largest grouper breeding area in the country, with an annual output of 7,206 metric tons and an annual output value of NT$1.89 billion (US$57.5 million). This latest shipment follows that of yellow groupers to Japan in 2023, she said.

SBNPM holds exhibition on Taoist immortal Lu Dongbin	The Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum is holding an exhibition featuring calligraphy and artifacts relating to Lu Dongbin, one of the Taoism's Eight Immortals, showcasing various interpretations of the immortals from sophisticated literary depictions to popular images of longevity and prosperity. According to the SBNPM, the Lu Dongbin legend emerged in the early 11th century with accounts of his miraculous manifestations. His spiritual legacy encompasses both literary work and spiritual practice, including distinctive sword techniques for overcoming worldly desire and emotional attachment. Titled &ldquo;Tracing the Taoist Immortal Lu Dongbin in the NPM collection,&rdquo; the exhibition's most important piece is the transcription of verses relating to the immortal character by Dong Qichang (1555-1636). The scroll is a rendition of Lu's poetry with a commentary, the SBNPM said, adding that Dong's brushwork centers on controlled tip movements and fluid transitions, creating lines that possess both vigor and grace. Through slightly asymmetrical, yet balanced character structures, expansive composition spacing and the dramatic interplay of ink and empty space, the work ultimately creates an ethereal and transcendent visual experience, the museum noted. The SBNPM said that other highlights of the exhibition are objects decorated with images of the eight immortals, including a gourd-shaped vase in blue underglaze, a vase with polychrome decoration and a round carved-polychrome lacquer box.

President Lai opens Taipei International Book Exhibition	President Lai Ching-te kicked off the 2025 Taipei International Book Exhibition Feb. 4 in Taipei City, highlighting the government's commitment to promoting Taiwan's publishing industry, the Ministry of Culture said. During his opening remarks, Lai said knowledge is power and encouraged more people to take part in the event. He invited readers to immerse themselves in the myriad cultures showcased by 504 publishing companies from 29 countries. Following his address, MOC Minister Li Yuan noted that as this year's guest of honor, Italy is presenting art by young cartoonists and illustrators, as well as children's literature and illustrated books, while 11 Italian authors are set to attend TIBE seminars. A collaborative creation inspired by Italian writer Italo Calvino's &ldquo;If on a Winter's Night a Traveler&rdquo; is also on display in the event's digital pavilion, he added. The minister went on to add that the MOC will launch a raft of measures to support the domestic publishing sector, citing an international book fair for children and young adults, promotions of Taiwan's graphic novels and the Books From Taiwan project, the latter of which invites global buyers to the country. According to Li, Taiwan has a diverse, free and creative culture, and the exhibition provides an opportunity to engage in cultural exchange with Italy and other countries from around the world. Echoing Li's remarks, Paola Seghi, international relations manager of the Italian Publishers Association, said that participating in the event is an extraordinary chance since Asia is the second-biggest region the association sells publishing rights to following the European market. The president also took the opportunity to present awards to winners of the Taipei International Book Exhibition Book Prize and the Golden Butterfly Awards for book design during the opening ceremony. Launched in 1987 by the Taipei Book Fair Foundation under the auspices of the MOC, TIBE is the leading event of its kind in Asia and one of the world's largest such events alongside the Frankfurt Book Fair, Bologna Children's Book Fair and BookExpo America.
