Furthermore, MOFA reiterates that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is an independent and sovereign nation; that it has the right to autonomously engage with other countries around the world and develop relations with them; that it will not accept interference or suppression from any country for any reason; and that it will not impose limits on itself. MOFA again thanks the US government for continuing to staunchly fulfill its security commitments to Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances. MOFA also again reminds China that any inappropriate overreaction to the ROC (Taiwan) president making routine overseas trips will be detrimental to regional peace and stability and lead to international condemnation.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118761	2024-12-03T01:39:00-08:00

MOFA response to Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declaring firm opposition to President Lai’s US transit stop	December 1, 2024 In response to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declaring firm opposition to Republic of China (Taiwan) President Lai Ching-te making a transit stop in the United States, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reiterates that the ROC (Taiwan) is an independent and sovereign nation; that neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; and that the PRC has never governed Taiwan for a single day. President Lai's stopover in the United States en route to Pacific allies to consolidate friendships is in accordance with customary practice and is an exercise of the legitimate rights of a sovereign nation. MOFA underlines that transit stops made by ROC (Taiwan) presidents are arranged pursuant to long-standing practice. The United States has followed this practice by extending assistance in accordance with the principles of safety, dignity, convenience, and comfort. MOFA thanks the United States for its assistance, which demonstrates that Taiwan-US relations are closer and more cordial than ever before. MOFA further asserts that any overreaction by China to the president of the ROC (Taiwan) conducting normal travel duties would represent an irresponsible attempt to damage regional peace and stability and be subject to the condemnation of the international community.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118745	2024-12-01T04:43:00-08:00

MOFA warmly welcomes this news and thanks the US government for continuing to provide the weaponry and services needed for Taiwan's defense and for honoring its security commitments as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances. This is the 18th arms sale to Taiwan announced during the Biden administration. It continues the US policy of normalized arms sales that ensure Taiwan has adequate self-defense capabilities and reliable defense capacity in response to China's threats. The sale highlights the US government's firm support for bolstering Taiwan's defense resilience and its high regard for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan will continue to demonstrate its commitment to self-defense in response to China's recurrent military pressure and gray-zone intrusion in the waters and airspace around Taiwan. It will strengthen national defense and whole-of-society resilience, staunchly defend its free and democratic way of life, seek peace through strength, and deepen its close security partnership with the United States. MOFA welcomes further concrete action by the United States and other like-minded partners that advances peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the Indo-Pacific.

MOFA response to UK parliament passing motion reaffirming that UNGA Resolution 2758 did not determine Taiwan’s status	November 29, 2024 Following a debate on November 28, the UK House of Commons unanimously passed a motion on the international status of Taiwan affirming that United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 did not mention Taiwan or establish PRC sovereignty over Taiwan and was silent on the status of Taiwan in the UN. Responding to the motion on behalf of the UK government, Catherine West, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Indo-Pacific at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, stated that the United Kingdom was of the view that UNGA Resolution 2758 decided that only the People's Republic of China should represent China at the UN, that it did not determine the status of Taiwan, and that it should not therefore be used to preclude Taiwan's meaningful participation in the UN or the wider international system. She pointed out that the United Kingdom opposed any attempt to broaden the interpretation of the resolution to rewrite history, which she said would not be in the interests of the Taiwanese people, the United Kingdom, or the global community. The passage of this motion by the UK parliament underscored its staunch support for Taiwan. Furthermore, through Ms. West's comments, the UK government publicly expressed for the first time its position on UNGA Resolution 2758 and underlined Taiwan's wrongful exclusion from important international cooperation and dialogue mechanisms. This marked a new milestone in Taiwan's efforts to counter China's distortion of the resolution. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates the support of the United Kingdom. The motion was introduced by Blair McDougall, a member of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, and cosigned by 16 members of parliament from the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National Party, and other political parties, including British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group Chair Sarah Champion and Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) Cochair for the United Kingdom Iain Duncan Smith. It fully demonstrated the firm commitment of both governing and opposition parliamentarians in the United Kingdom to supporting Taiwan's international status and participation. The UK House of Commons was the fifth national parliament in the world&mdash;after Australia, the Netherlands, Guatemala, and Canada&mdash;to pass such a motion since IPAC adopted a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 for its members' reference at its annual summit in July. The European Parliament has also approved a similar measure. MOFA sincerely thanks all parties once again for their support.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118749	2024-11-29T01:49:00-08:00

He laid flowers at the January 13 Memorial at the Seimas and witnessed the transfer of the chairmanship of the Lithuania-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group from Matas Maldeikis to Ruslanas Baranovas. The handover was a meaningful demonstration of the continuing desire of the two like-minded nations to promote parliamentary exchanges. When visiting Poland, Minister Lin attended the Polish-Taiwanese Economic Cooperation Forum on November 22. The event was organized by a group of companies led by Taiwan's International Economic Cooperation Association (CIECA) from sectors including ICT, semiconductors, smart urban transport, and drones. The following day, Minister Lin witnessed the signing of an MOU between the Taiwan-Poland Chamber of Commerce and the Polish-Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the city of Ł&oacute;dź. The two chambers will coordinate with the CIECA and the Polish Chamber of Commerce to develop economic and trade opportunities between Taiwan and Poland, thus promoting economic and trade diplomacy. In a demonstration of Taiwan's values-based diplomacy, on the same day in Warsaw, Minister Lin witnessed the donation of 580 electric generators for cities in Ukraine and 2,600 Taiwanese laptops to help Ukrainian students bridge the digital divide. The two donations, worth US$10 million, will be facilitated through the Association of Ukrainian Cities. Minister Lin also witnessed the signing of a letter of intent between Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom and the Ukrainian city of Bucha. The parties will cooperate to develop Bucha into Ukraine's first 5G smart city. The initiatives further demonstrated that Taiwan is aligning with the democratic community to provide much-needed humanitarian resources to Ukraine and assist it with reconstruction. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to promote integrated diplomacy and work with Europe and other like-minded partners to enhance democratic resilience and establish strong and mutually beneficial values-based alliances. Through joint public-private initiatives to promote economic and trade diplomacy, MOFA will further enhance Taiwan-Europe economic and trade links and consolidate Taiwan's pivotal position in global supply chains. Building on the robust ties between Taiwan and Europe, both sides will continue to deepen cooperation, bolster the economic security of democratic partners, and advance economic coprosperity.

Foreign Minister Lin leads delegation to Drone Industry Business Forum, seeks to create democratic supply chain with Lithuania	November 22, 2024No. 427 Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung led a 59-member delegation from the Taiwan Excellence Drone International Business Opportunities Alliance (TEDIBOA) and 20 related Taiwanese companies to Vilnius, Lithuania, to attend the Drone Industry Business Forum on November 21. The event was cohosted by the Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania and Lithuania's Innovation Agency. Minister Lin and Legislator Wang Ting-yu, Convener of the Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, delivered remarks on Taiwan's behalf. Vice Minister of National Defense Monika Koroliovienė, Director of the Innovation Agency Romualda Stragienė, and President of the Lithuanian Confederation of Industrialists (LPK) Vidmantas Janulevičius spoke on behalf of Lithuania. During the forum, Minister Lin also witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the TEDIBOA and the Lithuanian Defense and Security Industries Association (LGSPA), which underlined the commitment of Taiwan and Lithuania to jointly establishing a democratic drone supply chain. In his remarks, Minister Lin spoke about the serious threat posed by such authoritarian states as China and Russia as they continued to deploy gray-zone tactics, economic coercion, and other means to pressure democratic nations. Noting that the security of Europe and the Indo-Pacific were closely interconnected, he urged like-minded partners to come together to safeguard their hard-won free and democratic way of life. Explaining that President Lai Ching-te had identified the Five Trusted Industry Sectors in a bid to bolster economic resilience through Taiwan's innovative and technological strengths, Minister Lin said that Taiwan would employ integrated diplomacy to reinforce economic and trade collaboration with partners worldwide and thereby promote mutual prosperity. He also stated that Taiwan had already proven to the world that it was an indispensable partner in democratic supply chains and that it would continue to share its experience with Lithuania and other democracies. He described the development of close bilateral ties since the opening of Taiwan's representative office in Vilnius as a model for mutual assistance and cooperation between democratic countries. He said that, given the potential for drone industrial development in Taiwan and Lithuania, he was confident that this new domain would become a success story of bilateral collaboration, and added that Taiwan looked forward to working with the new government of Lithuania to further enhance a bilateral partnership of mutual benefit and shared prosperity. Also speaking at the forum, Legislator Wang said that he had accompanied Minister Lin on the trip to demonstrate Taiwan's support for Lithuania. He pointed out that since both countries stood on the front line of democracy against the threat of authoritarian expansion by such regimes as China and Russia, they should engage in close industrial cooperation so as to jointly enhance economic resilience. Citing Taiwan's commitment to a spirit of supreme excellence for producing the robust manufacturing base that prevailed in the country today, Legislator Wang pledged that Taiwan would uphold this enterprising approach in the drone sector and work steadfastly with like-minded partners to bolster democratic supply chains. Vice Minister Koroliovienė noted in her remarks that Taiwan and Lithuania shared the values of freedom and democracy and that Lithuania anticipated building on this solid existing foundation to strengthen bilateral cooperation. She said that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the threat to democratic countries from authoritarian expansion highlighted the urgent need to enhance national defense and all-out civilian defense, as well as to strengthen asymmetric capabilities through the development of the drone and counterdrone industries. She stated that Lithuania would continue to deepen cooperation with Indo-Pacific countries and that it hoped to pursue strategic collaboration with Taiwan in the drone industry so as to create a democratic defense supply chain. Director Stragienė and LPK President Janulevičius conveyed similar expectations in their remarks. This first Drone Industry Business Forum coorganized by Taiwan and Lithuania attracted participants from more than 40 companies from Lithuania and Ukraine. Interactions were lively at the event, which was attended by more than 200 people, including officials from the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of the Economy and Innovation. With staunch government support from both sides, Taiwan and Lithuania will use this platform to foster industrial linkages and jointly create business opportunities in drone markets in Europe and beyond. Minister Lin's presence at the head of the delegation to the forum underscored the importance he places on the bilateral partnership and his commitment to engage proactively with Lithuania's new government.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint statement between PRC and Brazil	November 21, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Brazilian President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva on November 20 signed and issued the Joint Statement Between the People's Republic of China and the Federative Republic of Brazil on Jointly Building the China-Brazil Community with a Shared Future for a More Just World and a More Sustainable Planet. According to the statement, Brazil reiterated support for the &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo; and said that Taiwan was an inalienable part of Chinese territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly protests and condemns these spurious claims that undermine Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA reiterates that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is an independent and sovereign nation; that neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; and that the PRC has never governed Taiwan for a single day. These are objective and universally understood facts. Taiwan is a modern, democratic nation that actively defends its democratic system and respects human rights and the rule of law. No statement distorting Taiwan's sovereign status can alter the international consensus as to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. Brazil is a country that pursues the core values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. MOFA calls on the government of Brazil to recognize the malevolent intentions behind China's Belt and Road Initiative, to no longer echo the false narrative pushed by China through the so-called &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; to refrain from maliciously disparaging Taiwan's sovereignty, and to avoid becoming an accomplice in authoritarian China's attempts to jeopardize regional peace and stability. MOFA reaffirms the Taiwanese people's staunch commitment to upholding the values of freedom and democracy and urges the international community to jointly condemn China's unilateral actions aimed at disrupting cross-strait peace and stability.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118699	2024-11-20T19:55:00-08:00

MOFA response to US President Biden again underscoring importance of cross-strait peace and stability in meeting with Chinese leader Xi in Peru	November 17, 2024 US President Joe Biden met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Lima, Peru, on November 16. During the meeting, President Biden reiterated that the United States opposed any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side of the Taiwan Strait, that it expected cross-strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, and that the world had an interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. He also called for an end to China's destabilizing military activity around Taiwan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) commends and welcomes President Biden publicly reaffirming the United States' commitment to preserving peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait during interactions with the Chinese leader. MOFA also thanks the Biden administration for placing great importance on, and doing its utmost through concrete actions to maintain, peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. This included a joint statement issued after the recent US-Japan-ROK leaders' meeting recognizing peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. In the statement, the three countries announced the establishment of a trilateral secretariat to coordinate and implement their shared commitments and ensure that their joint efforts would make the Indo-Pacific a thriving, connected, resilient, stable, and secure region. MOFA also notes that China's press release on the Biden-Xi meeting again included fallacious and misleading narratives on Taiwan and Taiwan-US relations. MOFA reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. It also stresses that, as the United States and other parties have repeatedly pointed out, China's continuous military provocations around Taiwan are the biggest destabilizing factor for regional peace and stability and the biggest threat to global economic prosperity. MOFA welcomes continued international attention on cross-strait peace and stability as well as concern over China's threat to the peaceful status quo. As a responsible member of the global community, Taiwan will actively implement the Four Pillars of Peace action plan, leveraging its strengths to ensure peace. Taiwan is staunchly committed to defending itself and will steadily enhance its defense capabilities. It will also work with the United States and other like-minded partners to preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118638	2024-11-17T01:19:00-08:00

MOFA response to China using APEC and other key international forums to disparage Taiwan’s sovereignty and spread falsehoods intended to confuse inter...	November 16, 2024 Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on November 15 on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. After the meeting, China publicly announced that Singapore fully understood the Chinese government's position on the Taiwan issue, opposed any form of Taiwan independence, and staunchly abided by the &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; However, since the Singaporean government has verifiably not made any such declaration, China's statement is unmistakably false. In addition to once again publishing untrue remarks about Taiwan on behalf of another country without its consent, China has repeatedly made erroneous statements misstating other countries' positions with the intention of confusing international public opinion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) solemnly condemns and refutes the Chinese government for repeatedly spreading falsehoods and lies among the international community that disparage Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA urges the international community to jointly denounce China's peremptory actions, which unilaterally and deliberately undermine regional peace and stability.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118628	2024-11-15T18:56:00-08:00	
MOFA response to claim made in China-Peru joint statement that Peru reiterates staunch commitment to -one China principle-	November 15, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a bilateral meeting with Peruvian President Dina Boluarte on November 14 while in Peru to attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. Following the meeting, a joint statement was issued that made the gratuitous claim that Peru had reiterated its staunch commitment to the &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) gravely protests and condemns China and Peru for making such unwarranted statements, which disparage Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA reiterates that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign and independent nation; that neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other; and that the PRC has never governed Taiwan for even a single day. These facts are understood throughout the world. Taiwan is a modern, democratic nation that actively defends its democratic system and respects human rights and the rule of law. No statement distorting Taiwan's sovereign status can alter the international consensus as to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. On the occasion of hosting a major international conference, the government of Peru has failed to consider the spirit of cordiality that exists between nations. Instead, it has unilaterally followed the Chinese government's one-sided &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo; and confused international public opinion. This is most certainly not what the leaders of participating APEC member economies would have wanted to see. MOFA urges Peru to recognize China's attempts to infiltrate Latin American countries by appealing to their economic and trade interests. Indeed, MOFA calls on Peru to no longer follow the falsehood that is the &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; maliciously disparage Taiwan's sovereignty, or serve as an accomplice in fueling regional tensions. MOFA solemnly reiterates that the staunch desire of the Taiwanese people to defend the values of freedom and democracy is indisputable and not to be underestimated. MOFA urges the international community to jointly denounce the Chinese government's peremptory actions, which unilaterally and deliberately undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118630	2024-11-14T23:00:00-08:00

MOFA sincerely thanks international community for supporting Taiwan’s participation in INTERPOL	November 12, 2024No. 410The 92nd session of the General Assembly of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) was held in Glasgow, United Kingdom, from November 4 to 7. In an unprecedented show of global support, executive and legislative branches of government, interparliamentary organizations, and prominent individuals of over 70 countries endorsed Taiwan's bid to participate in INTERPOL. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely thanks the international community for its calls for justice for Taiwan.This year, Taiwan's diplomatic allies voiced their support for Taiwan in multiple ways. Recognizing Taiwan's contributions to fighting crime over the years and underscoring the paramount importance of Taiwan's inclusion in the system to combat transnational crime, they staunchly backed Taiwan's involvement in INTERPOL, writing letters and raising the issue with the INTERPOL president and secretary general. In addition, the heads of delegations from Belize, Eswatini, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Paraguay, Saint Christopher and Nevis, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines produced videos urging support for Taiwan's participation in INTERPOL.Like-minded countries have also continued to publicly call for Taiwan's engagement with INTERPOL and other international organizations on numerous occasions. The Group of Seven (G7) Leaders' Communiqu&eacute; and the chair's statement issued after the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting both reaffirmed support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. Joint statements released following the UK-Australia Ministerial Consultations and the France-Australia Foreign and Defense Ministerial Consultations also backed Taiwan's involvement in the global arena.In addition, representative offices of like-minded nations demonstrated support for Taiwan on social media platforms. The American Institute in Taiwan shared Taiwan's INTERPOL campaign film on its official Facebook page, calling for Taiwan's substantive and meaningful participation in the international community as well as in collective efforts to advance global security. The Australian Office posted Taiwan's INTERPOL campaign logo on its official social media accounts to express support and called for active collaboration among law enforcement agencies worldwide to combat transnational crime. Support from various parliaments was also strong. The European Parliament, the Czech Senate, the Dutch House of Representatives, the Saint Christopher and Nevis National Assembly, the Guam Legislature, and other parliaments adopted resolutions endorsing Taiwan's participation in INTERPOL. The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, the Australian Senate, the Canadian House of Commons, the Italian Chamber of Deputies, and the Guatemalan Congress also passed resolutions backing Taiwan's participation in international organizations. Parliamentarians from the Republic of Korea (ROK), Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Latvia, Estonia, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and other countries, as well as Formosa Club members in various regions, sent individual or joint letters to the INTERPOL president or secretary general calling for INTERPOL to accept Taiwan into its fold.In terms of international press coverage, Taiwan's campaign was featured in 195 media reports. These included an op-ed entitled &ldquo;Joining hands with Taiwan to build a safer global village: Supporting Taiwan's participation in INTERPOL&rdquo; by Commissioner Chou Yew-woei of the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), letters to the editor from Taiwan's overseas missions, press interviews with heads of mission, and other related articles. News outlets that published the pieces included Newsmax and the National Interest in the United States; EU Political Report and Modern Diplomacy in the European Union; the Mainichi Shimbun in Japan; News1 in the ROK; The Statesman in India; Le Formiche and Notizie Geopolitiche in Italy; La Raz&oacute;n in Spain; Gazeta Wyborcza in Poland; and The Baltic Times in Latvia. A video produced by the CIB for this year's INTERPOL bid called Borderline Operations was posted on the Facebook and X accounts of MOFA and Taiwan's overseas missions, the Trending Taiwan YouTube channel, and other channels, accumulating more than 2.81 million views. Related posts on MOFA's new media accounts, including Facebook, X, Instagram, and Threads, were seen over 235,000 times.MOFA emphasizes that the global security map is incomplete without Taiwan. Taiwan's exclusion from INTERPOL undermines concerted efforts to maintain global security and jeopardizes the welfare of people worldwide. Taiwan is both willing and able to work with the international community to combat transnational crime. It urges INTERPOL to uphold the principles of professionalism and neutrality, swiftly include Taiwan in the global law enforcement network, and work with Taiwan on joint efforts to ensure international security.
