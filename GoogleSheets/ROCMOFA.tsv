Foreign Minister Lin addresses Global Taiwan Institute; promotes integrated diplomacy and urges cooperation with US to advance regional prosperity and...	October 17, 2024 No. 355 At the invitation of the Global Taiwan Institute (GTI), a think tank based in Washington, DC, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung delivered a keynote address via a prerecorded video at its annual symposium held on October 16. He discussed the grave challenges authoritarian coalitions and expansionism pose to the international order and commended the United States for creating a strong and mutually reinforcing latticework of alliances. He said that Taiwan, as an indispensable member of the international community, hoped to promote integrated diplomacy and work with the United States to respond to a variety of challenges. Minister Lin explained how China was ramping up military intimidation against Taiwan, in addition to legal, public opinion, and cognitive warfare. He indicated that China was deliberately using gray-zone tactics in an attempt to create a new normal across the Taiwan Strait, which seriously jeopardized peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the region. Minister Lin thanked the United States for its staunch commitment to supporting Taiwan's security, as reflected in such assistance as foreign military financing and presidential drawdown authority in recent years. He affirmed that Taiwan had also been steadily increasing its defense budget as well as whole-of-society defense resilience and defense capabilities. Minister Lin stated that the core of integrated diplomacy was the promotion of economic and trade partnerships based on mutual prosperity. He anticipated that through the Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue and other platforms Taiwan and the United States would continue to increase supply chain resilience and cooperation in critical areas. He noted that in line with the one plus one equals three concept, Taiwan and the United States could jointly facilitate development in third countries. He added that under the Global Cooperation and Training Framework cooperation with other nations could be expanded to respond to global issues and challenges, paving the way for Taiwan's policy shift from consolidating diplomatic ties to bolstering the prosperity of diplomatic allies. Emphasizing that Taiwan needed the world and the world needed Taiwan, Minister Lin said that Taiwan would continue to work closely with the United States, allies, and partners to implement integrated diplomacy and expand Taiwan's international presence. GTI was the first think tank in Washington, DC, to focus on Taiwan-related research. The theme of this year's symposium was &ldquo;US-Taiwan Relations: An Ironclad Partnership in a Period of Global Disruption.&rdquo; It explored Taiwan-US defense and security cooperation, the US elections, China's gray-zone threats, and geopolitical security issues.

MOFA response to UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office expressing serious concern over China’s joint military drills around Taiwan	October 15, 2024 The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office issued a press statement on October 14 expressing concern over China's military exercises around Taiwan and adding that these exercises increased tensions and risked dangerous escalation in the Taiwan Strait. In the statement, the United Kingdom reaffirmed its interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, which it said was of critical importance to global prosperity. The statement reiterated that the Taiwan issue should be settled by people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait through dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion.

MOFA response to US State Department expressing serious concern over China’s military drills around Taiwan	October 14, 2024 The US State Department issued a press statement on October 13 stating that the United States was seriously concerned by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) joint military drills in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan, and that the People's Republic of China (PRC) responding with military provocations to a routine annual speech was unwarranted and risked escalation. In the statement, the United States called on the PRC to act with restraint and to avoid any further actions that may undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the region. The statement added that the United States would continue to monitor China's activities and coordinate with allies and partners regarding their shared concerns. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week publicly emphasized that Taiwan's National Day address was a routine activity and that China should not use the event as a pretext for engaging in any provocative actions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) conveys its sincere appreciation to the United States for expressing its serious concerns and reaffirming its security commitments to Taiwan, and for once again focusing attention on the PLA as it uses a routine speech to justify launching military acts of harassment against Taiwan. MOFA emphasizes that China's use of President Lai Ching-te's National Day address as a pretext for applying military pressure on Taiwan and issuing a slew of threatening remarks is a grave violation of the fundamental spirit of the United Nations Charter. Such actions will not only fail to gain the endorsement of the international community, but rather prompt countries to express heightened concern over China's provocative behavior that disrupts the status quo. MOFA calls on like-minded allies and partners to jointly press China to exercise self-restraint and to cease its intimidation of Taiwan and all activities that undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the region.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118251	2024-10-14T02:26:00-07:00

MOFA strongly condemns China for disregarding Taiwan’s goodwill and taking provocative actions that raise tensions in Taiwan Strait and region	October 14, 2024 No. 353 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has noted that China on October 14 launched its so-called Joint Sword-2024B military drill around Taiwan, once again challenging the rules-based international order and gravely undermining regional peace and stability. MOFA strongly condemns China and urges it to pull back and immediately cease its military provocations. In his National Day address, President Lai Ching-te once again expressed goodwill to China and called for it to act responsibly and work with Taiwan to maintain the prevailing state of peace, stability, and prosperity. However, China remains determined to intimidate the people of Taiwan through military exercises and is attempting to threaten Taiwan's democracy and unilaterally disrupt the status quo of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the region. MOFA solemnly denounces China and urges it to neither use false pretexts aimed at justifying disagreement and strife nor become a troublemaker that undermines regional peace and stability. At the same time, MOFA calls on nations around the world to recognize China's authoritarian and expansionist nature, take concrete actions to support democratic Taiwan at this critical moment, unite in defending the values of freedom and democracy, and safeguard the rules-based international order, as well as the freedom, openness, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region.

MOFA response to false claims by China’s foreign ministry regarding Taiwan	October 10, 2024 At a regular press conference held on the afternoon of October 10, China's foreign ministry falsely claimed that Taiwan had &ldquo;no so-called sovereignty&rdquo; and urged &ldquo;the few foreign politicians who visit Taiwan to correct their wrong words and deeds.&rdquo; President Lai Ching-te clearly stated in his National Day address on October 10 that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China was subordinate to the other. He also emphasized that Taiwan was willing to work with China to address climate change, combat communicable diseases, and maintain regional security in the pursuit of peace and mutual prosperity for the well-being of both peoples. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reiterates that ideological narratives or threats will neither alter the fact that Taiwan is a democratic country with 23 million peace- and freedom-loving people nor hinder Taiwan from forging closer connections and interactions with the international community. MOFA calls on China to recognize the goodwill that President Lai expressed in his National Day address and squarely face the reality of the situation across the Taiwan Strait. Instead of continuing to cause apprehension and disturbances in the surrounding region, China should attempt to once again align with the rules-based international order so as to contribute to regional peace, stability, prosperity, and positive cross-strait development.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118227	2024-10-11T01:49:00-07:00

MOFA sincerely thanks international community for taking concrete actions to support Taiwan’s UN participation	October 4, 2024No. 058The General Debate of the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) concluded on September 30. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely thanks the diplomatic allies, like-minded countries, and friends from around the world who expressed support for Taiwan's participation in the UN and refuted China's deliberate misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 in various ways, both in the chamber and on the sidelines of the event. High-level government officials from Taiwan's diplomatic allies Paraguay, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Eswatini, Tuvalu, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Belize spoke up for Taiwan at the UN General Debate and Summit of the Future. Officials from the Marshall Islands, Palau, Tuvalu, and Saint Lucia explicitly pointed out that UNGA Resolution 2758 did not preclude Taiwan's participation in the UN system. Following similar remarks in 2022, US President Joe Biden again used his speech to the UN General Debate to spell out the United States' commitment to maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Australia mentioned the Taiwan Strait for the first time at the UN General Debate, with Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong stating that Australia had consistently pressed China on peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. At a US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing held a few days before the UN General Debate, US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell criticized China for using UNGA Resolution 2758 as a diplomatic tool to suppress Taiwan's status. In response to a question in parliament, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Caspar Veldkamp openly acknowledged that the resolution had nothing to do with Taiwan. Following a meeting on the sidelines of the UNGA held by the Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers and the European Union high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, the chair of the meeting released a statement reaffirming the importance of cross-strait peace and stability to international security and prosperity as well as supporting Taiwan's international participation. Joint statements expressing a high regard for cross-strait peace and stability were issued after other recent high-level meetings, including the Quad leaders' summit, the seventh high-level meeting of the EU-US Dialogue on China, the US-Japan summit meeting, the UK-US Strategic Dialogue, the Japan-Australia Foreign and Defence Ministerial Consultations, the Republic of Korea-New Zealand bilateral meeting, and the Lithuania-US Strategic Dialogue on the Indo-Pacific.In terms of legislative branches, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China passed a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 on July 30 for its members' reference. The Australian Senate, the Dutch House of Representatives, and the Guatemalan Congress have since adopted motions in support of Taiwan based on the model resolution. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Italian Chamber of Deputies also approved a resolution backing Taiwan's international participation, demonstrating staunch support for Taiwan.Speaking for the first time on the sidelines of the UNGA at the annual summit of the New York-based nonprofit organization Concordia through prerecorded remarks, President Lai Ching-te told the UN family that Taiwan would strive to maintain regional peace and stability and urged the international community to support Taiwan's participation. Ambassador Alexander Tah-ray Yui, Representative to the United States, held a discussion with former US Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith Krach on cross-strait peace and security and Taiwan's campaign to participate in the UN. During the UNGA, Taiwan cohosted a seminar in New York with the United States, Japan, Australia, and Canada under the Global Cooperation and Training Framework. The event underscored Taiwan's resolve to contribute to the global community.MOFA also appreciates the unwavering support of the Legislative Yuan. A cross-party delegation of legislators&mdash;including Ngalim Tiunn, Wu Tsung-hsien, and Wu Chun-cheng&mdash;visited New York during the UNGA to provide guidance and take part in related activities. The group powerfully conveyed the strong desire of the Taiwanese people to be part of the UN system.Through an international publicity and new media campaign, the government effectively communicated Taiwan's demands for UN participation to all quarters. An op-ed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung, letters to the editor from Taiwan's overseas missions, and interviews with Taiwanese ambassadors and representatives appeared 455 times in mainstream international media outlets. These included the Diplomat, the Hill, the Washington Times, National Review, and the New York Sun in the United States; Modern Diplomacy and the European Business Review in the European Union; the National Post in Canada; Le Figaro in France; Norrbottens-Kuriren in Sweden; La Raz&oacute;n in Spain; De Telegraaf and Nederlands Dagblad in the Netherlands; Euractiv in Greece; Rzeczpospolita in Poland; La Verit&agrave; and Le Formiche in Italy; the Sankei Shimbun in Japan; the Chosun Ilbo in the Republic of Korea; the Philippine Star in the Philippines; the Hindustan Times and the Tribune in India; the Jerusalem Post in Israel; La Raz&oacute;n in Peru; the Eswatini Observer in Eswatini; La Naci&oacute;n in Paraguay; O Tempo in Brazil; Jelen in Hungary; and the Daily News in Thailand. The short promotional film IC You received more than 25.4 million views&mdash;again breaking the record for Taiwan's annual campaign. During the UNGA, MOFA and its overseas missions released 2,922 posts about Taiwan's bid on social media platforms including Facebook, X, Instagram, and Threads. The posts were seen over 48.378 million times and received an unprecedentedly warm response. A short animation video, UNity through Peace: Chip in with Taiwan, was shown on a large billboard in New York City's iconic Times Square. The advertisement featured elements including semiconductor circuits and Taiwan's contributions to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The video conveyed Taiwan's strengths in IC technology, highlighted its image as a responsible member of the global community, and broadened worldwide recognition and support for Taiwan's call for international participation.MOFA reiterates that UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan. The resolution therefore has nothing to do with Taiwan and cannot serve as the basis for precluding Taiwan from the UN system and other international organizations. Taiwan is determined, willing, and able to contribute to the global community. Continuing to exclude Taiwan from multilateral endeavors will not only be a loss to humanity but also detrimental to realizing the SDGs. To uphold the UN principle of leaving no one behind, MOFA again calls on the UN to stop bowing to pressure from China and swiftly allow Taiwan's full participation.

MOFA sincerely congratulates Japanese Representative Ishiba on his election as LDP president	September 27, 2024No. 319 The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan elected Shigeru Ishiba, a member of the House of Representatives, as its new president after two rounds of voting on September 27. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) extends its sincere congratulations and has instructed the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Japan to promptly send a message of felicitations on behalf of the government of Taiwan.

MOFA strongly condemns Chinese Foreign Minister Wang for misrepresenting UNGA Resolution 2758 at 79th UNGA session	September 29, 2024No. 322The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for his remarks at the General Debate on September 28 during the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), in which he again falsely claimed that UNGA Resolution 2758 had resolved once and for all the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the UN. MOFA reiterates that the objective status quo across the Taiwan Strait and the internationally recognized reality is that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan; nor does it confirm Taiwan to be a part of the PRC or authorize the PRC to represent Taiwan in the UN. Hence, the resolution has nothing to do with Taiwan and does not address the issue of Taiwan's representation in the UN. MOFA again stresses that only Taiwan's popularly elected government can represent Taiwan in the UN and other international organizations and events.MOFA demands that China stop misleading the international community. It also urges nations worldwide to give due attention to China's mischaracterization of UNGA Resolution 2758, which constitutes a malicious attempt to unilaterally change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and establish a legal basis for the use of force against Taiwan. It calls on the global community to proactively take countermeasures against China's actions and work in concert to safeguard the cross-strait status quo of peace and stability and the rules-based international order.

MOFA response to US State Secretary Blinken reaffirming importance of cross-strait peace and stability in meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang o...	September 28, 2024United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with China Director of the Office of the Chinese Communist Party Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 27. A press release later issued by the US Department of State pointed out that Secretary Blinken had emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait during the meeting. It further stated that he had also raised concerns about China's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea as well as its support for Russia's defense industrial base.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes staunch US support for cross-strait peace and stability and appreciates high-level US officials reaffirming this position during interactions with Chinese counterparts. It also strongly condemns China for continuing to take actions that jeopardize the peaceful status quo at a time when the international community shares collective concerns regarding, and is striving to maintain, regional security and stability.MOFA further notes that in the press release China issued following the meeting, it again made spurious claims about Taiwan and Taiwan's relations with the United States that do not accord with reality. MOFA reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. MOFA also stresses that it is China's relentless intimidation of Taiwan and willful military expansion in the region that pose the greatest risk to regional peace and stability. Furthermore, by accommodating Russia, China has become a key supporter of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the transatlantic region. Its provocative staging of joint military exercises with Russia in the Indo-Pacific also shows that its ambitions have become a major global threat.As President Lai Ching-te pointed out to the international community while addressing a summit held by a nonprofit organization during the UNGA, &ldquo;a stronger Taiwan is better able to promote democracy, peace, and prosperity around the world.&rdquo; He also expressed the sincere hope for &ldquo;Taiwan and other democratic nations to jointly support the democratic umbrella and counter authoritarian aggression.&rdquo; As a responsible member of the global community, Taiwan will steadfastly enhance its defense capabilities and work together with the United States and other like-minded partners to safeguard the rules-based international order and preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118159	2024-09-28T01:48:00-07:00

President Lai and Representative to the US Yui strongly urge international support for Taiwan at Concordia Summit	September 25, 2024 No. 316 Renowned nonprofit organization Concordia held its annual summit in New York from September 23 to 25. At Concordia's invitation, President Lai Ching-te delivered a prerecorded speech at the summit on September 24. He reiterated that neither democratic Taiwan nor authoritarian China was subordinate to the other. He also condemned China for maliciously distorting United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 and inappropriately conflating the resolution with its &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; thereby depriving Taiwan of the right to participate in the United Nations and other international fora. President Lai further emphasized that Taiwan was actively implementing the Four Pillars of Peace action plan. He said that without yielding or provoking, Taiwan would maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and do its utmost to preserve regional peace and stability. He expressed the hope that more countries would support and walk together with democratic Taiwan on the path of prosperity. During the summit, Ambassador Alexander Tah-ray Yui, Representative to the United States, held a discussion with former US Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith Krach on &ldquo;Taiwan's Democratic Resolve: Shaping Global Security and Peace Through Strategic Cooperation.&rdquo; Ambassador Yui stressed that maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait was an indispensable element in global prosperity and economic growth. He also noted that China's continuous deployment of gray-zone tactics such as economic coercion and cognitive warfare to intimidate Taiwan not only threatened cross-strait peace and stability and global security and development but also undermined the rules-based international order. He said that democratic countries must work in solidarity to deter authoritarian expansion. Pointing out that Taiwan supplies more than 90 percent of the world's most advanced semiconductors, Ambassador Yui said that the Taiwan Strait was an important route for international trade and that Taiwan was an indispensable partner for building sustainable supply chains and a digital future, as well as for promoting global prosperity and development. He urged the international community to give due attention to the gravity of Taiwan's exclusion from the UN system and other international organizations and to proactively incorporate Taiwan's professional expertise and contributions into global sustainable development plans. He said that this would be truly in line with the UN commitment to leave no one behind. Since its establishment in 2011, Concordia has made significant efforts to foster influential cross-sector public-private partnerships, gaining prominence in the UN community in New York. The Concordia Annual Summit has been held during the UNGA in September for 13 consecutive years and had US President Joe Biden, UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, and former President Tsai Ing-wen among its keynote speakers.
