In the statement, the three countries announced the establishment of a trilateral secretariat to coordinate and implement their shared commitments and ensure that their joint efforts would make the Indo-Pacific a thriving, connected, resilient, stable, and secure region.

MOFA reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. It also stresses that, as the United States and other parties have repeatedly pointed out, China's continuous military provocations around Taiwan are the biggest destabilizing factor for regional peace and stability and the biggest threat to global economic prosperity.

As a responsible member of the global community, Taiwan will actively implement the Four Pillars of Peace action plan, leveraging its strengths to ensure peace.

MOFA response to China using APEC and other key international forums to disparage Taiwan’s sovereignty and spread falsehoods intended to confuse inter...	November 16, 2024 Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on November 15 on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. After the meeting, China publicly announced that Singapore fully understood the Chinese government's position on the Taiwan issue, opposed any form of Taiwan independence, and staunchly abided by the &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; However, since the Singaporean government has verifiably not made any such declaration, China's statement is unmistakably false. In addition to once again publishing untrue remarks about Taiwan on behalf of another country without its consent, China has repeatedly made erroneous statements misstating other countries' positions with the intention of confusing international public opinion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) solemnly condemns and refutes the Chinese government for repeatedly spreading falsehoods and lies among the international community that disparage Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA urges the international community to jointly denounce China's peremptory actions, which unilaterally and deliberately undermine regional peace and stability.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118628	2024-11-15T18:56:00-08:00	
MOFA response to claim made in China-Peru joint statement that Peru reiterates staunch commitment to -one China principle-	November 15, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a bilateral meeting with Peruvian President Dina Boluarte on November 14 while in Peru to attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. Following the meeting, a joint statement was issued that made the gratuitous claim that Peru had reiterated its staunch commitment to the &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) gravely protests and condemns China and Peru for making such unwarranted statements, which disparage Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA reiterates that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign and independent nation; that neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other; and that the PRC has never governed Taiwan for even a single day. These facts are understood throughout the world. Taiwan is a modern, democratic nation that actively defends its democratic system and respects human rights and the rule of law. No statement distorting Taiwan's sovereign status can alter the international consensus as to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. On the occasion of hosting a major international conference, the government of Peru has failed to consider the spirit of cordiality that exists between nations. Instead, it has unilaterally followed the Chinese government's one-sided &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo; and confused international public opinion. This is most certainly not what the leaders of participating APEC member economies would have wanted to see. MOFA urges Peru to recognize China's attempts to infiltrate Latin American countries by appealing to their economic and trade interests. Indeed, MOFA calls on Peru to no longer follow the falsehood that is the &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; maliciously disparage Taiwan's sovereignty, or serve as an accomplice in fueling regional tensions. MOFA solemnly reiterates that the staunch desire of the Taiwanese people to defend the values of freedom and democracy is indisputable and not to be underestimated. MOFA urges the international community to jointly denounce the Chinese government's peremptory actions, which unilaterally and deliberately undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118630	2024-11-14T23:00:00-08:00

In addition, the heads of delegations from Belize, Eswatini, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Paraguay, Saint Christopher and Nevis, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines produced videos urging support for Taiwan's participation in INTERPOL.Like-minded countries have also continued to publicly call for Taiwan's engagement with INTERPOL and other international organizations on numerous occasions. The Group of Seven (G7) Leaders' Communiqu&eacute; and the chair's statement issued after the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting both reaffirmed support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. Joint statements released following the UK-Australia Ministerial Consultations and the France-Australia Foreign and Defense Ministerial Consultations also backed Taiwan's involvement in the global arena.In addition, representative offices of like-minded nations demonstrated support for Taiwan on social media platforms. The American Institute in Taiwan shared Taiwan's INTERPOL campaign film on its official Facebook page, calling for Taiwan's substantive and meaningful participation in the international community as well as in collective efforts to advance global security. The Australian Office posted Taiwan's INTERPOL campaign logo on its official social media accounts to express support and called for active collaboration among law enforcement agencies worldwide to combat transnational crime. Support from various parliaments was also strong. The European Parliament, the Czech Senate, the Dutch House of Representatives, the Saint Christopher and Nevis National Assembly, the Guam Legislature, and other parliaments adopted resolutions endorsing Taiwan's participation in INTERPOL. The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, the Australian Senate, the Canadian House of Commons, the Italian Chamber of Deputies, and the Guatemalan Congress also passed resolutions backing Taiwan's participation in international organizations. Parliamentarians from the Republic of Korea (ROK), Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Latvia, Estonia, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and other countries, as well as Formosa Club members in various regions, sent individual or joint letters to the INTERPOL president or secretary general calling for INTERPOL to accept Taiwan into its fold.In terms of international press coverage, Taiwan's campaign was featured in 195 media reports.

A video produced by the CIB for this year's INTERPOL bid called Borderline Operations was posted on the Facebook and X accounts of MOFA and Taiwan's overseas missions, the Trending Taiwan YouTube channel, and other channels, accumulating more than 2.81 million views. Related posts on MOFA's new media accounts, including Facebook, X, Instagram, and Threads, were seen over 235,000 times.MOFA emphasizes that the global security map is incomplete without Taiwan. Taiwan's exclusion from INTERPOL undermines concerted efforts to maintain global security and jeopardizes the welfare of people worldwide. Taiwan is both willing and able to work with the international community to combat transnational crime. It urges INTERPOL to uphold the principles of professionalism and neutrality, swiftly include Taiwan in the global law enforcement network, and work with Taiwan on joint efforts to ensure international security.

Subsequent to this, China announced both the baselines of territorial waters around Huangyan Island (Scarborough Shoal) and standard names and geographic coordinates for 64 islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The government of the ROC (Taiwan) solemnly states that the Philippines' enactment of the two aforementioned domestic laws and China's demarcation of the baselines of territorial waters around Huangyan Island and the naming of certain islands and reefs in the South China Sea do not change the fact that the South China Sea islands are part of ROC (Taiwan) territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) stresses that the territorial sovereignty of the ROC (Taiwan) is indisputable and that the ROC (Taiwan) will staunchly safeguard its sovereign rights over territory and relevant waters in the South China Sea. MOFA points out that, in accordance with a related announcement previously issued by the Executive Yuan, Taiwan's rights with regard to its territorial sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and their relevant waters as accorded by international law and the law of the sea will not be impacted whatsoever by any country's unilateral claims. It expresses grave concern over the Philippines and China escalating disputes in the South China Sea, which undermines regional peace and stability. MOFA urges all parties to exercise restraint and peacefully resolve South China Sea issues through multilateral dialogue and dispute settlement mechanisms, and it calls for Taiwan's inclusion in such dialogue and mechanisms on the basis of equality. MOFA reiterates that the position of the ROC (Taiwan) on South China Sea issues is as follows: 1. The South China Sea islands are part of ROC (Taiwan) territory. That the ROC (Taiwan) is entitled to all rights over the South China Sea islands and their relevant waters in accordance with international law and the law of the sea is beyond dispute. 2. The ROC (Taiwan) supports freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea. It strongly maintains that disputes should be resolved peacefully in accordance with international law and the law of sea (including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) and that it should be included in related multilateral dialogue and dispute settlement mechanisms. 3. The ROC (Taiwan) will uphold the four principles and five actions.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint PRC-Indonesia statement issued by PRC	November 11, 2024Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during a visit to China from November 8 to 10. After the meeting, China issued the Joint Statement Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on Advancing the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and the China-Indonesia Community with a Shared Future, which declares that &ldquo;Indonesia reiterates its consistent adherence to [a] one-China principle, which is reaffirmed by the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, and its recognition . . . that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.&rdquo;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly protests and condemns these false claims. It reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; that the Chinese communist regime has never governed Taiwan; and that no narrative distorting Taiwan's sovereign status can change the internationally recognized status quo across the Taiwan Strait. MOFA also points out that UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan and has nothing to do with Taiwan. It stresses that the resolution neither reflects nor is equivalent to China's so-called &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Given China's continuing malicious misrepresentation of the resolution and its attempts to mislead the international community, MOFA calls on countries worldwide to come together to counter China's spurious claims. Taiwan and Indonesia share the fundamental values of democracy and freedom. President Prabowo and his new administration took office in October. MOFA looks forward to working with Indonesia's new government and building on friendly bilateral relations so as to further deepen exchanges and cooperation in economics and trade, agriculture, education, and other domains, and jointly contribute to regional peace, stability, and prosperity.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118579	2024-11-10T23:50:00-08:00
