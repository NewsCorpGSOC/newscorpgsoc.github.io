US government officially notifies Taiwan of latest arms sale	October 26, 2024 No. 367 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has received official notification from the United States government that its executive branch has informed Congress of a US$1.988 billion arms sale to Taiwan, including the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System as well as L-band and non-L-band radar turnkey systems. MOFA warmly welcomes this news and thanks the US government for continuing to provide the weaponry and services needed for Taiwan's defense and for honoring its security commitments as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances. This is the 17th arms sale to Taiwan announced during the Biden administration. It continues the US policy of normalized arms sales that ensure Taiwan has adequate self-defense capabilities. The sale reflects the US government's unwavering support for strengthening Taiwan's defensive resilience and deterrence capabilities and demonstrates its high regard for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. China has stepped up pressure recently by again holding large-scale military drills in the waters around Taiwan. It is increasingly using live-fire exercises as a pretext for infringing upon the freedom of navigation of shipping of other countries. MOFA welcomes continuing concrete action by the United States and other like-minded partners that display support for the cross-strait status quo of peace and stability. In the face of threats posed by China, Taiwan will not shirk its self-defense responsibilities. It will continue to show a determination to protect itself, enhance its defensive capabilities and resilience, staunchly uphold its free and democratic way of life, and pursue peace through strength. Furthermore, it will work to deepen the close Taiwan-US security partnership so as to jointly safeguard the rules-based international order and advance peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific.

MOFA welcomes European Parliament resolution on PRC’s misinterpretation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and continuous military provocations against Taiwan	October 25, 2024No. 365The European Parliament (EP) on October 24 adopted a resolution concerning the misinterpretation of United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 by the People's Republic of China and its continuous military provocations around Taiwan by an overwhelming majority of 432 votes in favor and 60 against. The EP resolution strongly opposes the PRC distorting UNGA Resolution 2758 to block Taiwan's international participation and calls on the European Union and its member states to support Taiwan's meaningful participation in relevant international organizations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates this support. The EP resolution points out that UNGA Resolution 2758 addresses the status of the PRC but does not determine that the PRC enjoys sovereignty over Taiwan, nor does it make any judgement on the future inclusion of Taiwan in the UN or any other international organization. It also states that Taiwan has never been part of the PRC. Stressing that UNGA Resolution 2758 takes no position on Taiwan, the EP resolution strongly rejects and refutes the PRC's attempts to distort history and international rules and thereby block Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. It also strongly condemns the PRC's continued military provocations and gray-zone activities against Taiwan and reiterates the EU's firm rejection of any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.Pointing out that Taiwan is a key, like-minded partner of the EU in the Indo-Pacific, the EP resolution calls for the EU and its member states to further deepen cooperation and exchanges with Taiwan in such domains as the economy, investment, semiconductor and high-tech industrial supply chains, disaster management, civil protection, and countering disinformation and foreign interference. It also advocates continued support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Criminal Police Organization, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and other multilateral organizations. In addition, the EP welcomes closer official and people-to-people interactions and exchanges between Taiwan and the EU, including the recent visit of former President Tsai Ing-wen to the EP.Since the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China passed a model resolution concerning UNGA Resolution 2758 in July for its members' reference, the Australian Senate and the Dutch House of Representatives have passed motions in support of Taiwan. The EP thus becomes the third parliament to approve a similar resolution. MOFA urges the global community to take concrete action to oppose China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and to refute China's false claim that there is an international consensus on its so-called &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Taiwan will continue to enhance its substantive and comprehensive cooperation with the EU and other like-minded partners to jointly ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific.

October 19, 2024 No. 359 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely appreciates that the administrations and friendly members of parliament of more than 30 countries, as well as the European Union, have publicly expressed concern over the cross-strait situation or stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability after China once again recently launched military drills to intimidate Taiwan. Countries including Taiwan's diplomatic allies, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Lithuania, and the Republic of Korea variously urged China to exercise restraint and stated that differences should be resolved through dialogue and not the threat of force or coercion. The maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is in the common interests of both sides of the strait and the international community. There is a high degree of consensus within global society over the importance of preserving peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the Indo-Pacific. MOFA once again calls on China to face up to the reality of the existence of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and to respect the Taiwanese people's choice of a free and democratic way of life, willingness to engage in international cooperation alongside China, and goodwill toward maintaining regional security and pursuing peace and shared prosperity. It urges China to stop using use military provocation or other means to threaten and suppress Taiwan and disrupt the regional status quo. Only this can facilitate the positive development of cross-strait relations and satisfy the expectations of the international community. MOFA calls on all nations to continue to voice concern over the cross-strait situation and support Taiwan. Taiwan will further work with its diplomatic allies and like-minded partners to safeguard the rules-based international order and jointly advance regional peace, stability, and prosperity.

Foreign Minister Lin addresses Global Taiwan Institute; promotes integrated diplomacy and urges cooperation with US to advance regional prosperity and...	October 17, 2024 No. 355 At the invitation of the Global Taiwan Institute (GTI), a think tank based in Washington, DC, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung delivered a keynote address via a prerecorded video at its annual symposium held on October 16. He discussed the grave challenges authoritarian coalitions and expansionism pose to the international order and commended the United States for creating a strong and mutually reinforcing latticework of alliances. He said that Taiwan, as an indispensable member of the international community, hoped to promote integrated diplomacy and work with the United States to respond to a variety of challenges. Minister Lin explained how China was ramping up military intimidation against Taiwan, in addition to legal, public opinion, and cognitive warfare. He indicated that China was deliberately using gray-zone tactics in an attempt to create a new normal across the Taiwan Strait, which seriously jeopardized peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the region. Minister Lin thanked the United States for its staunch commitment to supporting Taiwan's security, as reflected in such assistance as foreign military financing and presidential drawdown authority in recent years. He affirmed that Taiwan had also been steadily increasing its defense budget as well as whole-of-society defense resilience and defense capabilities. Minister Lin stated that the core of integrated diplomacy was the promotion of economic and trade partnerships based on mutual prosperity. He anticipated that through the Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue and other platforms Taiwan and the United States would continue to increase supply chain resilience and cooperation in critical areas. He noted that in line with the one plus one equals three concept, Taiwan and the United States could jointly facilitate development in third countries. He added that under the Global Cooperation and Training Framework cooperation with other nations could be expanded to respond to global issues and challenges, paving the way for Taiwan's policy shift from consolidating diplomatic ties to bolstering the prosperity of diplomatic allies. Emphasizing that Taiwan needed the world and the world needed Taiwan, Minister Lin said that Taiwan would continue to work closely with the United States, allies, and partners to implement integrated diplomacy and expand Taiwan's international presence. GTI was the first think tank in Washington, DC, to focus on Taiwan-related research. The theme of this year's symposium was &ldquo;US-Taiwan Relations: An Ironclad Partnership in a Period of Global Disruption.&rdquo; It explored Taiwan-US defense and security cooperation, the US elections, China's gray-zone threats, and geopolitical security issues.
