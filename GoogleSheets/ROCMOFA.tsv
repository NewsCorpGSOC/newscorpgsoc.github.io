MOFA strongly condemns Chinese Foreign Minister Wang for misrepresenting UNGA Resolution 2758 at 79th UNGA session	September 29, 2024No. 322The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for his remarks at the General Debate on September 28 during the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), in which he again falsely claimed that UNGA Resolution 2758 had resolved once and for all the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the UN. MOFA reiterates that the objective status quo across the Taiwan Strait and the internationally recognized reality is that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan; nor does it confirm Taiwan to be a part of the PRC or authorize the PRC to represent Taiwan in the UN. Hence, the resolution has nothing to do with Taiwan and does not address the issue of Taiwan's representation in the UN. MOFA again stresses that only Taiwan's popularly elected government can represent Taiwan in the UN and other international organizations and events.MOFA demands that China stop misleading the international community. It also urges nations worldwide to give due attention to China's mischaracterization of UNGA Resolution 2758, which constitutes a malicious attempt to unilaterally change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and establish a legal basis for the use of force against Taiwan. It calls on the global community to proactively take countermeasures against China's actions and work in concert to safeguard the cross-strait status quo of peace and stability and the rules-based international order.

MOFA response to US State Secretary Blinken reaffirming importance of cross-strait peace and stability in meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang o...	September 28, 2024United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with China Director of the Office of the Chinese Communist Party Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 27. A press release later issued by the US Department of State pointed out that Secretary Blinken had emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait during the meeting. It further stated that he had also raised concerns about China's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea as well as its support for Russia's defense industrial base.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes staunch US support for cross-strait peace and stability and appreciates high-level US officials reaffirming this position during interactions with Chinese counterparts. It also strongly condemns China for continuing to take actions that jeopardize the peaceful status quo at a time when the international community shares collective concerns regarding, and is striving to maintain, regional security and stability.MOFA further notes that in the press release China issued following the meeting, it again made spurious claims about Taiwan and Taiwan's relations with the United States that do not accord with reality. MOFA reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. MOFA also stresses that it is China's relentless intimidation of Taiwan and willful military expansion in the region that pose the greatest risk to regional peace and stability. Furthermore, by accommodating Russia, China has become a key supporter of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the transatlantic region. Its provocative staging of joint military exercises with Russia in the Indo-Pacific also shows that its ambitions have become a major global threat.As President Lai Ching-te pointed out to the international community while addressing a summit held by a nonprofit organization during the UNGA, &ldquo;a stronger Taiwan is better able to promote democracy, peace, and prosperity around the world.&rdquo; He also expressed the sincere hope for &ldquo;Taiwan and other democratic nations to jointly support the democratic umbrella and counter authoritarian aggression.&rdquo; As a responsible member of the global community, Taiwan will steadfastly enhance its defense capabilities and work together with the United States and other like-minded partners to safeguard the rules-based international order and preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118159	2024-09-28T01:48:00-07:00

President Lai and Representative to the US Yui strongly urge international support for Taiwan at Concordia Summit	September 25, 2024 No. 316 Renowned nonprofit organization Concordia held its annual summit in New York from September 23 to 25. At Concordia's invitation, President Lai Ching-te delivered a prerecorded speech at the summit on September 24. He reiterated that neither democratic Taiwan nor authoritarian China was subordinate to the other. He also condemned China for maliciously distorting United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 and inappropriately conflating the resolution with its &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; thereby depriving Taiwan of the right to participate in the United Nations and other international fora. President Lai further emphasized that Taiwan was actively implementing the Four Pillars of Peace action plan. He said that without yielding or provoking, Taiwan would maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and do its utmost to preserve regional peace and stability. He expressed the hope that more countries would support and walk together with democratic Taiwan on the path of prosperity. During the summit, Ambassador Alexander Tah-ray Yui, Representative to the United States, held a discussion with former US Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith Krach on &ldquo;Taiwan's Democratic Resolve: Shaping Global Security and Peace Through Strategic Cooperation.&rdquo; Ambassador Yui stressed that maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait was an indispensable element in global prosperity and economic growth. He also noted that China's continuous deployment of gray-zone tactics such as economic coercion and cognitive warfare to intimidate Taiwan not only threatened cross-strait peace and stability and global security and development but also undermined the rules-based international order. He said that democratic countries must work in solidarity to deter authoritarian expansion. Pointing out that Taiwan supplies more than 90 percent of the world's most advanced semiconductors, Ambassador Yui said that the Taiwan Strait was an important route for international trade and that Taiwan was an indispensable partner for building sustainable supply chains and a digital future, as well as for promoting global prosperity and development. He urged the international community to give due attention to the gravity of Taiwan's exclusion from the UN system and other international organizations and to proactively incorporate Taiwan's professional expertise and contributions into global sustainable development plans. He said that this would be truly in line with the UN commitment to leave no one behind. Since its establishment in 2011, Concordia has made significant efforts to foster influential cross-sector public-private partnerships, gaining prominence in the UN community in New York. The Concordia Annual Summit has been held during the UNGA in September for 13 consecutive years and had US President Joe Biden, UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, and former President Tsai Ing-wen among its keynote speakers.

MOFA thanks allies’ permanent representatives to UN for refuting misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and supporting Taiwan’s participation	September 20, 2024No. 310 In a firm demonstration of support for Taiwan's efforts to participate in the United Nations system, the permanent representatives to the UN of nine diplomatic allies sent a joint letter to UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres strongly refuting the misrepresentation and misapplication of UN General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758. The allies were Belize, Eswatini, Guatemala, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tuvalu. Paraguay also sent an individual letter backing Taiwan's UN bid. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely appreciates the warmth of support from Taiwan's diplomatic allies. The permanent representatives to the UN of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Palau, Guatemala, Tuvalu, and the Marshall Islands presented the joint letter to the UN Secretariat on September 19 before speaking to reporters in front of the UN headquarters to demand that the UN stop excluding Taiwan.The joint letter stressed three main points. First, it called on the UN to recognize and take action to address malicious distortions of UNGA Resolution 2758, which constitute a serious threat to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. Second, given that UNGA Resolution 2758 does not preclude Taiwan's meaningful engagement in the UN system, the letter urged the UN to seek appropriate means to allow Taiwan to participate and further contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Third, it called on the UN to remain strictly neutral, stop erroneously citing UNGA Resolution 2758, and cease inappropriately depriving Taiwanese nationals and journalists of the right to enter UN premises for visits, meetings, and newsgathering activities.MOFA reiterates that UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention and therefore has nothing to do with Taiwan. The resolution neither reflects nor equates to China's &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; nor does it block Taiwan from participating in the UN system or other international organizations. MOFA strongly condemns China's continued malicious distortion of the resolution in attempts to mislead international opinion. It calls on the international community to jointly oppose China's false narratives and urges the UN Secretariat to actively uphold the principle of universality embodied in the UN Charter, honor its commitment to leave no one behind, and promptly allow Taiwan's participation.

MOFA response to Dutch House of Representatives passing Taiwan-friendly motion on UNGA Resolution 2758 and Taiwan’s international participation	September 13, 2024 The House of Representatives of the Netherlands on September 12 adopted a Taiwan-friendly motion stating that United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 did not rule that the People's Republic of China (PRC) enjoyed sovereignty over Taiwan and that it did not make any judgment on Taiwan's participation in the UN or other international organizations. The motion was passed by an overwhelming majority, with 147 of 150 members voting in favor. It was highly significant that the motion was approved while the 79th session of the UNGA was being convened. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates the passage of the motion. The motion also noted that UNGA Resolution 2758 was being used by the PRC to block Taiwan's international engagement and that the Netherlands also had an interest in Taiwan's participation in such organizations as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the World Health Organization. After the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) adopted a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 for its members' reference at its annual summit in July and the subsequent passage of a related motion by the Australian Senate, the passage of this motion by the Dutch House of Representatives makes the Netherlands the second country in the world and the first in Europe to adopt a similar measure. The Taiwan-friendly motion was jointly proposed by 13 members of the Dutch House of Representatives from both the ruling and opposition parties, including Representative Jan Paternotte of Democrats 66, who is an IPAC cochair for the Netherlands. It marks the third concrete action taken by the Dutch House of Representatives to support Taiwan this year following the adoption of a motion in April backing Taiwan's international participation and another in May urging the Dutch government to pursue a joint effort with the European Union and like-minded European nations to oppose China's military drills around Taiwan and to maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118040	2024-09-13T01:05:00-07:00

MOFA welcomes EU-US joint press release reaffirming importance of cross-strait peace and stability	September 12, 2024 No. 300 European External Action Service Secretary General Stefano Sannino and United States Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell on September 11 issued a joint press release after holding the seventh high-level meeting of the EU-US Dialogue on China and the sixth meeting of the EU-US High-Level Consultations on the Indo-Pacific on September 9 and 10. The two sides underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and stated that this was indispensable to international peace and stability. They also called for the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues through dialogue, expressed opposition to any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force or coercion, urged China to exercise restraint in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan, and conveyed support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. As for security in the Indo-Pacific, both sides expressed serious concern about tensions in the East China Sea and the South China Sea and reiterated their strong opposition to recent actions by China that endanger the safety of life at sea and infringe upon freedom of navigation. They also highlighted their strong commitment to upholding peace, stability, and international law in the Indo-Pacific. The European Union and the United States have been holding high-level meetings of the EU-US Dialogue on China since 2021. Through related joint press releases, they have continued to reiterate great regard for cross-strait peace and stability. This demonstrates that the maintenance of security across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific has become the consensus of the European Union, the United States, and other members of the democratic camp. In facing the recent collusion of authoritarian countries that openly challenge the international order, Taiwan&mdash;a responsible and democratic member of the Indo-Pacific community&mdash;seeks to collaborate with the European Union, the United States, and other like-minded partners to jointly uphold the rules-based international order and defend such shared values as democracy, freedom, and human rights.
