2024 diplomacy review: building a new Taiwan of democracy, peace, and prosperity through integrated diplomacy	December 30, 2024 No. 471 In 2024, the global landscape underwent rapid changes; geopolitical turmoil continued unabated; democracy and authoritarianism remained starkly divided; the Russia-Ukraine war deadlocked; and instability prevailed in the Middle East, the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, and even in the first island chain. All of these events highlighted the increasingly formidable challenges that the world faces from the axis of upheaval. Meanwhile, the Republic of China (Taiwan) successfully completed its eighth presidential election on January 13, another milestone in its democratic advancement. The situation across the Taiwan Strait continued to elicit a high level of international concern, while the Indo-Pacific became pivotal to global strategy. All of these developments were closely intertwined with Taiwan's national security and interests. Diplomats at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and its overseas missions showed resilience and self-confidence. They did their utmost to safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty, dignity, and interests, as well as the Taiwanese people's rights and interests. Building on the excellent foundation laid by steadfast diplomacy over the past eight years, MOFA implemented integrated diplomacy, which aims at realizing values-based diplomacy and transforming Taiwan into a thriving global economic powerhouse as envisioned by President Lai Ching-te. Based on the three pillars of democracy, peace, and prosperity, MOFA fostered cooperation and deepened partnerships. MOFA pursued mutual benefits and coprosperity with diplomatic allies and like-minded nations, demonstrating that Taiwan was a pivotal force for stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and underscoring its value as a global model of freedom and democracy. Democratic Taiwan neither yielded nor provoked, remaining calm and confident. It worked with the global democratic community to respond to threats posed by authoritarian regimes. Taiwan stood firm and resilient against authoritarian expansionism, actively provided international humanitarian assistance during times of crisis, and leveraged its strengths to share prosperity with diplomatic allies and like-minded countries. For its contributions, Taiwan gained worldwide acclaim and recognition from all sectors. With the support of Taiwan's people, MOFA and its overseas missions spared no effort to promote head-of-state diplomacy. In December, President Lai led a delegation to Pacific diplomatic allies the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Palau under the theme &ldquo;Smart and Sustainable Development for a Prosperous Austronesian Region.&rdquo; He achieved the three main objectives of smart sustainability, sustainable democracy, and sustainable diplomatic ties while also making successful US transit stops in Hawaii and Guam. The tour was immensely productive and successfully consolidated international support for Taiwan. It both deepened Taiwan's friendships with allies and launched a new era of values-based diplomacy. In October, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung, serving as special presidential envoy, attended celebrations marking the 45th anniversary of the independence of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. He also visited Guatemala, Saint Lucia, Belize, and Saint Christopher and Nevis, where he witnessed the achievements of values-based diplomacy and economic and trade diplomacy. In addition, he deepened partnerships on the foundations already laid for bilateral cooperation. In November, Minister Lin visited Belgium, where the European Parliament is headquartered, as well as Lithuania and Poland, further enhancing democratic alliances and cooperation as well as economic and trade linkages between Taiwan and Europe. International friendship and support for Taiwan reached new heights this year. Following the successful completion of Taiwan's presidential and legislative elections in January, more than 1,600 prominent political figures from over 100 countries offered congratulations. Taiwan's significant success in diplomacy was substantively reflected through its solid formal alliances, rock-solid partnership with the United States, growing ties with Europe, and steadfast friendship with Japan. Diplomatic allies and like-minded nations spoke in support of Taiwan's international participation and reaffirmed the global consensus on maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. They lauded Taiwan as a force for good that safeguarded democratic values, provided humanitarian assistance, and made concrete contributions. Meanwhile, Taiwan has continued to deploy soft power, pursue public diplomacy, and seek international support. It has integrated resources across ministries, agencies, and departments to bolster its overall diplomatic strength. Furthermore, it has sought to have other countries implement consular measures addressing visas and digital governance to afford greater convenience to Taiwan's people while also promoting closer people-to-people exchanges with other nations. MOFA has devoted a maximum effort to the planning and implementation of the Diplomatic Allies Prosperity Project to deepen substantive relations with allies and like-minded countries. MOFA has formulated eight flagship projects concerning the Five Trusted Industry Sectors, covering semiconductor supply chain resilience, reliable networks and digital governance, new energy and carbon credit cooperation, smart demonstration parks overseas, smart medicine and healthcare, smart agriculture, sovereign AI, and sustainable tourism. Taiwan has brought its industrial strengths to play while integrating the resources of all ministries and agencies. Through the export of smart solutions, Taiwan has stimulated the prosperous development of allies and bolstered democratic supply chains. This has consolidated diplomatic ties and is helping allies enjoy greater prosperity. Taiwan is greeting a new world and the world is greeting a new Taiwan. Not only is this MOFA's mission in its diplomatic work, it is also the stellar outcome of coordinated efforts by the Taiwanese people and related agencies. MOFA has helped to promote the Executive Yuan's economic diplomacy task force and has a strategic team conducting research and administrative work for the task force. This task force facilitates the efficient integration of resources from across ministries, enabling every citizen to be a diplomat and every ministry to serve as a foreign ministry. MOFA will continue to improve the efficiency and quality of its public-facing services so that they have a tangible and positive impact on people's lives. It will work diligently for the dignity, rights, interests, continuity, and development of the nation and people. MOFA will utilize Taiwan's strengths as it connects to the world and work steadily to promote technology diplomacy, human rights diplomacy, cultural diplomacy, urban diplomacy, parliamentary diplomacy, medical and public health diplomacy, environmental diplomacy, sports diplomacy, indigenous diplomacy, religious diplomacy, and gender equality diplomacy. MOFA will help the international community better understand the important role that Taiwan plays. It will live up to the expectations of all sectors as concerns diplomatic efforts. In 2025, the world will usher in a new chapter in geopolitics. With confidence, resilience, and a professional and flexible approach, MOFA will maintain its footing in the new environment. It will leverage Taiwan's strengths; overcome challenges; and amplify the values of democracy, peace, and prosperity. By integrating diplomatic momentum from all sectors, MOFA will continue to contribute to the international community and realize President Lai's policy of values-based diplomacy and vision of Taiwan as a thriving global economic powerhouse. MOFA will demonstrate that Taiwan can help and that Taiwan can lead so that Taiwan continues to serve as a beacon shining far and wide across the globe.

They expressed the wish that the two countries could further engage in reciprocal support and cooperation on the basis of friendship and mutual trust. Lviv is the largest city in western Ukraine. Following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, it has become an important hub for other countries to deliver humanitarian aid to Ukraine as well as a major medical base to which wounded soldiers and patients are transferred for follow-up treatment. On December 27, the Taipei Representative Office (TRO) in Poland, the Lviv city government, and the Multidisciplinary Clinical Hospital of Emergency and Intensive Care signed a memorandum on cooperation and partnership for the reconstruction of the UNBROKEN National Rehabilitation Center in Lviv. The virtual signing ceremony was witnessed by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu. The government of Taiwan will fund the renovation of a rehabilitation facility, which will be named the Taiwan Friendship Building to accentuate Taiwan's donation and friendship. Speaking as Taiwan's representative at the MOU signing ceremony, Deputy Minister Wu stated that postsurgery rehabilitation would be available to military personnel and civilians at the Taiwan Friendship Building in the UNBROKEN center and that the Taiwan government would continue to work with Lviv on the basis of mutual trust and support so as to help Ukraine work toward a brighter future amidst current adversity. Mayor Sadovyy presented a briefing on UNBROKEN's operations and the recovery of those injured. Noting that the rehabilitation facility to be renovated with Taiwan government funding would benefit more Ukrainian patients, he expressed heartfelt appreciation to the government and people of Taiwan. UNBROKEN is a national rehabilitation center supported by Ukraine's Ministry of Health and overseen by the Lviv city government. The center includes a general hospital, a children's hospital, a rehabilitation center, a surgery facility, a prosthetics manufacturing facility, and temporary housing. To date, more than 940,000 Ukrainian patients have received medical treatment at this nationally renowned center. The facility to be renovated with Taiwan's assistance is a seven-story building located in the western part of the center. Once the project is completed, it will be home to specialized departments and provide such diverse medical and rehabilitation services as physical therapy, psychological consultations, and prosthetic fittings. It is expected to have the capacity to serve 13,000 patients simultaneously. (E)	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118892	2024-12-28T01:12:00-08:00

US government officially notifies Taiwan of latest arms sale	December 21, 2024 No. 465 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has received official notification from the United States government that its executive branch has informed Congress of a nearly US$300 million arms sale to Taiwan, to include upgrades to the Link-16 tactical datalink system as well as 76-mm gun mounts and related equipment. MOFA wholeheartedly welcomes this development and thanks the US government for continuing to honor its security commitments to Taiwan as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances. Recently, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken again publicly stressed that Taiwan was not China's business but the world's business. In its Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2024 report, the US Department of Defense explicitly pointed out that China has amplified pressure against Taiwan. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 adopted by the US Congress included a Taiwan security cooperation initiative. This latest round of arms sales to Taiwan is another concrete action demonstrating the high regard and bipartisan support of the US administration and Congress for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung has expressed his appreciation for the supportive comments by the US government and Secretary Blinken. This the 19th arms sale to Taiwan announced during the Biden administration. It continues the US policy of normalized weapons sales to Taiwan, underscores the United States' staunch commitment to and support for bolstering Taiwan's self-defense capabilities and resilience, and ensures that Taiwan has adequate and reliable defense capacity to respond to China's military and gray-zone coercion. MOFA reiterates that in the face of China's threats, Taiwan will fulfill its responsibility to protect its homeland and will continue to demonstrate its determination to defend itself. Through arms purchases from the United States, national defense reforms, enhancement of whole-of-society defense resilience, and other means, Taiwan will bolster its comprehensive defense capabilities and resilience, leverage its strengths to ensure peace, and deepen its close security partnership with the United States.

MOFA response to Australian Foreign Minister Wong thanking Taiwan, US, Japan, and New Zealand for supporting undersea cable project connecting to Tuva...	December 14, 2024 Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong on December 14 posted a message on her X account thanking Taiwan, the United States, Japan, and New Zealand for working with Australia to support the Tuvalu section of the Central Pacific Cable, which made landfall recently. Tuvalu, a diplomatic ally of Taiwan, has for years relied on satellite services for internet connectivity and telecommunications. However, related costs are high, communication stability is vulnerable due to weather-related factors, and insufficient bandwidth seriously impacts overall efficiency. Placing tremendous importance on internet infrastructure, which it regards as a critical domain in national development, on taking office in January the current administration of Tuvalu announced that one of the country's 21 priority plans would be to ensure the quality of internet connectivity. Since 2021, Taiwan has actively assisted in building nationwide 4G/LTE infrastructure in Tuvalu to back local efforts to strengthen internet and communication connectivity. To support the Tuvaluan government's implementation of priority policies and honor Taiwan's commitment to assist in the development of its Pacific allies, Taiwan has for the first time participated in the planning of a Pacific undersea cable installation project alongside the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries. This first undersea cable to connect to Tuvalu recently successfully made landfall. It is expected to significantly enhance Tuvalu's digital resilience and communication efficiency as well as contribute to advancing people's well-being and economic and social development. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomes and appreciates the public expression of gratitude for Taiwan's contributions by Minister Wong, which underscores the close cooperative partnership between Taiwan, Australia, the United States, Japan, and other like-minded countries.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118826	2024-12-14T01:05:00-08:00	
MOFA response to speech by NATO Secretary General Rutte drawing attention to China’s military buildup and bullying of Taiwan	December 14, 2024 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has taken note of a speech delivered by North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Secretary General Mark Rutte at an event in Brussels on December 12 that was organized by the think tank Carnegie Europe. In his remarks, titled &ldquo;To Prevent War, NATO Must Spend More,&rdquo; Secretary General Rutte called on NATO members to shift to a wartime mindset and turbo-charge defense production and defense spending so as to strengthen deterrence and defend their free and democratic way of life. Secretary General Rutte also urged all parties to be clear-eyed about China's ambitions, pointing out that China was substantially building up its forces and bullying Taiwan. In the Q&amp;A session following his speech, Secretary General Rutte said that if Russia were to come out on top in any peace negotiations with Ukraine, China would surely be watching and start nibbling Taiwan. This was the first public speech given by Secretary General Rutte since he assumed the position on October 1. He used the occasion to draw attention to the nature of China's expansionist actions and ambitions toward Taiwan, as well as to the challenges posed by China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran to global peace and security. Indeed, Secretary General Rutte's speech was especially meaningful at a time when authoritarian regimes are expanding their ambitions. Faced with coordinated efforts by authoritarian countries to undermine regional peace and stability and the international order, Taiwan, as a responsible and democratic member of the global community, will continue to work with such like-minded partners as the G7 and NATO in order to jointly safeguard peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and the wider region.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118825	2024-12-13T23:02:00-08:00	
Taiwan donates €4 million to EBRD’s Ukraine Recovery and Reconstruction Guarantee Facility to help revitalize Ukrainian insurance market	December 14, 2024 No. 461 To assist Ukraine in revitalizing its domestic insurance market and to boost international investment interest in Ukraine, Taiwan has agreed to allocate &euro;4 million from the TaiwanBusiness-EBRD Technical Cooperation Fund for the Ukraine Recovery and Reconstruction Guarantee Facility (URGF) initiative led by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The donation agreement was signed in Taipei on December 2 at a ceremony witnessed by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Chung-kwang. It was signed on behalf of Taiwan by Jonathan C. Y. Sun, Director General of the Department of International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and by Director for Donor Partnerships Camilla Otto on behalf of the EBRD. The EBRD held a ceremony to launch the URGF in its London headquarters on December 12, which was attended by Taiwan Representative to the United Kingdom Vincent C. H. Yao. In his remarks at the event, Representative Yao said that Taiwan staunchly supported Ukraine and looked forward to working with like-minded democratic allies to assist in Ukraine's reconstruction through the URGF mechanism. Due to the Russia-Ukraine war, international reinsurance companies have had reservations about providing coverage for businesses operating in Ukraine. The EBRD thus aims to raise &euro;110 million via the URGF mechanism so as to provide additional guarantees for potential losses incurred by war-related risks. This will increase international investor confidence and, in turn, accelerate economic recovery and improve the lives of the Ukrainian people. France, the United Kingdom, Norway, the European Union, and Switzerland have also pledged to donate to the URGF.

Minister Lin also affirmed that Taiwan would continue to work with Poland and other like-minded countries to bolster democratic resilience, deepen Taiwan-Europe economic and trade linkages, and forge resilient democratic supply chains throughout the world. Furthermore, Minister Lin noted that the Polish-Taiwanese Parliamentarian Group released statements in April last year and May this year advocating Taiwan's international participation and expressing concern over peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He thanked friends from the Polish parliament for taking such concrete action in support of Taiwan and added that he looked forward to further collaborating in the future and deepening bilateral interactions and exchanges. In his remarks, Deputy Senate Marshal Kamiński stated that Taiwan and Poland could learn from each other through exchanges in such fields as culture, the economy and trade, science and technology, and academia. He also said that due to Poland's considerable economic development potential, many major Taiwanese enterprises had already invested in Poland, including Chi Mei Frozen Food and Compal, and that he anticipated that even more Taiwanese businesses would seek to develop market opportunities in Poland. Taiwan and Poland share such universal values as freedom and democracy. In the future, the two countries will continue to work closely together to jointly promote prosperity and progress and protect hard-earned democratic achievements.

MOFA response to Czech Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee adopting resolution on China’s misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758	December 13, 2024 The Czech Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee on December 12 adopted a resolution on the misrepresentation of United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 by the People's Republic of China and support for Taiwan's participation in international organizations. In the resolution, the committee opposed China's inappropriate conflation of UNGA Resolution 2758 with its &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; rejected China's claim that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and advocated for Taiwan's international participation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates this support from the Czech Republic. The resolution stated that UNGA Resolution 2758 merely addressed China's representation in the UN; that it did not mention Taiwan or address its political status or participation in the international community; that it did not establish PRC sovereignty over Taiwan; and that it did not make any decision regarding Taiwan's inclusion in the UN or any other international organization. Furthermore, the resolution opposed China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and urged China to respect its content and to stop misusing it for its own political ends. The resolution also endorsed Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations, including the World Health Organization, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the International Civil Aviation Organization, and the International Criminal Police Organization. MOFA thanks the Czech Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee for speaking in favor of justice for Taiwan and urges the international community to continue to take concrete action to counter China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758. Taiwan will continue to work with like-minded partners around the world to jointly safeguard the core values shared by the global democratic community and to preserve regional peace, stability, and prosperity.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118816	2024-12-13T01:36:00-08:00	
MOFA response to Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi expressing strong concern over China’s military exercises around first island chain	December 12, 2024During a regular press conference on December 11, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi stressed that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait were paramount to the security of Japan and the stability of the entire international community. He made the comments in response to the Chinese People's Liberation Army deploying large numbers of naval and coast guard vessels around the first island chain for days-long, large-scale military exercises. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) appreciates and welcomes the Japanese government's public expression of strong support for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi said that the Japanese government had directly conveyed to China its high regard for cross-strait peace at the Japan-China summit in November. He added that Japan would initiate comprehensive countermeasures, further monitor movements in the surrounding waters and airspace, remain alert to subsequent developments, and work closely with the United States and other allies to respond to any situation.Maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is a matter of international consensus. China's large-scale military maritime operations have seriously undermined regional peace and stability.

MOFA responds to China’s military activities around first island chain; urges international community to jointly safeguard cross-strait peace and stab...	December 11, 2024 No. 457 China has recently deployed large numbers of PLA Navy and China Coast Guard vessels around the first island chain for days-long military exercises. It has also repeatedly dispatched military aircraft and vessels to harass Taiwan, unilaterally disrupting peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, unnecessarily escalating regional tensions, and interfering with regular international shipping and trade. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) demands that the Beijing authorities immediately cease their military intimidation and all other unreasonable behavior that is jeopardizing regional peace and stability. An international consensus has been reached on the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region. Although cross-strait and regional developments are closely followed by the international community, China continues to ramp up rhetorical and military intimidation against Taiwan. China's large-scale military buildup around the first island chain has created uncertainty and risk, giving countries in the region cause for concern. This underscores the fact that China is a destabilizing force that is undermining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. China's provocative actions toward Taiwan and other countries in the region are a clear violation of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that all countries must refrain from the threat or use of force to infringe on the territorial sovereignty of another country. MOFA solemnly demands that China immediately stop violating international law and demonstrate that it can be a responsible major power. Taiwan will do its utmost to fulfill its international responsibilities, calmly respond to China's military threats, staunchly safeguard its sovereignty and national security, and firmly defend democracy and freedom. MOFA urges democratic partners worldwide to unite with Taiwan to jointly counter authoritarian expansionism and encroachment, prevent repeated attempts to unilaterally and deliberately disrupt the status quo, uphold the rules-based international order, and together preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific.
