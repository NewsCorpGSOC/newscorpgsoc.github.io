MOFA response to false claims by China’s foreign ministry regarding Taiwan	October 10, 2024 At a regular press conference held on the afternoon of October 10, China's foreign ministry falsely claimed that Taiwan had &ldquo;no so-called sovereignty&rdquo; and urged &ldquo;the few foreign politicians who visit Taiwan to correct their wrong words and deeds.&rdquo; President Lai Ching-te clearly stated in his National Day address on October 10 that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China was subordinate to the other. He also emphasized that Taiwan was willing to work with China to address climate change, combat communicable diseases, and maintain regional security in the pursuit of peace and mutual prosperity for the well-being of both peoples. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reiterates that ideological narratives or threats will neither alter the fact that Taiwan is a democratic country with 23 million peace- and freedom-loving people nor hinder Taiwan from forging closer connections and interactions with the international community. MOFA calls on China to recognize the goodwill that President Lai expressed in his National Day address and squarely face the reality of the situation across the Taiwan Strait. Instead of continuing to cause apprehension and disturbances in the surrounding region, China should attempt to once again align with the rules-based international order so as to contribute to regional peace, stability, prosperity, and positive cross-strait development.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118227	2024-10-11T01:49:00-07:00

MOFA sincerely thanks international community for taking concrete actions to support Taiwan’s UN participation	October 4, 2024No. 058The General Debate of the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) concluded on September 30. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely thanks the diplomatic allies, like-minded countries, and friends from around the world who expressed support for Taiwan's participation in the UN and refuted China's deliberate misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 in various ways, both in the chamber and on the sidelines of the event. High-level government officials from Taiwan's diplomatic allies Paraguay, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Eswatini, Tuvalu, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Belize spoke up for Taiwan at the UN General Debate and Summit of the Future. Officials from the Marshall Islands, Palau, Tuvalu, and Saint Lucia explicitly pointed out that UNGA Resolution 2758 did not preclude Taiwan's participation in the UN system. Following similar remarks in 2022, US President Joe Biden again used his speech to the UN General Debate to spell out the United States' commitment to maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Australia mentioned the Taiwan Strait for the first time at the UN General Debate, with Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong stating that Australia had consistently pressed China on peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. At a US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing held a few days before the UN General Debate, US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell criticized China for using UNGA Resolution 2758 as a diplomatic tool to suppress Taiwan's status. In response to a question in parliament, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Caspar Veldkamp openly acknowledged that the resolution had nothing to do with Taiwan. Following a meeting on the sidelines of the UNGA held by the Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers and the European Union high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, the chair of the meeting released a statement reaffirming the importance of cross-strait peace and stability to international security and prosperity as well as supporting Taiwan's international participation. Joint statements expressing a high regard for cross-strait peace and stability were issued after other recent high-level meetings, including the Quad leaders' summit, the seventh high-level meeting of the EU-US Dialogue on China, the US-Japan summit meeting, the UK-US Strategic Dialogue, the Japan-Australia Foreign and Defence Ministerial Consultations, the Republic of Korea-New Zealand bilateral meeting, and the Lithuania-US Strategic Dialogue on the Indo-Pacific.In terms of legislative branches, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China passed a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 on July 30 for its members' reference. The Australian Senate, the Dutch House of Representatives, and the Guatemalan Congress have since adopted motions in support of Taiwan based on the model resolution. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Italian Chamber of Deputies also approved a resolution backing Taiwan's international participation, demonstrating staunch support for Taiwan.Speaking for the first time on the sidelines of the UNGA at the annual summit of the New York-based nonprofit organization Concordia through prerecorded remarks, President Lai Ching-te told the UN family that Taiwan would strive to maintain regional peace and stability and urged the international community to support Taiwan's participation. Ambassador Alexander Tah-ray Yui, Representative to the United States, held a discussion with former US Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith Krach on cross-strait peace and security and Taiwan's campaign to participate in the UN. During the UNGA, Taiwan cohosted a seminar in New York with the United States, Japan, Australia, and Canada under the Global Cooperation and Training Framework. The event underscored Taiwan's resolve to contribute to the global community.MOFA also appreciates the unwavering support of the Legislative Yuan. A cross-party delegation of legislators&mdash;including Ngalim Tiunn, Wu Tsung-hsien, and Wu Chun-cheng&mdash;visited New York during the UNGA to provide guidance and take part in related activities. The group powerfully conveyed the strong desire of the Taiwanese people to be part of the UN system.Through an international publicity and new media campaign, the government effectively communicated Taiwan's demands for UN participation to all quarters. An op-ed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung, letters to the editor from Taiwan's overseas missions, and interviews with Taiwanese ambassadors and representatives appeared 455 times in mainstream international media outlets. These included the Diplomat, the Hill, the Washington Times, National Review, and the New York Sun in the United States; Modern Diplomacy and the European Business Review in the European Union; the National Post in Canada; Le Figaro in France; Norrbottens-Kuriren in Sweden; La Raz&oacute;n in Spain; De Telegraaf and Nederlands Dagblad in the Netherlands; Euractiv in Greece; Rzeczpospolita in Poland; La Verit&agrave; and Le Formiche in Italy; the Sankei Shimbun in Japan; the Chosun Ilbo in the Republic of Korea; the Philippine Star in the Philippines; the Hindustan Times and the Tribune in India; the Jerusalem Post in Israel; La Raz&oacute;n in Peru; the Eswatini Observer in Eswatini; La Naci&oacute;n in Paraguay; O Tempo in Brazil; Jelen in Hungary; and the Daily News in Thailand. The short promotional film IC You received more than 25.4 million views&mdash;again breaking the record for Taiwan's annual campaign. During the UNGA, MOFA and its overseas missions released 2,922 posts about Taiwan's bid on social media platforms including Facebook, X, Instagram, and Threads. The posts were seen over 48.378 million times and received an unprecedentedly warm response. A short animation video, UNity through Peace: Chip in with Taiwan, was shown on a large billboard in New York City's iconic Times Square. The advertisement featured elements including semiconductor circuits and Taiwan's contributions to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The video conveyed Taiwan's strengths in IC technology, highlighted its image as a responsible member of the global community, and broadened worldwide recognition and support for Taiwan's call for international participation.MOFA reiterates that UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan. The resolution therefore has nothing to do with Taiwan and cannot serve as the basis for precluding Taiwan from the UN system and other international organizations. Taiwan is determined, willing, and able to contribute to the global community. Continuing to exclude Taiwan from multilateral endeavors will not only be a loss to humanity but also detrimental to realizing the SDGs. To uphold the UN principle of leaving no one behind, MOFA again calls on the UN to stop bowing to pressure from China and swiftly allow Taiwan's full participation.

MOFA sincerely congratulates Japanese Representative Ishiba on his election as LDP president	September 27, 2024No. 319 The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan elected Shigeru Ishiba, a member of the House of Representatives, as its new president after two rounds of voting on September 27.

Taiwan expresses deep appreciation for this support. MOFA sincerely hopes that the LDP, under the leadership of President Ishiba, will continue to strengthen cooperation with Taiwan, as well as promoting a comprehensive and substantive bilateral partnership to jointly uphold peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.

MOFA strongly condemns Chinese Foreign Minister Wang for misrepresenting UNGA Resolution 2758 at 79th UNGA session	September 29, 2024No. 322The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for his remarks at the General Debate on September 28 during the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), in which he again falsely claimed that UNGA Resolution 2758 had resolved once and for all the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the UN. MOFA reiterates that the objective status quo across the Taiwan Strait and the internationally recognized reality is that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan; nor does it confirm Taiwan to be a part of the PRC or authorize the PRC to represent Taiwan in the UN. Hence, the resolution has nothing to do with Taiwan and does not address the issue of Taiwan's representation in the UN. MOFA again stresses that only Taiwan's popularly elected government can represent Taiwan in the UN and other international organizations and events.MOFA demands that China stop misleading the international community. It also urges nations worldwide to give due attention to China's mischaracterization of UNGA Resolution 2758, which constitutes a malicious attempt to unilaterally change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and establish a legal basis for the use of force against Taiwan. It calls on the global community to proactively take countermeasures against China's actions and work in concert to safeguard the cross-strait status quo of peace and stability and the rules-based international order.

MOFA response to US State Secretary Blinken reaffirming importance of cross-strait peace and stability in meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang o...	September 28, 2024United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with China Director of the Office of the Chinese Communist Party Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 27. A press release later issued by the US Department of State pointed out that Secretary Blinken had emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait during the meeting. It further stated that he had also raised concerns about China's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea as well as its support for Russia's defense industrial base.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes staunch US support for cross-strait peace and stability and appreciates high-level US officials reaffirming this position during interactions with Chinese counterparts. It also strongly condemns China for continuing to take actions that jeopardize the peaceful status quo at a time when the international community shares collective concerns regarding, and is striving to maintain, regional security and stability.MOFA further notes that in the press release China issued following the meeting, it again made spurious claims about Taiwan and Taiwan's relations with the United States that do not accord with reality. MOFA reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. MOFA also stresses that it is China's relentless intimidation of Taiwan and willful military expansion in the region that pose the greatest risk to regional peace and stability. Furthermore, by accommodating Russia, China has become a key supporter of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the transatlantic region. Its provocative staging of joint military exercises with Russia in the Indo-Pacific also shows that its ambitions have become a major global threat.As President Lai Ching-te pointed out to the international community while addressing a summit held by a nonprofit organization during the UNGA, &ldquo;a stronger Taiwan is better able to promote democracy, peace, and prosperity around the world.&rdquo; He also expressed the sincere hope for &ldquo;Taiwan and other democratic nations to jointly support the democratic umbrella and counter authoritarian aggression.&rdquo; As a responsible member of the global community, Taiwan will steadfastly enhance its defense capabilities and work together with the United States and other like-minded partners to safeguard the rules-based international order and preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118159	2024-09-28T01:48:00-07:00

President Lai and Representative to the US Yui strongly urge international support for Taiwan at Concordia Summit	September 25, 2024 No. 316 Renowned nonprofit organization Concordia held its annual summit in New York from September 23 to 25. At Concordia's invitation, President Lai Ching-te delivered a prerecorded speech at the summit on September 24. He reiterated that neither democratic Taiwan nor authoritarian China was subordinate to the other. He also condemned China for maliciously distorting United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 and inappropriately conflating the resolution with its &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; thereby depriving Taiwan of the right to participate in the United Nations and other international fora. President Lai further emphasized that Taiwan was actively implementing the Four Pillars of Peace action plan. He said that without yielding or provoking, Taiwan would maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and do its utmost to preserve regional peace and stability. He expressed the hope that more countries would support and walk together with democratic Taiwan on the path of prosperity. During the summit, Ambassador Alexander Tah-ray Yui, Representative to the United States, held a discussion with former US Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith Krach on &ldquo;Taiwan's Democratic Resolve: Shaping Global Security and Peace Through Strategic Cooperation.&rdquo; Ambassador Yui stressed that maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait was an indispensable element in global prosperity and economic growth. He also noted that China's continuous deployment of gray-zone tactics such as economic coercion and cognitive warfare to intimidate Taiwan not only threatened cross-strait peace and stability and global security and development but also undermined the rules-based international order. He said that democratic countries must work in solidarity to deter authoritarian expansion. Pointing out that Taiwan supplies more than 90 percent of the world's most advanced semiconductors, Ambassador Yui said that the Taiwan Strait was an important route for international trade and that Taiwan was an indispensable partner for building sustainable supply chains and a digital future, as well as for promoting global prosperity and development. He urged the international community to give due attention to the gravity of Taiwan's exclusion from the UN system and other international organizations and to proactively incorporate Taiwan's professional expertise and contributions into global sustainable development plans. He said that this would be truly in line with the UN commitment to leave no one behind. Since its establishment in 2011, Concordia has made significant efforts to foster influential cross-sector public-private partnerships, gaining prominence in the UN community in New York. The Concordia Annual Summit has been held during the UNGA in September for 13 consecutive years and had US President Joe Biden, UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, and former President Tsai Ing-wen among its keynote speakers.

MOFA response to US President Biden and Australian Prime Minister Albanese conveying high regard for peace and stability across Taiwan Strait	September 21, 2024 US President Joe Biden met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on September 20 in the US state of Delaware. Following the meeting, the White House published a readout stating that the two leaders had discussed their support for maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait; their concerns about the coercive and destabilizing activities of the People's Republic of China, including in the South China Sea; and the commitment of the United States and Australia to promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable. Following the public expression of strong, all-round support for Taiwan in the joint statement on the Australia-US Ministerial Consultations in August, the readout of the meeting between the two leaders once again demonstrates both countries' high regard for maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sincerely appreciates and welcomes this. The United States, Australia, and other like-minded nations continue to frequently issue statements to express a joint position regarding peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, fully demonstrating that the safeguarding of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait has become an international consensus. As a responsible member of the Indo-Pacific region, Taiwan will continue to work with like-minded nations to defend the common values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law; preserve the rules-based international order; and uphold peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118097	2024-09-21T00:02:00-07:00
