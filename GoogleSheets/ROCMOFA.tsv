MOFA response to public comments by US Deputy Secretary of State Campbell on UNGA Resolution 2758 and cross-strait peace and stability	September 20, 2024 The US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs held a hearing on &ldquo;Great Power Competition in the Indo-Pacific&rdquo; on September 18. In response to a question concerning the fact that Taiwan's status was not mentioned in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758, US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell agreed, pointing out that China was using the resolution as a diplomatic tool to falsely portray Taiwan's status as illegitimate and that China was conflating its interpretation with its &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo; in order to suppress Taiwan. Deputy Secretary Campbell reaffirmed the unwavering US commitment to Taiwan and the long-standing US efforts to preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, emphasizing that this was a bipartisan consensus. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes and appreciates that yet another high-level US diplomat has publicly pointed out China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and reiterated bipartisan US support for maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The comments follow remarks made earlier by US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Mark Lambert and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink. MOFA is pleased that in addition to the United States, like-minded nations including Australia and the Netherlands have adopted friendly resolutions or motions stating that UNGA Resolution 2758 made no reference to Taiwan. MOFA calls on the international community to jointly take concrete actions to refute China's misrepresentation of the resolution and oppose its spurious claims of there being an international consensus on its &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Taiwan will continue to cooperate with the United States and other like-minded countries and together preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118084	2024-09-20T01:53:00-07:00	
US government officially notifies Taiwan of latest arms sale	September 17, 2024 No. 308 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has received official notification from the United States government that the executive branch has informed Congress of a US$228 million sale to Taiwan for the return, repair, and reshipment of spare parts and related equipment. MOFA highly welcomes this news and thanks the US government for continuing to honor its security commitments as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances. This is the 16th arms sale to Taiwan made by the administration of President Joe Biden since he took office in 2021. It continues the US policy in recent years of normalized arms sales to Taiwan and highlights the rock-solid US security commitment to Taiwan. The announcement also demonstrates the US government's strong support for enhancing Taiwan's defense capabilities and its high regard for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Given China's frequent use of gray-zone tactics to intimidate and coerce Taiwan and other countries in the region, Taiwan will continue to show its determination to protect the nation. It will enhance its self-defense capabilities and asymmetric warfighting capacity while staunchly upholding its people's well-being and free and democratic way of life. It will also further deepen the close Taiwan-US security partnership so as to jointly safeguard the rules-based international order and advance peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the Indo-Pacific region.

Minister Lin stated that with China and other authoritarian countries persistently challenging the rules-based international order, democratic partners should work in solidarity to enhance economic and social resilience. He reiterated Taiwan's willingness to share with European partners its experience in countering China's hybrid warfare, information warfare, and economic coercion. Minister Lin also affirmed the recent transit of German vessels through the Taiwan Strait so as to safeguard freedom of navigation, adding that he was pleased that Germany and the EU were implementing de-risking policies. Noting that an investment project in Dresden by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company had set a new milestone in bilateral cooperation, Minister Lin expressed the hope that Taiwan and Germany would steadily bolster economic and trade cooperation and jointly strengthen economic resilience. Mr. M&uuml;ller and Mr. Larem strongly concurred on the importance of democratic partners standing in unity against authoritarian expansion. Calling for enhanced cooperation among democracies in such domains as the economy, technology, and culture, they said they looked forward to deeper substantive collaboration between Taiwan and Germany. Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu also hosted a luncheon for the delegation on the same day. During the luncheon, Deputy Minister Wu pointed out that China's authoritarian expansionist ambitions were not purely a cross-strait issue but rather represented a grave challenge to the international order. He said that Taiwan sincerely hoped to work with like-minded European partners to contribute to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. This was the first visit to Taiwan by all delegation members. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs looks forward to Taiwan and Germany building on their strong existing foundations to further deepen bilateral ties and jointly advance global peace, stability, and prosperity.

An eight-member delegation from Tuvalu led by Speaker of the Tuvaluan Parliament Sir Iakoba Taeia Italeli and his wife attended the event. In his remarks, Minister Lin welcomed Speaker Italeli on behalf of the government of Taiwan. He noted that Tuvalu was Taiwan's longest-standing Pacific ally. Since establishing their diplomatic alliance in 1979, the two nations had realized remarkable achievements in bilateral cooperation in such areas as agriculture, fisheries, public health and medicine, clean energy and climate change, and ICT.

MOFA response to Dutch House of Representatives passing Taiwan-friendly motion on UNGA Resolution 2758 and Taiwan’s international participation	September 13, 2024 The House of Representatives of the Netherlands on September 12 adopted a Taiwan-friendly motion stating that United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 did not rule that the People's Republic of China (PRC) enjoyed sovereignty over Taiwan and that it did not make any judgment on Taiwan's participation in the UN or other international organizations. The motion was passed by an overwhelming majority, with 147 of 150 members voting in favor. It was highly significant that the motion was approved while the 79th session of the UNGA was being convened. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates the passage of the motion. The motion also noted that UNGA Resolution 2758 was being used by the PRC to block Taiwan's international engagement and that the Netherlands also had an interest in Taiwan's participation in such organizations as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the World Health Organization. After the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) adopted a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 for its members' reference at its annual summit in July and the subsequent passage of a related motion by the Australian Senate, the passage of this motion by the Dutch House of Representatives makes the Netherlands the second country in the world and the first in Europe to adopt a similar measure. The Taiwan-friendly motion was jointly proposed by 13 members of the Dutch House of Representatives from both the ruling and opposition parties, including Representative Jan Paternotte of Democrats 66, who is an IPAC cochair for the Netherlands. It marks the third concrete action taken by the Dutch House of Representatives to support Taiwan this year following the adoption of a motion in April backing Taiwan's international participation and another in May urging the Dutch government to pursue a joint effort with the European Union and like-minded European nations to oppose China's military drills around Taiwan and to maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118040	2024-09-13T01:05:00-07:00

MOFA welcomes EU-US joint press release reaffirming importance of cross-strait peace and stability	September 12, 2024 No. 300 European External Action Service Secretary General Stefano Sannino and United States Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell on September 11 issued a joint press release after holding the seventh high-level meeting of the EU-US Dialogue on China and the sixth meeting of the EU-US High-Level Consultations on the Indo-Pacific on September 9 and 10. The two sides underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and stated that this was indispensable to international peace and stability. They also called for the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues through dialogue, expressed opposition to any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force or coercion, urged China to exercise restraint in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan, and conveyed support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. As for security in the Indo-Pacific, both sides expressed serious concern about tensions in the East China Sea and the South China Sea and reiterated their strong opposition to recent actions by China that endanger the safety of life at sea and infringe upon freedom of navigation. They also highlighted their strong commitment to upholding peace, stability, and international law in the Indo-Pacific. The European Union and the United States have been holding high-level meetings of the EU-US Dialogue on China since 2021. Through related joint press releases, they have continued to reiterate great regard for cross-strait peace and stability. This demonstrates that the maintenance of security across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific has become the consensus of the European Union, the United States, and other members of the democratic camp. In facing the recent collusion of authoritarian countries that openly challenge the international order, Taiwan&mdash;a responsible and democratic member of the Indo-Pacific community&mdash;seeks to collaborate with the European Union, the United States, and other like-minded partners to jointly uphold the rules-based international order and defend such shared values as democracy, freedom, and human rights.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint statement between PRC and South Africa	September 4, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping on September 2 met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who was in Beijing to attend the summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. After the meeting, they issued the Joint Statement between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of South Africa on the Establishment of an All-Round Strategic Cooperative Partnership in a New Era. The statement included such false claims as Taiwan being an inalienable part of China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns China for repeatedly using meetings with other countries' leaders and large international conferences it organizes to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA solemnly reiterates that it has always been an undeniable fact that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; that the PRC has never governed Taiwan; and that no country can or has the right to deny this objective reality through a joint statement. Taiwan staunchly upholds the ideals of democracy and freedom, never wavering in the face of political coercion and diplomatic suppression by China. With a focus on democracy, peace, and freedom, it will continue to enhance cooperation with like-minded partners, ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and deepen exchanges with all countries.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117999	2024-09-04T00:21:00-07:00	
Taiwan’s 2024 UN bid aims to refute distortion and misapplication of UNGA Resolution 2758	September 3, 2024 No. 289 The 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) will commence at UN headquarters in New York on September 10. The UN General Debate will be held from September 24 to 28 and on September 30. The theme of this year's General Debate is &ldquo;leaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations.&rdquo; Ironically, however, the 23.5 million people of Taiwan continue to be left behind by the UN system. This grave injustice is due mainly to China's malicious misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758; China's attempts to mislead the international community into accepting that the resolution is equivalent to the so-called &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo;; and China's spurious claims that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China and that Resolution 2758 has authorized the PRC to represent Taiwan in the UN system. In effect, China is seeking to establish a legal basis to undermine the objective reality that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign nation and divest Taiwan of its legitimate right to pursue participation in the UN system. In the face of China's cognitive warfare, prompt rebuttals and clarifications must be issued. Otherwise, the objective status quo across the Taiwan Strait&mdash;in which neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other&mdash;will utterly change, allowing China to lay a legal foundation for an armed invasion of Taiwan. The international community would then lose its legitimate right to assist Taiwan in accordance with the UN Charter, which calls for maintaining international peace and security and resolving international disputes through peaceful means. Therefore, Taiwan's bid to participate in the United Nations this year is focused on enhancing international understanding of UNGA Resolution 2758. The government hopes to make clear that the resolution does not mention Taiwan and thus has nothing to do with Taiwan. Moreover, the resolution neither states that Taiwan is part of China&mdash;as the PRC falsely claims&mdash;nor gives China the right to represent Taiwan in the United Nations. Taiwan's 2024 campaign for UN participation comprises three main issues. 1. The malicious distortion of UNGA Resolution 2758 has become a serious threat to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. The United Nations must take action to address it. 2. UNGA Resolution 2758 does not preclude Taiwan's meaningful participation in the UN system. The United Nations must seek suitable ways of including Taiwan so that Taiwan can better contribute to realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 3. The UN Secretariat must adopt a strictly neutral stance and stop erroneously citing UNGA Resolution 2758. It must also grant Taiwanese nationals and journalists the right to access UN premises for visits, meetings, and newsgathering activities. Over the past eight years, the Taiwan government's stable and steadfast approach to promoting its UN campaigns has received international recognition and encouraged ever more like-minded countries to support its efforts to increase global engagement. Following careful deliberations and considering this past success, the government has again decided to ask permanent representatives to the United Nations from Taiwan's diplomatic allies to write a joint letter to UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres. Officials from diplomatic allies have also been urged to speak up for Taiwan during the General Debate and other UNGA events. To communicate Taiwan's UN bid to the global community directly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung wrote an op-ed entitled &ldquo;To secure peace in the Indo-Pacific, include Taiwan in the UN system.&rdquo; The op-ed has been published in media outlets around the world. The logo and short film for Taiwan's UN campaign this year center on semiconductors and peace, highlighting Taiwan's leading role in global semiconductor supply chains and its strong determination to pursue peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. These efforts aim to foster understanding worldwide that Taiwan&mdash;as a responsible member of the international community&mdash;will implement the Four Pillars of Peace action plan proposed by President Lai Ching-te. Taiwan will continue working with democratic partners to create sustainable supply chains for democracy chips and to advance global prosperity and development. In terms of cross-strait relations, Taiwan will neither yield nor provoke but will maintain the status quo and do its part to ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. During the UNGA, the government will hold related side events and activities in New York to promote a positive image of Taiwan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely thanks legislators from the governing and opposition parties for once again organizing a cross-party delegation to provide guidance in New York. The delegation will explain to the UN community that the prevailing opinion among Taiwan's 23.5 million people is a strong desire for equal participation in the UN system. The United Nations belongs to all humanity. The UN Charter explicitly states that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to develop friendly relations among countries based on respect for the principle of equal rights of peoples. Yet, the United Nations has continued to succumb to pressure from China, ignore the Taiwanese people's legitimate right to UN participation, echo China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758, and thereby seek to rationalize the wrongful and illegitimate exclusion of the Taiwanese people. MOFA deeply regrets the United Nations' actions and expresses its strong displeasure. MOFA extends appreciation to the US government for making a four-point public rebuttal in April regarding the misapplication of UNGA Resolution 2758. It also thanks the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China for adopting a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 in July that could serve as reference for IPAC members when introducing related motions in their respective parliaments. In August, the Australian Senate became the first national parliament to pass such a motion, repudiating the misuse of UNGA Resolution 2758. Moving forward, Taiwan firmly believes that even more countries will stand up and call for justice for Taiwan. To safeguard the Taiwanese people's basic human right to international engagement, the government has campaigned persistently for UN participation since 1993. However, due to China's unreasonable and heavy-handed interference, as well as the UN's blind capitulation to China's pressure, Taiwan has encountered countless difficulties and challenges to its UN bids. Despite this, the Taiwan government has never abandoned its efforts and never will&mdash;it will continue to seek international support. Taiwan once again reminds the United Nations that only by accepting Taiwan's full participation can the world achieve peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future generations.
