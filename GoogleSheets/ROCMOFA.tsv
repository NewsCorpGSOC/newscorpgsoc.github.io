MOFA response to Australian Foreign Minister Wong thanking Taiwan, US, Japan, and New Zealand for supporting undersea cable project connecting to Tuva...	December 14, 2024 Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong on December 14 posted a message on her X account thanking Taiwan, the United States, Japan, and New Zealand for working with Australia to support the Tuvalu section of the Central Pacific Cable, which made landfall recently. Tuvalu, a diplomatic ally of Taiwan, has for years relied on satellite services for internet connectivity and telecommunications. However, related costs are high, communication stability is vulnerable due to weather-related factors, and insufficient bandwidth seriously impacts overall efficiency. Placing tremendous importance on internet infrastructure, which it regards as a critical domain in national development, on taking office in January the current administration of Tuvalu announced that one of the country's 21 priority plans would be to ensure the quality of internet connectivity. Since 2021, Taiwan has actively assisted in building nationwide 4G/LTE infrastructure in Tuvalu to back local efforts to strengthen internet and communication connectivity. To support the Tuvaluan government's implementation of priority policies and honor Taiwan's commitment to assist in the development of its Pacific allies, Taiwan has for the first time participated in the planning of a Pacific undersea cable installation project alongside the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries. This first undersea cable to connect to Tuvalu recently successfully made landfall. It is expected to significantly enhance Tuvalu's digital resilience and communication efficiency as well as contribute to advancing people's well-being and economic and social development. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomes and appreciates the public expression of gratitude for Taiwan's contributions by Minister Wong, which underscores the close cooperative partnership between Taiwan, Australia, the United States, Japan, and other like-minded countries.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118826	2024-12-14T01:05:00-08:00	
MOFA response to speech by NATO Secretary General Rutte drawing attention to China’s military buildup and bullying of Taiwan	December 14, 2024 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has taken note of a speech delivered by North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Secretary General Mark Rutte at an event in Brussels on December 12 that was organized by the think tank Carnegie Europe. In his remarks, titled &ldquo;To Prevent War, NATO Must Spend More,&rdquo; Secretary General Rutte called on NATO members to shift to a wartime mindset and turbo-charge defense production and defense spending so as to strengthen deterrence and defend their free and democratic way of life. Secretary General Rutte also urged all parties to be clear-eyed about China's ambitions, pointing out that China was substantially building up its forces and bullying Taiwan. In the Q&amp;A session following his speech, Secretary General Rutte said that if Russia were to come out on top in any peace negotiations with Ukraine, China would surely be watching and start nibbling Taiwan. This was the first public speech given by Secretary General Rutte since he assumed the position on October 1. He used the occasion to draw attention to the nature of China's expansionist actions and ambitions toward Taiwan, as well as to the challenges posed by China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran to global peace and security. Indeed, Secretary General Rutte's speech was especially meaningful at a time when authoritarian regimes are expanding their ambitions. Faced with coordinated efforts by authoritarian countries to undermine regional peace and stability and the international order, Taiwan, as a responsible and democratic member of the global community, will continue to work with such like-minded partners as the G7 and NATO in order to jointly safeguard peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and the wider region.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118825	2024-12-13T23:02:00-08:00	
Taiwan donates €4 million to EBRD’s Ukraine Recovery and Reconstruction Guarantee Facility to help revitalize Ukrainian insurance market	December 14, 2024 No. 461 To assist Ukraine in revitalizing its domestic insurance market and to boost international investment interest in Ukraine, Taiwan has agreed to allocate &euro;4 million from the TaiwanBusiness-EBRD Technical Cooperation Fund for the Ukraine Recovery and Reconstruction Guarantee Facility (URGF) initiative led by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The donation agreement was signed in Taipei on December 2 at a ceremony witnessed by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Chung-kwang. It was signed on behalf of Taiwan by Jonathan C. Y. Sun, Director General of the Department of International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and by Director for Donor Partnerships Camilla Otto on behalf of the EBRD. The EBRD held a ceremony to launch the URGF in its London headquarters on December 12, which was attended by Taiwan Representative to the United Kingdom Vincent C. H. Yao. In his remarks at the event, Representative Yao said that Taiwan staunchly supported Ukraine and looked forward to working with like-minded democratic allies to assist in Ukraine's reconstruction through the URGF mechanism. Due to the Russia-Ukraine war, international reinsurance companies have had reservations about providing coverage for businesses operating in Ukraine. The EBRD thus aims to raise &euro;110 million via the URGF mechanism so as to provide additional guarantees for potential losses incurred by war-related risks. This will increase international investor confidence and, in turn, accelerate economic recovery and improve the lives of the Ukrainian people. France, the United Kingdom, Norway, the European Union, and Switzerland have also pledged to donate to the URGF.

During the event, the two sides exchanged views on regional developments, Taiwan-Poland relations, and economic and trade exchanges. Minister Lin pointed out that both Taiwan and Poland had previously gone through periods of authoritarian rule but had since chosen the path of democracy. He remarked that bilateral relations had steadily advanced in recent years in such areas as the economy, trade, higher education, law enforcement, and science and technology. Minister Lin also affirmed that Taiwan would continue to work with Poland and other like-minded countries to bolster democratic resilience, deepen Taiwan-Europe economic and trade linkages, and forge resilient democratic supply chains throughout the world. Furthermore, Minister Lin noted that the Polish-Taiwanese Parliamentarian Group released statements in April last year and May this year advocating Taiwan's international participation and expressing concern over peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He thanked friends from the Polish parliament for taking such concrete action in support of Taiwan and added that he looked forward to further collaborating in the future and deepening bilateral interactions and exchanges. In his remarks, Deputy Senate Marshal Kamiński stated that Taiwan and Poland could learn from each other through exchanges in such fields as culture, the economy and trade, science and technology, and academia. He also said that due to Poland's considerable economic development potential, many major Taiwanese enterprises had already invested in Poland, including Chi Mei Frozen Food and Compal, and that he anticipated that even more Taiwanese businesses would seek to develop market opportunities in Poland. Taiwan and Poland share such universal values as freedom and democracy. In the future, the two countries will continue to work closely together to jointly promote prosperity and progress and protect hard-earned democratic achievements.

MOFA response to Czech Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee adopting resolution on China’s misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758	December 13, 2024 The Czech Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee on December 12 adopted a resolution on the misrepresentation of United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 by the People's Republic of China and support for Taiwan's participation in international organizations. In the resolution, the committee opposed China's inappropriate conflation of UNGA Resolution 2758 with its &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; rejected China's claim that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and advocated for Taiwan's international participation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates this support from the Czech Republic. The resolution stated that UNGA Resolution 2758 merely addressed China's representation in the UN; that it did not mention Taiwan or address its political status or participation in the international community; that it did not establish PRC sovereignty over Taiwan; and that it did not make any decision regarding Taiwan's inclusion in the UN or any other international organization. Furthermore, the resolution opposed China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and urged China to respect its content and to stop misusing it for its own political ends. The resolution also endorsed Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations, including the World Health Organization, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the International Civil Aviation Organization, and the International Criminal Police Organization. MOFA thanks the Czech Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee for speaking in favor of justice for Taiwan and urges the international community to continue to take concrete action to counter China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758. Taiwan will continue to work with like-minded partners around the world to jointly safeguard the core values shared by the global democratic community and to preserve regional peace, stability, and prosperity.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118816	2024-12-13T01:36:00-08:00	
MOFA response to Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi expressing strong concern over China’s military exercises around first island chain	December 12, 2024During a regular press conference on December 11, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi stressed that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait were paramount to the security of Japan and the stability of the entire international community. He made the comments in response to the Chinese People's Liberation Army deploying large numbers of naval and coast guard vessels around the first island chain for days-long, large-scale military exercises. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) appreciates and welcomes the Japanese government's public expression of strong support for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi said that the Japanese government had directly conveyed to China its high regard for cross-strait peace at the Japan-China summit in November. He added that Japan would initiate comprehensive countermeasures, further monitor movements in the surrounding waters and airspace, remain alert to subsequent developments, and work closely with the United States and other allies to respond to any situation.Maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is a matter of international consensus. China's large-scale military maritime operations have seriously undermined regional peace and stability. MOFA again calls on China to exercise reason and self-restraint and cease all actions that threaten Taiwan and escalate tensions in the region.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118818	2024-12-12T02:32:00-08:00

MOFA responds to China’s military activities around first island chain; urges international community to jointly safeguard cross-strait peace and stab...	December 11, 2024 No. 457 China has recently deployed large numbers of PLA Navy and China Coast Guard vessels around the first island chain for days-long military exercises. It has also repeatedly dispatched military aircraft and vessels to harass Taiwan, unilaterally disrupting peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, unnecessarily escalating regional tensions, and interfering with regular international shipping and trade. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) demands that the Beijing authorities immediately cease their military intimidation and all other unreasonable behavior that is jeopardizing regional peace and stability. An international consensus has been reached on the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region. Although cross-strait and regional developments are closely followed by the international community, China continues to ramp up rhetorical and military intimidation against Taiwan. China's large-scale military buildup around the first island chain has created uncertainty and risk, giving countries in the region cause for concern. This underscores the fact that China is a destabilizing force that is undermining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. China's provocative actions toward Taiwan and other countries in the region are a clear violation of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that all countries must refrain from the threat or use of force to infringe on the territorial sovereignty of another country. MOFA solemnly demands that China immediately stop violating international law and demonstrate that it can be a responsible major power. Taiwan will do its utmost to fulfill its international responsibilities, calmly respond to China's military threats, staunchly safeguard its sovereignty and national security, and firmly defend democracy and freedom. MOFA urges democratic partners worldwide to unite with Taiwan to jointly counter authoritarian expansionism and encroachment, prevent repeated attempts to unilaterally and deliberately disrupt the status quo, uphold the rules-based international order, and together preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific.

In the joint statement issued after the meeting, they reiterated the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, opposed unilateral changes to the status quo, and expressed concern over the situation in the South China Sea. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes and appreciates this statement. Australia and New Zealand are important friends of Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific region, and bilateral relations with both countries have made significant strides in recent years. Given that maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea has become a global consensus, MOFA invites the international community to continue expressing its concerns and take practical action to uphold the rules-based international order. The Taiwan government will continue to promote values-based diplomacy and work with like-minded countries to advance democracy, peace, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.

MOFA again thanks the US government for continuing to staunchly fulfill its security commitments to Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances.

A renowned multilateral development bank with an excellent credit rating, it assists countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, West Asia, North Africa, and other regions in gradually transitioning to market economies and democratic and pluralistic societies. Taiwan is an important cooperation partner of the EBRD. In 2006, it established the TaiwanBusiness-EBRD Technical Cooperation Fund, which has since helped finance over 400 EBRD projects. Taiwan proactively supports EBRD efforts to promote socioeconomic development in beneficiary countries and creates business opportunities for Taiwanese companies, achieving win-win outcomes.

MOFA response to Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declaring firm opposition to President Lai’s US transit stop	December 1, 2024 In response to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declaring firm opposition to Republic of China (Taiwan) President Lai Ching-te making a transit stop in the United States, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reiterates that the ROC (Taiwan) is an independent and sovereign nation; that neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; and that the PRC has never governed Taiwan for a single day. President Lai's stopover in the United States en route to Pacific allies to consolidate friendships is in accordance with customary practice and is an exercise of the legitimate rights of a sovereign nation. MOFA underlines that transit stops made by ROC (Taiwan) presidents are arranged pursuant to long-standing practice. The United States has followed this practice by extending assistance in accordance with the principles of safety, dignity, convenience, and comfort. MOFA thanks the United States for its assistance, which demonstrates that Taiwan-US relations are closer and more cordial than ever before. MOFA further asserts that any overreaction by China to the president of the ROC (Taiwan) conducting normal travel duties would represent an irresponsible attempt to damage regional peace and stability and be subject to the condemnation of the international community.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118745	2024-12-01T04:43:00-08:00

This is the 18th arms sale to Taiwan announced during the Biden administration. It continues the US policy of normalized arms sales that ensure Taiwan has adequate self-defense capabilities and reliable defense capacity in response to China's threats. The sale highlights the US government's firm support for bolstering Taiwan's defense resilience and its high regard for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan will continue to demonstrate its commitment to self-defense in response to China's recurrent military pressure and gray-zone intrusion in the waters and airspace around Taiwan. It will strengthen national defense and whole-of-society resilience, staunchly defend its free and democratic way of life, seek peace through strength, and deepen its close security partnership with the United States. MOFA welcomes further concrete action by the United States and other like-minded partners that advances peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the Indo-Pacific.
