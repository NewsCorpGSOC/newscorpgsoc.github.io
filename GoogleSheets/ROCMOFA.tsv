MOFA strongly condemns Chinese Foreign Minister Wang for misrepresenting UNGA Resolution 2758 at 79th UNGA session	September 29, 2024No. 322The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi for his remarks at the General Debate on September 28 during the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), in which he again falsely claimed that UNGA Resolution 2758 had resolved once and for all the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the UN. MOFA reiterates that the objective status quo across the Taiwan Strait and the internationally recognized reality is that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan; nor does it confirm Taiwan to be a part of the PRC or authorize the PRC to represent Taiwan in the UN. Hence, the resolution has nothing to do with Taiwan and does not address the issue of Taiwan's representation in the UN. MOFA again stresses that only Taiwan's popularly elected government can represent Taiwan in the UN and other international organizations and events.MOFA demands that China stop misleading the international community. It also urges nations worldwide to give due attention to China's mischaracterization of UNGA Resolution 2758, which constitutes a malicious attempt to unilaterally change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and establish a legal basis for the use of force against Taiwan. It calls on the global community to proactively take countermeasures against China's actions and work in concert to safeguard the cross-strait status quo of peace and stability and the rules-based international order.

MOFA response to US State Secretary Blinken reaffirming importance of cross-strait peace and stability in meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang o...	September 28, 2024United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with China Director of the Office of the Chinese Communist Party Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 27. A press release later issued by the US Department of State pointed out that Secretary Blinken had emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait during the meeting. It further stated that he had also raised concerns about China's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea as well as its support for Russia's defense industrial base.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes staunch US support for cross-strait peace and stability and appreciates high-level US officials reaffirming this position during interactions with Chinese counterparts. It also strongly condemns China for continuing to take actions that jeopardize the peaceful status quo at a time when the international community shares collective concerns regarding, and is striving to maintain, regional security and stability.MOFA further notes that in the press release China issued following the meeting, it again made spurious claims about Taiwan and Taiwan's relations with the United States that do not accord with reality. MOFA reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. MOFA also stresses that it is China's relentless intimidation of Taiwan and willful military expansion in the region that pose the greatest risk to regional peace and stability. Furthermore, by accommodating Russia, China has become a key supporter of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the transatlantic region. Its provocative staging of joint military exercises with Russia in the Indo-Pacific also shows that its ambitions have become a major global threat.As President Lai Ching-te pointed out to the international community while addressing a summit held by a nonprofit organization during the UNGA, &ldquo;a stronger Taiwan is better able to promote democracy, peace, and prosperity around the world.&rdquo; He also expressed the sincere hope for &ldquo;Taiwan and other democratic nations to jointly support the democratic umbrella and counter authoritarian aggression.&rdquo; As a responsible member of the global community, Taiwan will steadfastly enhance its defense capabilities and work together with the United States and other like-minded partners to safeguard the rules-based international order and preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118159	2024-09-28T01:48:00-07:00

President Lai and Representative to the US Yui strongly urge international support for Taiwan at Concordia Summit	September 25, 2024 No. 316 Renowned nonprofit organization Concordia held its annual summit in New York from September 23 to 25. At Concordia's invitation, President Lai Ching-te delivered a prerecorded speech at the summit on September 24. He reiterated that neither democratic Taiwan nor authoritarian China was subordinate to the other. He also condemned China for maliciously distorting United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 and inappropriately conflating the resolution with its &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; thereby depriving Taiwan of the right to participate in the United Nations and other international fora. President Lai further emphasized that Taiwan was actively implementing the Four Pillars of Peace action plan. He said that without yielding or provoking, Taiwan would maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and do its utmost to preserve regional peace and stability. He expressed the hope that more countries would support and walk together with democratic Taiwan on the path of prosperity. During the summit, Ambassador Alexander Tah-ray Yui, Representative to the United States, held a discussion with former US Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith Krach on &ldquo;Taiwan's Democratic Resolve: Shaping Global Security and Peace Through Strategic Cooperation.&rdquo; Ambassador Yui stressed that maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait was an indispensable element in global prosperity and economic growth. He also noted that China's continuous deployment of gray-zone tactics such as economic coercion and cognitive warfare to intimidate Taiwan not only threatened cross-strait peace and stability and global security and development but also undermined the rules-based international order. He said that democratic countries must work in solidarity to deter authoritarian expansion. Pointing out that Taiwan supplies more than 90 percent of the world's most advanced semiconductors, Ambassador Yui said that the Taiwan Strait was an important route for international trade and that Taiwan was an indispensable partner for building sustainable supply chains and a digital future, as well as for promoting global prosperity and development. He urged the international community to give due attention to the gravity of Taiwan's exclusion from the UN system and other international organizations and to proactively incorporate Taiwan's professional expertise and contributions into global sustainable development plans. He said that this would be truly in line with the UN commitment to leave no one behind. Since its establishment in 2011, Concordia has made significant efforts to foster influential cross-sector public-private partnerships, gaining prominence in the UN community in New York. The Concordia Annual Summit has been held during the UNGA in September for 13 consecutive years and had US President Joe Biden, UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, and former President Tsai Ing-wen among its keynote speakers.

MOFA thanks allies’ permanent representatives to UN for refuting misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and supporting Taiwan’s participation	September 20, 2024No. 310 In a firm demonstration of support for Taiwan's efforts to participate in the United Nations system, the permanent representatives to the UN of nine diplomatic allies sent a joint letter to UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres strongly refuting the misrepresentation and misapplication of UN General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758. The allies were Belize, Eswatini, Guatemala, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tuvalu. Paraguay also sent an individual letter backing Taiwan's UN bid. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely appreciates the warmth of support from Taiwan's diplomatic allies. The permanent representatives to the UN of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Palau, Guatemala, Tuvalu, and the Marshall Islands presented the joint letter to the UN Secretariat on September 19 before speaking to reporters in front of the UN headquarters to demand that the UN stop excluding Taiwan.The joint letter stressed three main points. First, it called on the UN to recognize and take action to address malicious distortions of UNGA Resolution 2758, which constitute a serious threat to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. Second, given that UNGA Resolution 2758 does not preclude Taiwan's meaningful engagement in the UN system, the letter urged the UN to seek appropriate means to allow Taiwan to participate and further contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Third, it called on the UN to remain strictly neutral, stop erroneously citing UNGA Resolution 2758, and cease inappropriately depriving Taiwanese nationals and journalists of the right to enter UN premises for visits, meetings, and newsgathering activities.MOFA reiterates that UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention and therefore has nothing to do with Taiwan. The resolution neither reflects nor equates to China's &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; nor does it block Taiwan from participating in the UN system or other international organizations. MOFA strongly condemns China's continued malicious distortion of the resolution in attempts to mislead international opinion. It calls on the international community to jointly oppose China's false narratives and urges the UN Secretariat to actively uphold the principle of universality embodied in the UN Charter, honor its commitment to leave no one behind, and promptly allow Taiwan's participation.

MOFA response to Dutch House of Representatives passing Taiwan-friendly motion on UNGA Resolution 2758 and Taiwan’s international participation	September 13, 2024 The House of Representatives of the Netherlands on September 12 adopted a Taiwan-friendly motion stating that United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 did not rule that the People's Republic of China (PRC) enjoyed sovereignty over Taiwan and that it did not make any judgment on Taiwan's participation in the UN or other international organizations. The motion was passed by an overwhelming majority, with 147 of 150 members voting in favor. It was highly significant that the motion was approved while the 79th session of the UNGA was being convened. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates the passage of the motion. The motion also noted that UNGA Resolution 2758 was being used by the PRC to block Taiwan's international engagement and that the Netherlands also had an interest in Taiwan's participation in such organizations as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the World Health Organization. After the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) adopted a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 for its members' reference at its annual summit in July and the subsequent passage of a related motion by the Australian Senate, the passage of this motion by the Dutch House of Representatives makes the Netherlands the second country in the world and the first in Europe to adopt a similar measure. The Taiwan-friendly motion was jointly proposed by 13 members of the Dutch House of Representatives from both the ruling and opposition parties, including Representative Jan Paternotte of Democrats 66, who is an IPAC cochair for the Netherlands. It marks the third concrete action taken by the Dutch House of Representatives to support Taiwan this year following the adoption of a motion in April backing Taiwan's international participation and another in May urging the Dutch government to pursue a joint effort with the European Union and like-minded European nations to oppose China's military drills around Taiwan and to maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118040	2024-09-13T01:05:00-07:00

As for security in the Indo-Pacific, both sides expressed serious concern about tensions in the East China Sea and the South China Sea and reiterated their strong opposition to recent actions by China that endanger the safety of life at sea and infringe upon freedom of navigation. They also highlighted their strong commitment to upholding peace, stability, and international law in the Indo-Pacific. The European Union and the United States have been holding high-level meetings of the EU-US Dialogue on China since 2021.

This demonstrates that the maintenance of security across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific has become the consensus of the European Union, the United States, and other members of the democratic camp. In facing the recent collusion of authoritarian countries that openly challenge the international order, Taiwan&mdash;a responsible and democratic member of the Indo-Pacific community&mdash;seeks to collaborate with the European Union, the United States, and other like-minded partners to jointly uphold the rules-based international order and defend such shared values as democracy, freedom, and human rights.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint statement between PRC and South Africa	September 4, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping on September 2 met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who was in Beijing to attend the summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. After the meeting, they issued the Joint Statement between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of South Africa on the Establishment of an All-Round Strategic Cooperative Partnership in a New Era. The statement included such false claims as Taiwan being an inalienable part of China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns China for repeatedly using meetings with other countries' leaders and large international conferences it organizes to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA solemnly reiterates that it has always been an undeniable fact that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; that the PRC has never governed Taiwan; and that no country can or has the right to deny this objective reality through a joint statement. Taiwan staunchly upholds the ideals of democracy and freedom, never wavering in the face of political coercion and diplomatic suppression by China. With a focus on democracy, peace, and freedom, it will continue to enhance cooperation with like-minded partners, ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and deepen exchanges with all countries.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117999	2024-09-04T00:21:00-07:00	
Taiwan’s 2024 UN bid aims to refute distortion and misapplication of UNGA Resolution 2758	September 3, 2024 No. 289 The 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) will commence at UN headquarters in New York on September 10. The UN General Debate will be held from September 24 to 28 and on September 30. The theme of this year's General Debate is &ldquo;leaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations.&rdquo; Ironically, however, the 23.5 million people of Taiwan continue to be left behind by the UN system. This grave injustice is due mainly to China's malicious misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758; China's attempts to mislead the international community into accepting that the resolution is equivalent to the so-called &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo;; and China's spurious claims that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China and that Resolution 2758 has authorized the PRC to represent Taiwan in the UN system. In effect, China is seeking to establish a legal basis to undermine the objective reality that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign nation and divest Taiwan of its legitimate right to pursue participation in the UN system. In the face of China's cognitive warfare, prompt rebuttals and clarifications must be issued. Otherwise, the objective status quo across the Taiwan Strait&mdash;in which neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other&mdash;will utterly change, allowing China to lay a legal foundation for an armed invasion of Taiwan. The international community would then lose its legitimate right to assist Taiwan in accordance with the UN Charter, which calls for maintaining international peace and security and resolving international disputes through peaceful means. Therefore, Taiwan's bid to participate in the United Nations this year is focused on enhancing international understanding of UNGA Resolution 2758. The government hopes to make clear that the resolution does not mention Taiwan and thus has nothing to do with Taiwan. Moreover, the resolution neither states that Taiwan is part of China&mdash;as the PRC falsely claims&mdash;nor gives China the right to represent Taiwan in the United Nations. Taiwan's 2024 campaign for UN participation comprises three main issues. 1. The malicious distortion of UNGA Resolution 2758 has become a serious threat to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. The United Nations must take action to address it. 2. UNGA Resolution 2758 does not preclude Taiwan's meaningful participation in the UN system. The United Nations must seek suitable ways of including Taiwan so that Taiwan can better contribute to realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 3. The UN Secretariat must adopt a strictly neutral stance and stop erroneously citing UNGA Resolution 2758. It must also grant Taiwanese nationals and journalists the right to access UN premises for visits, meetings, and newsgathering activities. Over the past eight years, the Taiwan government's stable and steadfast approach to promoting its UN campaigns has received international recognition and encouraged ever more like-minded countries to support its efforts to increase global engagement. Following careful deliberations and considering this past success, the government has again decided to ask permanent representatives to the United Nations from Taiwan's diplomatic allies to write a joint letter to UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres. Officials from diplomatic allies have also been urged to speak up for Taiwan during the General Debate and other UNGA events. To communicate Taiwan's UN bid to the global community directly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung wrote an op-ed entitled &ldquo;To secure peace in the Indo-Pacific, include Taiwan in the UN system.&rdquo; The op-ed has been published in media outlets around the world. The logo and short film for Taiwan's UN campaign this year center on semiconductors and peace, highlighting Taiwan's leading role in global semiconductor supply chains and its strong determination to pursue peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. These efforts aim to foster understanding worldwide that Taiwan&mdash;as a responsible member of the international community&mdash;will implement the Four Pillars of Peace action plan proposed by President Lai Ching-te. Taiwan will continue working with democratic partners to create sustainable supply chains for democracy chips and to advance global prosperity and development. In terms of cross-strait relations, Taiwan will neither yield nor provoke but will maintain the status quo and do its part to ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. During the UNGA, the government will hold related side events and activities in New York to promote a positive image of Taiwan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely thanks legislators from the governing and opposition parties for once again organizing a cross-party delegation to provide guidance in New York. The delegation will explain to the UN community that the prevailing opinion among Taiwan's 23.5 million people is a strong desire for equal participation in the UN system. The United Nations belongs to all humanity. The UN Charter explicitly states that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to develop friendly relations among countries based on respect for the principle of equal rights of peoples. Yet, the United Nations has continued to succumb to pressure from China, ignore the Taiwanese people's legitimate right to UN participation, echo China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758, and thereby seek to rationalize the wrongful and illegitimate exclusion of the Taiwanese people. MOFA deeply regrets the United Nations' actions and expresses its strong displeasure. MOFA extends appreciation to the US government for making a four-point public rebuttal in April regarding the misapplication of UNGA Resolution 2758. It also thanks the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China for adopting a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 in July that could serve as reference for IPAC members when introducing related motions in their respective parliaments. In August, the Australian Senate became the first national parliament to pass such a motion, repudiating the misuse of UNGA Resolution 2758. Moving forward, Taiwan firmly believes that even more countries will stand up and call for justice for Taiwan. To safeguard the Taiwanese people's basic human right to international engagement, the government has campaigned persistently for UN participation since 1993. However, due to China's unreasonable and heavy-handed interference, as well as the UN's blind capitulation to China's pressure, Taiwan has encountered countless difficulties and challenges to its UN bids. Despite this, the Taiwan government has never abandoned its efforts and never will&mdash;it will continue to seek international support. Taiwan once again reminds the United Nations that only by accepting Taiwan's full participation can the world achieve peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future generations.
