MOFA response to disinformation campaign alleging Taiwanese firm assisted Russia	January 8, 2025 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) solemnly issues a clarification in response to recent reports fabricated by ill-intentioned individuals claiming that the Taiwanese company Rung Cherng Suspenparts (TRC) produced servomechanisms for Russia to augment its weaponry for use against Ukraine. This is completely false. MOFA strongly condemns the malicious individuals behind the deplorable disinformation campaign against Taiwan and calls on all sectors to carefully distinguish fact from fiction so as not to be misled. Recent media reports have cited statements by Ukrainian civic activist Vadym Labas, who claimed that TRC had supplied servomechanisms to Russia that could increase the precision of arms deployed against Ukraine. After receiving news of the reports on January 6, MOFA immediately instructed the Taipei Representative Office in Poland to contact Ukraine for clarification. Ukraine promptly responded that the items in question were believed to be counterfeits of Taiwanese products jointly manufactured by China and Russia; that the components and packaging were intentionally branded with the TRC logo to falsely link them to Taiwan; and that this was believed to be a disinformation campaign targeting Taiwan. Mr. Labas, the original news source, has since publicly clarified on his Facebook page that Taiwan strongly supports Ukraine. He has added that further investigation revealed the likelihood of a deliberate attempt by unscrupulous Chinese and Russian businesspeople to circumvent sanctions and discredit Taiwan, leading to Taiwan being wrongfully accused. MOFA also contacted the Ministry of Economic Affairs International Trade Administration for information on TRC, the company that was implicated. TRC stated in a media interview on January 6 that it did not even manufacture servomechanisms and that it would take legal action in response to the unfounded allegations. Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, Taiwan has staunchly supported Ukraine in countering Russian aggression; provided humanitarian assistance for reconstruction efforts in Ukraine; and joined the United States, European nations, and other like-minded democratic countries in imposing sanctions on Russia. MOFA urges people everywhere to beware of disinformation campaigns against Taiwan and not be misled by false reports.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118925	2025-01-08T01:32:00-08:00	
Foreign Minister Lin promotes integrated diplomacy in interview with Nikkei News and Nikkei Asia	January 7, 2025 No. 002 Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung sat for a joint interview with the Taipei correspondents of Nikkei News and Nikkei Asia on January 3. The interview has received great international attention after related articles were published on January 7, in English with the headline &ldquo;Taiwan foreign minister vows to work with Trump on democratic supply chain,&rdquo; and in Japanese with the headline &ldquo;Taiwan foreign minister seeks to deepen cooperation with Japan on responding to natural disasters.&rdquo; During the interview, Minister Lin indicated that China's rise had challenged the rules-based international order and that Taiwan was a tipping point for the global balance of power; not merely a pawn, but rather a player. Minister Lin stressed that Taiwan had increased its defense spending to 2.5 percent of GDP, higher than Japan or most NATO members. He said that Taiwan was responding to US President-elect Donald Trump's appeals, strengthening its self-defense resolve, further increasing its military budget, and deepening Taiwan-US security cooperation. According to Minister Lin, Taiwan hoped to discuss with the United States ways to expedite delivery of delayed military hardware shipments, for example by tapping Taiwan's manufacturing prowess to speed up production by friend-shoring. Minister Lin also noted that Taiwan-US cooperation on drone R&amp;D was exceedingly important because such machines were at the heart of asymmetrical deterrence of China's use of military force. Concerning Taiwan-Japan relations, Minister Lin stated that he hoped to engage in further exchanges and cooperation with Japan on disaster relief and humanitarian aid efforts. For example, last July, Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration and Japan's Coast Guard engaged in the two nations' first-ever joint rescue exercise. Through responding to natural disasters, both sides could gain experience with cooperation. Minister Lin also suggested that the two sides engage in greater cooperation on patrols and first island chain security, in particular on developing drones and security affairs, so as to jointly address the military threat posed by China. In the economic sphere, Minister Lin pointed out that Taiwan was the linchpin in the global semiconductor supply chain and had become a focus of global investment. This, in turn, increased Taiwan's stature with regard to international economic cooperation. Minister Lin called on the Japanese government to expedite the signing of an economic partnership agreement with Taiwan, as this would spur closer economic links and be beneficial to Taiwan's accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). He also said that Taiwan and Japan had already signed roughly 90 cooperation accords and should work toward signing a more substantive economic agreement. Minister Lin further elaborated that Taiwan's strategy of integrated diplomacy consisted of the three pillars of values-based diplomacy, alliance diplomacy, and economic and trade diplomacy. He spoke about democratic, non-red supply chains as a strategic way of addressing China's red supply chains. Minister Lin stressed that China was attempting to use the Belt and Road Initiative and Digital Silk Road to influence the economies and information security of other nations. To counter the rise of expansionist China, Taiwan was leveraging its strengths in semiconductors and AI to work with like-minded partners on creating more resilient democratic suppliers that did not rely on China. Taiwan was an important force for regional peace and global prosperity as well as a trustworthy partner in defending global economic security. Minister Lin added that Taiwan would work with all like-minded nations to continue strengthening cooperation and opposing China's authoritarian expansionism. The Nikkei Asia article also introduced Minister Lin's new book, A Country Where the Economic Sun Never Sets, which discussed how Taiwan's semiconductor industry had made Taiwan a global investment destination, causing Taiwan Strait security to become a global issue and increasing Taiwan's global status, affording it the ability to act as a middle power diplomatically. Nikkei News is one of Japan's five largest nationwide newspapers. Since purchasing the Financial Times in 2015, it has become one of the world's largest media conglomerates. Nikkei Asia is an English-language publication of the firm that focuses on Asia and provides discourse on international events from an Asian perspective. Reporters involved in the interview included Nikkei News Taipei bureau chief Nonushi Hata and reporter Hideaki Tatsumoto as well as Nikkei Asia Taiwan-based reporters Thompson Chau, Ting-fang Cheng, and Lauly Li.

2024 diplomacy review: building a new Taiwan of democracy, peace, and prosperity through integrated diplomacy	December 30, 2024 No. 471 In 2024, the global landscape underwent rapid changes; geopolitical turmoil continued unabated; democracy and authoritarianism remained starkly divided; the Russia-Ukraine war deadlocked; and instability prevailed in the Middle East, the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, and even in the first island chain. All of these events highlighted the increasingly formidable challenges that the world faces from the axis of upheaval. Meanwhile, the Republic of China (Taiwan) successfully completed its eighth presidential election on January 13, another milestone in its democratic advancement. The situation across the Taiwan Strait continued to elicit a high level of international concern, while the Indo-Pacific became pivotal to global strategy. All of these developments were closely intertwined with Taiwan's national security and interests. Diplomats at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and its overseas missions showed resilience and self-confidence. They did their utmost to safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty, dignity, and interests, as well as the Taiwanese people's rights and interests. Building on the excellent foundation laid by steadfast diplomacy over the past eight years, MOFA implemented integrated diplomacy, which aims at realizing values-based diplomacy and transforming Taiwan into a thriving global economic powerhouse as envisioned by President Lai Ching-te. Based on the three pillars of democracy, peace, and prosperity, MOFA fostered cooperation and deepened partnerships. MOFA pursued mutual benefits and coprosperity with diplomatic allies and like-minded nations, demonstrating that Taiwan was a pivotal force for stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and underscoring its value as a global model of freedom and democracy. Democratic Taiwan neither yielded nor provoked, remaining calm and confident. It worked with the global democratic community to respond to threats posed by authoritarian regimes. Taiwan stood firm and resilient against authoritarian expansionism, actively provided international humanitarian assistance during times of crisis, and leveraged its strengths to share prosperity with diplomatic allies and like-minded countries. For its contributions, Taiwan gained worldwide acclaim and recognition from all sectors. With the support of Taiwan's people, MOFA and its overseas missions spared no effort to promote head-of-state diplomacy. In December, President Lai led a delegation to Pacific diplomatic allies the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Palau under the theme &ldquo;Smart and Sustainable Development for a Prosperous Austronesian Region.&rdquo; He achieved the three main objectives of smart sustainability, sustainable democracy, and sustainable diplomatic ties while also making successful US transit stops in Hawaii and Guam. The tour was immensely productive and successfully consolidated international support for Taiwan. It both deepened Taiwan's friendships with allies and launched a new era of values-based diplomacy. In October, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung, serving as special presidential envoy, attended celebrations marking the 45th anniversary of the independence of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. He also visited Guatemala, Saint Lucia, Belize, and Saint Christopher and Nevis, where he witnessed the achievements of values-based diplomacy and economic and trade diplomacy. In addition, he deepened partnerships on the foundations already laid for bilateral cooperation. In November, Minister Lin visited Belgium, where the European Parliament is headquartered, as well as Lithuania and Poland, further enhancing democratic alliances and cooperation as well as economic and trade linkages between Taiwan and Europe. International friendship and support for Taiwan reached new heights this year. Following the successful completion of Taiwan's presidential and legislative elections in January, more than 1,600 prominent political figures from over 100 countries offered congratulations. Taiwan's significant success in diplomacy was substantively reflected through its solid formal alliances, rock-solid partnership with the United States, growing ties with Europe, and steadfast friendship with Japan. Diplomatic allies and like-minded nations spoke in support of Taiwan's international participation and reaffirmed the global consensus on maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. They lauded Taiwan as a force for good that safeguarded democratic values, provided humanitarian assistance, and made concrete contributions. Meanwhile, Taiwan has continued to deploy soft power, pursue public diplomacy, and seek international support. It has integrated resources across ministries, agencies, and departments to bolster its overall diplomatic strength. Furthermore, it has sought to have other countries implement consular measures addressing visas and digital governance to afford greater convenience to Taiwan's people while also promoting closer people-to-people exchanges with other nations. MOFA has devoted a maximum effort to the planning and implementation of the Diplomatic Allies Prosperity Project to deepen substantive relations with allies and like-minded countries. MOFA has formulated eight flagship projects concerning the Five Trusted Industry Sectors, covering semiconductor supply chain resilience, reliable networks and digital governance, new energy and carbon credit cooperation, smart demonstration parks overseas, smart medicine and healthcare, smart agriculture, sovereign AI, and sustainable tourism. Taiwan has brought its industrial strengths to play while integrating the resources of all ministries and agencies. Through the export of smart solutions, Taiwan has stimulated the prosperous development of allies and bolstered democratic supply chains. This has consolidated diplomatic ties and is helping allies enjoy greater prosperity. Taiwan is greeting a new world and the world is greeting a new Taiwan. Not only is this MOFA's mission in its diplomatic work, it is also the stellar outcome of coordinated efforts by the Taiwanese people and related agencies. MOFA has helped to promote the Executive Yuan's economic diplomacy task force and has a strategic team conducting research and administrative work for the task force. This task force facilitates the efficient integration of resources from across ministries, enabling every citizen to be a diplomat and every ministry to serve as a foreign ministry. MOFA will continue to improve the efficiency and quality of its public-facing services so that they have a tangible and positive impact on people's lives. It will work diligently for the dignity, rights, interests, continuity, and development of the nation and people. MOFA will utilize Taiwan's strengths as it connects to the world and work steadily to promote technology diplomacy, human rights diplomacy, cultural diplomacy, urban diplomacy, parliamentary diplomacy, medical and public health diplomacy, environmental diplomacy, sports diplomacy, indigenous diplomacy, religious diplomacy, and gender equality diplomacy. MOFA will help the international community better understand the important role that Taiwan plays. It will live up to the expectations of all sectors as concerns diplomatic efforts. In 2025, the world will usher in a new chapter in geopolitics. With confidence, resilience, and a professional and flexible approach, MOFA will maintain its footing in the new environment. It will leverage Taiwan's strengths; overcome challenges; and amplify the values of democracy, peace, and prosperity. By integrating diplomatic momentum from all sectors, MOFA will continue to contribute to the international community and realize President Lai's policy of values-based diplomacy and vision of Taiwan as a thriving global economic powerhouse. MOFA will demonstrate that Taiwan can help and that Taiwan can lead so that Taiwan continues to serve as a beacon shining far and wide across the globe.

Foreign Minister Lin hosts welcome luncheon for Ukrainian delegation led by Lviv Mayor Sadovyy	December 28, 2024 No. 468 Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung on December 27 hosted a luncheon to welcome a Ukrainian delegation led by Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyy. During the event, the two sides exchanged views on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, the peaceful development of Ukraine, the strengthening of local municipal exchanges, the building of resilient cities, and other initiatives. In addition to sharing with the guests Taiwan's experience and insights regarding economic transformation and high-tech industrial development, Minister Lin stressed that cities in Taiwan and Ukraine could engage in exchanges at the annual Smart City Summit and Expo held in Taiwan. The visiting delegation thanked the Taiwan government for its humanitarian assistance and support to Ukraine, adding that the Ukrainian people were deeply moved by Taiwan's goodwill. They expressed the wish that the two countries could further engage in reciprocal support and cooperation on the basis of friendship and mutual trust. Lviv is the largest city in western Ukraine. Following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, it has become an important hub for other countries to deliver humanitarian aid to Ukraine as well as a major medical base to which wounded soldiers and patients are transferred for follow-up treatment. On December 27, the Taipei Representative Office (TRO) in Poland, the Lviv city government, and the Multidisciplinary Clinical Hospital of Emergency and Intensive Care signed a memorandum on cooperation and partnership for the reconstruction of the UNBROKEN National Rehabilitation Center in Lviv. The virtual signing ceremony was witnessed by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chihchung Wu. The government of Taiwan will fund the renovation of a rehabilitation facility, which will be named the Taiwan Friendship Building to accentuate Taiwan's donation and friendship. Speaking as Taiwan's representative at the MOU signing ceremony, Deputy Minister Wu stated that postsurgery rehabilitation would be available to military personnel and civilians at the Taiwan Friendship Building in the UNBROKEN center and that the Taiwan government would continue to work with Lviv on the basis of mutual trust and support so as to help Ukraine work toward a brighter future amidst current adversity. Mayor Sadovyy presented a briefing on UNBROKEN's operations and the recovery of those injured. Noting that the rehabilitation facility to be renovated with Taiwan government funding would benefit more Ukrainian patients, he expressed heartfelt appreciation to the government and people of Taiwan. UNBROKEN is a national rehabilitation center supported by Ukraine's Ministry of Health and overseen by the Lviv city government. The center includes a general hospital, a children's hospital, a rehabilitation center, a surgery facility, a prosthetics manufacturing facility, and temporary housing. To date, more than 940,000 Ukrainian patients have received medical treatment at this nationally renowned center. The facility to be renovated with Taiwan's assistance is a seven-story building located in the western part of the center. Once the project is completed, it will be home to specialized departments and provide such diverse medical and rehabilitation services as physical therapy, psychological consultations, and prosthetic fittings. It is expected to have the capacity to serve 13,000 patients simultaneously. (E)	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118892	2024-12-28T01:12:00-08:00
