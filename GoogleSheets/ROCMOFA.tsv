MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint statement between PRC and South Africa	September 4, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping on September 2 met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who was in Beijing to attend the summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. After the meeting, they issued the Joint Statement between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of South Africa on the Establishment of an All-Round Strategic Cooperative Partnership in a New Era. The statement included such false claims as Taiwan being an inalienable part of China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns China for repeatedly using meetings with other countries' leaders and large international conferences it organizes to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA solemnly reiterates that it has always been an undeniable fact that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; that the PRC has never governed Taiwan; and that no country can or has the right to deny this objective reality through a joint statement. Taiwan staunchly upholds the ideals of democracy and freedom, never wavering in the face of political coercion and diplomatic suppression by China. With a focus on democracy, peace, and freedom, it will continue to enhance cooperation with like-minded partners, ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and deepen exchanges with all countries.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117999	2024-09-04T00:21:00-07:00	
Taiwan’s 2024 UN bid aims to refute distortion and misapplication of UNGA Resolution 2758	September 3, 2024 No. 289 The 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) will commence at UN headquarters in New York on September 10. The UN General Debate will be held from September 24 to 28 and on September 30. The theme of this year's General Debate is &ldquo;leaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations.&rdquo; Ironically, however, the 23.5 million people of Taiwan continue to be left behind by the UN system. This grave injustice is due mainly to China's malicious misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758; China's attempts to mislead the international community into accepting that the resolution is equivalent to the so-called &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo;; and China's spurious claims that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China and that Resolution 2758 has authorized the PRC to represent Taiwan in the UN system. In effect, China is seeking to establish a legal basis to undermine the objective reality that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign nation and divest Taiwan of its legitimate right to pursue participation in the UN system. In the face of China's cognitive warfare, prompt rebuttals and clarifications must be issued. Otherwise, the objective status quo across the Taiwan Strait&mdash;in which neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other&mdash;will utterly change, allowing China to lay a legal foundation for an armed invasion of Taiwan. The international community would then lose its legitimate right to assist Taiwan in accordance with the UN Charter, which calls for maintaining international peace and security and resolving international disputes through peaceful means. Therefore, Taiwan's bid to participate in the United Nations this year is focused on enhancing international understanding of UNGA Resolution 2758. The government hopes to make clear that the resolution does not mention Taiwan and thus has nothing to do with Taiwan. Moreover, the resolution neither states that Taiwan is part of China&mdash;as the PRC falsely claims&mdash;nor gives China the right to represent Taiwan in the United Nations. Taiwan's 2024 campaign for UN participation comprises three main issues. 1. The malicious distortion of UNGA Resolution 2758 has become a serious threat to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. The United Nations must take action to address it. 2. UNGA Resolution 2758 does not preclude Taiwan's meaningful participation in the UN system. The United Nations must seek suitable ways of including Taiwan so that Taiwan can better contribute to realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 3. The UN Secretariat must adopt a strictly neutral stance and stop erroneously citing UNGA Resolution 2758. It must also grant Taiwanese nationals and journalists the right to access UN premises for visits, meetings, and newsgathering activities. Over the past eight years, the Taiwan government's stable and steadfast approach to promoting its UN campaigns has received international recognition and encouraged ever more like-minded countries to support its efforts to increase global engagement. Following careful deliberations and considering this past success, the government has again decided to ask permanent representatives to the United Nations from Taiwan's diplomatic allies to write a joint letter to UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres. Officials from diplomatic allies have also been urged to speak up for Taiwan during the General Debate and other UNGA events. To communicate Taiwan's UN bid to the global community directly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung wrote an op-ed entitled &ldquo;To secure peace in the Indo-Pacific, include Taiwan in the UN system.&rdquo; The op-ed has been published in media outlets around the world. The logo and short film for Taiwan's UN campaign this year center on semiconductors and peace, highlighting Taiwan's leading role in global semiconductor supply chains and its strong determination to pursue peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. These efforts aim to foster understanding worldwide that Taiwan&mdash;as a responsible member of the international community&mdash;will implement the Four Pillars of Peace action plan proposed by President Lai Ching-te. Taiwan will continue working with democratic partners to create sustainable supply chains for democracy chips and to advance global prosperity and development. In terms of cross-strait relations, Taiwan will neither yield nor provoke but will maintain the status quo and do its part to ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. During the UNGA, the government will hold related side events and activities in New York to promote a positive image of Taiwan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely thanks legislators from the governing and opposition parties for once again organizing a cross-party delegation to provide guidance in New York. The delegation will explain to the UN community that the prevailing opinion among Taiwan's 23.5 million people is a strong desire for equal participation in the UN system. The United Nations belongs to all humanity. The UN Charter explicitly states that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to develop friendly relations among countries based on respect for the principle of equal rights of peoples. Yet, the United Nations has continued to succumb to pressure from China, ignore the Taiwanese people's legitimate right to UN participation, echo China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758, and thereby seek to rationalize the wrongful and illegitimate exclusion of the Taiwanese people. MOFA deeply regrets the United Nations' actions and expresses its strong displeasure. MOFA extends appreciation to the US government for making a four-point public rebuttal in April regarding the misapplication of UNGA Resolution 2758. It also thanks the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China for adopting a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 in July that could serve as reference for IPAC members when introducing related motions in their respective parliaments. In August, the Australian Senate became the first national parliament to pass such a motion, repudiating the misuse of UNGA Resolution 2758. Moving forward, Taiwan firmly believes that even more countries will stand up and call for justice for Taiwan. To safeguard the Taiwanese people's basic human right to international engagement, the government has campaigned persistently for UN participation since 1993. However, due to China's unreasonable and heavy-handed interference, as well as the UN's blind capitulation to China's pressure, Taiwan has encountered countless difficulties and challenges to its UN bids. Despite this, the Taiwan government has never abandoned its efforts and never will&mdash;it will continue to seek international support. Taiwan once again reminds the United Nations that only by accepting Taiwan's full participation can the world achieve peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future generations.

MOFA again strongly condemns China for ramming of Philippine offi...	September 1, 2024No. 287As the Philippine Coast Guard patrol vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua (MRRV-9701) was preparing to raise anchor at Sabina Shoal on August 31, it was deliberately rammed multiple times in intimidating and dangerous maneuvers by a China Coast Guard vessel. This marked the third confrontation between the two sides in the same maritime area in recent days.China has recently cited &ldquo;rights protection&rdquo; as a pretext for using illegal, threatening, coercive, and dangerous maneuvers and other nonpeaceful means to obstruct and interfere with the legal navigation of Philippine vessels, leading to several collisions at sea. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) again strongly condemns China's bullying tactics in repeatedly and intentionally causing confrontations in the same maritime area and escalating tensions in the South China Sea.MOFA reiterates that Taiwan opposes any threat to security in the South China Sea or actions that harm regional peace and stability. It urges all sides to exercise restraint, abide by international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and resolve differences via peaceful means. Taiwan will continue to work closely with like-minded countries to monitor developments in the South China Sea and jointly maintain regional peace and stability.

August 31, 2024 US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and New Zealand Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade Bede Corry met for the New Zealand-United States Strategic Dialogue in Auckland on August 30. They reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, encouraged the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues, and expressed grave concern over China's provocative actions toward Philippine vessels in the South China Sea. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) expresses strong affirmation of and sincere appreciation for their support. Maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea has become a matter of global consensus. MOFA welcomes like-minded countries' continued attention on this issue at international events and appreciates their concrete actions to uphold the rules-based international order.

MOFA expresses sincere condolences over passing of Maori King Tuh...	August 30, 2024 No. 283 Maori King Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII passed away in the early morning of August 30 at the age of 69, according to statements released by the New Zealand government and the king's office. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) extends sincere condolences over his passing on behalf of the people and government of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Ambassador Joanne Ou, Taiwan Representative to New Zealand, has expressed sympathies to the queen and other family members of King Tuheitia through the king's office on behalf of Taiwan's people and government. King Tuheitia was friendly toward Taiwan. He made multiple visits to Taiwan and maintained cordial relations with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO), New Zealand and TECO in Auckland over the years. During his 18-year reign, King Tuheitia spared no effort in advancing the welfare of the Maori community, earning the love of his people as well as international recognition. Taiwan and New Zealand place great importance on the rights and interests of indigenous peoples, share the core values of freedom and democracy, and maintain close people-to-people exchanges and robust economic and trade cooperation. Taiwan is willing to uphold the spirit of compassion shown by King Tuheitia in working steadily and jointly with New Zealand to deepen friendly bilateral collaboration and enhance the well-being of both peoples.

MOFA response to US National Security Advisor Sullivan stressing ...	August 29, 2024 US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Wang Yi, Director of the Office of the Chinese Communist Party Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister of China, in Beijing on August 27 and 28. A press release issued afterwards by the White House pointed out that National Security Advisor Sullivan had underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait during the meeting. He emphasized concerns about China's support for Russia's defense industrial base and the effect this was having on European and transatlantic security, as well as about China's destabilizing actions in the South China Sea. He also reaffirmed the US commitment to defending its Indo-Pacific allies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes staunch US support for maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and appreciates high-level US officials' again expressing this position during interactions with their Chinese counterparts. In addition, MOFA notes that China again made spurious claims about Taiwan that do not accord with reality in the press release issued following the meeting. MOFA strongly condemns these false narratives and reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. In fact, China's relentless intimidation and suppression of Taiwan and its naked ambition for military expansion pose the greatest risk to regional peace and stability. By accommodating Russia, China has become a key supporter of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, jeopardizing transatlantic security. This also shows that China's ambitions extend beyond Taiwan to other regions, making it a major global threat. China's malicious actions have elicited a high level of concern among the global democratic community. As a responsible member of the international community, Taiwan will continue to enhance its self-defense capabilities and work with the United States and other like-minded partners to jointly safeguard the rules-based international order and preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117959	2024-08-29T01:18:00-07:00	
MOFA strongly condemns China’s dangerous maneuvers against Philip...	August 27, 2024No. 278On August 25, official vessel no. 3002 of the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, heading from Hasa Hasa Shoal toward Sabina Shoal in the South China Sea to carry out a humanitarian supply replenishment, was surrounded by eight Chinese military and coast guard vessels. The Chinese vessels proceeded to engage in dangerous maneuvers, including approaching at close range, spraying water cannons, and even ramming the Philippine vessel. This was the second confrontation between the two sides in the same maritime area this week.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) notes that China has recently taken deliberate action to expand the area of confrontation with the Philippines from Second Thomas Shoal to other locations such as Scarborough Shoal, Sabina Shoal, Sandy Cay, and Subi Reef. Furthermore, China has deployed nearly 100 ships in the South China Sea, including navy, coast guard, maritime militia, and scientific research vessels, and continues to frequently interfere with Philippine humanitarian replenishment missions. At the same time, it is using &ldquo;rights protection&rdquo; as a pretext for using illegal, threatening, coercive, and other nonpeaceful means to interfere with the navigation of other countries' vessels. This is raising regional tensions. MOFA strongly condemns China's hegemonic actions, which are clearly being taken with expansionist objectives in mind.MOFA emphasizes that maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight remains the consensus of the international community. Taiwan opposes any threat to security in the South China Sea or actions that harm the regional status quo of peace and stability. Moreover, it gravely condemns any use of military force or coercion to interfere with other countries' freedom of navigation. Taiwan solemnly urges all sides to exercise restraint, abide by international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and resolve differences via peaceful means.MOFA reiterates that the South China Sea Islands are part of the territory of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and that Taiwan enjoys rights over the South China Seas Islands and associated waters in accordance with international law and the law of the sea. Taiwan will continue to work closely with like-minded countries to monitor developments in the South China Sea and jointly maintain regional peace and stability. The government of Taiwan will continue to handle South China Sea affairs prudently in accordance with the four principles and five actions.

MOFA strongly condemns China for reckless incursion into Japanese...	August 27, 2024No. 277A Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft intruded into Japanese airspace near the Danjo Islands, Nagasaki Prefecture, on the morning of August 26, seriously violating Japan's sovereignty and raising regional tensions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns China's reckless infringement on the sovereignty of another country, which has undermined regional peace and stability.Recently, China has been ramping up incursions of military aircraft and vessels into the air defense identification zones and exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan, escalating regional tensions. Moreover, China has been conducting frequent joint military exercises with Russia in the East and South China Seas in an attempt to change the status quo through force. China's military expansionism poses a major threat to the security of countries in the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan and Japan.MOFA solemnly denounces China's behavior and once again calls on China to be rational, show restraint, and immediately stop all actions that undermine peace across the Taiwan Strait and increase regional tensions. As a responsible member of the Indo-Pacific, Taiwan will continue to actively strengthen its self-defense capabilities and cooperate with Japan and other like-minded countries to jointly curb authoritarian expansionism and aggression.

MOFA response to Chinese government’s continued attempts to use e...	August 24, 2024The Chinese government has for many years pressured enterprises to comply with its political objectives through such coercive tactics as boycotts, sanctions, tax investigations, and allegations of illegal activities. Moreover, in recent years, it has used the so-called &ldquo;little pinks&rdquo; and other jingoist Chinese nationalists to stir up online abuse against selected targets. Through this disruptive behavior, as well as associated denunciations by local collaborators in related countries, China has attempted to impose pressure or incite fear, and force compromises and concessions upon companies worldwide.In July 2023, an internationally renowned jewelry brand was subjected to criticism by Chinese state media, and insults and intimidation by hordes of Chinese netizens, after it was alleged that the company had listed Taiwan as a country on its official websites outside of China. Elsewhere, when the Canadian government expelled a Chinese diplomat based in Toronto in May 2023, the &ldquo;little pink&rdquo; movement promptly instigated a boycott against Canadian products. These are but two of a long list of examples. In addition to international enterprises, individuals from any sector in any country may also become targets of economic coercion by the Chinese government. Last month, Chinese netizens compiled a list of 94 Taiwanese entertainers who had not stated that Taiwan belonged to China at the time President Lai Ching-te assumed office, pressuring them to take a stand. This is one of many blatant examples of coercion.The Beijing authorities' use of &ldquo;little pink&rdquo; campaigns is a very clear element in China's cognitive warfare against Taiwan and the international community. However, just like its wolf-warrior diplomacy, this will only arouse aversion among the global community and further tarnish its international image.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Republic of China (Taiwan) strongly condemns authoritarian China for using such tactics as economic coercion to engage in political manipulation and thereby influence businesses' international commercial activities. In addition, MOFA urges the international community to recognize China's ubiquitous application of cognitive warfare tactics. It encourages the international community to work together to counter coercive actions by China's authoritarian government and curb the CCP regime's insatiable aspiration for advancement, as well as its continuous undermining of the rules-based international order and routine commercial activities.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117928	2024-08-24T01:53:00-07:00	
MOFA thanks Australian Senate for passing unanimous motion suppor...	August 22, 2024 No. 270 The Australian Senate on August 21 passed an urgency motion stating that United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 does not establish the People's Republic of China's sovereignty over Taiwan. The motion added that the resolution determines neither the future status of Taiwan in the United Nations nor Taiwanese participation in UN agencies or international organizations. The motion, moved by Deputy Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade David Fawcett and Chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Financial Services Deborah O'Neill, was passed unanimously. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly affirms and sincerely thanks the Australian Parliament for its firm support of Taiwan's international participation. Senators Fawcett and O'Neill are both staunch friends of Taiwan and visited in July to attend the annual summit of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC). Following IPAC's approval of a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 for use by national parliaments, Australia has now become the first country to pass a related motion in its parliament. MOFA thanks Australia and IPAC for righteously speaking out for Taiwan and calls on the international community to oppose China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758, as well as its attempts to erroneously conflate the resolution with its so-called &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Taiwan will continue to cooperate with Australia and other like-minded partners so as to jointly defend the core values shared by the global democratic camp and safeguard peace, stability, and prosperity throughout the region.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in PRC’s joint sta...	August 21, 2024Following a meeting on August 19, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and President of Vietnam To Lam issued a joint statement on further strengthening the bilateral comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and building a Vietnam-China community with a shared future. Chinese leader Xi issued another joint statement with Prime Minister of Fiji Sitiveni Rabuka after a meeting on August 20. Both statements falsely claimed that Taiwan was an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly refutes such claims.MOFA solemnly reaffirms that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a free and democratic country and that neither democratic Taiwan nor totalitarian China is subordinate to the other. These are long-standing, objective, and internationally recognized facts, as well as the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan has never been governed by the PRC, nor has it ever been part of the PRC. Only the democratically elected government of Taiwan has the right to represent the Taiwanese people in the United Nations system and the international arena. China and countries deferring to it have no say in the matter. MOFA strongly condemns and protests the Chinese government's repeated use of meetings with leaders of other countries to make false claims aimed at undermining Taiwan's sovereignty and misleading the international community.MOFA again urges countries deferring to China to not ignore history and to recognize that China is a totalitarian and autocratic regime. MOFA calls on them to refrain from blindly abetting China's deceitful narratives, which only distort the truth, maliciously undermine Taiwan's sovereignty, attempt to rationalize China's expansionist ambitions, and increase international instability. Taiwan will continue to steadfastly safeguard the values of freedom and democracy and bolster cooperation with democratic partners to jointly deter authoritarian expansionism; staunchly ensure cross-strait peace and security; and preserve a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117913	2024-08-20T23:49:00-07:00

August 20, 2024No. 267While visiting Australia from August 15 to 16, Prime Minister of New Zealand Christopher Luxon held bilateral talks with Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese. In a joint statement issued after their meeting, the leaders reaffirmed the importance of cross-strait peace and stability and expressed concern over rising tensions across the Taiwan Strait. They also called for the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues through dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion, and reiterated their opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly affirms the statement and sincerely thanks the two countries for again underscoring the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, following a similar statement at the Australia-New Zealand Foreign and Defence Ministerial Consultations in February.The joint statement also expressed grave concern about dangerous, destabilizing, and provocative behavior in the South China Sea. It called on all parties to adhere to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, de-escalate tensions, and resolve maritime disputes peacefully in accordance with international law. Maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea has become a matter of global consensus. MOFA welcomes that like-minded countries are continuing to focus attention on the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea at international events and take concrete actions to uphold the rules-based international order. Taiwan remains committed to promoting values-based diplomacy and jointly safeguarding democracy, peace, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.

US Democratic National Convention adopts party platform that incl...	August 20, 2024No. 264The US Democratic National Convention on August 19 adopted a party platform that again included text friendly to Taiwan. The platform affirmed that in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, the Six Assurances, and other policies, the Democratic Party firmly pledged to preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and ensure that there were no unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. Marking yet another explicit expression of staunch support for Taiwan in the Democratic Party platform, this was also the first time that the platform included a reference to the Six Assurances and a statement on remaining &ldquo;steadfast in America's commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&rdquo; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely welcomes and appreciates this strong support for Taiwan.This was the first time that the Democratic Party has held an in-person national convention in eight years. Following past precedents, Taiwan sent a delegation to attend the event in Chicago. The inclusion of Taiwan-friendly text in the party platform not only reflected the Democratic Party's unwavering support for Taiwan but also underscored its high regard for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. In fact, maintaining cross-strait peace and stability has not only gained support in the United States but also become a matter of international consensus in recent years.Taiwan has long enjoyed friendly relations with all circles in the United States. MOFA will build on this solid foundation by continuing to engage in close and steadfast cooperation with the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and US friends across all sectors so as to steadily deepen the values-based Taiwan-US partnership across the globe.

August 18, 2024 The White House on August 17 issued a joint leaders' statement on the anniversary of the Trilateral Leaders' Summit held by the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea at Camp David. The statement emphasized further deepening the trilateral partnership in such domains as security, technology, and economics based on the principles established at the 2023 Camp David summit. It also reaffirmed the three countries' resolve to maintain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific, remain aligned in their shared vision, and stand ready to meet the world's greatest challenges. Indo-Pacific security is an issue of common concern and importance to the international community. Joint statements issued at recent multilateral and bilateral events have stressed the importance of preserving peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and opposing changes to the status quo.

August 17, 2024 In response to a question at a forum held by the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines on August 16, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique A. Manalo stated that the situation across the Taiwan Strait was very important to the Philippines, adding that he hoped all parties could resolve issues peacefully. The statement by Foreign Secretary Manalo in support of peace across the Taiwan Strait follows his reaffirmation of the importance of cross-strait peace and stability in a joint statement issued after the Philippines-US 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue on July 30. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Republic of China (Taiwan) welcomes and appreciates this support. MOFA is willing to steadily enhance substantive cooperation between Taiwan and the Philippines in accordance with comprehensive diplomacy built on the three pillars of values, alliances, and the economy and trade. High-level officials from the Philippines, including President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., and Foreign Secretary Manalo, have recently on multiple occasions openly expressed concern over cross-strait developments and called for the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. MOFA welcomes joint efforts with the international community aimed at ensuring peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait; defending the core values of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law; and upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117883	2024-08-16T23:30:00-07:00
