Foreign Minister Lin hosts reception to mark 45th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Tuvalu	September 13, 2024No. 302Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung hosted a reception at the Taipei Guest House on the afternoon of September 12 to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of China (Taiwan) and Tuvalu. An eight-member delegation from Tuvalu led by Speaker of the Tuvaluan Parliament Sir Iakoba Taeia Italeli and his wife attended the event. In his remarks, Minister Lin welcomed Speaker Italeli on behalf of the government of Taiwan. He noted that Tuvalu was Taiwan's longest-standing Pacific ally. Since establishing their diplomatic alliance in 1979, the two nations had realized remarkable achievements in bilateral cooperation in such areas as agriculture, fisheries, public health and medicine, clean energy and climate change, and ICT. Minister Lin stated that Taiwan had recently joined forces with like-minded countries to implement the Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project to enhance Tuvalu's climate change resilience. He added that Taiwan was working with the United States, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand to connect Tuvalu to the Central Pacific Cable. Minister Lin said the project would give Tuvalu its first subsea cable connection, providing a secure, sustainable, and resilient internet communications system and boosting economic growth and social development.Noting that Taiwan and Tuvalu shared the values of freedom, democracy, and human rights, Minister Lin thanked Tuvalu for its long-standing support of Taiwan's efforts to expand participation in various international organizations. He said that the two countries were taina&mdash;which means &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; in Tuvaluan. Minister Lin stated that Taiwan cherished its friendship with Tuvalu and remained committed to deepening bilateral cooperation and assisting Tuvalu in achieving sustainable development.Speaker Italeli remarked that Taiwan was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Tuvalu after it gained independence. He lauded the success that the two countries had achieved through years of cooperation across domains such as agriculture, medicine, infrastructure, sustainable energy, and climate change.

Speaker Italeli stressed that Tuvalu valued its fraternal bonds with Taiwan and would continue to support Taiwan's engagement in international organizations. He expressed a deep conviction that the two countries would build on the milestone of their 45 years of diplomatic relations to further improve the well-being of their peoples and promote the prosperous development of both countries. Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Chung-kwang, who previously served as ambassador to Tuvalu, echoed Minister Lin in thanking Tuvalu for its staunch support of Taiwan's international participation. He praised the culture of Tuvalu for being warm and hospitable as well as resolute and resilient, which earned an enthusiastic response from Speaker Italeli and the other Tuvaluan guests. The cheerful and lively reception was also attended by Deputy Minister of Health and Welfare Lin Ching-yi, who had been stationed in Tuvalu to provide medical services; Deputy Minister of Environment Shih Wen-chen; Deputy Minister of the Council of Indigenous Peoples Calivat&middot;Gadu; and representatives from various sectors who have assisted Taiwan in implementing bilateral cooperation projects in Tuvalu.

MOFA response to Dutch House of Representatives passing Taiwan-friendly motion on UNGA Resolution 2758 and Taiwanâ€™s international participation	September 13, 2024 The House of Representatives of the Netherlands on September 12 adopted a Taiwan-friendly motion stating that United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 did not rule that the People's Republic of China (PRC) enjoyed sovereignty over Taiwan and that it did not make any judgment on Taiwan's participation in the UN or other international organizations. The motion was passed by an overwhelming majority, with 147 of 150 members voting in favor. It was highly significant that the motion was approved while the 79th session of the UNGA was being convened. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates the passage of the motion. The motion also noted that UNGA Resolution 2758 was being used by the PRC to block Taiwan's international engagement and that the Netherlands also had an interest in Taiwan's participation in such organizations as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the World Health Organization. After the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) adopted a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 for its members' reference at its annual summit in July and the subsequent passage of a related motion by the Australian Senate, the passage of this motion by the Dutch House of Representatives makes the Netherlands the second country in the world and the first in Europe to adopt a similar measure. The Taiwan-friendly motion was jointly proposed by 13 members of the Dutch House of Representatives from both the ruling and opposition parties, including Representative Jan Paternotte of Democrats 66, who is an IPAC cochair for the Netherlands. It marks the third concrete action taken by the Dutch House of Representatives to support Taiwan this year following the adoption of a motion in April backing Taiwan's international participation and another in May urging the Dutch government to pursue a joint effort with the European Union and like-minded European nations to oppose China's military drills around Taiwan and to maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118040	2024-09-13T01:05:00-07:00

They also reiterated concern over China's continued provocative activities in the South China Sea, underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and conveyed opposition to any unilateral attempt to change the cross-strait status quo by force or coercion. The need to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait has become a global consensus.

It also appreciates their concrete efforts to uphold the rules-based international order. Taiwan will continue to cooperate with like-minded nations to enhance economic and social resilience, jointly counter the threat of authoritarian expansion, and safeguard democracy, peace, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118039	2024-09-13T01:04:00-07:00	
MOFA welcomes EU-US joint press release reaffirming importance of cross-strait peace and stability	September 12, 2024 No. 300 European External Action Service Secretary General Stefano Sannino and United States Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell on September 11 issued a joint press release after holding the seventh high-level meeting of the EU-US Dialogue on China and the sixth meeting of the EU-US High-Level Consultations on the Indo-Pacific on September 9 and 10. The two sides underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and stated that this was indispensable to international peace and stability. They also called for the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues through dialogue, expressed opposition to any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force or coercion, urged China to exercise restraint in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan, and conveyed support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. As for security in the Indo-Pacific, both sides expressed serious concern about tensions in the East China Sea and the South China Sea and reiterated their strong opposition to recent actions by China that endanger the safety of life at sea and infringe upon freedom of navigation. They also highlighted their strong commitment to upholding peace, stability, and international law in the Indo-Pacific. The European Union and the United States have been holding high-level meetings of the EU-US Dialogue on China since 2021. Through related joint press releases, they have continued to reiterate great regard for cross-strait peace and stability. This demonstrates that the maintenance of security across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific has become the consensus of the European Union, the United States, and other members of the democratic camp. In facing the recent collusion of authoritarian countries that openly challenge the international order, Taiwan&mdash;a responsible and democratic member of the Indo-Pacific community&mdash;seeks to collaborate with the European Union, the United States, and other like-minded partners to jointly uphold the rules-based international order and defend such shared values as democracy, freedom, and human rights.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint statement between PRC and South Africa	September 4, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping on September 2 met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who was in Beijing to attend the summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. After the meeting, they issued the Joint Statement between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of South Africa on the Establishment of an All-Round Strategic Cooperative Partnership in a New Era. The statement included such false claims as Taiwan being an inalienable part of China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns China for repeatedly using meetings with other countries' leaders and large international conferences it organizes to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA solemnly reiterates that it has always been an undeniable fact that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; that the PRC has never governed Taiwan; and that no country can or has the right to deny this objective reality through a joint statement. Taiwan staunchly upholds the ideals of democracy and freedom, never wavering in the face of political coercion and diplomatic suppression by China. With a focus on democracy, peace, and freedom, it will continue to enhance cooperation with like-minded partners, ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and deepen exchanges with all countries.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117999	2024-09-04T00:21:00-07:00	
Taiwanâ€™s 2024 UN bid aims to refute distortion and misapplication of UNGA Resolution 2758	September 3, 2024 No. 289 The 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) will commence at UN headquarters in New York on September 10. The UN General Debate will be held from September 24 to 28 and on September 30. The theme of this year's General Debate is &ldquo;leaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations.&rdquo; Ironically, however, the 23.5 million people of Taiwan continue to be left behind by the UN system. This grave injustice is due mainly to China's malicious misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758; China's attempts to mislead the international community into accepting that the resolution is equivalent to the so-called &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo;; and China's spurious claims that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China and that Resolution 2758 has authorized the PRC to represent Taiwan in the UN system. In effect, China is seeking to establish a legal basis to undermine the objective reality that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign nation and divest Taiwan of its legitimate right to pursue participation in the UN system. In the face of China's cognitive warfare, prompt rebuttals and clarifications must be issued. Otherwise, the objective status quo across the Taiwan Strait&mdash;in which neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other&mdash;will utterly change, allowing China to lay a legal foundation for an armed invasion of Taiwan. The international community would then lose its legitimate right to assist Taiwan in accordance with the UN Charter, which calls for maintaining international peace and security and resolving international disputes through peaceful means. Therefore, Taiwan's bid to participate in the United Nations this year is focused on enhancing international understanding of UNGA Resolution 2758. The government hopes to make clear that the resolution does not mention Taiwan and thus has nothing to do with Taiwan. Moreover, the resolution neither states that Taiwan is part of China&mdash;as the PRC falsely claims&mdash;nor gives China the right to represent Taiwan in the United Nations. Taiwan's 2024 campaign for UN participation comprises three main issues. 1. The malicious distortion of UNGA Resolution 2758 has become a serious threat to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. The United Nations must take action to address it. 2. UNGA Resolution 2758 does not preclude Taiwan's meaningful participation in the UN system. The United Nations must seek suitable ways of including Taiwan so that Taiwan can better contribute to realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 3. The UN Secretariat must adopt a strictly neutral stance and stop erroneously citing UNGA Resolution 2758. It must also grant Taiwanese nationals and journalists the right to access UN premises for visits, meetings, and newsgathering activities. Over the past eight years, the Taiwan government's stable and steadfast approach to promoting its UN campaigns has received international recognition and encouraged ever more like-minded countries to support its efforts to increase global engagement. Following careful deliberations and considering this past success, the government has again decided to ask permanent representatives to the United Nations from Taiwan's diplomatic allies to write a joint letter to UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres. Officials from diplomatic allies have also been urged to speak up for Taiwan during the General Debate and other UNGA events. To communicate Taiwan's UN bid to the global community directly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung wrote an op-ed entitled &ldquo;To secure peace in the Indo-Pacific, include Taiwan in the UN system.&rdquo; The op-ed has been published in media outlets around the world. The logo and short film for Taiwan's UN campaign this year center on semiconductors and peace, highlighting Taiwan's leading role in global semiconductor supply chains and its strong determination to pursue peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. These efforts aim to foster understanding worldwide that Taiwan&mdash;as a responsible member of the international community&mdash;will implement the Four Pillars of Peace action plan proposed by President Lai Ching-te. Taiwan will continue working with democratic partners to create sustainable supply chains for democracy chips and to advance global prosperity and development. In terms of cross-strait relations, Taiwan will neither yield nor provoke but will maintain the status quo and do its part to ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. During the UNGA, the government will hold related side events and activities in New York to promote a positive image of Taiwan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely thanks legislators from the governing and opposition parties for once again organizing a cross-party delegation to provide guidance in New York. The delegation will explain to the UN community that the prevailing opinion among Taiwan's 23.5 million people is a strong desire for equal participation in the UN system. The United Nations belongs to all humanity. The UN Charter explicitly states that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to develop friendly relations among countries based on respect for the principle of equal rights of peoples. Yet, the United Nations has continued to succumb to pressure from China, ignore the Taiwanese people's legitimate right to UN participation, echo China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758, and thereby seek to rationalize the wrongful and illegitimate exclusion of the Taiwanese people. MOFA deeply regrets the United Nations' actions and expresses its strong displeasure. MOFA extends appreciation to the US government for making a four-point public rebuttal in April regarding the misapplication of UNGA Resolution 2758. It also thanks the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China for adopting a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 in July that could serve as reference for IPAC members when introducing related motions in their respective parliaments. In August, the Australian Senate became the first national parliament to pass such a motion, repudiating the misuse of UNGA Resolution 2758. Moving forward, Taiwan firmly believes that even more countries will stand up and call for justice for Taiwan. To safeguard the Taiwanese people's basic human right to international engagement, the government has campaigned persistently for UN participation since 1993. However, due to China's unreasonable and heavy-handed interference, as well as the UN's blind capitulation to China's pressure, Taiwan has encountered countless difficulties and challenges to its UN bids. Despite this, the Taiwan government has never abandoned its efforts and never will&mdash;it will continue to seek international support. Taiwan once again reminds the United Nations that only by accepting Taiwan's full participation can the world achieve peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future generations.

September 1, 2024No. 287As the Philippine Coast Guard patrol vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua (MRRV-9701) was preparing to raise anchor at Sabina Shoal on August 31, it was deliberately rammed multiple times in intimidating and dangerous maneuvers by a China Coast Guard vessel. This marked the third confrontation between the two sides in the same maritime area in recent days.China has recently cited &ldquo;rights protection&rdquo; as a pretext for using illegal, threatening, coercive, and dangerous maneuvers and other nonpeaceful means to obstruct and interfere with the legal navigation of Philippine vessels, leading to several collisions at sea. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) again strongly condemns China's bullying tactics in repeatedly and intentionally causing confrontations in the same maritime area and escalating tensions in the South China Sea.MOFA reiterates that Taiwan opposes any threat to security in the South China Sea or actions that harm regional peace and stability. It urges all sides to exercise restraint, abide by international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and resolve differences via peaceful means.

August 30, 2024 No. 283 Maori King Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII passed away in the early morning of August 30 at the age of 69, according to statements released by the New Zealand government and the king's office. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) extends sincere condolences over his passing on behalf of the people and government of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Ambassador Joanne Ou, Taiwan Representative to New Zealand, has expressed sympathies to the queen and other family members of King Tuheitia through the king's office on behalf of Taiwan's people and government. King Tuheitia was friendly toward Taiwan. He made multiple visits to Taiwan and maintained cordial relations with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO), New Zealand and TECO in Auckland over the years. During his 18-year reign, King Tuheitia spared no effort in advancing the welfare of the Maori community, earning the love of his people as well as international recognition. Taiwan and New Zealand place great importance on the rights and interests of indigenous peoples, share the core values of freedom and democracy, and maintain close people-to-people exchanges and robust economic and trade cooperation. Taiwan is willing to uphold the spirit of compassion shown by King Tuheitia in working steadily and jointly with New Zealand to deepen friendly bilateral collaboration and enhance the well-being of both peoples.

MOFA response to US National Security Advisor Sullivan stressing ...	August 29, 2024 US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Wang Yi, Director of the Office of the Chinese Communist Party Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister of China, in Beijing on August 27 and 28. A press release issued afterwards by the White House pointed out that National Security Advisor Sullivan had underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait during the meeting. He emphasized concerns about China's support for Russia's defense industrial base and the effect this was having on European and transatlantic security, as well as about China's destabilizing actions in the South China Sea. He also reaffirmed the US commitment to defending its Indo-Pacific allies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes staunch US support for maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and appreciates high-level US officials' again expressing this position during interactions with their Chinese counterparts. In addition, MOFA notes that China again made spurious claims about Taiwan that do not accord with reality in the press release issued following the meeting. MOFA strongly condemns these false narratives and reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. In fact, China's relentless intimidation and suppression of Taiwan and its naked ambition for military expansion pose the greatest risk to regional peace and stability. By accommodating Russia, China has become a key supporter of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, jeopardizing transatlantic security. This also shows that China's ambitions extend beyond Taiwan to other regions, making it a major global threat. China's malicious actions have elicited a high level of concern among the global democratic community. As a responsible member of the international community, Taiwan will continue to enhance its self-defense capabilities and work with the United States and other like-minded partners to jointly safeguard the rules-based international order and preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117959	2024-08-29T01:18:00-07:00	
MOFA strongly condemns Chinaâ€™s dangerous maneuvers against Philip...	August 27, 2024No. 278On August 25, official vessel no. 3002 of the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, heading from Hasa Hasa Shoal toward Sabina Shoal in the South China Sea to carry out a humanitarian supply replenishment, was surrounded by eight Chinese military and coast guard vessels. The Chinese vessels proceeded to engage in dangerous maneuvers, including approaching at close range, spraying water cannons, and even ramming the Philippine vessel. This was the second confrontation between the two sides in the same maritime area this week.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) notes that China has recently taken deliberate action to expand the area of confrontation with the Philippines from Second Thomas Shoal to other locations such as Scarborough Shoal, Sabina Shoal, Sandy Cay, and Subi Reef. Furthermore, China has deployed nearly 100 ships in the South China Sea, including navy, coast guard, maritime militia, and scientific research vessels, and continues to frequently interfere with Philippine humanitarian replenishment missions. At the same time, it is using &ldquo;rights protection&rdquo; as a pretext for using illegal, threatening, coercive, and other nonpeaceful means to interfere with the navigation of other countries' vessels. This is raising regional tensions. MOFA strongly condemns China's hegemonic actions, which are clearly being taken with expansionist objectives in mind.MOFA emphasizes that maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight remains the consensus of the international community. Taiwan opposes any threat to security in the South China Sea or actions that harm the regional status quo of peace and stability. Moreover, it gravely condemns any use of military force or coercion to interfere with other countries' freedom of navigation. Taiwan solemnly urges all sides to exercise restraint, abide by international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and resolve differences via peaceful means.MOFA reiterates that the South China Sea Islands are part of the territory of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and that Taiwan enjoys rights over the South China Seas Islands and associated waters in accordance with international law and the law of the sea. Taiwan will continue to work closely with like-minded countries to monitor developments in the South China Sea and jointly maintain regional peace and stability. The government of Taiwan will continue to handle South China Sea affairs prudently in accordance with the four principles and five actions.

August 27, 2024No. 277A Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft intruded into Japanese airspace near the Danjo Islands, Nagasaki Prefecture, on the morning of August 26, seriously violating Japan's sovereignty and raising regional tensions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns China's reckless infringement on the sovereignty of another country, which has undermined regional peace and stability.Recently, China has been ramping up incursions of military aircraft and vessels into the air defense identification zones and exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan, escalating regional tensions. Moreover, China has been conducting frequent joint military exercises with Russia in the East and South China Seas in an attempt to change the status quo through force. China's military expansionism poses a major threat to the security of countries in the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan and Japan.MOFA solemnly denounces China's behavior and once again calls on China to be rational, show restraint, and immediately stop all actions that undermine peace across the Taiwan Strait and increase regional tensions. As a responsible member of the Indo-Pacific, Taiwan will continue to actively strengthen its self-defense capabilities and cooperate with Japan and other like-minded countries to jointly curb authoritarian expansionism and aggression.
