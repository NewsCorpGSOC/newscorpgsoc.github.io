MOFA response to China using APEC and other key international forums to disparage Taiwan’s sovereignty and spread falsehoods intended to confuse inter...	November 16, 2024 Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on November 15 on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. After the meeting, China publicly announced that Singapore fully understood the Chinese government's position on the Taiwan issue, opposed any form of Taiwan independence, and staunchly abided by the &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; However, since the Singaporean government has verifiably not made any such declaration, China's statement is unmistakably false. In addition to once again publishing untrue remarks about Taiwan on behalf of another country without its consent, China has repeatedly made erroneous statements misstating other countries' positions with the intention of confusing international public opinion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) solemnly condemns and refutes the Chinese government for repeatedly spreading falsehoods and lies among the international community that disparage Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA urges the international community to jointly denounce China's peremptory actions, which unilaterally and deliberately undermine regional peace and stability.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118628	2024-11-15T18:56:00-08:00	
MOFA response to claim made in China-Peru joint statement that Peru reiterates staunch commitment to -one China principle-	November 15, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a bilateral meeting with Peruvian President Dina Boluarte on November 14 while in Peru to attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. Following the meeting, a joint statement was issued that made the gratuitous claim that Peru had reiterated its staunch commitment to the &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) gravely protests and condemns China and Peru for making such unwarranted statements, which disparage Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA reiterates that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign and independent nation; that neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other; and that the PRC has never governed Taiwan for even a single day. These facts are understood throughout the world. Taiwan is a modern, democratic nation that actively defends its democratic system and respects human rights and the rule of law. No statement distorting Taiwan's sovereign status can alter the international consensus as to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. On the occasion of hosting a major international conference, the government of Peru has failed to consider the spirit of cordiality that exists between nations. Instead, it has unilaterally followed the Chinese government's one-sided &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo; and confused international public opinion. This is most certainly not what the leaders of participating APEC member economies would have wanted to see. MOFA urges Peru to recognize China's attempts to infiltrate Latin American countries by appealing to their economic and trade interests. Indeed, MOFA calls on Peru to no longer follow the falsehood that is the &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; maliciously disparage Taiwan's sovereignty, or serve as an accomplice in fueling regional tensions. MOFA solemnly reiterates that the staunch desire of the Taiwanese people to defend the values of freedom and democracy is indisputable and not to be underestimated. MOFA urges the international community to jointly denounce the Chinese government's peremptory actions, which unilaterally and deliberately undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118630	2024-11-14T23:00:00-08:00

In addition, the heads of delegations from Belize, Eswatini, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Paraguay, Saint Christopher and Nevis, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines produced videos urging support for Taiwan's participation in INTERPOL.Like-minded countries have also continued to publicly call for Taiwan's engagement with INTERPOL and other international organizations on numerous occasions. The Group of Seven (G7) Leaders' Communiqu&eacute; and the chair's statement issued after the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting both reaffirmed support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. Joint statements released following the UK-Australia Ministerial Consultations and the France-Australia Foreign and Defense Ministerial Consultations also backed Taiwan's involvement in the global arena.In addition, representative offices of like-minded nations demonstrated support for Taiwan on social media platforms. The American Institute in Taiwan shared Taiwan's INTERPOL campaign film on its official Facebook page, calling for Taiwan's substantive and meaningful participation in the international community as well as in collective efforts to advance global security. The Australian Office posted Taiwan's INTERPOL campaign logo on its official social media accounts to express support and called for active collaboration among law enforcement agencies worldwide to combat transnational crime. Support from various parliaments was also strong. The European Parliament, the Czech Senate, the Dutch House of Representatives, the Saint Christopher and Nevis National Assembly, the Guam Legislature, and other parliaments adopted resolutions endorsing Taiwan's participation in INTERPOL. The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, the Australian Senate, the Canadian House of Commons, the Italian Chamber of Deputies, and the Guatemalan Congress also passed resolutions backing Taiwan's participation in international organizations.

Related posts on MOFA's new media accounts, including Facebook, X, Instagram, and Threads, were seen over 235,000 times.MOFA emphasizes that the global security map is incomplete without Taiwan. Taiwan's exclusion from INTERPOL undermines concerted efforts to maintain global security and jeopardizes the welfare of people worldwide. Taiwan is both willing and able to work with the international community to combat transnational crime. It urges INTERPOL to uphold the principles of professionalism and neutrality, swiftly include Taiwan in the global law enforcement network, and work with Taiwan on joint efforts to ensure international security.

Subsequent to this, China announced both the baselines of territorial waters around Huangyan Island (Scarborough Shoal) and standard names and geographic coordinates for 64 islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The government of the ROC (Taiwan) solemnly states that the Philippines' enactment of the two aforementioned domestic laws and China's demarcation of the baselines of territorial waters around Huangyan Island and the naming of certain islands and reefs in the South China Sea do not change the fact that the South China Sea islands are part of ROC (Taiwan) territory.

MOFA urges all parties to exercise restraint and peacefully resolve South China Sea issues through multilateral dialogue and dispute settlement mechanisms, and it calls for Taiwan's inclusion in such dialogue and mechanisms on the basis of equality. MOFA reiterates that the position of the ROC (Taiwan) on South China Sea issues is as follows: 1. The South China Sea islands are part of ROC (Taiwan) territory. That the ROC (Taiwan) is entitled to all rights over the South China Sea islands and their relevant waters in accordance with international law and the law of the sea is beyond dispute. 2. The ROC (Taiwan) supports freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint PRC-Indonesia statement issued by PRC	November 11, 2024Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during a visit to China from November 8 to 10. After the meeting, China issued the Joint Statement Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on Advancing the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and the China-Indonesia Community with a Shared Future, which declares that &ldquo;Indonesia reiterates its consistent adherence to [a] one-China principle, which is reaffirmed by the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, and its recognition . . . that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.&rdquo;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly protests and condemns these false claims. It reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; that the Chinese communist regime has never governed Taiwan; and that no narrative distorting Taiwan's sovereign status can change the internationally recognized status quo across the Taiwan Strait. MOFA also points out that UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan and has nothing to do with Taiwan. It stresses that the resolution neither reflects nor is equivalent to China's so-called &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Given China's continuing malicious misrepresentation of the resolution and its attempts to mislead the international community, MOFA calls on countries worldwide to come together to counter China's spurious claims.

October 27, 2024 No. 371 On October 25, during his visit to Guatemala, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung met with President Bernardo Ar&eacute;valo, Foreign Minister Carlos Mart&iacute;nez, and other senior officials. He also toured the neonatal building of San Juan de Dios Hospital, which finished construction this year with assistance from Taiwan. While at the new building, Minister Lin interacted with families that benefited from the joint endeavor, giving him the opportunity to better understand the fruits of Taiwan-Guatemala collaboration. Hospital Director Erika P&eacute;rez and Pediatrics Department Chief Juan Carlos Reyes introduced the facilities and functions of the building to Minister Lin when he toured the neonatal building in the morning. Accompanied by Guatemalan Minister of Public Health and Social Assistance Joaqu&iacute;n Barnoya, Minister Lin attended a traditional Taiwanese ceremony to bless infants and gave gifts to the attending families. In his remarks at San Juan de Dios Hospital, Minister Lin stated that, in addition to the joint construction of the hospital's neonatal building, Taiwan's technical mission and Guatemala are working on a program to promote maternal and neonatal health care. The initiative will assist in training medical professionals at hospitals and birth centers in Guatemala City to enhance their ability to give women clinical care before, during, and after childbirth and reduce premature birth and infant mortality risks, benefiting 70,000 people each year. It will also arrange for related personnel from Guatemala to travel to Taiwan for training. Over 450 health care professionals are expected to receive training, thereby raising the quality of services available to women and children in Guatemala. It took just 12 months for Taiwan and Guatemala to complete the planning and construction of the neonatal building of San Juan de Dios Hospital, which has helped improve maternal and neonatal care. The important project has been met with wide approval from the government and civil society of Guatemala. In the afternoon, Minister Lin called at Guatemala's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet with Minister Mart&iacute;nez, who invited him to view bamboo planted by Taiwan's technical mission in the square outside the building. The plants commemorate 90 years of friendship and diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Guatemala. (E)	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118511	2024-10-27T03:57:00-07:00

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) thanks the United States, Japan, and the ROK for continuing to jointly reiterate the importance of cross-strait peace and stability through high-level meetings of national security officials and diplomats, underscoring the high degree of international consensus on maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the region.

US government officially notifies Taiwan of latest arms sale	October 26, 2024 No. 367 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has received official notification from the United States government that its executive branch has informed Congress of a US$1.988 billion arms sale to Taiwan, including the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System as well as L-band and non-L-band radar turnkey systems. MOFA warmly welcomes this news and thanks the US government for continuing to provide the weaponry and services needed for Taiwan's defense and for honoring its security commitments as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances. This is the 17th arms sale to Taiwan announced during the Biden administration. It continues the US policy of normalized arms sales that ensure Taiwan has adequate self-defense capabilities. The sale reflects the US government's unwavering support for strengthening Taiwan's defensive resilience and deterrence capabilities and demonstrates its high regard for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. China has stepped up pressure recently by again holding large-scale military drills in the waters around Taiwan. It is increasingly using live-fire exercises as a pretext for infringing upon the freedom of navigation of shipping of other countries. MOFA welcomes continuing concrete action by the United States and other like-minded partners that display support for the cross-strait status quo of peace and stability. In the face of threats posed by China, Taiwan will not shirk its self-defense responsibilities. It will continue to show a determination to protect itself, enhance its defensive capabilities and resilience, staunchly uphold its free and democratic way of life, and pursue peace through strength. Furthermore, it will work to deepen the close Taiwan-US security partnership so as to jointly safeguard the rules-based international order and advance peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific.

MOFA welcomes European Parliament resolution on PRC’s misinterpretation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and continuous military provocations against Taiwan	October 25, 2024No. 365The European Parliament (EP) on October 24 adopted a resolution concerning the misinterpretation of United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 by the People's Republic of China and its continuous military provocations around Taiwan by an overwhelming majority of 432 votes in favor and 60 against. The EP resolution strongly opposes the PRC distorting UNGA Resolution 2758 to block Taiwan's international participation and calls on the European Union and its member states to support Taiwan's meaningful participation in relevant international organizations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates this support. The EP resolution points out that UNGA Resolution 2758 addresses the status of the PRC but does not determine that the PRC enjoys sovereignty over Taiwan, nor does it make any judgement on the future inclusion of Taiwan in the UN or any other international organization. It also states that Taiwan has never been part of the PRC. Stressing that UNGA Resolution 2758 takes no position on Taiwan, the EP resolution strongly rejects and refutes the PRC's attempts to distort history and international rules and thereby block Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. It also strongly condemns the PRC's continued military provocations and gray-zone activities against Taiwan and reiterates the EU's firm rejection of any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.Pointing out that Taiwan is a key, like-minded partner of the EU in the Indo-Pacific, the EP resolution calls for the EU and its member states to further deepen cooperation and exchanges with Taiwan in such domains as the economy, investment, semiconductor and high-tech industrial supply chains, disaster management, civil protection, and countering disinformation and foreign interference. It also advocates continued support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Criminal Police Organization, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and other multilateral organizations. In addition, the EP welcomes closer official and people-to-people interactions and exchanges between Taiwan and the EU, including the recent visit of former President Tsai Ing-wen to the EP.Since the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China passed a model resolution concerning UNGA Resolution 2758 in July for its members' reference, the Australian Senate and the Dutch House of Representatives have passed motions in support of Taiwan. The EP thus becomes the third parliament to approve a similar resolution. MOFA urges the global community to take concrete action to oppose China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and to refute China's false claim that there is an international consensus on its so-called &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Taiwan will continue to enhance its substantive and comprehensive cooperation with the EU and other like-minded partners to jointly ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific.
