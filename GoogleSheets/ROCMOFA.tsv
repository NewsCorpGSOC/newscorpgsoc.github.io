Foreign Minister Lin hosts welcome luncheon for Polish parliamentary delegation led by Deputy Senate Marshal Kamiński	December 13, 2024 No. 459 Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung on December 12 hosted a luncheon to welcome a parliamentary delegation from the Republic of Poland led by Deputy Senate Marshal Michał Kamiński. During the event, the two sides exchanged views on regional developments, Taiwan-Poland relations, and economic and trade exchanges. Minister Lin pointed out that both Taiwan and Poland had previously gone through periods of authoritarian rule but had since chosen the path of democracy. He remarked that bilateral relations had steadily advanced in recent years in such areas as the economy, trade, higher education, law enforcement, and science and technology. Minister Lin also affirmed that Taiwan would continue to work with Poland and other like-minded countries to bolster democratic resilience, deepen Taiwan-Europe economic and trade linkages, and forge resilient democratic supply chains throughout the world. Furthermore, Minister Lin noted that the Polish-Taiwanese Parliamentarian Group released statements in April last year and May this year advocating Taiwan's international participation and expressing concern over peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He thanked friends from the Polish parliament for taking such concrete action in support of Taiwan and added that he looked forward to further collaborating in the future and deepening bilateral interactions and exchanges. In his remarks, Deputy Senate Marshal Kamiński stated that Taiwan and Poland could learn from each other through exchanges in such fields as culture, the economy and trade, science and technology, and academia. He also said that due to Poland's considerable economic development potential, many major Taiwanese enterprises had already invested in Poland, including Chi Mei Frozen Food and Compal, and that he anticipated that even more Taiwanese businesses would seek to develop market opportunities in Poland. Taiwan and Poland share such universal values as freedom and democracy. In the future, the two countries will continue to work closely together to jointly promote prosperity and progress and protect hard-earned democratic achievements.

MOFA response to Czech Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee adopting resolution on China’s misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758	December 13, 2024 The Czech Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee on December 12 adopted a resolution on the misrepresentation of United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 by the People's Republic of China and support for Taiwan's participation in international organizations. In the resolution, the committee opposed China's inappropriate conflation of UNGA Resolution 2758 with its &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; rejected China's claim that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and advocated for Taiwan's international participation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates this support from the Czech Republic. The resolution stated that UNGA Resolution 2758 merely addressed China's representation in the UN; that it did not mention Taiwan or address its political status or participation in the international community; that it did not establish PRC sovereignty over Taiwan; and that it did not make any decision regarding Taiwan's inclusion in the UN or any other international organization. Furthermore, the resolution opposed China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and urged China to respect its content and to stop misusing it for its own political ends. The resolution also endorsed Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations, including the World Health Organization, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the International Civil Aviation Organization, and the International Criminal Police Organization. MOFA thanks the Czech Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee for speaking in favor of justice for Taiwan and urges the international community to continue to take concrete action to counter China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758. Taiwan will continue to work with like-minded partners around the world to jointly safeguard the core values shared by the global democratic community and to preserve regional peace, stability, and prosperity.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118816	2024-12-13T01:36:00-08:00	
MOFA response to Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi expressing strong concern over China’s military exercises around first island chain	December 12, 2024During a regular press conference on December 11, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi stressed that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait were paramount to the security of Japan and the stability of the entire international community. He made the comments in response to the Chinese People's Liberation Army deploying large numbers of naval and coast guard vessels around the first island chain for days-long, large-scale military exercises. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) appreciates and welcomes the Japanese government's public expression of strong support for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi said that the Japanese government had directly conveyed to China its high regard for cross-strait peace at the Japan-China summit in November. He added that Japan would initiate comprehensive countermeasures, further monitor movements in the surrounding waters and airspace, remain alert to subsequent developments, and work closely with the United States and other allies to respond to any situation.Maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is a matter of international consensus. China's large-scale military maritime operations have seriously undermined regional peace and stability. MOFA again calls on China to exercise reason and self-restraint and cease all actions that threaten Taiwan and escalate tensions in the region.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118818	2024-12-12T02:32:00-08:00

MOFA responds to China’s military activities around first island chain; urges international community to jointly safeguard cross-strait peace and stab...	December 11, 2024 No. 457 China has recently deployed large numbers of PLA Navy and China Coast Guard vessels around the first island chain for days-long military exercises. It has also repeatedly dispatched military aircraft and vessels to harass Taiwan, unilaterally disrupting peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, unnecessarily escalating regional tensions, and interfering with regular international shipping and trade. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) demands that the Beijing authorities immediately cease their military intimidation and all other unreasonable behavior that is jeopardizing regional peace and stability. An international consensus has been reached on the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region. Although cross-strait and regional developments are closely followed by the international community, China continues to ramp up rhetorical and military intimidation against Taiwan. China's large-scale military buildup around the first island chain has created uncertainty and risk, giving countries in the region cause for concern. This underscores the fact that China is a destabilizing force that is undermining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. China's provocative actions toward Taiwan and other countries in the region are a clear violation of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that all countries must refrain from the threat or use of force to infringe on the territorial sovereignty of another country. MOFA solemnly demands that China immediately stop violating international law and demonstrate that it can be a responsible major power. Taiwan will do its utmost to fulfill its international responsibilities, calmly respond to China's military threats, staunchly safeguard its sovereignty and national security, and firmly defend democracy and freedom. MOFA urges democratic partners worldwide to unite with Taiwan to jointly counter authoritarian expansionism and encroachment, prevent repeated attempts to unilaterally and deliberately disrupt the status quo, uphold the rules-based international order, and together preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific.

In the joint statement issued after the meeting, they reiterated the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, opposed unilateral changes to the status quo, and expressed concern over the situation in the South China Sea. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes and appreciates this statement. Australia and New Zealand are important friends of Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific region, and bilateral relations with both countries have made significant strides in recent years. Given that maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea has become a global consensus, MOFA invites the international community to continue expressing its concerns and take practical action to uphold the rules-based international order. The Taiwan government will continue to promote values-based diplomacy and work with like-minded countries to advance democracy, peace, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.

A renowned multilateral development bank with an excellent credit rating, it assists countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, West Asia, North Africa, and other regions in gradually transitioning to market economies and democratic and pluralistic societies. Taiwan is an important cooperation partner of the EBRD. In 2006, it established the TaiwanBusiness-EBRD Technical Cooperation Fund, which has since helped finance over 400 EBRD projects. Taiwan proactively supports EBRD efforts to promote socioeconomic development in beneficiary countries and creates business opportunities for Taiwanese companies, achieving win-win outcomes.

MOFA response to Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declaring firm opposition to President Lai’s US transit stop	December 1, 2024 In response to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declaring firm opposition to Republic of China (Taiwan) President Lai Ching-te making a transit stop in the United States, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reiterates that the ROC (Taiwan) is an independent and sovereign nation; that neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; and that the PRC has never governed Taiwan for a single day. President Lai's stopover in the United States en route to Pacific allies to consolidate friendships is in accordance with customary practice and is an exercise of the legitimate rights of a sovereign nation. MOFA underlines that transit stops made by ROC (Taiwan) presidents are arranged pursuant to long-standing practice. The United States has followed this practice by extending assistance in accordance with the principles of safety, dignity, convenience, and comfort. MOFA thanks the United States for its assistance, which demonstrates that Taiwan-US relations are closer and more cordial than ever before. MOFA further asserts that any overreaction by China to the president of the ROC (Taiwan) conducting normal travel duties would represent an irresponsible attempt to damage regional peace and stability and be subject to the condemnation of the international community.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118745	2024-12-01T04:43:00-08:00

MOFA warmly welcomes this news and thanks the US government for continuing to provide the weaponry and services needed for Taiwan's defense and for honoring its security commitments as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances. This is the 18th arms sale to Taiwan announced during the Biden administration. It continues the US policy of normalized arms sales that ensure Taiwan has adequate self-defense capabilities and reliable defense capacity in response to China's threats. The sale highlights the US government's firm support for bolstering Taiwan's defense resilience and its high regard for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan will continue to demonstrate its commitment to self-defense in response to China's recurrent military pressure and gray-zone intrusion in the waters and airspace around Taiwan. It will strengthen national defense and whole-of-society resilience, staunchly defend its free and democratic way of life, seek peace through strength, and deepen its close security partnership with the United States. MOFA welcomes further concrete action by the United States and other like-minded partners that advances peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the Indo-Pacific.

MOFA response to UK parliament passing motion reaffirming that UNGA Resolution 2758 did not determine Taiwan’s status	November 29, 2024 Following a debate on November 28, the UK House of Commons unanimously passed a motion on the international status of Taiwan affirming that United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 did not mention Taiwan or establish PRC sovereignty over Taiwan and was silent on the status of Taiwan in the UN. Responding to the motion on behalf of the UK government, Catherine West, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Indo-Pacific at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, stated that the United Kingdom was of the view that UNGA Resolution 2758 decided that only the People's Republic of China should represent China at the UN, that it did not determine the status of Taiwan, and that it should not therefore be used to preclude Taiwan's meaningful participation in the UN or the wider international system. She pointed out that the United Kingdom opposed any attempt to broaden the interpretation of the resolution to rewrite history, which she said would not be in the interests of the Taiwanese people, the United Kingdom, or the global community. The passage of this motion by the UK parliament underscored its staunch support for Taiwan. Furthermore, through Ms. West's comments, the UK government publicly expressed for the first time its position on UNGA Resolution 2758 and underlined Taiwan's wrongful exclusion from important international cooperation and dialogue mechanisms. This marked a new milestone in Taiwan's efforts to counter China's distortion of the resolution. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates the support of the United Kingdom. The motion was introduced by Blair McDougall, a member of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, and cosigned by 16 members of parliament from the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National Party, and other political parties, including British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group Chair Sarah Champion and Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) Cochair for the United Kingdom Iain Duncan Smith. It fully demonstrated the firm commitment of both governing and opposition parliamentarians in the United Kingdom to supporting Taiwan's international status and participation. The UK House of Commons was the fifth national parliament in the world&mdash;after Australia, the Netherlands, Guatemala, and Canada&mdash;to pass such a motion since IPAC adopted a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 for its members' reference at its annual summit in July. The European Parliament has also approved a similar measure. MOFA sincerely thanks all parties once again for their support.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118749	2024-11-29T01:49:00-08:00

Foreign Minister Lin leads delegation to Drone Industry Business Forum, seeks to create democratic supply chain with Lithuania	November 22, 2024No. 427 Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung led a 59-member delegation from the Taiwan Excellence Drone International Business Opportunities Alliance (TEDIBOA) and 20 related Taiwanese companies to Vilnius, Lithuania, to attend the Drone Industry Business Forum on November 21. The event was cohosted by the Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania and Lithuania's Innovation Agency. Minister Lin and Legislator Wang Ting-yu, Convener of the Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, delivered remarks on Taiwan's behalf. Vice Minister of National Defense Monika Koroliovienė, Director of the Innovation Agency Romualda Stragienė, and President of the Lithuanian Confederation of Industrialists (LPK) Vidmantas Janulevičius spoke on behalf of Lithuania. During the forum, Minister Lin also witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the TEDIBOA and the Lithuanian Defense and Security Industries Association (LGSPA), which underlined the commitment of Taiwan and Lithuania to jointly establishing a democratic drone supply chain. In his remarks, Minister Lin spoke about the serious threat posed by such authoritarian states as China and Russia as they continued to deploy gray-zone tactics, economic coercion, and other means to pressure democratic nations. Noting that the security of Europe and the Indo-Pacific were closely interconnected, he urged like-minded partners to come together to safeguard their hard-won free and democratic way of life. Explaining that President Lai Ching-te had identified the Five Trusted Industry Sectors in a bid to bolster economic resilience through Taiwan's innovative and technological strengths, Minister Lin said that Taiwan would employ integrated diplomacy to reinforce economic and trade collaboration with partners worldwide and thereby promote mutual prosperity. He also stated that Taiwan had already proven to the world that it was an indispensable partner in democratic supply chains and that it would continue to share its experience with Lithuania and other democracies. He described the development of close bilateral ties since the opening of Taiwan's representative office in Vilnius as a model for mutual assistance and cooperation between democratic countries. He said that, given the potential for drone industrial development in Taiwan and Lithuania, he was confident that this new domain would become a success story of bilateral collaboration, and added that Taiwan looked forward to working with the new government of Lithuania to further enhance a bilateral partnership of mutual benefit and shared prosperity. Also speaking at the forum, Legislator Wang said that he had accompanied Minister Lin on the trip to demonstrate Taiwan's support for Lithuania. He pointed out that since both countries stood on the front line of democracy against the threat of authoritarian expansion by such regimes as China and Russia, they should engage in close industrial cooperation so as to jointly enhance economic resilience. Citing Taiwan's commitment to a spirit of supreme excellence for producing the robust manufacturing base that prevailed in the country today, Legislator Wang pledged that Taiwan would uphold this enterprising approach in the drone sector and work steadfastly with like-minded partners to bolster democratic supply chains. Vice Minister Koroliovienė noted in her remarks that Taiwan and Lithuania shared the values of freedom and democracy and that Lithuania anticipated building on this solid existing foundation to strengthen bilateral cooperation. She said that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the threat to democratic countries from authoritarian expansion highlighted the urgent need to enhance national defense and all-out civilian defense, as well as to strengthen asymmetric capabilities through the development of the drone and counterdrone industries. She stated that Lithuania would continue to deepen cooperation with Indo-Pacific countries and that it hoped to pursue strategic collaboration with Taiwan in the drone industry so as to create a democratic defense supply chain. Director Stragienė and LPK President Janulevičius conveyed similar expectations in their remarks. This first Drone Industry Business Forum coorganized by Taiwan and Lithuania attracted participants from more than 40 companies from Lithuania and Ukraine. Interactions were lively at the event, which was attended by more than 200 people, including officials from the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of the Economy and Innovation. With staunch government support from both sides, Taiwan and Lithuania will use this platform to foster industrial linkages and jointly create business opportunities in drone markets in Europe and beyond. Minister Lin's presence at the head of the delegation to the forum underscored the importance he places on the bilateral partnership and his commitment to engage proactively with Lithuania's new government.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint statement between PRC and Brazil	November 21, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Brazilian President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva on November 20 signed and issued the Joint Statement Between the People's Republic of China and the Federative Republic of Brazil on Jointly Building the China-Brazil Community with a Shared Future for a More Just World and a More Sustainable Planet. According to the statement, Brazil reiterated support for the &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo; and said that Taiwan was an inalienable part of Chinese territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly protests and condemns these spurious claims that undermine Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA reiterates that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is an independent and sovereign nation; that neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; and that the PRC has never governed Taiwan for a single day. These are objective and universally understood facts. Taiwan is a modern, democratic nation that actively defends its democratic system and respects human rights and the rule of law. No statement distorting Taiwan's sovereign status can alter the international consensus as to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. Brazil is a country that pursues the core values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. MOFA calls on the government of Brazil to recognize the malevolent intentions behind China's Belt and Road Initiative, to no longer echo the false narrative pushed by China through the so-called &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; to refrain from maliciously disparaging Taiwan's sovereignty, and to avoid becoming an accomplice in authoritarian China's attempts to jeopardize regional peace and stability. MOFA reaffirms the Taiwanese people's staunch commitment to upholding the values of freedom and democracy and urges the international community to jointly condemn China's unilateral actions aimed at disrupting cross-strait peace and stability.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118699	2024-11-20T19:55:00-08:00
