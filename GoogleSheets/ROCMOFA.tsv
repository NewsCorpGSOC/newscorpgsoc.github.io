September 1, 2024No. 287As the Philippine Coast Guard patrol vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua (MRRV-9701) was preparing to raise anchor at Sabina Shoal on August 31, it was deliberately rammed multiple times in intimidating and dangerous maneuvers by a China Coast Guard vessel. This marked the third confrontation between the two sides in the same maritime area in recent days.China has recently cited &ldquo;rights protection&rdquo; as a pretext for using illegal, threatening, coercive, and dangerous maneuvers and other nonpeaceful means to obstruct and interfere with the legal navigation of Philippine vessels, leading to several collisions at sea. The&nbsp;Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) again strongly condemns China&rsquo;s bullying tactics in repeatedly and intentionally causing confrontations in the same maritime area and escalating tensions in the South China Sea.MOFA reiterates that Taiwan opposes any threat to security in the South China Sea or actions that harm regional peace and stability. It urges all sides to exercise restraint, abide by international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and resolve differences via peaceful means. Taiwan will continue to work closely with like-minded countries to monitor developments in the South China Sea and jointly maintain regional peace and stability.

MOFA response to US National Security Advisor Sullivan stressing cross-strait peace during meeting w...	August 29, 2024&nbsp; US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Wang Yi, Director of the Office of the Chinese Communist Party Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister of China, in Beijing on August 27 and 28. A press release issued afterwards by the White House pointed out that National Security Advisor Sullivan had underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait during the meeting. He emphasized concerns about China&rsquo;s support for Russia&rsquo;s defense industrial base and the effect this was having on European and transatlantic security, as well as about China&rsquo;s destabilizing actions in the South China Sea. He also reaffirmed the US commitment to defending its Indo-Pacific allies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes staunch US support for maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and appreciates high-level US officials&rsquo; again expressing this position during interactions with their Chinese counterparts. &nbsp; In addition, MOFA notes that China again made spurious claims about Taiwan that do not accord with reality in the press release issued following the meeting. MOFA strongly condemns these false narratives and reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People&rsquo;s Republic of China is subordinate to the other. In fact, China&rsquo;s relentless intimidation and suppression of Taiwan and its naked ambition for military expansion pose the greatest risk to regional peace and stability. By accommodating Russia, China has become a key supporter of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, jeopardizing transatlantic security. This also shows that China&rsquo;s ambitions extend beyond Taiwan to other regions, making it a major global threat. China&rsquo;s malicious actions have elicited a high level of concern among the global democratic community. &nbsp; As a responsible member of the international community, Taiwan will continue to enhance its self-defense capabilities and work with the United States and other like-minded partners to jointly safeguard the rules-based international order and preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117959	2024-08-29T01:18:00-07:00	
MOFA strongly condemns China’s dangerous maneuvers against Philippine vessel in South China Sea	August 27, 2024No. 278On August 25, official vessel no. 3002 of the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, heading from Hasa Hasa Shoal toward Sabina Shoal in the South China Sea to carry out a humanitarian supply replenishment, was surrounded by eight Chinese military and coast guard vessels. The Chinese vessels proceeded to engage in dangerous maneuvers, including approaching at close range, spraying water cannons, and even ramming the Philippine vessel. This was the second confrontation between the two sides in the same maritime area this week.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) notes that China has recently taken deliberate action to expand the area of confrontation with the Philippines from Second Thomas Shoal to other locations such as Scarborough Shoal, Sabina Shoal, Sandy Cay, and Subi Reef. Furthermore, China has deployed nearly 100 ships in the South China Sea, including navy, coast guard, maritime militia, and scientific research vessels, and continues to frequently interfere with Philippine humanitarian replenishment missions. At the same time, it is using &ldquo;rights protection&rdquo; as a pretext for using illegal, threatening, coercive, and other nonpeaceful means to interfere with the navigation of other countries&rsquo; vessels. This is raising regional tensions. MOFA strongly condemns China&rsquo;s hegemonic actions, which are clearly being taken with expansionist objectives in mind.MOFA emphasizes that maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight remains the consensus of the international community. Taiwan opposes any threat to security in the South China Sea or actions that harm the regional status quo of peace and stability. Moreover, it gravely condemns any use of military force or coercion to interfere with other countries&rsquo; freedom of navigation. Taiwan solemnly urges all sides to exercise restraint, abide by international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and resolve differences via peaceful means.MOFA reiterates that the South China Sea Islands are part of the territory of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and that Taiwan enjoys rights over the South China Seas Islands and associated waters in accordance with international law and the law of the sea. Taiwan will continue to work closely with like-minded countries to monitor developments in the South China Sea and jointly maintain regional peace and stability. The government of Taiwan will continue to handle South China Sea affairs prudently in accordance with the four principles and five actions.

MOFA strongly condemns China for reckless incursion into Japanese airspace	August 27, 2024No. 277A Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft intruded into Japanese airspace near the Danjo Islands, Nagasaki Prefecture, on the morning of August 26, seriously violating Japan&rsquo;s sovereignty and raising regional tensions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns China&rsquo;s reckless infringement on the sovereignty of another country, which has undermined regional peace and stability.Recently, China has been ramping up incursions of military aircraft and vessels into the air defense identification zones and exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan, escalating regional tensions. Moreover, China has been conducting frequent joint military exercises with Russia in the East and South China Seas in an attempt to change the status quo through force. China&rsquo;s military expansionism poses a major threat to the security of countries in the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan and Japan.MOFA solemnly denounces China&rsquo;s behavior and once again calls on China to be rational, show restraint, and immediately stop all actions that undermine peace across the Taiwan Strait and increase regional tensions. As a responsible member of the Indo-Pacific, Taiwan will continue to actively strengthen its self-defense capabilities and cooperate with Japan and other like-minded countries to jointly curb authoritarian expansionism and aggression.

MOFA response to Chinese government’s continued attempts to use economic coercion to engage in polit...	August 24, 2024The Chinese government has for many years pressured enterprises to comply with its political objectives through such coercive tactics as boycotts, sanctions, tax investigations, and allegations of illegal activities. Moreover, in recent years, it has used the so-called &ldquo;little pinks&rdquo; and other jingoist Chinese nationalists to stir up online abuse against selected targets. Through this disruptive behavior, as well as associated denunciations by local collaborators in related countries, China has attempted to impose pressure or incite fear, and force compromises and concessions upon companies worldwide.In July 2023, an internationally renowned jewelry brand was subjected to criticism by Chinese state media, and insults and intimidation by hordes of Chinese netizens, after it was alleged that the company had listed Taiwan as a country on its official websites outside of China. Elsewhere, when the Canadian government expelled a Chinese diplomat based in Toronto in May 2023, the &ldquo;little pink&rdquo; movement promptly instigated a boycott against Canadian products. These are but two of a long list of examples.&nbsp;In addition to international enterprises, individuals from any sector in any country may also become targets of economic coercion by the Chinese government. Last month, Chinese netizens compiled a list of 94 Taiwanese entertainers who had not stated that Taiwan belonged to China at the time President Lai Ching-te assumed office, pressuring them to take a stand. This is one of many blatant examples of coercion.The Beijing authorities&rsquo; use of &ldquo;little pink&rdquo; campaigns is a very clear element in China&rsquo;s cognitive warfare against Taiwan and the international community. However, just like its wolf-warrior diplomacy, this will only arouse aversion among the global community and further tarnish its international image.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Republic of China (Taiwan) strongly condemns authoritarian China for using such tactics as economic coercion to engage in political manipulation and thereby influence businesses&rsquo; international commercial activities. In addition, MOFA urges the international community to recognize China&rsquo;s ubiquitous application of cognitive warfare tactics. It encourages the international community to work together to counter coercive actions by China&rsquo;s authoritarian government and curb the CCP regime&rsquo;s insatiable aspiration for advancement, as well as its continuous undermining of the rules-based international order and routine commercial activities.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117928	2024-08-24T01:53:00-07:00	
MOFA thanks Australian Senate for passing unanimous motion supporting Taiwan’s international partici...	August 22, 2024 &nbsp;No. 270 &nbsp;The Australian Senate on August 21 passed an urgency motion stating that United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 does not establish the People&rsquo;s Republic of China&rsquo;s sovereignty over Taiwan. The motion added that the resolution determines neither the future status of Taiwan in the United Nations nor Taiwanese participation in UN agencies or international organizations. The motion, moved by Deputy Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade David Fawcett and Chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Financial Services Deborah O&rsquo;Neill, was passed unanimously. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly affirms and sincerely thanks the Australian Parliament for its firm support of Taiwan&rsquo;s international participation. &nbsp; Senators Fawcett and O&rsquo;Neill are both staunch friends of Taiwan and visited in July to attend the annual summit of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC). Following IPAC&rsquo;s approval of a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 for use by national parliaments, Australia has now become the first country to pass a related motion in its parliament. &nbsp; MOFA thanks Australia and IPAC for righteously speaking out for Taiwan and calls on the international community to oppose China&rsquo;s misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758, as well as its attempts to erroneously conflate the resolution with its so-called &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Taiwan will continue to cooperate with Australia and other like-minded partners so as to jointly defend the core values shared by the global democratic camp and safeguard peace, stability, and prosperity throughout the region.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in PRC’s joint statements with Vietnam and Fiji	August 21, 2024Following a meeting on August 19, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and President of Vietnam To Lam issued a joint statement on further strengthening the bilateral comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and building a Vietnam-China community with a shared future. Chinese leader Xi issued another joint statement with Prime Minister of Fiji Sitiveni Rabuka after a meeting on August 20. Both statements falsely claimed that Taiwan was an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly refutes such claims.MOFA solemnly reaffirms that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a free and democratic country and that neither democratic Taiwan nor totalitarian China is subordinate to the other. These are long-standing, objective, and internationally recognized facts, as well as the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan has never been governed by the PRC, nor has it ever been part of the PRC. Only the democratically elected government of Taiwan has the right to represent the Taiwanese people in the United Nations system and the international arena. China and countries deferring to it have no say in the matter. MOFA strongly condemns and protests the Chinese government&rsquo;s repeated use of meetings with leaders of other countries to make false claims aimed at undermining Taiwan&rsquo;s sovereignty and misleading the international community.MOFA again urges countries deferring to China to not ignore history and to recognize that China is a totalitarian and autocratic regime. MOFA calls on them to refrain from blindly abetting China&rsquo;s deceitful narratives, which only distort the truth, maliciously undermine Taiwan&rsquo;s sovereignty, attempt to rationalize China&rsquo;s expansionist ambitions, and increase international instability.&nbsp;Taiwan will continue to steadfastly safeguard the values of freedom and democracy and bolster cooperation with democratic partners to jointly deter authoritarian expansionism; staunchly ensure cross-strait peace and security; and preserve a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117913	2024-08-20T23:49:00-07:00

August 20, 2024No. 267While visiting Australia from August 15 to 16, Prime Minister of New Zealand Christopher Luxon held bilateral talks with Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese. In a joint statement issued after their meeting, the leaders reaffirmed the importance of cross-strait peace and stability and expressed concern over rising tensions across the Taiwan Strait.

It called on all parties to adhere to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, de-escalate tensions, and resolve maritime disputes peacefully in accordance with international law.&nbsp;Maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea has become a matter of global consensus. MOFA welcomes that like-minded countries are continuing to focus attention on the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea at international events and take concrete actions to uphold the rules-based international order.

US Democratic National Convention adopts party platform that includes first-ever references to Six A...	August 20, 2024No. 264The US Democratic National Convention on August 19 adopted a party platform that again included text friendly to Taiwan. The platform affirmed that in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, the Six Assurances, and other policies, the Democratic Party firmly pledged to preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and ensure that there were no unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. Marking yet another explicit expression of staunch support for Taiwan in the Democratic Party platform, this was also the first time that the platform included a reference to the Six Assurances and a statement on remaining &ldquo;steadfast in America&rsquo;s commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&rdquo; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely welcomes and appreciates this strong support for Taiwan.This was the first time that the Democratic Party has held an in-person national convention in eight years. Following past precedents, Taiwan sent a delegation to attend the event in Chicago. The inclusion of Taiwan-friendly text in the party platform not only reflected the Democratic Party&rsquo;s unwavering support for Taiwan but also underscored its high regard for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. In fact, maintaining cross-strait peace and stability has not only gained support in the United States but also become a matter of international consensus in recent years.Taiwan has long enjoyed friendly relations with all circles in the United States. MOFA will build on this solid foundation by continuing to engage in close and steadfast cooperation with the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and US friends across all sectors so as to steadily deepen the values-based Taiwan-US partnership across the globe.

August 17, 2024 &nbsp; In response to a question at a forum held by the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines on August 16, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique A. Manalo stated that the situation across the Taiwan Strait was very important to the Philippines, adding that he hoped all parties could resolve issues peacefully.

MOFA response to Palau President Whipps’s comment that China is weaponizing tourism to pressure Pala...	August 16, 2024 &nbsp; Palau is a diplomatic ally and a friend of Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific region. Taiwan has consistently supported Palau&rsquo;s efforts to develop its tourism industry and implement its national policy of building economic resilience and pursuing sustainable development. Taiwan has proactively assisted Palau with revitalizing its tourism sector following the pandemic, increasing the number of direct flights between the two countries and enhancing the resilience of Palau&rsquo;s tourism sector. In contrast, China has deployed such tactics as intimidation, incentives, and economic coercion to expand its power in the Pacific in recent years, undermining regional peace, stability, and prosperity. There have also been occasional reports of China attempting to coerce Taiwan&rsquo;s diplomatic allies to switch diplomatic recognition. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns China&rsquo;s actions. &nbsp; During an interview with the press, President of Palau Surangel Whipps, Jr.&nbsp;said that China has weaponized tourism, seeking to suppress Palau&rsquo;s tourism industry and force Palau to switch diplomatic recognition.&nbsp;This was not the first time that President Whipps had warned about such an occurrence. This again demonstrates the predicament faced by small island nations subjected to economic bullying by major countries. Taiwan empathizes with Palau and will continue to extend heartfelt and staunch support. &nbsp; After pandemic measures were lifted across the globe, Taiwan resumed regular twice-weekly flights to Palau in November 2022. An additional flight was scheduled in April and again in July this year, bringing the total to four flights a week. Taiwan welcomes the preferential tourism programs that Palau has introduced for Taiwanese visitors since the number of flights was increased. These programs have been a success and highlight the close cooperation between Taiwan and Palau, presenting a sharp contrast to China&rsquo;s selective targeting and suppressive economic coercion tactics. &nbsp; In the interview, President Whipps also emphasized that the Taiwan-Palau diplomatic alliance is built on shared values and that Palau cherishes its friendship with Taiwan. Since establishing diplomatic relations in 1999, the two countries have enjoyed solid and cordial ties and engaged in close cooperation across a number of domains, including agriculture, fishery, medicine, health care, tourism development, sports exchanges, education, training, culture, marine conservation, and maritime security. Joint initiatives have been welcomed and recognized by politicians of all persuasions and the people of Palau. MOFA will continue to support President Whipps&rsquo;s promotion of values-based diplomacy. Taiwan will cooperate with Palau and other Pacific allies and like-minded countries to jointly advance cordial diplomatic ties with Palau and ensure peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117892	2024-08-15T23:43:00-07:00

August 15, 2024&nbsp; No. 261&nbsp; Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung hosted a luncheon on August 14 to welcome a delegation of Japanese parliamentarians focused on security issues. The delegation included six members of the Japanese House of Representatives&mdash; Shigeru Ishiba and Seiji Maehara, who jointly led the delegation, as well as Gen Nakatani, Akihisa Nagashima, Shu Watanabe, and Keiro Kitagami. &nbsp; In his remarks, Minister Lin noted the geographical proximity of Taiwan and Japan, their shared values of democracy and freedom, the close ties between their peoples, and the threat of authoritarian expansionism they both face.&nbsp;He then called for the two countries to establish a security dialogue mechanism to facilitate discussions on responses to emergency situations in the future. &nbsp; Minister Lin thanked the government of Japan for leveraging its influence at a number of international events to reiterate the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, increasing the significance countries worldwide attach to cross-strait security. He noted that Taiwan had applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). He also stated that Canada, as this year&rsquo;s CPTPP Commission chair, had issued new guidelines in accordance with the three Auckland Principles and had encouraged CPTPP members to engage in unofficial consultations with economies that had applied to join. Minister Lin expressed the hope that Japan would soon launch unofficial consultations with Taiwan and assist Taiwan in acceding to the CPTPP as early as possible.&nbsp; &nbsp; In his speech, Representative Ishiba thanked Minister Lin for his warm hospitality. He said that in-depth exchanges with prominent Taiwanese political figures during the visit had been very productive and that he hoped a dialogue mechanism could be established for future interactions. In addition, to prevent East Asia from becoming the Ukraine of tomorrow, he recommended that Taiwan and Japan work with other members of the democratic community to strengthen deterrence capabilities and jointly maintain peace and security across East Asia and the Taiwan Strait. &nbsp; The luncheon was also attended by Hsieh Wen-sheng, Chief Executive Officer of the Taiwan Oasis Foundation, and Tristan Y. J. Liu, Acting President of the Taipei University of Marine Technology. Participants enjoyed a lively discussion and exchanged perspectives on issues such as Indo-Pacific developments, supply chain resilience, and food security.

August 11, 2024 Canadian Minister of National Defence Bill Blair and Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Richard Marles held a bilateral meeting in Vancouver, Canada, on August 8. In the Joint Statement on Strengthening the Canada-Australia Defence Relationship issued after the meeting, they reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and their opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo. They also called for the peaceful resolution of differences through dialogue without the threat or use of force or coercion. Both sides emphasized the importance of preventing and deterring conflict in the Indo-Pacific region and expressed concern regarding China&rsquo;s increasing military activity in the South China Sea and the vicinity of Taiwan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Republic of China (Taiwan) sincerely welcomes and affirms Canada and Australia&rsquo;s staunch support for the cross-strait status quo of security and stability. &nbsp; Minister Blair publicly confirmed on July 31 that a Canadian naval vessel had transited the Taiwan Strait. And at a bilateral meeting with Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore this June, he reiterated concern over military exercises China had been conducting around Taiwan since Taiwan&rsquo;s presidential election in January. This demonstrated Canada&rsquo;s consistent position of attaching importance to and supporting a peaceful, stable, free, and open Taiwan Strait. It also highlighted the fact that maintaining cross-strait security was a consensus in the international democratic community. As a responsible member of the global community, Taiwan will continue to cooperate with Canada, Australia, and other like-minded countries to steadfastly defend democracy and do its utmost to contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait, the region, and the world.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117858	2024-08-10T18:47:00-07:00
