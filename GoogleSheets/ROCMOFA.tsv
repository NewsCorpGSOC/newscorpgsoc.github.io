MOFA response to Palau President Whipps’s comment that China is weaponizing tourism to pressure Palau to sever relations with Taiwan	August 16, 2024 Palau is a diplomatic ally and a friend of Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific region. Taiwan has consistently supported Palau's efforts to develop its tourism industry and implement its national policy of building economic resilience and pursuing sustainable development. Taiwan has proactively assisted Palau with revitalizing its tourism sector following the pandemic, increasing the number of direct flights between the two countries and enhancing the resilience of Palau's tourism sector. In contrast, China has deployed such tactics as intimidation, incentives, and economic coercion to expand its power in the Pacific in recent years, undermining regional peace, stability, and prosperity. There have also been occasional reports of China attempting to coerce Taiwan's diplomatic allies to switch diplomatic recognition. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns China's actions. During an interview with the press, President of Palau Surangel Whipps, Jr. said that China has weaponized tourism, seeking to suppress Palau's tourism industry and force Palau to switch diplomatic recognition. This was not the first time that President Whipps had warned about such an occurrence. This again demonstrates the predicament faced by small island nations subjected to economic bullying by major countries. Taiwan empathizes with Palau and will continue to extend heartfelt and staunch support. After pandemic measures were lifted across the globe, Taiwan resumed regular twice-weekly flights to Palau in November 2022. An additional flight was scheduled in April and again in July this year, bringing the total to four flights a week. Taiwan welcomes the preferential tourism programs that Palau has introduced for Taiwanese visitors since the number of flights was increased. These programs have been a success and highlight the close cooperation between Taiwan and Palau, presenting a sharp contrast to China's selective targeting and suppressive economic coercion tactics. In the interview, President Whipps also emphasized that the Taiwan-Palau diplomatic alliance is built on shared values and that Palau cherishes its friendship with Taiwan. Since establishing diplomatic relations in 1999, the two countries have enjoyed solid and cordial ties and engaged in close cooperation across a number of domains, including agriculture, fishery, medicine, health care, tourism development, sports exchanges, education, training, culture, marine conservation, and maritime security. Joint initiatives have been welcomed and recognized by politicians of all persuasions and the people of Palau. MOFA will continue to support President Whipps's promotion of values-based diplomacy. Taiwan will cooperate with Palau and other Pacific allies and like-minded countries to jointly advance cordial diplomatic ties with Palau and ensure peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117892	2024-08-15T23:43:00-07:00	
Foreign Minister Lin hosts welcome luncheon for Japanese parliamentary delegation focused on security issues	August 15, 2024 No. 261 Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung hosted a luncheon on August 14 to welcome a delegation of Japanese parliamentarians focused on security issues. The delegation included six members of the Japanese House of Representatives&mdash; Shigeru Ishiba and Seiji Maehara, who jointly led the delegation, as well as Gen Nakatani, Akihisa Nagashima, Shu Watanabe, and Keiro Kitagami. In his remarks, Minister Lin noted the geographical proximity of Taiwan and Japan, their shared values of democracy and freedom, the close ties between their peoples, and the threat of authoritarian expansionism they both face. He then called for the two countries to establish a security dialogue mechanism to facilitate discussions on responses to emergency situations in the future. Minister Lin thanked the government of Japan for leveraging its influence at a number of international events to reiterate the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, increasing the significance countries worldwide attach to cross-strait security. He noted that Taiwan had applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). He also stated that Canada, as this year's CPTPP Commission chair, had issued new guidelines in accordance with the three Auckland Principles and had encouraged CPTPP members to engage in unofficial consultations with economies that had applied to join. Minister Lin expressed the hope that Japan would soon launch unofficial consultations with Taiwan and assist Taiwan in acceding to the CPTPP as early as possible. In his speech, Representative Ishiba thanked Minister Lin for his warm hospitality. He said that in-depth exchanges with prominent Taiwanese political figures during the visit had been very productive and that he hoped a dialogue mechanism could be established for future interactions. In addition, to prevent East Asia from becoming the Ukraine of tomorrow, he recommended that Taiwan and Japan work with other members of the democratic community to strengthen deterrence capabilities and jointly maintain peace and security across East Asia and the Taiwan Strait. The luncheon was also attended by Hsieh Wen-sheng, Chief Executive Officer of the Taiwan Oasis Foundation, and Tristan Y. J. Liu, Acting President of the Taipei University of Marine Technology. Participants enjoyed a lively discussion and exchanged perspectives on issues such as Indo-Pacific developments, supply chain resilience, and food security.

MOFA response to Canada and Australia reaffirming importance of cross-strait peace and stability in joint statement	August 11, 2024 Canadian Minister of National Defence Bill Blair and Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Richard Marles held a bilateral meeting in Vancouver, Canada, on August 8. In the Joint Statement on Strengthening the Canada-Australia Defence Relationship issued after the meeting, they reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and their opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo. They also called for the peaceful resolution of differences through dialogue without the threat or use of force or coercion. Both sides emphasized the importance of preventing and deterring conflict in the Indo-Pacific region and expressed concern regarding China's increasing military activity in the South China Sea and the vicinity of Taiwan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Republic of China (Taiwan) sincerely welcomes and affirms Canada and Australia's staunch support for the cross-strait status quo of security and stability. Minister Blair publicly confirmed on July 31 that a Canadian naval vessel had transited the Taiwan Strait. And at a bilateral meeting with Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore this June, he reiterated concern over military exercises China had been conducting around Taiwan since Taiwan's presidential election in January. This demonstrated Canada's consistent position of attaching importance to and supporting a peaceful, stable, free, and open Taiwan Strait. It also highlighted the fact that maintaining cross-strait security was a consensus in the international democratic community. As a responsible member of the global community, Taiwan will continue to cooperate with Canada, Australia, and other like-minded countries to steadfastly defend democracy and do its utmost to contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait, the region, and the world.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117858	2024-08-10T18:47:00-07:00	
MOFA response to false claims that Taiwan is -Chinese real estate-	August 9, 2024The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly refutes recent comments made by former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating during a press interview that Taiwan was &ldquo;Chinese real estate.&rdquo;MOFA reiterates that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is an independent and sovereign country; neither the R.O.C. (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other; Taiwan is absolutely not the &ldquo;real estate&rdquo; of any country; and this constitutes the internationally recognized status quo. Taiwan actively defends its democratic system and respects human rights and the rule of law. It will not accept intimidation or coercion by other countries. Nor will it allow its sovereign status to be changed by biased comments made by a few foreign individuals ignorant of the current international situation.Taiwan and Australia are like-minded Indo-Pacific partners sharing common strategic interests. In recent years, the government of Australia has issued multiple joint statements with the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, the Philippines, New Zealand, and other nations reaffirming its support of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and endorsing Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. Australian officials including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong solemnly expressed Australia's position and concerns when hosting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Premier Li Qiang this year. These developments underscore Australia's high regard for the Taiwan Strait situation, which it considers to be of vital national importance. Former Prime Minister Keating's comments were completely incompatible with the current geopolitical situation and absolutely did not reflect mainstream international opinion. The Taiwan government will continue to enhance cooperation with Australia across all domains, establish ever closer friendly relations, remain committed to jointly safeguarding the democratic community, and work proactively with like-minded countries to advance democracy, peace, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117894	2024-08-09T00:05:00-07:00

After the meeting, the US Department of State and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a joint statement on the 34th AUSMIN. In the statement, the two countries reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and their shared opposition to unilateral changes to the cross-strait status quo. They called for the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues through dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion. They also expressed strong concern regarding China's military and coast guard activity around Taiwan. Both the United States and Australia recognized Taiwan as a critical partner and a leading Indo-Pacific economy and democracy. In addition, they reiterated their commitment to supporting Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations; further strengthening economic, trade, and people-to-people ties with Taiwan; and enhancing development coordination in the Pacific. This marked the fifth consecutive year that the United States and Australia have publicly expressed staunch and comprehensive support for Taiwan in the joint statement of the annual AUSMIN. It was also the first time that they have expressed grave concern over China's frequent military and coast guard activity around Taiwan, which has disrupted the status quo and escalated tensions in the region. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely welcomes and appreciates their support. The United States and other like-minded countries have continued to regularly issue statements demonstrating their shared position on peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. These include recent statements following the US-Sweden Consultation on the Indo-Pacific, the US-Japan Security Consultative Committee, and the US-Philippines 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue, all of which stressed the importance of maintaining cross-strait peace and stability, indicating that this has become international consensus. As a responsible member of the Indo-Pacific, Taiwan will work steadfastly with like-minded nations to jointly safeguard the shared values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law; uphold the rules-based international order; and preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117847	2024-08-06T23:28:00-07:00	
Foreign Minister Lin meets with Guatemalan Vice Foreign Minister Orozco	August 6, 2024 No. 256 Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung met with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Julio Eduardo Orozco P&eacute;rez of Guatemala in the morning of August 5. The two exchanged views on a wide range of issues, including bilateral industrial, economic, and trade exchanges and several cooperation projects.

He also thanked the government of Guatemala for backing Taiwan's efforts to participate in the World Health Assembly and other international organizations.

Following the meeting, they issued a joint statement reaffirming the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity. The joint statement released after the Philippines-US 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in April 2023 placed high regard on cross-strait peace and stability for the first time. This is the second time that the matter has been mentioned in this context, underscoring the significance that the Philippines and the United States attach to the Taiwan Strait issue. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes and affirms these statements.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint statement between PRC and Timor-Leste	July 30, 2024Timor-Leste President Jos&eacute; Ramos-Horta met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on July 29. After the meeting, they issued the Joint Statement between the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on Strengthening Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The statement included malicious claims attempting to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty. It deliberately misrepresented United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758, erroneously linking it to China's so-called &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; and incorrectly alleged that Taiwan was an inalienable part of China's territory. In the statement, Timor-Leste also expressed support for all efforts of China's government to realize &ldquo;national reunification.&rdquo;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) solemnly condemns and refutes this deceitful rhetoric, which ignores the international status quo. MOFA reiterates that UNGA Resolution 2758 only addresses the issue of China's representation in the United Nations and never mentions Taiwan. The resolution does not identify Taiwan as part of the PRC&mdash;much less authorize the PRC to represent Taiwan in the United Nations. Indeed, the resolution has nothing to do with Taiwan. The Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign and independent country. Neither the R.O.C. (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other. China's falsehoods regarding Taiwan do not change the fact that Taiwan is a sovereign nation.MOFA urges the government of Timor-Leste not to yield to China's efforts aimed at diminishing Taiwan's sovereign status so as to avoid becoming an accomplice in China's expansionism. MOFA calls on the international community to take concrete action to oppose China's continued misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758; to deter China's ambitions of establishing a legal pretext for future military aggression against Taiwan; and to jointly safeguard peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117823	2024-07-30T01:58:00-07:00	
MOFA thanks IPAC for passing model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 and showing concrete support for Taiwan	July 30, 2024 No. 253 The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) held its annual summit in Taipei on July 30. A total of 49 members from 23 countries and the European Parliament attended, setting a record high for the event. Through concrete action, the IPAC summit demonstrated support for Taiwan and opposition to China's acts of intimidation. It adopted an IPAC model resolution on United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 that could serve as reference for IPAC members and facilitate the introduction of related resolutions in their respective parliaments. At an international press conference held after the summit, IPAC officially welcomed key political figures from Taiwan, Colombia, Iraq, Malawi, Solomon Islands, The Gambia, and Uruguay as new members. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely appreciates IPAC's staunch support for Taiwan. At IPAC's invitation, President Lai Ching-te delivered a speech entitled &ldquo;Taiwan's Global Vision&rdquo; at the summit's Taiwan session on July 30. He emphasized that by upholding the spirit of democracy, peace, and prosperity, Taiwan was embraced by the world and was working with democratic partners worldwide to pursue prosperity. He called on international allies to jointly leverage their defensive strengths under the democratic umbrella so that democratic partners could avert the threats of expanding authoritarianism. Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, who was invited to attend the international press conference after the summit's Taiwan session, stated that Taiwan would continue to cooperate with like-minded countries to firmly uphold the shared values of democracy and freedom and safeguard the rules-based international order. On MOFA's behalf, Vice Minister Remus Li-kuo Chen, who also attended the Taiwan session, thanked IPAC for supporting Taiwan. During the summit, IPAC members discussed the relentless suppression of Taiwan's international space by China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 in the context of the evolving geopolitical environment. They also focused on China's employment of gray-zone strategies, including hybrid political, economic, and military measures, as well as lawfare, to intimidate Taiwan. They reiterated that the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait was indispensable to international security and prosperity and that Taiwan's robust technological strengths were paramount to the resilience of global democratic supply chains. The IPAC summit also passed a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 for members to use after returning home in guiding their respective parliaments to take more concrete action to support democratic Taiwan. The model resolution pointed out that UNGA Resolution 2758 did not endorse the &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo; as international consensus, call for Taiwan's exclusion from international organizations, or have any bearing on sovereign choices of other countries regarding their relations with Taiwan. It also urged that the lack of representation of Taiwan's 23.5 million people in the UN be immediately remedied. MOFA appreciates that IPAC advocated justice for Taiwan and encouraged the international community to jointly counter China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and attempts to link the resolution with its so-called &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; MOFA highly commends IPAC's unprecedented decision to hold its annual summit in Taiwan, thereby underlining the importance of cross-strait issues to the international community. It welcomes visits by more democratic partners to witness Taiwan's contributions to world peace and prosperity. Based on the Four Pillars of Peace action plan launched by President Lai, Taiwan will further enhance its economic resilience, as well as defense and deterrence capabilities. It will continue to engage and collaborate with IPAC and other like-minded partners to jointly uphold security across the Taiwan Strait; preserve peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific; reinforce economic and trade security and semiconductor supply chains that are mutually beneficial; and safeguard the core values of democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law that are shared by the global democratic community.

MOFA response to US and Japan foreign and defense ministers reaffirming importance of cross-strait peace and stability	July 28, 2024 The US-Japan Security Consultative Committee, or 2+2 meeting, was convened by the US secretaries of state and defense and the Japanese ministers for foreign affairs and defense in Tokyo on July 28. A joint statement was issued after the meeting, reaffirming the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the international community. It also called for cross-strait issues to be resolved peacefully. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes and appreciates the continued high regard that the United States and Japan have shown for cross-strait peace. The statement pointed out that China's foreign policy seeks to reshape the international order for its own benefit and achieve its objectives through military means. It also noted that this was of serious concern to the United States, Japan, and the international community and represented the greatest strategic challenge in the Indo-Pacific. Authoritarian countries' continuous outward expansion and challenges to the rules-based international order have caused volatility in the geopolitical landscape. As a responsible member of the Indo-Pacific, Taiwan will work steadfastly to deepen cooperation with the United States, Japan, and other like-minded nations to jointly safeguard the shared values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. In addition, it will further collaborate with them to preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific.

MOFA response to EU High Representative Borrell calling for cross-strait peace and stability at ASEAN Regional Forum	July 28, 2024 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) notes that EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell emphasized in his July 27 address to the 31st ASEAN Regional Forum that the European Union had a direct interest in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He stressed that the European Union opposed any unilateral attempts to change the status quo through force or coercion. MOFA welcomes and appreciates his reaffirmation of the EU stance on safeguarding cross-strait peace and stability. In his speech, High Representative Borrell also expressed concern over tensions in the South China Sea, underscored that the Indo-Pacific region was the center of global competition, and noted that conflict in the South China Sea could have far greater ramifications than the Red Sea crisis. He urged all parties to reduce tensions in the South China Sea in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and expressed opposition to the use of force to resolve conflicts. High Representative Borrell's position is commensurate with Taiwan's commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea. Taiwan opposes any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force and condemns the escalation of gray-zone tactics and military coercion in the South China Sea. This is not only detrimental to regional peace and stability, it also undermines the global maritime order that is founded in international law and UNCLOS. Taiwan will continue to cooperate with regional allies and like-minded countries to jointly protect a free and open Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117807	2024-07-27T18:26:00-07:00

Noting that Taiwan and Germany shared vibrant and frequent academic, economic, and trade exchanges, Minister Lin anticipated that the two countries could definitely work together to enhance the resilience of democratic partnerships following the establishment of a foundry by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in Dresden, Germany. Mr. Kiesewetter strongly concurred on the importance of solidarity and cooperation between democratic partners, adding that the Russia-Ukraine war had served as a wake-up call. He urged democratic partners not to harbor illusions regarding authoritarian countries and stressed that mutual trust had become the key to international cooperation today. He affirmed that Taiwan's investment in the German semiconductor sector had boosted bilateral technological and personnel exchanges, which carried immense significance in terms of strengthening the overall resilience of democratic supply chains. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Remus Li-kuo Chen hosted a luncheon for Mr. Kiesewetter on July 22. He sincerely thanked the German Bundestag for recently passing a resolution backing Taiwan and called on the German federal government to focus attention on the importance of cross-strait peace and stability. Moreover, he expressed the hope that Mr. Kiesewetter would exert his influence to expand support for Taiwan in Germany and build further bilateral linkages. Mr. Kiesewetter strongly agreed with him and urged democratic partners to work together to deter China's military aggression against Taiwan. He said that an increase in bilateral official visits and deeper exchanges across all domains would be welcomed. This was Mr. Kiesewetter's second visit to Taiwan and underlined his staunch support for Taiwan.

MOFA congratulates European Commission President Von der Leyen on reelection	July 19, 2024 No. 247 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) congratulates European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on her successful reelection by the European Parliament on July 18. Under the Political Guidelines for the Next European Commission 2024-2029 that President Von der Leyen proposed for her second term in office, she stated that the European Union would work collectively with Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, and Australia to deter China from using military means to unilaterally change the status quo, particularly with regard to Taiwan. MOFA promptly congratulated President Von der Leyen on the X platform and expressed appreciation for her high level of support and concern for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Under President Von der Leyen's leadership, the European Commission has steadily enhanced relations with Taiwan.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint statement between PRC and Solomon Islands	July 13, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele on July 12. After the meeting, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Solomon Islands issued a joint statement, falsely claiming that Taiwan was an inseparable part of China's territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly refutes this claim. MOFA solemnly reaffirms that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a free and democratic country and that neither democratic Taiwan nor totalitarian China is subordinate to the other. These are long-standing, objective, and internationally recognized facts, as well as the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan has never been governed by the PRC; nor has it ever been part of the PRC. Only the democratically elected government of Taiwan has the right to represent the Taiwanese people in the United Nations system and the international arena. China and countries deferring to it have no say in the matter. MOFA again urges these countries not to ignore history and to recognize China for what it is&mdash;a totalitarian and autocratic regime. MOFA calls on them to refrain from blindly abetting China's deceitful narratives, which only distort the truth, maliciously undermine Taiwan's sovereignty, attempt to rationalize China's expansionist ambitions, and increase international instability. Taiwan will continue to steadfastly safeguard the values of freedom and democracy and bolster cooperation with democratic partners to jointly deter authoritarian expansionism; staunchly ensure cross-strait peace and security; and preserve a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117703	2024-07-13T01:43:00-07:00

July 9, 2024 No. 231 Russian airstrikes on Ukraine's capital Kyiv on July 8 heavily damaged Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital and caused dozens of civilian casualties, including children. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns Russia's attacks on the hospital, which ruthlessly targeted children. Following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022, Taiwan's civil society promptly donated approximately US$30 million to assist Ukraine out of humanitarian concern.

In the wake of the Russian attack on the hospital, MOFA has instructed the Taipei Representative Office in Poland to express condolences to the hospital's director. At the same time, MOFA has announced a donation of US$200,000 to the hospital for the purchase of needed medical supplies and reiterated its commitment to providing necessary assistance. In a spirit of solidarity, Taiwan has extended a helping hand to the hospital and its young patients and their families, supporting efforts to ensure the basic dignity and humanitarian treatment of the Ukrainian people. MOFA once again urges Russia to respect Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; cease its aggressive actions; and restore peace as soon as possible. Taiwan will steadfastly fulfill its responsibility as a force for good in the international community and cooperate with like-minded countries to safeguard the core values of democracy, freedom, the rule of law, and human rights.

MOFA response to friendly resolution on cross-strait situation passed by German Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee	July 6, 2024 The German Bundestag Committee on Foreign Affairs recently adopted a resolution on deeper cooperation with Indo-Pacific partners to address global challenges. Proposed by the governing traffic light coalition comprising the Social Democratic Party, Alliance 90/Greens, and the Free Democratic Party, this was the first resolution passed by the committee recognizing the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and opposing any unilateral change to the cross-strait status quo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Republic of China (Taiwan) sincerely thanks the German Bundestag for its staunch support for Taiwan. The resolution pointed out that European and Indo-Pacific security were closely linked and that German involvement in Indo-Pacific security affairs was commensurate with German interests and those of the European Union (EU). The Bundestag also expressed concern over tensions in the South and East China Seas, the Taiwan Strait, and the region. It further opposed any unilateral change to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, stating that any alteration to the relations between China and Taiwan must occur peacefully and by mutual agreement. Furthermore, the resolution especially recognized a previously established Taiwan-Germany platform for civil society exchanges for having advanced bilateral dialogue. It also supported Taiwan's participation in international bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and backed engagement between Taiwan's civil society and the United Nations and its specialized agencies. In addition, it called for stronger Taiwan-EU economic and trade relations, collaboration on industrial supply chains, and exchanges with Taiwan in such areas as education and research. The German government coalition agreement of November 2021 was the first such accord to include friendly content supporting Taiwan's substantive participation in international organizations and stressing that the cross-strait status quo could only be altered in a peaceful manner and by mutual agreement. In 2022, when Germany held the Group of Seven (G7) rotating presidency, the joint statements of the G7 foreign ministers and leaders both reiterated the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Moreover, the Bundestag adopted resolutions in 2022 and 2023 endorsing Taiwan's involvement in WHO. The passage of this most recent resolution by the Bundestag Committee on Foreign Affairs calling for cross-strait peace and stability highlights the unanimous support of the German executive and legislative branches of government for Taiwan's substantive participation in international organizations as well as their concern over China's threats in the Taiwan Strait and disruption of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. MOFA reiterates that Taiwan will steadfastly promote the Four Pillars of Peace action plan put forward by President Lai Ching-te to strengthen economic resilience and enhance defense and deterrence capabilities. Taiwan will also work with like-minded international partners to preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117665	2024-07-06T01:41:00-07:00

MOFA response to Dutch House of Representatives passing Taiwan-friendly motion on UNGA Resolution 2758 and Taiwan’s international participation	September 13, 2024 The House of Representatives of the Netherlands on September 12 adopted a Taiwan-friendly motion stating that United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 did not rule that the People's Republic of China (PRC) enjoyed sovereignty over Taiwan and that it did not make any judgment on Taiwan's participation in the UN or other international organizations. The motion was passed by an overwhelming majority, with 147 of 150 members voting in favor. It was highly significant that the motion was approved while the 79th session of the UNGA was being convened. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates the passage of the motion. The motion also noted that UNGA Resolution 2758 was being used by the PRC to block Taiwan's international engagement and that the Netherlands also had an interest in Taiwan's participation in such organizations as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the World Health Organization. After the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) adopted a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 for its members' reference at its annual summit in July and the subsequent passage of a related motion by the Australian Senate, the passage of this motion by the Dutch House of Representatives makes the Netherlands the second country in the world and the first in Europe to adopt a similar measure. The Taiwan-friendly motion was jointly proposed by 13 members of the Dutch House of Representatives from both the ruling and opposition parties, including Representative Jan Paternotte of Democrats 66, who is an IPAC cochair for the Netherlands. It marks the third concrete action taken by the Dutch House of Representatives to support Taiwan this year following the adoption of a motion in April backing Taiwan's international participation and another in May urging the Dutch government to pursue a joint effort with the European Union and like-minded European nations to oppose China's military drills around Taiwan and to maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118040	2024-09-13T01:05:00-07:00

MOFA welcomes EU-US joint press release reaffirming importance of cross-strait peace and stability	September 12, 2024 No. 300 European External Action Service Secretary General Stefano Sannino and United States Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell on September 11 issued a joint press release after holding the seventh high-level meeting of the EU-US Dialogue on China and the sixth meeting of the EU-US High-Level Consultations on the Indo-Pacific on September 9 and 10. The two sides underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and stated that this was indispensable to international peace and stability. They also called for the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues through dialogue, expressed opposition to any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force or coercion, urged China to exercise restraint in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan, and conveyed support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. As for security in the Indo-Pacific, both sides expressed serious concern about tensions in the East China Sea and the South China Sea and reiterated their strong opposition to recent actions by China that endanger the safety of life at sea and infringe upon freedom of navigation. They also highlighted their strong commitment to upholding peace, stability, and international law in the Indo-Pacific. The European Union and the United States have been holding high-level meetings of the EU-US Dialogue on China since 2021. Through related joint press releases, they have continued to reiterate great regard for cross-strait peace and stability. This demonstrates that the maintenance of security across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific has become the consensus of the European Union, the United States, and other members of the democratic camp. In facing the recent collusion of authoritarian countries that openly challenge the international order, Taiwan&mdash;a responsible and democratic member of the Indo-Pacific community&mdash;seeks to collaborate with the European Union, the United States, and other like-minded partners to jointly uphold the rules-based international order and defend such shared values as democracy, freedom, and human rights.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint statement between PRC and South Africa	September 4, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping on September 2 met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who was in Beijing to attend the summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. After the meeting, they issued the Joint Statement between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of South Africa on the Establishment of an All-Round Strategic Cooperative Partnership in a New Era. The statement included such false claims as Taiwan being an inalienable part of China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns China for repeatedly using meetings with other countries' leaders and large international conferences it organizes to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA solemnly reiterates that it has always been an undeniable fact that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; that the PRC has never governed Taiwan; and that no country can or has the right to deny this objective reality through a joint statement. Taiwan staunchly upholds the ideals of democracy and freedom, never wavering in the face of political coercion and diplomatic suppression by China. With a focus on democracy, peace, and freedom, it will continue to enhance cooperation with like-minded partners, ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and deepen exchanges with all countries.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117999	2024-09-04T00:21:00-07:00	
Taiwan’s 2024 UN bid aims to refute distortion and misapplication of UNGA Resolution 2758	September 3, 2024 No. 289 The 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) will commence at UN headquarters in New York on September 10. The UN General Debate will be held from September 24 to 28 and on September 30. The theme of this year's General Debate is &ldquo;leaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations.&rdquo; Ironically, however, the 23.5 million people of Taiwan continue to be left behind by the UN system. This grave injustice is due mainly to China's malicious misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758; China's attempts to mislead the international community into accepting that the resolution is equivalent to the so-called &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo;; and China's spurious claims that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China and that Resolution 2758 has authorized the PRC to represent Taiwan in the UN system. In effect, China is seeking to establish a legal basis to undermine the objective reality that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign nation and divest Taiwan of its legitimate right to pursue participation in the UN system. In the face of China's cognitive warfare, prompt rebuttals and clarifications must be issued. Otherwise, the objective status quo across the Taiwan Strait&mdash;in which neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other&mdash;will utterly change, allowing China to lay a legal foundation for an armed invasion of Taiwan. The international community would then lose its legitimate right to assist Taiwan in accordance with the UN Charter, which calls for maintaining international peace and security and resolving international disputes through peaceful means. Therefore, Taiwan's bid to participate in the United Nations this year is focused on enhancing international understanding of UNGA Resolution 2758. The government hopes to make clear that the resolution does not mention Taiwan and thus has nothing to do with Taiwan. Moreover, the resolution neither states that Taiwan is part of China&mdash;as the PRC falsely claims&mdash;nor gives China the right to represent Taiwan in the United Nations. Taiwan's 2024 campaign for UN participation comprises three main issues. 1. The malicious distortion of UNGA Resolution 2758 has become a serious threat to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. The United Nations must take action to address it. 2. UNGA Resolution 2758 does not preclude Taiwan's meaningful participation in the UN system. The United Nations must seek suitable ways of including Taiwan so that Taiwan can better contribute to realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 3. The UN Secretariat must adopt a strictly neutral stance and stop erroneously citing UNGA Resolution 2758. It must also grant Taiwanese nationals and journalists the right to access UN premises for visits, meetings, and newsgathering activities. Over the past eight years, the Taiwan government's stable and steadfast approach to promoting its UN campaigns has received international recognition and encouraged ever more like-minded countries to support its efforts to increase global engagement. Following careful deliberations and considering this past success, the government has again decided to ask permanent representatives to the United Nations from Taiwan's diplomatic allies to write a joint letter to UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres. Officials from diplomatic allies have also been urged to speak up for Taiwan during the General Debate and other UNGA events. To communicate Taiwan's UN bid to the global community directly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung wrote an op-ed entitled &ldquo;To secure peace in the Indo-Pacific, include Taiwan in the UN system.&rdquo; The op-ed has been published in media outlets around the world. The logo and short film for Taiwan's UN campaign this year center on semiconductors and peace, highlighting Taiwan's leading role in global semiconductor supply chains and its strong determination to pursue peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. These efforts aim to foster understanding worldwide that Taiwan&mdash;as a responsible member of the international community&mdash;will implement the Four Pillars of Peace action plan proposed by President Lai Ching-te. Taiwan will continue working with democratic partners to create sustainable supply chains for democracy chips and to advance global prosperity and development. In terms of cross-strait relations, Taiwan will neither yield nor provoke but will maintain the status quo and do its part to ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. During the UNGA, the government will hold related side events and activities in New York to promote a positive image of Taiwan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely thanks legislators from the governing and opposition parties for once again organizing a cross-party delegation to provide guidance in New York. The delegation will explain to the UN community that the prevailing opinion among Taiwan's 23.5 million people is a strong desire for equal participation in the UN system. The United Nations belongs to all humanity. The UN Charter explicitly states that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to develop friendly relations among countries based on respect for the principle of equal rights of peoples. Yet, the United Nations has continued to succumb to pressure from China, ignore the Taiwanese people's legitimate right to UN participation, echo China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758, and thereby seek to rationalize the wrongful and illegitimate exclusion of the Taiwanese people. MOFA deeply regrets the United Nations' actions and expresses its strong displeasure. MOFA extends appreciation to the US government for making a four-point public rebuttal in April regarding the misapplication of UNGA Resolution 2758. It also thanks the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China for adopting a model resolution on UNGA Resolution 2758 in July that could serve as reference for IPAC members when introducing related motions in their respective parliaments. In August, the Australian Senate became the first national parliament to pass such a motion, repudiating the misuse of UNGA Resolution 2758. Moving forward, Taiwan firmly believes that even more countries will stand up and call for justice for Taiwan. To safeguard the Taiwanese people's basic human right to international engagement, the government has campaigned persistently for UN participation since 1993. However, due to China's unreasonable and heavy-handed interference, as well as the UN's blind capitulation to China's pressure, Taiwan has encountered countless difficulties and challenges to its UN bids. Despite this, the Taiwan government has never abandoned its efforts and never will&mdash;it will continue to seek international support. Taiwan once again reminds the United Nations that only by accepting Taiwan's full participation can the world achieve peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future generations.

September 1, 2024No. 287As the Philippine Coast Guard patrol vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua (MRRV-9701) was preparing to raise anchor at Sabina Shoal on August 31, it was deliberately rammed multiple times in intimidating and dangerous maneuvers by a China Coast Guard vessel. This marked the third confrontation between the two sides in the same maritime area in recent days.China has recently cited &ldquo;rights protection&rdquo; as a pretext for using illegal, threatening, coercive, and dangerous maneuvers and other nonpeaceful means to obstruct and interfere with the legal navigation of Philippine vessels, leading to several collisions at sea. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) again strongly condemns China's bullying tactics in repeatedly and intentionally causing confrontations in the same maritime area and escalating tensions in the South China Sea.MOFA reiterates that Taiwan opposes any threat to security in the South China Sea or actions that harm regional peace and stability. It urges all sides to exercise restraint, abide by international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and resolve differences via peaceful means. Taiwan will continue to work closely with like-minded countries to monitor developments in the South China Sea and jointly maintain regional peace and stability.

August 30, 2024 No. 283 Maori King Kiingi Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII passed away in the early morning of August 30 at the age of 69, according to statements released by the New Zealand government and the king's office. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) extends sincere condolences over his passing on behalf of the people and government of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Ambassador Joanne Ou, Taiwan Representative to New Zealand, has expressed sympathies to the queen and other family members of King Tuheitia through the king's office on behalf of Taiwan's people and government. King Tuheitia was friendly toward Taiwan. He made multiple visits to Taiwan and maintained cordial relations with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO), New Zealand and TECO in Auckland over the years. During his 18-year reign, King Tuheitia spared no effort in advancing the welfare of the Maori community, earning the love of his people as well as international recognition. Taiwan and New Zealand place great importance on the rights and interests of indigenous peoples, share the core values of freedom and democracy, and maintain close people-to-people exchanges and robust economic and trade cooperation. Taiwan is willing to uphold the spirit of compassion shown by King Tuheitia in working steadily and jointly with New Zealand to deepen friendly bilateral collaboration and enhance the well-being of both peoples.

MOFA response to US National Security Advisor Sullivan stressing ...	August 29, 2024 US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Wang Yi, Director of the Office of the Chinese Communist Party Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister of China, in Beijing on August 27 and 28. A press release issued afterwards by the White House pointed out that National Security Advisor Sullivan had underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait during the meeting. He emphasized concerns about China's support for Russia's defense industrial base and the effect this was having on European and transatlantic security, as well as about China's destabilizing actions in the South China Sea. He also reaffirmed the US commitment to defending its Indo-Pacific allies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomes staunch US support for maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and appreciates high-level US officials' again expressing this position during interactions with their Chinese counterparts. In addition, MOFA notes that China again made spurious claims about Taiwan that do not accord with reality in the press release issued following the meeting. MOFA strongly condemns these false narratives and reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. In fact, China's relentless intimidation and suppression of Taiwan and its naked ambition for military expansion pose the greatest risk to regional peace and stability. By accommodating Russia, China has become a key supporter of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, jeopardizing transatlantic security. This also shows that China's ambitions extend beyond Taiwan to other regions, making it a major global threat. China's malicious actions have elicited a high level of concern among the global democratic community. As a responsible member of the international community, Taiwan will continue to enhance its self-defense capabilities and work with the United States and other like-minded partners to jointly safeguard the rules-based international order and preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117959	2024-08-29T01:18:00-07:00	
MOFA strongly condemns China’s dangerous maneuvers against Philip...	August 27, 2024No. 278On August 25, official vessel no. 3002 of the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, heading from Hasa Hasa Shoal toward Sabina Shoal in the South China Sea to carry out a humanitarian supply replenishment, was surrounded by eight Chinese military and coast guard vessels. The Chinese vessels proceeded to engage in dangerous maneuvers, including approaching at close range, spraying water cannons, and even ramming the Philippine vessel. This was the second confrontation between the two sides in the same maritime area this week.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) notes that China has recently taken deliberate action to expand the area of confrontation with the Philippines from Second Thomas Shoal to other locations such as Scarborough Shoal, Sabina Shoal, Sandy Cay, and Subi Reef. Furthermore, China has deployed nearly 100 ships in the South China Sea, including navy, coast guard, maritime militia, and scientific research vessels, and continues to frequently interfere with Philippine humanitarian replenishment missions. At the same time, it is using &ldquo;rights protection&rdquo; as a pretext for using illegal, threatening, coercive, and other nonpeaceful means to interfere with the navigation of other countries' vessels. This is raising regional tensions. MOFA strongly condemns China's hegemonic actions, which are clearly being taken with expansionist objectives in mind.MOFA emphasizes that maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight remains the consensus of the international community. Taiwan opposes any threat to security in the South China Sea or actions that harm the regional status quo of peace and stability. Moreover, it gravely condemns any use of military force or coercion to interfere with other countries' freedom of navigation. Taiwan solemnly urges all sides to exercise restraint, abide by international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and resolve differences via peaceful means.MOFA reiterates that the South China Sea Islands are part of the territory of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and that Taiwan enjoys rights over the South China Seas Islands and associated waters in accordance with international law and the law of the sea. Taiwan will continue to work closely with like-minded countries to monitor developments in the South China Sea and jointly maintain regional peace and stability. The government of Taiwan will continue to handle South China Sea affairs prudently in accordance with the four principles and five actions.

August 27, 2024No. 277A Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft intruded into Japanese airspace near the Danjo Islands, Nagasaki Prefecture, on the morning of August 26, seriously violating Japan's sovereignty and raising regional tensions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly condemns China's reckless infringement on the sovereignty of another country, which has undermined regional peace and stability.Recently, China has been ramping up incursions of military aircraft and vessels into the air defense identification zones and exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and Japan, escalating regional tensions. Moreover, China has been conducting frequent joint military exercises with Russia in the East and South China Seas in an attempt to change the status quo through force. China's military expansionism poses a major threat to the security of countries in the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan and Japan.MOFA solemnly denounces China's behavior and once again calls on China to be rational, show restraint, and immediately stop all actions that undermine peace across the Taiwan Strait and increase regional tensions. As a responsible member of the Indo-Pacific, Taiwan will continue to actively strengthen its self-defense capabilities and cooperate with Japan and other like-minded countries to jointly curb authoritarian expansionism and aggression.

MOFA response to Chinese government’s continued attempts to use e...	August 24, 2024The Chinese government has for many years pressured enterprises to comply with its political objectives through such coercive tactics as boycotts, sanctions, tax investigations, and allegations of illegal activities. Moreover, in recent years, it has used the so-called &ldquo;little pinks&rdquo; and other jingoist Chinese nationalists to stir up online abuse against selected targets. Through this disruptive behavior, as well as associated denunciations by local collaborators in related countries, China has attempted to impose pressure or incite fear, and force compromises and concessions upon companies worldwide.In July 2023, an internationally renowned jewelry brand was subjected to criticism by Chinese state media, and insults and intimidation by hordes of Chinese netizens, after it was alleged that the company had listed Taiwan as a country on its official websites outside of China. Elsewhere, when the Canadian government expelled a Chinese diplomat based in Toronto in May 2023, the &ldquo;little pink&rdquo; movement promptly instigated a boycott against Canadian products. These are but two of a long list of examples. In addition to international enterprises, individuals from any sector in any country may also become targets of economic coercion by the Chinese government. Last month, Chinese netizens compiled a list of 94 Taiwanese entertainers who had not stated that Taiwan belonged to China at the time President Lai Ching-te assumed office, pressuring them to take a stand. This is one of many blatant examples of coercion.The Beijing authorities' use of &ldquo;little pink&rdquo; campaigns is a very clear element in China's cognitive warfare against Taiwan and the international community. However, just like its wolf-warrior diplomacy, this will only arouse aversion among the global community and further tarnish its international image.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Republic of China (Taiwan) strongly condemns authoritarian China for using such tactics as economic coercion to engage in political manipulation and thereby influence businesses' international commercial activities. In addition, MOFA urges the international community to recognize China's ubiquitous application of cognitive warfare tactics. It encourages the international community to work together to counter coercive actions by China's authoritarian government and curb the CCP regime's insatiable aspiration for advancement, as well as its continuous undermining of the rules-based international order and routine commercial activities.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=117928	2024-08-24T01:53:00-07:00
