Foreign Minister Lin leads delegation to Drone Industry Business Forum, seeks to create democratic supply chain with Lithuania	November 22, 2024No. 427 Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung led a 59-member delegation from the Taiwan Excellence Drone International Business Opportunities Alliance (TEDIBOA) and 20 related Taiwanese companies to Vilnius, Lithuania, to attend the Drone Industry Business Forum on November 21. The event was cohosted by the Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania and Lithuania's Innovation Agency. Minister Lin and Legislator Wang Ting-yu, Convener of the Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, delivered remarks on Taiwan's behalf. Vice Minister of National Defense Monika Koroliovienė, Director of the Innovation Agency Romualda Stragienė, and President of the Lithuanian Confederation of Industrialists (LPK) Vidmantas Janulevičius spoke on behalf of Lithuania. During the forum, Minister Lin also witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the TEDIBOA and the Lithuanian Defense and Security Industries Association (LGSPA), which underlined the commitment of Taiwan and Lithuania to jointly establishing a democratic drone supply chain. In his remarks, Minister Lin spoke about the serious threat posed by such authoritarian states as China and Russia as they continued to deploy gray-zone tactics, economic coercion, and other means to pressure democratic nations. Noting that the security of Europe and the Indo-Pacific were closely interconnected, he urged like-minded partners to come together to safeguard their hard-won free and democratic way of life. Explaining that President Lai Ching-te had identified the Five Trusted Industry Sectors in a bid to bolster economic resilience through Taiwan's innovative and technological strengths, Minister Lin said that Taiwan would employ integrated diplomacy to reinforce economic and trade collaboration with partners worldwide and thereby promote mutual prosperity. He also stated that Taiwan had already proven to the world that it was an indispensable partner in democratic supply chains and that it would continue to share its experience with Lithuania and other democracies. He described the development of close bilateral ties since the opening of Taiwan's representative office in Vilnius as a model for mutual assistance and cooperation between democratic countries. He said that, given the potential for drone industrial development in Taiwan and Lithuania, he was confident that this new domain would become a success story of bilateral collaboration, and added that Taiwan looked forward to working with the new government of Lithuania to further enhance a bilateral partnership of mutual benefit and shared prosperity. Also speaking at the forum, Legislator Wang said that he had accompanied Minister Lin on the trip to demonstrate Taiwan's support for Lithuania. He pointed out that since both countries stood on the front line of democracy against the threat of authoritarian expansion by such regimes as China and Russia, they should engage in close industrial cooperation so as to jointly enhance economic resilience. Citing Taiwan's commitment to a spirit of supreme excellence for producing the robust manufacturing base that prevailed in the country today, Legislator Wang pledged that Taiwan would uphold this enterprising approach in the drone sector and work steadfastly with like-minded partners to bolster democratic supply chains. Vice Minister Koroliovienė noted in her remarks that Taiwan and Lithuania shared the values of freedom and democracy and that Lithuania anticipated building on this solid existing foundation to strengthen bilateral cooperation. She said that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the threat to democratic countries from authoritarian expansion highlighted the urgent need to enhance national defense and all-out civilian defense, as well as to strengthen asymmetric capabilities through the development of the drone and counterdrone industries. She stated that Lithuania would continue to deepen cooperation with Indo-Pacific countries and that it hoped to pursue strategic collaboration with Taiwan in the drone industry so as to create a democratic defense supply chain. Director Stragienė and LPK President Janulevičius conveyed similar expectations in their remarks. This first Drone Industry Business Forum coorganized by Taiwan and Lithuania attracted participants from more than 40 companies from Lithuania and Ukraine. Interactions were lively at the event, which was attended by more than 200 people, including officials from the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of the Economy and Innovation. With staunch government support from both sides, Taiwan and Lithuania will use this platform to foster industrial linkages and jointly create business opportunities in drone markets in Europe and beyond. Minister Lin's presence at the head of the delegation to the forum underscored the importance he places on the bilateral partnership and his commitment to engage proactively with Lithuania's new government.

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint statement between PRC and Brazil	November 21, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Brazilian President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva on November 20 signed and issued the Joint Statement Between the People's Republic of China and the Federative Republic of Brazil on Jointly Building the China-Brazil Community with a Shared Future for a More Just World and a More Sustainable Planet. According to the statement, Brazil reiterated support for the &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo; and said that Taiwan was an inalienable part of Chinese territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly protests and condemns these spurious claims that undermine Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA reiterates that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is an independent and sovereign nation; that neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; and that the PRC has never governed Taiwan for a single day. These are objective and universally understood facts. Taiwan is a modern, democratic nation that actively defends its democratic system and respects human rights and the rule of law. No statement distorting Taiwan's sovereign status can alter the international consensus as to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. Brazil is a country that pursues the core values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. MOFA calls on the government of Brazil to recognize the malevolent intentions behind China's Belt and Road Initiative, to no longer echo the false narrative pushed by China through the so-called &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; to refrain from maliciously disparaging Taiwan's sovereignty, and to avoid becoming an accomplice in authoritarian China's attempts to jeopardize regional peace and stability. MOFA reaffirms the Taiwanese people's staunch commitment to upholding the values of freedom and democracy and urges the international community to jointly condemn China's unilateral actions aimed at disrupting cross-strait peace and stability.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118699	2024-11-20T19:55:00-08:00

During the meeting, President Biden reiterated that the United States opposed any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side of the Taiwan Strait, that it expected cross-strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, and that the world had an interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) commends and welcomes President Biden publicly reaffirming the United States' commitment to preserving peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait during interactions with the Chinese leader. MOFA also thanks the Biden administration for placing great importance on, and doing its utmost through concrete actions to maintain, peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.

In the statement, the three countries announced the establishment of a trilateral secretariat to coordinate and implement their shared commitments and ensure that their joint efforts would make the Indo-Pacific a thriving, connected, resilient, stable, and secure region. MOFA also notes that China's press release on the Biden-Xi meeting again included fallacious and misleading narratives on Taiwan and Taiwan-US relations. MOFA reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other. It also stresses that, as the United States and other parties have repeatedly pointed out, China's continuous military provocations around Taiwan are the biggest destabilizing factor for regional peace and stability and the biggest threat to global economic prosperity. MOFA welcomes continued international attention on cross-strait peace and stability as well as concern over China's threat to the peaceful status quo. As a responsible member of the global community, Taiwan will actively implement the Four Pillars of Peace action plan, leveraging its strengths to ensure peace.

MOFA response to China using APEC and other key international forums to disparage Taiwan’s sovereignty and spread falsehoods intended to confuse inter...	November 16, 2024 Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on November 15 on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. After the meeting, China publicly announced that Singapore fully understood the Chinese government's position on the Taiwan issue, opposed any form of Taiwan independence, and staunchly abided by the &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; However, since the Singaporean government has verifiably not made any such declaration, China's statement is unmistakably false. In addition to once again publishing untrue remarks about Taiwan on behalf of another country without its consent, China has repeatedly made erroneous statements misstating other countries' positions with the intention of confusing international public opinion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) solemnly condemns and refutes the Chinese government for repeatedly spreading falsehoods and lies among the international community that disparage Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA urges the international community to jointly denounce China's peremptory actions, which unilaterally and deliberately undermine regional peace and stability.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118628	2024-11-15T18:56:00-08:00	
MOFA response to claim made in China-Peru joint statement that Peru reiterates staunch commitment to -one China principle-	November 15, 2024 Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a bilateral meeting with Peruvian President Dina Boluarte on November 14 while in Peru to attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. Following the meeting, a joint statement was issued that made the gratuitous claim that Peru had reiterated its staunch commitment to the &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) gravely protests and condemns China and Peru for making such unwarranted statements, which disparage Taiwan's sovereignty. MOFA reiterates that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign and independent nation; that neither the ROC (Taiwan) nor the People's Republic of China is subordinate to the other; and that the PRC has never governed Taiwan for even a single day. These facts are understood throughout the world. Taiwan is a modern, democratic nation that actively defends its democratic system and respects human rights and the rule of law. No statement distorting Taiwan's sovereign status can alter the international consensus as to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. On the occasion of hosting a major international conference, the government of Peru has failed to consider the spirit of cordiality that exists between nations. Instead, it has unilaterally followed the Chinese government's one-sided &ldquo;one China principle&rdquo; and confused international public opinion. This is most certainly not what the leaders of participating APEC member economies would have wanted to see. MOFA urges Peru to recognize China's attempts to infiltrate Latin American countries by appealing to their economic and trade interests. Indeed, MOFA calls on Peru to no longer follow the falsehood that is the &ldquo;one China principle,&rdquo; maliciously disparage Taiwan's sovereignty, or serve as an accomplice in fueling regional tensions. MOFA solemnly reiterates that the staunch desire of the Taiwanese people to defend the values of freedom and democracy is indisputable and not to be underestimated. MOFA urges the international community to jointly denounce the Chinese government's peremptory actions, which unilaterally and deliberately undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118630	2024-11-14T23:00:00-08:00

In addition, the heads of delegations from Belize, Eswatini, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Paraguay, Saint Christopher and Nevis, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines produced videos urging support for Taiwan's participation in INTERPOL.Like-minded countries have also continued to publicly call for Taiwan's engagement with INTERPOL and other international organizations on numerous occasions. The Group of Seven (G7) Leaders' Communiqu&eacute; and the chair's statement issued after the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting both reaffirmed support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. Joint statements released following the UK-Australia Ministerial Consultations and the France-Australia Foreign and Defense Ministerial Consultations also backed Taiwan's involvement in the global arena.In addition, representative offices of like-minded nations demonstrated support for Taiwan on social media platforms. The American Institute in Taiwan shared Taiwan's INTERPOL campaign film on its official Facebook page, calling for Taiwan's substantive and meaningful participation in the international community as well as in collective efforts to advance global security. The Australian Office posted Taiwan's INTERPOL campaign logo on its official social media accounts to express support and called for active collaboration among law enforcement agencies worldwide to combat transnational crime. Support from various parliaments was also strong. The European Parliament, the Czech Senate, the Dutch House of Representatives, the Saint Christopher and Nevis National Assembly, the Guam Legislature, and other parliaments adopted resolutions endorsing Taiwan's participation in INTERPOL. The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, the Australian Senate, the Canadian House of Commons, the Italian Chamber of Deputies, and the Guatemalan Congress also passed resolutions backing Taiwan's participation in international organizations.

Related posts on MOFA's new media accounts, including Facebook, X, Instagram, and Threads, were seen over 235,000 times.MOFA emphasizes that the global security map is incomplete without Taiwan. Taiwan's exclusion from INTERPOL undermines concerted efforts to maintain global security and jeopardizes the welfare of people worldwide. Taiwan is both willing and able to work with the international community to combat transnational crime. It urges INTERPOL to uphold the principles of professionalism and neutrality, swiftly include Taiwan in the global law enforcement network, and work with Taiwan on joint efforts to ensure international security.

MOFA response to Philippines’ enactment of domestic laws and China’s announcement of maritime baselines regarding South China Sea	November 12, 2024 Philippine President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr., signed into law the Philippine Maritime Zones Act and the Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act on November 8. Subsequent to this, China announced both the baselines of territorial waters around Huangyan Island (Scarborough Shoal) and standard names and geographic coordinates for 64 islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The government of the ROC (Taiwan) solemnly states that the Philippines' enactment of the two aforementioned domestic laws and China's demarcation of the baselines of territorial waters around Huangyan Island and the naming of certain islands and reefs in the South China Sea do not change the fact that the South China Sea islands are part of ROC (Taiwan) territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) stresses that the territorial sovereignty of the ROC (Taiwan) is indisputable and that the ROC (Taiwan) will staunchly safeguard its sovereign rights over territory and relevant waters in the South China Sea. MOFA points out that, in accordance with a related announcement previously issued by the Executive Yuan, Taiwan's rights with regard to its territorial sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and their relevant waters as accorded by international law and the law of the sea will not be impacted whatsoever by any country's unilateral claims. It expresses grave concern over the Philippines and China escalating disputes in the South China Sea, which undermines regional peace and stability. MOFA urges all parties to exercise restraint and peacefully resolve South China Sea issues through multilateral dialogue and dispute settlement mechanisms, and it calls for Taiwan's inclusion in such dialogue and mechanisms on the basis of equality. MOFA reiterates that the position of the ROC (Taiwan) on South China Sea issues is as follows: 1. The South China Sea islands are part of ROC (Taiwan) territory. That the ROC (Taiwan) is entitled to all rights over the South China Sea islands and their relevant waters in accordance with international law and the law of the sea is beyond dispute. 2. The ROC (Taiwan) supports freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea. It strongly maintains that disputes should be resolved peacefully in accordance with international law and the law of sea (including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) and that it should be included in related multilateral dialogue and dispute settlement mechanisms. 3. The ROC (Taiwan) will uphold the four principles and five actions. On the basis of setting aside differences and promoting joint development, it is willing to work with all countries to safeguard and advance peace and stability, as well as to jointly protect and develop resources, in the South China Sea.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118583	2024-11-12T01:49:00-08:00

MOFA response to false claims regarding Taiwan in joint PRC-Indonesia statement issued by PRC	November 11, 2024Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during a visit to China from November 8 to 10. After the meeting, China issued the Joint Statement Between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia on Advancing the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and the China-Indonesia Community with a Shared Future, which declares that &ldquo;Indonesia reiterates its consistent adherence to [a] one-China principle, which is reaffirmed by the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, and its recognition . . . that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.&rdquo;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly protests and condemns these false claims. It reiterates that neither the Republic of China (Taiwan) nor the PRC is subordinate to the other; that the Chinese communist regime has never governed Taiwan; and that no narrative distorting Taiwan's sovereign status can change the internationally recognized status quo across the Taiwan Strait. MOFA also points out that UNGA Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan and has nothing to do with Taiwan. It stresses that the resolution neither reflects nor is equivalent to China's so-called &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Given China's continuing malicious misrepresentation of the resolution and its attempts to mislead the international community, MOFA calls on countries worldwide to come together to counter China's spurious claims. Taiwan and Indonesia share the fundamental values of democracy and freedom. President Prabowo and his new administration took office in October.

Foreign Minister Lin hosts welcome dinner for Paraguayan delegation led by Congress and Senate President Núñez and his wife	November 6, 2024 No. 396 Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung hosted a dinner banquet on November 5 to welcome a delegation from Paraguay led by Congress and Senate President Basilio Gustavo N&uacute;&ntilde;ez Gim&eacute;nez and his wife. The two sides exchanged views on a number of issues, including the deepening of bilateral diplomatic ties and enhancement of educational, public health, and economic and trade collaboration. Minister Lin noted that Taiwan and Paraguay had achieved remarkable success in their cooperation across a broad range of domains. He pointed out that the various Taiwan scholarships and the Taiwan-Paraguay Polytechnic University had nurtured many professionals who contributed to national and social development in Paraguay and served as a bridge of friendship between the two countries. Minister Lin recalled his visit to Paraguay in August last year, when he accompanied then-Vice President Lai Ching-te to the inauguration of President Santiago Pe&ntilde;a. He said that he was deeply impressed by Paraguay's development and local customs and traditions. Senate President N&uacute;&ntilde;ez stated that the visiting delegation, composed of members of the governing National Republican Association (or the Red Party) and the largest opposition Authentic Radical Liberal Party (or the Blue Party), was representative of public opinion and showed that Taiwan enjoyed staunch support among both the ruling and opposition parties. He thanked Taiwan for the many diverse projects it had implemented to benefit the Paraguayan economy and people's livelihoods over the years. He specifically cited the health information system, which had reduced patient waiting time, improved health care quality, and automated pharmaceutical and medical supply management. He stated that Paraguay would continue to refer to Taiwan's development success and experience and further broaden and deepen bilateral collaboration and exchanges. Minister Lin and Senate President N&uacute;&ntilde;ez also engaged in in-depth discussions on bilateral economic, trade, and investment issues. Both sides agreed to leverage Paraguay's membership in the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) to facilitate investment by Taiwan businesses in this market of nearly 300 million people and make use of attractive conditions such as a stable Paraguayan currency, low utility rates, tax incentives, and a large young labor force. They expressed optimism that the Diplomatic Allies Prosperity Project would support the global expansion of Taiwan's industries while stimulating industrial development in allied nations, creating a win-win situation.
