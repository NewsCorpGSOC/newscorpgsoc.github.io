He also spoke about the launch of a new agricultural cooperation program in 2025 focusing on the introduction of smart agricultural technologies to improve productivity and bolster young people's engagement in agriculture. The Republic of China (Taiwan) and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines established diplomatic relations in 1981. Over the past 43 years, bilateral cooperation projects have produced remarkable achievements.

October 27, 2024 No. 371 On October 25, during his visit to Guatemala, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung met with President Bernardo Ar&eacute;valo, Foreign Minister Carlos Mart&iacute;nez, and other senior officials. He also toured the neonatal building of San Juan de Dios Hospital, which finished construction this year with assistance from Taiwan. While at the new building, Minister Lin interacted with families that benefited from the joint endeavor, giving him the opportunity to better understand the fruits of Taiwan-Guatemala collaboration. Hospital Director Erika P&eacute;rez and Pediatrics Department Chief Juan Carlos Reyes introduced the facilities and functions of the building to Minister Lin when he toured the neonatal building in the morning. Accompanied by Guatemalan Minister of Public Health and Social Assistance Joaqu&iacute;n Barnoya, Minister Lin attended a traditional Taiwanese ceremony to bless infants and gave gifts to the attending families. In his remarks at San Juan de Dios Hospital, Minister Lin stated that, in addition to the joint construction of the hospital's neonatal building, Taiwan's technical mission and Guatemala are working on a program to promote maternal and neonatal health care. The initiative will assist in training medical professionals at hospitals and birth centers in Guatemala City to enhance their ability to give women clinical care before, during, and after childbirth and reduce premature birth and infant mortality risks, benefiting 70,000 people each year. It will also arrange for related personnel from Guatemala to travel to Taiwan for training. Over 450 health care professionals are expected to receive training, thereby raising the quality of services available to women and children in Guatemala. It took just 12 months for Taiwan and Guatemala to complete the planning and construction of the neonatal building of San Juan de Dios Hospital, which has helped improve maternal and neonatal care. The important project has been met with wide approval from the government and civil society of Guatemala. In the afternoon, Minister Lin called at Guatemala's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet with Minister Mart&iacute;nez, who invited him to view bamboo planted by Taiwan's technical mission in the square outside the building. The plants commemorate 90 years of friendship and diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Guatemala. (E)	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118511	2024-10-27T03:57:00-07:00

October 26, 2024 US White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Japanese National Security Secretariat Secretary-General Takeo Akiba, and Republic of Korea National Security Office Director Shin Won-sik held a trilateral meeting in Washington, DC, on October 25. In a joint readout issued after the meeting, the three national security advisors reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, called for the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues, and expressed strong opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion in the waters of the Indo-Pacific. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) thanks the United States, Japan, and the ROK for continuing to jointly reiterate the importance of cross-strait peace and stability through high-level meetings of national security officials and diplomats, underscoring the high degree of international consensus on maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the region. Taiwan will continue to work with the United States, Japan, the ROK, and other like-minded nations to preserve peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and beyond.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118379	2024-10-26T00:11:00-07:00	
US government officially notifies Taiwan of latest arms sale	October 26, 2024 No. 367 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has received official notification from the United States government that its executive branch has informed Congress of a US$1.988 billion arms sale to Taiwan, including the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System as well as L-band and non-L-band radar turnkey systems. MOFA warmly welcomes this news and thanks the US government for continuing to provide the weaponry and services needed for Taiwan's defense and for honoring its security commitments as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances. This is the 17th arms sale to Taiwan announced during the Biden administration. It continues the US policy of normalized arms sales that ensure Taiwan has adequate self-defense capabilities. The sale reflects the US government's unwavering support for strengthening Taiwan's defensive resilience and deterrence capabilities and demonstrates its high regard for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. China has stepped up pressure recently by again holding large-scale military drills in the waters around Taiwan. It is increasingly using live-fire exercises as a pretext for infringing upon the freedom of navigation of shipping of other countries. MOFA welcomes continuing concrete action by the United States and other like-minded partners that display support for the cross-strait status quo of peace and stability. In the face of threats posed by China, Taiwan will not shirk its self-defense responsibilities. It will continue to show a determination to protect itself, enhance its defensive capabilities and resilience, staunchly uphold its free and democratic way of life, and pursue peace through strength. Furthermore, it will work to deepen the close Taiwan-US security partnership so as to jointly safeguard the rules-based international order and advance peace, stability, and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific.

MOFA welcomes European Parliament resolution on PRC’s misinterpretation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and continuous military provocations against Taiwan	October 25, 2024No. 365The European Parliament (EP) on October 24 adopted a resolution concerning the misinterpretation of United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 2758 by the People's Republic of China and its continuous military provocations around Taiwan by an overwhelming majority of 432 votes in favor and 60 against. The EP resolution strongly opposes the PRC distorting UNGA Resolution 2758 to block Taiwan's international participation and calls on the European Union and its member states to support Taiwan's meaningful participation in relevant international organizations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly affirms and sincerely appreciates this support. The EP resolution points out that UNGA Resolution 2758 addresses the status of the PRC but does not determine that the PRC enjoys sovereignty over Taiwan, nor does it make any judgement on the future inclusion of Taiwan in the UN or any other international organization. It also states that Taiwan has never been part of the PRC. Stressing that UNGA Resolution 2758 takes no position on Taiwan, the EP resolution strongly rejects and refutes the PRC's attempts to distort history and international rules and thereby block Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. It also strongly condemns the PRC's continued military provocations and gray-zone activities against Taiwan and reiterates the EU's firm rejection of any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.Pointing out that Taiwan is a key, like-minded partner of the EU in the Indo-Pacific, the EP resolution calls for the EU and its member states to further deepen cooperation and exchanges with Taiwan in such domains as the economy, investment, semiconductor and high-tech industrial supply chains, disaster management, civil protection, and countering disinformation and foreign interference. It also advocates continued support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Criminal Police Organization, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and other multilateral organizations. In addition, the EP welcomes closer official and people-to-people interactions and exchanges between Taiwan and the EU, including the recent visit of former President Tsai Ing-wen to the EP.Since the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China passed a model resolution concerning UNGA Resolution 2758 in July for its members' reference, the Australian Senate and the Dutch House of Representatives have passed motions in support of Taiwan. The EP thus becomes the third parliament to approve a similar resolution. MOFA urges the global community to take concrete action to oppose China's misrepresentation of UNGA Resolution 2758 and to refute China's false claim that there is an international consensus on its so-called &ldquo;one China principle.&rdquo; Taiwan will continue to enhance its substantive and comprehensive cooperation with the EU and other like-minded partners to jointly ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific.

October 19, 2024 No. 359 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) sincerely appreciates that the administrations and friendly members of parliament of more than 30 countries, as well as the European Union, have publicly expressed concern over the cross-strait situation or stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability after China once again recently launched military drills to intimidate Taiwan. Countries including Taiwan's diplomatic allies, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Lithuania, and the Republic of Korea variously urged China to exercise restraint and stated that differences should be resolved through dialogue and not the threat of force or coercion. The maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is in the common interests of both sides of the strait and the international community. There is a high degree of consensus within global society over the importance of preserving peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the Indo-Pacific. MOFA once again calls on China to face up to the reality of the existence of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and to respect the Taiwanese people's choice of a free and democratic way of life, willingness to engage in international cooperation alongside China, and goodwill toward maintaining regional security and pursuing peace and shared prosperity. It urges China to stop using use military provocation or other means to threaten and suppress Taiwan and disrupt the regional status quo. Only this can facilitate the positive development of cross-strait relations and satisfy the expectations of the international community. MOFA calls on all nations to continue to voice concern over the cross-strait situation and support Taiwan. Taiwan will further work with its diplomatic allies and like-minded partners to safeguard the rules-based international order and jointly advance regional peace, stability, and prosperity.

Foreign Minister Lin addresses Global Taiwan Institute; promotes integrated diplomacy and urges cooperation with US to advance regional prosperity and...	October 17, 2024 No. 355 At the invitation of the Global Taiwan Institute (GTI), a think tank based in Washington, DC, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung delivered a keynote address via a prerecorded video at its annual symposium held on October 16. He discussed the grave challenges authoritarian coalitions and expansionism pose to the international order and commended the United States for creating a strong and mutually reinforcing latticework of alliances. He said that Taiwan, as an indispensable member of the international community, hoped to promote integrated diplomacy and work with the United States to respond to a variety of challenges. Minister Lin explained how China was ramping up military intimidation against Taiwan, in addition to legal, public opinion, and cognitive warfare. He indicated that China was deliberately using gray-zone tactics in an attempt to create a new normal across the Taiwan Strait, which seriously jeopardized peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the region. Minister Lin thanked the United States for its staunch commitment to supporting Taiwan's security, as reflected in such assistance as foreign military financing and presidential drawdown authority in recent years. He affirmed that Taiwan had also been steadily increasing its defense budget as well as whole-of-society defense resilience and defense capabilities. Minister Lin stated that the core of integrated diplomacy was the promotion of economic and trade partnerships based on mutual prosperity. He anticipated that through the Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue and other platforms Taiwan and the United States would continue to increase supply chain resilience and cooperation in critical areas. He noted that in line with the one plus one equals three concept, Taiwan and the United States could jointly facilitate development in third countries. He added that under the Global Cooperation and Training Framework cooperation with other nations could be expanded to respond to global issues and challenges, paving the way for Taiwan's policy shift from consolidating diplomatic ties to bolstering the prosperity of diplomatic allies. Emphasizing that Taiwan needed the world and the world needed Taiwan, Minister Lin said that Taiwan would continue to work closely with the United States, allies, and partners to implement integrated diplomacy and expand Taiwan's international presence. GTI was the first think tank in Washington, DC, to focus on Taiwan-related research. The theme of this year's symposium was &ldquo;US-Taiwan Relations: An Ironclad Partnership in a Period of Global Disruption.&rdquo; It explored Taiwan-US defense and security cooperation, the US elections, China's gray-zone threats, and geopolitical security issues.

MOFA response to UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office expressing serious concern over China’s joint military drills around Taiwan	October 15, 2024 The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office issued a press statement on October 14 expressing concern over China's military exercises around Taiwan and adding that these exercises increased tensions and risked dangerous escalation in the Taiwan Strait.

MOFA response to US State Department expressing serious concern over China’s military drills around Taiwan	October 14, 2024 The US State Department issued a press statement on October 13 stating that the United States was seriously concerned by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) joint military drills in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan, and that the People's Republic of China (PRC) responding with military provocations to a routine annual speech was unwarranted and risked escalation. In the statement, the United States called on the PRC to act with restraint and to avoid any further actions that may undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the region. The statement added that the United States would continue to monitor China's activities and coordinate with allies and partners regarding their shared concerns. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week publicly emphasized that Taiwan's National Day address was a routine activity and that China should not use the event as a pretext for engaging in any provocative actions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) conveys its sincere appreciation to the United States for expressing its serious concerns and reaffirming its security commitments to Taiwan, and for once again focusing attention on the PLA as it uses a routine speech to justify launching military acts of harassment against Taiwan. MOFA emphasizes that China's use of President Lai Ching-te's National Day address as a pretext for applying military pressure on Taiwan and issuing a slew of threatening remarks is a grave violation of the fundamental spirit of the United Nations Charter. Such actions will not only fail to gain the endorsement of the international community, but rather prompt countries to express heightened concern over China's provocative behavior that disrupts the status quo. MOFA calls on like-minded allies and partners to jointly press China to exercise self-restraint and to cease its intimidation of Taiwan and all activities that undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the region.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118251	2024-10-14T02:26:00-07:00

MOFA strongly condemns China for disregarding Taiwan’s goodwill and taking provocative actions that raise tensions in Taiwan Strait and region	October 14, 2024 No. 353 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has noted that China on October 14 launched its so-called Joint Sword-2024B military drill around Taiwan, once again challenging the rules-based international order and gravely undermining regional peace and stability. MOFA strongly condemns China and urges it to pull back and immediately cease its military provocations. In his National Day address, President Lai Ching-te once again expressed goodwill to China and called for it to act responsibly and work with Taiwan to maintain the prevailing state of peace, stability, and prosperity.

MOFA solemnly denounces China and urges it to neither use false pretexts aimed at justifying disagreement and strife nor become a troublemaker that undermines regional peace and stability. At the same time, MOFA calls on nations around the world to recognize China's authoritarian and expansionist nature, take concrete actions to support democratic Taiwan at this critical moment, unite in defending the values of freedom and democracy, and safeguard the rules-based international order, as well as the freedom, openness, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region.

During their stay in Tainan, the group paid a visit to Anping Old Fort, where Taiwan's rich history and culture and the warm hospitality of the people of Tainan left a deep impression on the visitors.Tuvalu is a key ally of Taiwan in the Pacific. This visit&mdash;Prime Minister Teo's second trip to Taiwan since taking office in February&mdash;proved to be greatly significant in terms of strengthening bilateral ties.

MOFA response to US Secretary of State Blinken reaffirming importance of cross-strait peace and stability at ASEAN-US and East Asia Summits	October 12, 2024 United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended the 12th ASEAN-US Summit and the 19th East Asia Summit in Laos on October 10 and 11. In remarks at the first meeting, Secretary Blinken stated that it was important to maintain a shared commitment to protect stability across the Taiwan Strait. At the East Asia Summit the following day, he again spoke on cross-strait peace and stability as well as pressing regional and international challenges and threats, including China's provocations in the East and South China Seas. Responding to a question at a press availability on October 11, Secretary Blinken highlighted the strong desire for all countries represented at the summit, including ASEAN members, to see peace and stability maintained across the Taiwan Strait. He stressed that President Lai Ching-te's National Day speech was a regular exercise that China should not use in any fashion as a pretext for provocative actions. He further reiterated the importance of maintaining the cross-strait status quo and opposition to unilateral actions by any party to change the status quo. He said that 50 percent of commercial container traffic went through the Taiwan Strait every day and that more than 70 percent of high-end semiconductors were produced in Taiwan. This showed that there was a strong global economic incentive to maintain peace and stability and preserve the status quo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs thanks the United States for continuing to use key regional summits to underscore the importance of cross-strait and regional peace and stability and for stating unequivocally that Taiwan's regular National Day speech should not be a pretext for China's provocations. As an important member of the Indo-Pacific region and a defender of the regional status quo, Taiwan will continue to collaborate with like-minded nations to uphold cross-strait and regional peace, stability, and prosperity.	https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&s=118250	2024-10-12T02:09:00-07:00
