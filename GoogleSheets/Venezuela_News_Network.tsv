From Sudamerica Radical Some time ago, I wrote a message where I ...	From Sudamerica RadicalSome time ago, I wrote a message where I called to go out and fight for Venezuela on January 10, 2025, regardless of whether the -opposition- does something or not, regardless of whether that day MCM calls to stay at home or to take any other measure that we know will not be effective. I imagine that many of those who read this message will wonder why we do it if we have failed in past years, so I will try to explain why:It is true that we have lost in previous struggles, 2002, 2014, 2017, 2019 and perhaps some other year that I am overlooking, all of you who are reading me know or have heard of someone who died or was seriously injured in those struggles, I know that nobody likes to lose. Show me a happy loser, and I will show you a loser. Almost 2025 has arrived and many people think that the best thing to do is to do nothing and that is the problem, the reason why this government has lasted so many years in power is due to the help of the opposition and mainly because Venezuelans play it too safe, everyone today is afraid of losing again, which they do lose. But winning does not mean not being afraid of losing. Victories generally follow defeats.Before learning to ride a bicycle, we fall many times. I have never met a baseball player who has not been struck out. I have never met someone who has fallen in love without being heartbroken before. I have never met a rich person who has not lost money. And I have never met a country with freedom that has not lost in its fight for freedom.The reason why Venezuelans do not win from the point of view of overthrowing the government is because the pain of losing is much greater than the joy of being free. -Everyone wants to go to heaven but no one wants to die.-Many may not know the story of the Alamo, but it is a great story of brave people who preferred to fight, knowing there was no hope of success against overwhelming odds. They chose to die rather than surrender, and although everyone who was at the Alamo died, it was thanks to this battle that the U.S. was able to defeat Mexico in the war.We cannot bury our failures, but we can draw inspiration from them. Failure encourages the most determined to become winners. All who have succeeded were encouraged by failures to improve. Winners are encouraged by losses, and losers are defeated.The United States was attacked at Pearl Harbor during the years of World War II, being one of the greatest losses for the U.S., but at the same time it was thanks to that attack that every time they fought the Americans said: -Remember Pearl Harbor.- This became one of the main reasons for winning. It was thanks to that great defeat that gave the United States strength to continue fighting.Most people who are afraid of losing play it safe: they emigrate, do nothing or join the government, live their whole lives as slaves and at best with a standard quality of life in another country. This happened in Cuba, when Cubans preferred to emigrate, do nothing or simply accept the system. Ask Cubans if that life was worth it? The main reason why dictatorships perpetuate themselves is because of playing it safe, because of the fear of losing. They don't play to win.Don't get me wrong, emigrating is not bad, but when your country is in crisis, the treatment you receive is not the best, for obvious reasons stable countries do not want mass emigrants from other countries and it causes the decision to leave the country only to cause your quality of life in economic matters to be good but in social matters you are despised, mistreated and in the worst case attacked because of where you come from.We can find excuses for not going out on January 10: -it's too dangerous-, -it's too risky-, -let's wait for the opposition- and believe me, we will all have lost.	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/13123	2024-11-03T18:26:48-08:00

His driver is wounded.➡️ It happened after weeks that Evo Morales supporters blocked the roads and streets to protest against the current Leftist President of Bolivia, Luis Arce, over the attempts by Bolivian Judicial system to arrest Evo over the rape of a teenager ➡️ Over the past weeks, Mr. Morales has been trying to resist arrest attempts related to the rape accusation and has been actively, behind the doors, asking for asylum in neighboring and allied countries (i.e. Brazil), though he did not specify which ones.➡️ Although Pro-BRICS media outlets purposefully do not mention this, it is worth remembering that Evo Morales' party, the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS), is irreparably fractured and that the current dominant faction, Pro-Arce, which is socially progressive and aligned with regional social-democratic factions, is doing everything it can to eliminate Morales from Bolivian politics.

First case of polio recorded in Venezuela after 30 years of being eradicatedThe Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) confirmed this Friday, October 18, the resurgence of polio in Venezuela after 30 years of having been eradicated.Although the Polio Bulletin published by PAHO does not specify who the patient is, nor how serious his case is, it is known that he is a two-year-old child who lives in Delta Amacuro and was not vaccinated against the disease.

Venezuelans without passports or safe-conduct passes can enter the country through the border with ColombiaVenezuelans without passports or with expired documents who need to enter the country can do so through the border with Colombia, due to the existence of the Treaty of Tonchalá, which establishes mobility between both countries by simply presenting an identity card.William Gómez, border analyst and former mayor of the border municipality of Bolívar, explained that given Venezuela's regulations not allowing entry into the country to those with expired documents and without safe-conduct passes, the option to return to the country is through the international bridges that link Venezuela with Colombia through the state of Táchira.The option would be to travel from any of the countries to El Dorado airport in Bogotá, where they can stamp entry into the country even with an expired passport, and then travel to Cúcuta, where it is also possible to stamp exit from Colombia. From Cúcuta, Norte de Santander, there are four international bridges through which you can enter Venezuela: Simón Bolívar, Atanasio Girardot, Francisco de Paula Santander and Puente Unión.	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/12924	2024-10-07T14:02:25-07:00
