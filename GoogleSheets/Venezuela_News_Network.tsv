With a cape, worker's helmet, and iron fist, he -fights the American empire and other enemies, including opposition members.-⁉️ In a recently released episode, Super Bigote's enemy is Musk, depicted as the Devil—he has hair shaped like horns, long nails, and sits in an office chair with a pentagram on it. He also wears an armband resembling that of the Nazis, but with the logo of the social network he owns.💥 Súper Bigote responds by saying that in this context, he is -David against Goliath,- a reference to the biblical story of David, the small and brave defender of his people, who defeated a much larger and more powerful adversary, the giant Goliath.Source 🖇 Video is too big	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/12536	2024-08-24T18:00:10-07:00
