Saab says they are still reviewing cases of those arrested in post-election protestsAttorney General Tarek William Saab confirmed on Thursday afternoon, December 5, that they will continue to review the measures of deprivation of liberty of those arrested during the post-election protests in July. However, he insisted that the possibility of favorable decisions will depend on each case.Saab, interviewed in La Iguana, mentioned the case of the teenager Mariana G√≥nzalez, who was released from prison and was subject to a review measure after an evaluation made by the Public Prosecutor's Office and the forensic doctor.He stressed that the authorities managed to quell -the violence- in the demonstrations that took place after the elections, following the announcement by the CNE that it had awarded the victory to President Nicol√°s Maduro. In his opinion, this left the opposition -with nothing.-On the night of Wednesday, December 4, Saab himself announced that the teenager Mariana Gonz√°lez - arrested on July 29 during the post-election protests - had been released after requesting a review of the measure.The teenager's case became known a few days ago through a letter sent to her parents. The 16-year-old wrote a letter to her mother in which she revealed the conditions in which she was held and stated that she felt -without strength- and -without the will to live.-In the letter, shared by the human rights account Vente Venezuela, Gonz√°lez said that he missed his mother very much and that he was depressed.	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/13381	2024-12-06T17:23:34-08:00
