ATROCIOUS stance by Brazil on the recent Venezuelan election, with President Lula, when asked if he recognized Nicolas Maduro's victory, declaring, -Not yet. Not yet. He knows he owes an explanation to Brazilian society and to the world. He knows this.- The arrogance! Egregious! Actually, Lula - or maybe we should call him Jewla! - Maduro owes nothing to nobody EXCEPT the Venezuelan people. And THEY... chose HIM, with the results being independently verified as legitimate! 🇻🇪 🤬 🇧🇷As ugly as it is however... The level of astonishment is actually minuscule. Because the Lula regime... is a ZOG. Through and through. A lot of talk against 'Israel' and absolutely ZERO action, with Brasilia--Tel Aviv- ties blossoming on all fronts beneath the surface of the public eye.Joining the coupmongers against the usurping Zionist entity's number one target in Latin America might be Lula's biggest service to Empire Judaica yet. We would call it disappointing or even heartbreaking considering the one-time brotherly warmth between El Comandante Hugo Chávez (R.A.) and the now-adversary of Bolivarianism... But... The Zionist-collaborationist history unfortunately speaks for itself. And this betrayal is thus par for the course. 🇻🇪 🤬 🇧🇷 #VivaMaduro #VivaChavez #TheNoticing #GRNIntel 🔴 @Cultures_of_Resistance	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/12485	2024-08-18T04:39:10-07:00
