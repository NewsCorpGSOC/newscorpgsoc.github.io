🎖️🇻🇪The problem with venezuelan military. Have you ever though...	🎖️🇻🇪The problem with venezuelan military.Have you ever thought why venezuelan military has not acted like it should? Everybody knows about the existence of 'Cartel de los Soles', a drug trafficking organization ruled by Nicolás Maduro and FANB generals. But even thinking like if we were venezuelan generals, why not just killing Maduro, talk in private with María Corina telling her -don't mess with our business and we don't mess with politics-. Is it so hard?The reason why that does not happen is because paradoxically the military power in Venezuela is diluted. How? To give you an idea let's talk about how many generals have neighboring countries and superpowers.🇨🇴Colombia: around 100 generals. A little bit less since Petro is president.🇧🇷 Brazil: during Bolsonaro the country had around 130 generals. Of course, bigger country.🇲🇽México: the exact number by 2017 was 541 generals. Big number if we note that is not the largest army in Latin America🇺🇸USA: uncle Sam's armed forces count around 900 generals.🇷🇺 Russia: sources estimate that the number of russian generals is around 1.200.Venezuela🇻🇪 in the other hand many sources had claimed that the number of venezuelan generals rise to 2.000, and maybe more. The questions start:Who has more power, one general of Colombia or one in Venezuela? How many generals have to agree in Venezuela to make a coup and how possible is to actually get in that number? How many generals would sell the others to climb closer to the top?When you see it with that perspective and start asking this questions, you understand why nothing like a coup (excluding isolated middle and low rank uprisings like Caguaripano's) has not happened.	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/12329	2024-08-11T13:34:51-07:00
