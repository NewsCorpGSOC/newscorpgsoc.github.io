Along with Caracas, Barquisimeto and Valencia, the city of Maracaibo recorded more hot days due to climate change in 2023, as indicated in a report by Climate Central in June	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/13073	2024-10-27T17:28:01-07:00

Forwarded From Bellum Acta - Intel, Urgent News and Archives#BREAKING 🇧🇴🔫❗️ — It is reported that Former Bolivian President Evo Morales survived an supposed -assassination attempt- in Shinahota, Bolivia after the former socialist leader tried to flee a Police checkpoint, causing the police officers to fire upon the car➡️ 14 gunshots against the vehicle he’s traveling in. His driver is wounded.➡️ It happened after weeks that Evo Morales supporters blocked the roads and streets to protest against the current Leftist President of Bolivia, Luis Arce, over the attempts by Bolivian Judicial system to arrest Evo over the rape of a teenager ➡️ Over the past weeks, Mr. Morales has been trying to resist arrest attempts related to the rape accusation and has been actively, behind the doors, asking for asylum in neighboring and allied countries (i.e. Brazil), though he did not specify which ones.➡️ Although Pro-BRICS media outlets purposefully do not mention this, it is worth remembering that Evo Morales' party, the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS), is irreparably fractured and that the current dominant faction, Pro-Arce, which is socially progressive and aligned with regional social-democratic factions, is doing everything it can to eliminate Morales from Bolivian politics.

It also indicates that these children were forced to sell candy or beg for money in commercial areas.Local authorities in Lechería were already following up on cases of this type, suspecting that adults must be behind this type of activity. However, it was thanks to a complaint that they managed to locate at least three adults, who were in charge of logistics.Police officers from Urbaneja captured three people, managed to rescue 11 children and also carried out the confiscation of a vehicle. In this vehicle, the subjects are presumed to have transported the children from popular areas and then transported them to more commercial areas of the city.Additionally, it highlights that the detainees will be charged with various crimes related to child exploitation.For his part, the mayor of Lechería, Manuel Ferreira, assured that the case is being worked on jointly with other agencies such as the Public Prosecutor's Office and also the Council for the Protection of Minors.

Venezuelans without passports or safe-conduct passes can enter the country through the border with ColombiaVenezuelans without passports or with expired documents who need to enter the country can do so through the border with Colombia, due to the existence of the Treaty of Tonchalá, which establishes mobility between both countries by simply presenting an identity card.William Gómez, border analyst and former mayor of the border municipality of Bolívar, explained that given Venezuela's regulations not allowing entry into the country to those with expired documents and without safe-conduct passes, the option to return to the country is through the international bridges that link Venezuela with Colombia through the state of Táchira.The option would be to travel from any of the countries to El Dorado airport in Bogotá, where they can stamp entry into the country even with an expired passport, and then travel to Cúcuta, where it is also possible to stamp exit from Colombia. From Cúcuta, Norte de Santander, there are four international bridges through which you can enter Venezuela: Simón Bolívar, Atanasio Girardot, Francisco de Paula Santander and Puente Unión.	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/12924	2024-10-07T14:02:25-07:00
