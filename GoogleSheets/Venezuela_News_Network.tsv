Prosecutor's Office refused to accept a complaint for the forced disappearance of Williams Dávila because -it was the weekend-More than 48 hours have passed since the forced disappearance of former deputy and former governor Williams Dávila, leader of AD in resistance, and neither his family nor his lawyers know of his whereabouts.Despite being told that the leader is being held in El Helicoide, they have not been able to verify this information because they are being denied entry, reported Génesis Dávila, president of the NGO Defiende Venezuela.The human rights organization went with its team of lawyers to file a complaint at the Prosecutor's Office on Saturday 10th, but they responded that -because it is the weekend they do not receive complaints of human rights violations.-	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/12330	2024-08-11T13:53:34-07:00
🎖️🇻🇪The problem with venezuelan military. Have you ever though...	🎖️🇻🇪The problem with venezuelan military.Have you ever thought why venezuelan military has not acted like it should? Everybody knows about the existence of 'Cartel de los Soles', a drug trafficking organization ruled by Nicolás Maduro and FANB generals. But even thinking like if we were venezuelan generals, why not just killing Maduro, talk in private with María Corina telling her -don't mess with our business and we don't mess with politics-. Is it so hard?The reason why that does not happen is because paradoxically the military power in Venezuela is diluted. How? To give you an idea let's talk about how many generals have neighboring countries and superpowers.🇨🇴Colombia: around 100 generals. A little bit less since Petro is president.🇧🇷 Brazil: during Bolsonaro the country had around 130 generals. Of course, bigger country.🇲🇽México: the exact number by 2017 was 541 generals. Big number if we note that is not the largest army in Latin America🇺🇸USA: uncle Sam's armed forces count around 900 generals.🇷🇺 Russia: sources estimate that the number of russian generals is around 1.200.Venezuela🇻🇪 in the other hand many sources had claimed that the number of venezuelan generals rise to 2.000, and maybe more. The questions start:Who has more power, one general of Colombia or one in Venezuela? How many generals have to agree in Venezuela to make a coup and how possible is to actually get in that number? How many generals would sell the others to climb closer to the top?When you see it with that perspective and start asking this questions, you understand why nothing like a coup (excluding isolated middle and low rank uprisings like Caguaripano's) has not happened.	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/12329	2024-08-11T13:34:51-07:00
