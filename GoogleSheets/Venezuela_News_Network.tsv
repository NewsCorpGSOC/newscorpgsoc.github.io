Maria Corina statement:-To Venezuelans and the world,The decision of the Argentine government to grant diplomatic asylum to the six members of our team at its official residence in Caracas on March 20, 2024, as well as that of the Brazilian government to safeguard Argentine interests in Venezuela since August 1, have been made in strict compliance with international law, to guarantee their protection and the guarantee of their human rights.These are six honorable people who, like millions of Venezuelans, have served the cause of democracy and freedom in a brave and impeccable manner. The alleged and absurd accusations against them, as well as the unilateral decisions by the Venezuelan regime, violating international conventions on diplomatic asylum and immunity of diplomatic missions, represent a serious threat against them, against those of us who have assumed the defense of democracy in Venezuela, and against the rights and interests of nations that have representation in other countries.The principle of the inviolability of diplomatic missions, according to the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations and Consular Relations, is sacred, and encompasses not only their physical spaces, but also the dignity and integrity of the persons present there.Diplomatic asylum, as a principle and institution with a profound Latin American spirit, has served to protect those who are politically persecuted, and has been an essential pillar of the doctrine on the protection of human rights. Its convention, signed in Caracas, is very clear about its scope and implementation. Today, it is intended to be violated, precisely in this city.We alert the world about the consequences that violations of these norms could have for our country and for the entire region. We also ask democratic nations to support us and provide the necessary support and protection for all those activists who are suffering harassment and persecution in these hours. We also ask them to take the necessary steps to issue safe-conduct passes for our colleagues, as stipulated in international law.We are determined to move forward with serenity, courage and firmness until the end.The truth is with us and will set us free.-	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/12681	2024-09-07T16:35:18-07:00
