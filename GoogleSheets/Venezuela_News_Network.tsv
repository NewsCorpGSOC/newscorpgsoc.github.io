Venezuelans without passports or safe-conduct passes can enter the country through the border with ColombiaVenezuelans without passports or with expired documents who need to enter the country can do so through the border with Colombia, due to the existence of the Treaty of Tonchalá, which establishes mobility between both countries by simply presenting an identity card.William Gómez, border analyst and former mayor of the border municipality of Bolívar, explained that given Venezuela's regulations not allowing entry into the country to those with expired documents and without safe-conduct passes, the option to return to the country is through the international bridges that link Venezuela with Colombia through the state of Táchira.The option would be to travel from any of the countries to El Dorado airport in Bogotá, where they can stamp entry into the country even with an expired passport, and then travel to Cúcuta, where it is also possible to stamp exit from Colombia. From Cúcuta, Norte de Santander, there are four international bridges through which you can enter Venezuela: Simón Bolívar, Atanasio Girardot, Francisco de Paula Santander and Puente Unión.	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/12924	2024-10-07T14:02:25-07:00

Forwarded From Tupi Report 🇧🇷🇻🇪🇻🇪💥📰 — ALERT OF REPRESSION IN VENEZUELA: Nicolás Maduro's regime has intensified its persecution of the press, offering a $150 reward for each journalist captured, as reported by photographer Juan Carlos Neira. Neira was followed by the municipal police of Miranda after covering a protest organized by María Corina Machado in Caracas⛓ Neira managed to take refuge in a commercial establishment where the owners helped him escape. A police officer reportedly confessed that the government offers rewards for the capture of journalists. Shortly after, a SEBIN van arrived to arrest him, but the store owners helped him flee by jumping across rooftops.❗️ The repressive wave doesn’t stop there: in the last two months, 15 journalists have been arrested in Venezuela, 10 of whom are still imprisoned, facing serious charges of -terrorism- and -incitement to hatred.- Journalists detained during this period face sentences ranging from 12 to 20 years in prison.	https://t.me/VenezuelaNetwork/12878	2024-09-30T09:26:28-07:00
