ASEAN’s economic diplomacy as the crucial lynchpin in East Asian security	Since its formation ASEAN’s success has been founded on a globally-oriented economic development strategy built on economic integration with its bigger industrial neighbours in East Asia. ASEAN countries trade with one another, but the key to their success has been the rapid growth in the trade ASEAN countries do with countries outside the bloc.&nbsp; For decades intra-ASEAN trade has hovered around just 25 per cent of total ASEAN trade but ASEAN overall trades much more than its GDP — making it one of the most trade dependent regions in the world. ASEAN is at the geographic and policy centre of East Asia, increasingly so as its scale and importance in the regional and global economy grows. Collectively, ASEAN is now China’s largest trading partner.&nbsp; ASEAN’s high trade shares with its big industrial neighbours thus make East Asia the primary theatre for leverage and action on shared interests in the multilateral global trade regime. ASEAN&#8217;s growth will continue to depend on trade-based development, marked by heavy specialisation in the region. This further increases its stake in regional and global institutional frameworks that promote a free, open and multilaterally negotiated regime of rules governing trade and cross-border investment.&nbsp; Both the scale and the nature of ASEAN’s growth give political impetus to policy processes aimed at better integrating ASEAN into the global economy.&nbsp; ASEAN has many times declared its interests in ‘free trade and open markets. with respect for a rules-based, non-discriminatory, open, free, fair, inclusive, equitable, and transparent multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core’, again recently in the Australian-ASEAN Joint Leaders’ Declaration at the Australia–ASEAN Special Summit in March 2024.&nbsp; Thus ASEAN, as a lynchpin of an open economic order in East Asia, has a central role to play in global diplomatic strategy as the driver of a globally significant order-making enterprise aimed at making multilateralism and rules-based trade and investment robust to the big geopolitical forces that put pressure on it today. This is the critical economic dimension of ASEAN centrality. As Mari Pangestu and Rania Teguh observe&nbsp;in this week’s lead article, there is a ‘chorus of calls for ASEAN to walk the talk on its claims of centrality in the management of the strategic challenges to peace and prosperity in East Asia. Calls for ASEAN to -do more- usually centre on its claiming a more assertive role in security affairs in the South China Sea and redoubling its efforts to encourage political dialogue in Myanmar’. But, as they correctly say, ‘the biggest threat to ASEAN centrality is corrosion of the open economic order on which its prosperity and security depend’. Indeed, ASEAN faces increasingly acute risks to its hard-won centrality within regional architecture, as great-power competition threatens to become the defining dynamic in the international politics of the region in the absence of new efforts to moderate it through multilateral cooperation. The big strategic question today is what ASEAN can do to future-proof its centrality. What is needed at this pivotal moment in regional and world affairs is a regional order framed by the interests that its member states have in non-alignment, economic integration based on market principles, and multilateral management of security and other transnational policy issues that are key to prosperity and peace in the region. To achieve something remotely like that, ASEAN must reassert its agency, making fuller use of existing mechanisms and platforms to drive tangible policy outcomes that defend and extend its key norms and institutions. Pangestu and Teguh argue that the Regional Comprehensive Partnership (RCEP) is a ready-to-go vehicle for ASEAN to safeguard shared commitment to free and rules-based trade, coordinate on the green transition and commit to common positions in defence of the multilateral trading system with regional partners. The ASEAN Outlook on the Indo Pacific (AOIP) situates ASEAN in regional architecture and the East Asian Summit is the platform for delivery of a new ASEAN agenda. ‘RCEP is more than a trade agreement’, as Pangestu and Teguh point out. ‘Its inbuilt institutional infrastructure includes a political cooperation process led by ministers and leaders, supported by a Joint Committee and subsidiary bodies. This provides a political foundation for addressing emerging policy challenges, from digital trade to climate change, through multilateral cooperation. RCEP is a -living agreement- which allows for a comprehensive economic cooperation agenda’.&nbsp; ‘Cooperation within RCEP structures also gives the region the opportunity to form common policy positions in response to developments outside the region that impinge upon its core ASEAN economic development interests’. The essential ingredient is a level of political will commensurate with the acute challenges that confront ASEAN’s centrality in managing the region’s pressing, and deeply intertwined, economic and security challenges. To make a difference, ASEAN centrality must be a hard-headed exercise in the leverage that ASEAN has accrued as a consequence of its strategic non-alignment. In current circumstances, the onus will be on ASEAN to prove its relevance through tangible steps to upgrade its institutions and processes to meet the challenges of the times and actually using them to forge multilateral solutions to those challenges. This will require a major push against the policy drift in ASEAN itself. ASEAN’s efforts cannot therefore be limited to statements of principles unaccompanied by concrete plans for policy action to which ASEAN can hold itself accountable and demonstrate a way forward to the region and the world. Crucially, this process must be led by active initiative from the top. Potentially transformative institutions such as RCEP have no endogenous source of political momentum. To develop momentum infusions of purpose and legitimacy will therefore have to come from ASEAN’s leaders’ and ministers’ level forums. In RCEP, at least, ASEAN has an instrument for reclaiming policy leadership and economic diplomacy to meet the strategic challenges that it now faces.

ASEAN needs to reclaim RCEP for regional economic leadership	There is a chorus of calls for ASEAN to walk the talk on its claims of centrality in the management of the strategic challenges to peace and prosperity in East Asia. Calls for ASEAN to ‘do more’ usually centre on its claiming a more assertive role in security affairs in the South China Sea and redoubling its efforts to encourage political dialogue in Myanmar. But the bigger threat to ASEAN centrality is corrosion of the open economic order on which its prosperity and security depend. And there is opportunity to cement its role as a platform for negotiating a regional economic order attuned to its members’ interests in East Asia through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which is less politically fraught. RCEP is the world’s largest trade agreement, with its 15 members of 2.3 billion people accounting for 32 per cent of global GDP and 29 per cent of world merchandise trade. It aims to create a more integrated and efficient regional market, driving growth, strengthening regional value chains and boosting competitiveness of member economies. RCEP will also promote investment by attracting more foreign direct investment into regional manufacturing. Other provisions on e-commerce, competition, intellectual property and SME development can also support trade growth. In the 15–20 year phase-in for less developed members, the agreement provides for 92 per cent market access among all the partners. The current utilisation of RCEP varies across member countries, with big differences in the number of Certificates of Origin (COOs) issued in its first year of operation. Members which did not have an FTA with each other prior to RCEP’s implementation benefited most. China leads with 218,100 COOs issued in 2023, a 38.2 per cent year-on-year increase, on exports valued at US$7.21 billion. The figures for Thailand and Indonesia are still miniscule. Regional value chains are yet to be reconfigured beyond the ASEAN + 1 FTAs with China, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand, under cumulative rules of origin. RCEP is more than a trade agreement. Its inbuilt institutional infrastructure includes a political cooperation process led by ministers and leaders, supported by a Joint Committee and subsidiary bodies. This provides a political foundation for addressing emerging policy challenges, from digital trade to climate change, through multilateral cooperation. RCEP is a ‘living agreement’ which allows for a comprehensive economic cooperation agenda.&nbsp; The region can stay competitive in the industries of the future without sleepwalking into protectionism or a wasteful industrial policy arms race by working together now to ensure the development of trans-regional value chains allows its economies to specialise where they have comparative advantage, not just in goods but also in services. The restructuring of industrial value chains around the energy transition and shifts in manufacturing bases has, however, not been matched by the cooperation that is required. ASEAN is in danger of falling into the trap of inefficient and costly fragmentation around competition for investment in these sectors. RCEP’s economic cooperation pillar was designed to address this danger. Cooperation within RCEP structures also gives the region the opportunity to form common policy positions in response to developments outside the region that impinge upon its core ASEAN economic development interests. One of the biggest risks to regional integration is the increasing securitisation of economic policy in industrial economies that reshape trade around dubious political considerations rather than market competitiveness. A critical issue is the unilateral imposition of rules by external actors, particularly in areas such as environmental regulation. The European Union’s Deforestation Regulation and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) are examples of policies that could disrupt ASEAN’s economic development strategies, highlighting the need for ASEAN to strengthen its own regulatory frameworks and ensure that external rules don’t undermine regional cooperation. RCEP provides ASEAN with the tools to push back against this trend and needs to act quickly to defend the rules-based multilateral system and safeguard its multilateral economic interests. One immediate step would be for ASEAN to embrace the Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement (MPIA), which serves as a temporary backstop for the WTO’s dispute settlement system. Another priority would be addressing the misuse of the national security exception under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which has been increasingly invoked to justify protectionist policies. ASEAN has a clear interest in working with its partners to limit the overreach of this provision. The success of RCEP depends on political leadership. Without clear direction from the top, the agreement risks being a locomotive stuck at the station. ASEAN’s leaders will have to take ownership of the regional economic agenda, to utilise RCEP not only a platform for economic growth but also as an instrument for managing strategic challenges. It can also do this through leading by example — demonstrating through policy initiative its commitment to multilateralism, open markets, and sustainable development. The recent downgrade of US credit by Fitch should serve as a wake-up call. The US withdrawal from global economic leadership has significant implications, and regional policymakers and leaders need to understand the gravity of the situation. It isn’t business as usual: the great powers, who increasingly see their economic relationships through the prism of geopolitical competition, can’t be relied upon to supply the global public good of leadership in furthering multilateralism and rules-based trade. To an unprecedented extent, small and middle powers — especially in the Global South — must now take the lead on openness. In RCEP, ASEAN and East Asia have a vehicle for taking on that role, and ASEAN must reclaim ownership of RCEP to assume its centrality in regional leadership.

Smelters squeeze Indonesia’s nickel ore supply	Indonesia has emerged as the leading force in the nickel industry, holding over half of the global&nbsp;market share&nbsp;in 2023. Since the&nbsp;downstreaming policy&nbsp;banning raw nickel ore exports was enacted in 2020, nickel mining and production activities have steadily risen, driven by robust global demand and an influx of investment in processing and smelting facilities across the country. Indonesia’s nickel ore output has seen a significant increase, more than tripling from&nbsp;51.3 million tonnes&nbsp;in 2020 to&nbsp;175.6 million tonnes&nbsp;in 2023. This rapid growth, driven by a strong push for onshore nickel processing, has led to an excess of processed or semi-processed nickel products. But concerns are rising due to a mismatch between the capacity of the nickel ore supply on the mining side and the demand for smelters on the production side.&nbsp; Nickel sourced from and processed in&nbsp;Indonesia has been&nbsp;flooding the global market, leading to a supply glut and driving down prices worldwide. As a result, some miners outside Indonesia have been forced to&nbsp;shut down&nbsp;their operations. Indonesia&nbsp;was&nbsp;also blamed as a primary contributor to the decline in nickel prices in early 2024. There are&nbsp;44 nickel smelters&nbsp;in operation with a production capacity of 22.9 million tonnes per year&nbsp;in Indonesia.&nbsp;Out of 44 operating facilities, 40 are Rotary Kiln Electric Furnace (RKEF) smelters that process higher-grade saprolite nickel ore into nickel pig iron (NPI) and stainless steel. The remaining four facilities use High Pressure Acid Leach technology to process lower-grade limonite nickel ore into mixed hydroxide precipitate, a material used in EV batteries.&nbsp;There are&nbsp;also&nbsp;19 projects under construction and another seven facilities under feasibility study, totalling up to 70 nickel smelter plants nationwide.&nbsp; The high&nbsp;number of nickel processing facilities in Indonesia has led to new challenges, particularly in sourcing the raw nickel ore for processing needs. Since late 2023, Indonesia has seen early signs of a&nbsp;supply shortage&nbsp;due to the rapid growth of processing and refining facilities, coupled with limited ore availability. Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources has&nbsp;calculated&nbsp;that the country’s total nickel reserves reached 5.3 billion tonnes of ore and 56 million tonnes of metal, including both proven and estimated reserves.&nbsp; Despite having the world’s largest nickel reserves and being the world’s largest nickel producer, Indonesia has imported a record amount of nickel from neighbouring countries like the Philippines&nbsp;and&nbsp;Australia. In 2023, Indonesia imported&nbsp;374,468 tonnes&nbsp;of nickel ore valued at US$16 million.&nbsp; Inconsistent nickel supply due to permit delays has prompted companies to seek alternative ore supply from abroad. In June 2024,&nbsp;the energy ministry approved mining permits&nbsp;for 470 nickel companies for the 2024–26 period, with a combined production of up to&nbsp;240 million tonnes&nbsp;annually. Industry groups have called for&nbsp;the government to start the moratorium on the issuance of permits for RKEF smelters to prolong the availability of high-grade nickel reserves. The Indonesia Nickel Miners Association&nbsp;projected that&nbsp;the country’s high-grade ore reserves may be depleted&nbsp;in the next six years. The Indonesian Nickel Industry Forum has also emphasised the urgent&nbsp;need for a moratorium, pointing out that the nickel ore processing capacity has reached 130 million tonnes annually, while the actual ore production falls short, not exceeding 100 million tonnes per year. After&nbsp;extensive discussions throughout 2023 among government agencies about the need for a moratorium on RKEF smelters, the Ministry&nbsp;of&nbsp;Energy and Mineral Resources&nbsp;finally announced&nbsp;that a moratorium will be imposed, pending the issuance of relevant government regulations. Besides ensuring a stable domestic supply, implementing the moratorium is crucial for maintaining price stability in the global market, considering Indonesia’s significant market shares. Excessive production of processed nickel from Indonesia could lead to downward pressure on prices, resulting a decline in global NPI prices and hurting profitability for producers. Continued overproduction in the RKEF smelters could also accelerate the depletion of nickel resources. Moving forward, the major task for the Indonesian government, including the administration to be sworn in October 2024, is to attract more companies to&nbsp;invest in&nbsp;High-Pressure Acid Leach facilities. These plants are crucial for processing nickel ore into battery-grade materials required for electric vehicle&nbsp;production, as the country aims to become a global electronic vehicle&nbsp;hub and reap the economic benefits from this burgeoning industry.&nbsp; While developing High Pressure Acid Leach facilities remains costly due to high capital and operational expenditures, as well as technological and environmental concerns, the government needs to find&nbsp;effective strategies&nbsp;to foster more investment.&nbsp; While accelerating investment in the country’s nickel sector is&nbsp;essential for economic growth&nbsp;and job creation, it is equally important for the government to prioritise sustainability. Tighter regulations and the adoption of sustainable mining practices are necessary to mitigate&nbsp;negative impacts on the environment.&nbsp; Ensuring a stable and secure supply of nickel through an RKEF moratorium is crucial for stabilising nickel supply, preventing the overproduction of certain outputs and balancing market demand. It will also manage the pace of resources extraction and prevent the rapid depletion of nickel reserves by enforcing stringent environmental regulations, ensuring sustainable long-term development.

Is the dissolution of Jemaah Islamiyah a victory or a strategic deception?	On 30 June 2024 Abu Rusydan, a former leader of Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and veteran of the Afghan conflict, announced the official dissolution of the militant group. Contemplating this development, one question looms large — is this the definitive end of JI, or is it a strategic deception with far-reaching implications? Once the most feared terrorist organisation in Southeast Asia, with links to Al-Qaeda, JI’s demise was unexpected. For decades, it has orchestrated some of the most devastating terrorist attacks in Southeast Asia, most notoriously the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people. Yet in recent years the group has struggled to maintain its once-formidable presence. Relentless counter-terrorism operations led by Southeast Asian governments, particularly Indonesia, played a pivotal role in JI’s downfall. The Indonesian National Police’s Detachment 88 (Densus 88) has been instrumental in dismantling the group’s cells, leading to over 1200 arrests and capturing key figures, including top JI leader Zulkarnaen. Internal strife also weakened JI. The horrific scale of the Bali bombings and other attacks led to a loss of public support, driving potential recruits away and diminishing JI’s financial backing. Ideological disagreements, leadership disputes and factional splits further eroded the group’s cohesion. Despite attempts at resurgence in the mid-2010s, during which time JI was committed to not engage in terrorism in Indonesia, JI could never reclaim its former strength. The arrest of its leader, Para Wijayanto, in 2019 was a crippling blow. And by 2022, even Wijayanto admitted in a prison interview that JI no longer existed as a unified entity. But the story of JI does not end with its dissolution. Its ideological influence persists through figures like Dr Sunardi, whose death at the hands of Densus 88 led to widespread protests from the medical community, underscoring the need for transparent communication regarding counter-terrorism strategies. Scepticism lingers within extremist circles and among counter-terrorism experts about the true nature of this disbandment. Is JI really gone or has it simply slipped into the shadows, waiting for a more opportune moment to re-emerge under a different guise? One troubling aspect of the dissolution is the lack of transparency regarding JI’s economic assets. There has been no clear transfer of funds or disclosure of the group’s financial dealings, raising suspicions that this might be a tactical manoeuvre rather than a genuine disbandment. Is this a strategy to safeguard resources for future operations, or perhaps to infiltrate governmental structures, as has been seen in other conflict zones like Syria? The case of senior JI member Bambang Sukirno, known as ‘Bangkir’, adds another layer of complexity. Despite suspicions about his collaboration with Indonesian authorities, Bangkir remains influential due to his substantial financial resources. It remains unclear whether he is a genuine supporter of JI or a covert ally of the authorities. JI’s dissolution is an opportunity for governments to shift focus towards rehabilitation. Former JI members, now lacking an organisational structure, are at a crossroad. Effective rehabilitation programs can prevent these individuals from slipping back into extremism, instead guiding them towards social reintegration. But this is easier said than done. Rehabilitation is not just about providing job training or education; it requires a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of radicalisation, including ideological indoctrination and social alienation. With support from the National Counter Terrorism Agency, international donors and Islamic organisations such as Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama — though not yet strong in their rehabilitation efforts — can work closely with other civil society groups involved in preventing and countering violent extremism (P/CVE) in Indonesia. These organisations can assist in ensuring that JI-affiliated schools, which continue to operate legally under Indonesian law, are rid of extremist ideologies and promote peace and tolerance. Even as policymakers focus on rehabilitation, they must remain vigilant. The enduring popularity of JI’s dual approach — preaching (dakwah) and armed struggle (jihad) — among certain segments of the population means that the group’s legacy may continue to inspire new generations of extremists. Without ongoing monitoring and engagement, new, even more dangerous, entities may emerge in the region. JI’s dissolution is a critical moment in the fight against terrorism in Southeast Asia. But this apparent victory must not lull the region into complacency. Policymakers must continue to strengthen intelligence efforts, foster regional collaboration and build resilient communities capable of withstanding the ideological and operational threats that may yet arise in a post-JI era. The real test of JI’s dissolution will be whether Southeast Asia can prevent its remnants from reconstituting and whether former members can be successfully rehabilitated. If this is achieved, the dissolution of JI may indeed be remembered as a victory against terrorism. If not, it could become just another chapter in the ongoing struggle against violent extremism in the region. Noor Huda Ismail is Visiting Fellow at the S.

Why India is so concerned about Bangladesh’s political problems	Sheikh Hasina’s resignation as Bangladesh’s longest-serving prime minister and exile to India in the face of a revolutionary mass uprising against her has raised widespread speculation about the trajectory of Dhaka’s relations with New Delhi. Her rule was marked by warm relations with India, which included several critical strategic alignments that benefitted New Delhi’s security and geopolitical interests. The Bangladesh–India relationship will be under review by the new regime in Dhaka. The interim government led by Muhammad Yunus has pledged to hold free and fair elections. There is increasing concern in New Delhi that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which has historically been hostile towards India, may win a landslide. No political party has been as popular and robust as the BNP since the fall of the Awami League. This will raise concerns in New Delhi about the strategic stability of India’s North–eastern region, which shares a border with Bangladesh, and Dhaka’s new geopolitical calculus. India supported the liberation movement of Bangladesh against Pakistan in 1971 for their strategic interest, making Pakistan a weaker rival. Since then, Dhaka’s relations with New Delhi have varied according to the political parties in power. The Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina, and the BNP, led by Khaleda Zia, are two of the most significant political parties and arch-rivals. Hasina’s party had historically aligned with India, whereas the Khaleda-led BNP had been critical of New Delhi. The most recent Khaleda-led BNP tenure, from 2001–06, had been marked by the rise of Islamic militancy and the safe housing of insurgents from India’s North–eastern region. Terrorist outfits hostile to India started operating, maintaining connections with various BNP leaders like Tarek Zia and Lutfozzaman Babar. Scandals, like the incident of 10 trucks of arms being shipped through Bangladesh to insurgents in the North–east, also took place under the direction of top officials of the BNP regime in 2004. All these issues spiralled into an unofficial political consensus in New Delhi that a pro-India regime in Dhaka is vital to their national and strategic interests. Hasina’s victory in the 2009 national polls was a geopolitical win for India and the relationship between Dhaka and New Delhi has since deepened significantly during the 15 years of the Hasina regime. The relationship can be defined as Bangladesh’s tilt towards India, where Bangladesh has granted India several strategic benefits. India has significantly developed subregional connectivity with its Seven Sisters through land transit, rail connectivity and transhipment within Bangladesh, which was allowed by the Hasina regime. North–eastern region-based insurgents were also expelled and handed over to India through extradition treaties. New Delhi was also awarded two special economic zones and priority in the Teesta Project. These ensured India access to its North–eastern region in case of a conflict with China, where the latter might cut off the former by occupying the Siliguri Corridor or aiding regional insurgents. Hasina also diminished terrorist outfits like ISIS offshoot Neo-JMB and Al–Qaeda offshoot Ansar Al Islam. Law enforcement and the judiciary crushed anti-India political parties like Hefazat-e-Islam and Jamaat Islami. Such measures prevented Bangladesh from becoming a terrorist hub and protected the Hindu minorities inside Bangladesh from being targeted by extremists. New Delhi also successfully established defence cooperation with Dhaka by providing military hardware through loans and interactions like exercises, seminars and dialogues. Through defence diplomacy, New Delhi also tried to assuage the long-term scepticism of Bangladesh’s Armed Forces, one of the largest buyers of Chinese defence equipment. It is easy to see why India is concerned about the current situation in Bangladesh. The people’s uprising demonstrated the mass frustration against Hasina and her party and the chances of&nbsp; the Awami League returning to power is slim. New Delhi is concerned about the BNP and other Islamist parties winning the new elections, which will harm their geopolitical interests and influence. India’s support and shelter for Hasina could be used by the BNP to garner popular anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh. They have previously used anti-India rhetoric as a political tool and have already started putting pressure on New Delhi by demanding that the former premier be extradited. BNP activists were harassed, tortured and murdered with impunity for years while India turned a blind eye and supported unfair elections by the Hasina regime. This uneasy relationship between the BNP and New Delhi has also built an environment of mistrust and resentment towards the latter by the former. These political realities may be headed toward severely disadvantaging India’s strategic interests and geopolitical realities concerning Bangladesh.

US–China AI competition at the crossroads between dialogue and decoupling	The United States and China are competing fiercely in the race to develop artificial intelligence (AI). While Beijing is working to lead the world by 2030, Washington’s approach and US–China competition hinge on the result of the 2024 US presidential election between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. China is pushing ahead with both its AI development and regulation. Despite discouraging&nbsp;headwinds from US chip sanctions&nbsp;and concerns that&nbsp;regulatory requirements may stifle innovation, the Chinese government has proved&nbsp;willing to bend its rules&nbsp;to promote development and social stability. China’s AI progress will likely continue. Though&nbsp;behind in many metrics, it&nbsp;holds the majority of global AI patents, and its large language models&nbsp;starting to top&nbsp;some international leaderboards. The US relies heavily on self-regulation and voluntary compliance to regulate the industry. The Biden administration’s AI governance approach has been light on legislation that impacts the private sector. But it has laid out detailed directions to federal agencies for best practices and developing guidelines, forwarding a community-centred and rights-based narrative. Washington’s flagship AI governance document — the October 2023 Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence — takes a whole-of-government approach towards AI development. It aims to promote AI use across the federal government, encourage innovation, protect civil rights and strengthen US leadership on the international stage. Though Harris may support more concrete AI regulation, any legislation would require overcoming a congressional gridlock. A future Harris administration would likely continue Biden’s relatively light-touch approach to restraining the AI industry. The only private sector requirements in Biden’s executive order require developers of frontier models and companies with large computing clusters to make reports to the federal government. But it has still faced criticism from some in Silicon Valley. While many AI startups and Big Tech companies alike approved of the AI executive order, the 2024 Republican Party platform has gained support from prominent figures who reject any attempt to regulate AI, including Marc Andreessen and Elon Musk. The platform pledges to repeal the ‘dangerous’ executive order in favour of ‘AI Development rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing’ and claims that Biden’s directive ‘hinders AI Innovation’ and ‘imposes radical leftwing ideas’ on its development. Trump allies have drafted a new executive order to ‘Make America First in AI’ through military technology moonshots and eliminating ‘unnecessary and burdensome regulations’. It isn’t clear what regulations Republicans consider ‘burdensome’. Many of the Biden administration’s measures are about information gathering to assess how the government can effectively use AI and evaluate what new standards and tools are necessary. A lack of information and standards would hinder the US government’s ability to deploy AI. Repealing Biden’s executive order would likely have minimal impact on the private sector as only companies developing the largest models are impacted and the reporting requirements are built on cybersecurity measures and testing that companies are already doing. Instead, its repeal would hinder efforts to promote civil rights, equity and non-discrimination in AI development. Republican policy would also ultimately complicate visa processes key to attracting foreign talent. This may serve another of Trump’s policy goals — decoupling with China. The Republican platform wants to secure strategic independence from China, possibly through massive tariffs. The ‘Project 2025’ initiative linked to the Trump administration wants to end economic engagement with China. This would harm both countries’ semiconductor industries, talent engagement and the overall relationship. US companies selling less advanced chips and those doing final chip processing in China would be hit, as would Chinese companies making more basic ‘legacy chips’ for export, but the relative impact on each economy is unclear. Impeding Chinese AI talent moving to the United States would be a massive own goal, as Chinese-born researchers make up 38 per cent of top US AI researchers. Keeping China’s superior talent pool out of the United States would hobble US innovation while fuelling China’s development of AI. Dialogue, not decoupling, is crucial to avoid stoking tensions that could lead to broader conflict. While Democratic policy has not been friendly to China, it has shown commitment to common-sense measures that benefit the United States and its relationship with China. The future of AI development and US–China competition depends on the outcome of the November election. China has a long-term plan to secure AI dominance that — barring unexpected economic or political turmoil — it will continue to execute. The United States’ rhetoric and policy on AI have changed with the priorities of each new administration since the Obama presidency. A Harris victory would see changes commensurate with a new administration but would likely continue to encourage responsible AI development while preserving civil rights. A Trump victory would likely promote full-throttle innovation but repealing Biden’s executive order would harm the government’s use of AI. Republican opposition to engagement with China would also hamstring the US semiconductor industry, international supply chains and the country’s talent pool while increasing the risk of escalated conflict that would cause irreparable harm far beyond AI development. While some vocal venture capitalists and Silicon Valley elites may laud a second Trump term, it would be a Pyrrhic victory that damages the very industry they claim to promote.

Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah lays down arms	On 30 June 2024, Abu Rusydan, a senior member of the Indonesian terrorist organisation Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), announced in a video that the organisation was ready to disband. The announcement stated that JI intended to ‘return to the Republic of Indonesia’, abide by all its laws and remove tatharuf (extremism) from its madrassas (religious schools). The announcement was followed by several concrete actions. These included JI handing over its cache of weapons and explosives, providing the names of its military wing members and meeting with the government’s Ministry of Religion to revise JI-affiliated schools’ curriculums. The decision to disband is likely based on both a genuine shift in JI’s interpretation of jihad and a pragmatic assessment of how to best salvage what remains of the organisation. JI has been shifting its strategic preference to prioritise dakwah (proselytisation) over violence. Since Para Wijayanto became Amir (leader) in 2009, the use of violence has been forbidden. In 2016, JI further moved away from violence by issuing a fatwa supporting the idea of peaceful demonstrations as ‘jihad through words’. In 2018, JI’s deputy Amir even allowed some members to participate in elections. This shift away from violence was accompanied by JI’s reassessment of the viability of tanzim sirri (covert organisations) in achieving its goals. Indeed, as early as 2010, some JI scholars had noted that ‘if establishing an Islamic state were the goal, above-ground organisations like the Islamic Defenders Front had made more progress than JI’. JI has since operated several legal entities, such as the Abdurrahman bin Auf foundation for fundraising, the Majelis Umat Dakwah Indonesia for dakwah activities and the PERISAI legal-advocacy group for counter-intelligence operations. But JI’s decision to disband is also driven by pragmatic reasons. JI has been the main focus of Indonesia’s counter-terrorism operations in the past five years. While JI members only accounted for 8 per cent of arrested terrorist suspects in 2019, they represented 59 per cent of arrested terrorist suspects in 2023. This increase in arrests has resulted in significant losses in JI’s central leadership and has forced the organisation to disband several of its key divisions, such as the ADIRA, JI’s recruit vetting and training division. Despite adapting its structure and programs to minimise further arrests and sustain essential operations, JI leaders perceived these efforts to be insufficient. According to a 2024 report, JI leaders recognised by 2022 that their existing operational framework needed reform. Without these changes, counter-terrorism efforts would eventually seize JI’s affiliated schools, preachers and assets, debilitating their ability to conduct JI’s main strategic priority — dakwah. It was only after this realisation that JI leadership began engaging with the police to discuss the organisation’s dissolution. While JI’s senior members’ decision to disband is noteworthy, its significance will depend on whether the organisation’s members and other active senior members will acquiesce. Most JI members, especially those recruited throughout Para Wijayanto’s leadership, are likely to accept the announcement. Unlike members that helped Noordin Top’s splinter in 2004, these recruits underwent JI’s newly standardised disciplinary programs, which trained them to obey JI leadership. They also lack the organisational authority and religious credentials to oppose the decision — especially given that the announcement was endorsed by many respected JI figures. But there remains a risk of some dissenting JI senior members splintering. JI senior members are not a monolithic group. During a 2019 re-strategising meeting held by JI’s Tim Lajnah, a member of the ad hoc caretaker council, JI senior members disagreed about whether the organisation should fully halt its use of violence. Some argued that military training hampered JI’s peaceful dakwah initiatives by associating them with violence. But there were others who were adamant that JI should maintain its military capacity because ‘Islam was spread in Indonesia through both peaceful proselytisation and open conflict’. There have been several cases in the past decade where JI senior members successfully developed factions that operated outside of standard operating procedure. In 2013, JI senior member Ustadz Fahim formed an Iqomatuddin faction that recruited members ‘quickly and instantly’ — contrary to JI’s two-year, multi-stage recruitment process. In 2019, JI senior member Imaruddin also led a faction of his own and planned several attacks targeting Chinese-Indonesian owned stores in Banten, West Java and East Java — violating JI’s ban on members’ use of violence. That said, it is important to temper fears. If a JI splinter forms, it will take time. Following the June 2024 announcement, JI senior members went to visit several of its geographical strongholds to explain their decision, facing little resistance from members. In West Java and Banten, over 200 JI members pledged allegiance to Indonesia, including notable senior members such as the Head of JI’s Fatwa Council Ustadz Imtihan Syafi’i. If a splinter were to form, it would also suffer from a lack of organisational resources, as it would not be privy to most of JI’s funds, training centres and skilled members. While this would not limit potential splinter groups’ intent to enact JI’s original strategic visions, it will limit their ability to do so — at least for now.

China’s network connection issues in global AI governance	The World Artificial Intelligence Conference, held in Shanghai in early July 2024, served as an important platform for advancing global AI governance. The ‘Shanghai Declaration on Global AI Governance’, issued at the conference, was developed to extend and implement the principles outlined in China’s ‘Global AI Governance Initiative’. The Declaration emphasises the safety and ethics of AI, proposing concrete strategies for multilateral and multi-stakeholder cooperation. These two documents outline the overarching framework for AI governance. China’s two additional position papers — on ‘Strengthening Ethical Governance of Artificial Intelligence’ and ‘Regulating Military Applications of Artificial Intelligence’ — focus on more specific areas of AI governance such as autonomous weapons. These documents provide a coherent account of China’s approach to AI governance, integrating broad governance principles with targeted policies in key areas. China’s stance is largely consistent with other international initiatives, such as the Bletchley Declaration, particularly in their shared focus on promoting international cooperation. But China’s initiatives also have unique focuses, emphasising opposition to ideological divisions and respect for each country’s development path and technological rights. In the realm of global AI governance, China aspires to the complementary roles of a rule developer and solution provider. As a rule developer, China actively participates in various AI governance processes led by the United Nations. In July 2024, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to enhance international cooperation on AI capacity building proposed by China. Chinese experts are also actively involved in the United Nations’ High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, contributing to documents such as ‘Governing AI for Humanity’. China actively contributes to developing AI-related standards through international bodies, such as the International Organization for Standardization. As a solution provider, China aims to propose global governance solutions with Chinese characteristics. These solutions include establishing a risk-level testing and evaluation system, implementing agile governance, and tiered and category-based management for a rapid and effective response. Documents such as the ‘Global AI Governance Initiative’ provide specific technical standards and operational norms while highlighting the positive role of AI in social welfare, economic development and environmental protection. But in practice, China faces challenges in developing rules and implementing solutions. While China can quickly follow the forefront of innovation and achieve scale, its AI sector lacks breakthrough creativity. It is constrained by the financial structure and business models of its tech enterprises. In breakthrough innovation areas such as large language models, China’s foundational breakthroughs lagged behind the United States’ by approximately 10 months. This deficiency in innovative capacity prevents China from reaching the transformative frontiers of AI innovation — reflected in China’s relatively smaller output of breakthrough AI papers. Despite China’s solid industrial strength in AI, it has not yet fully developed the ability to lead technological transformation and grasp the latest advances in AI technology. China’s international cooperation also lacks depth and strategic alignment. China has established numerous collaborations, such as cooperating with European countries on autonomous driving technology and serving as Australia’s leading AI research partner. Yet these collaborations are focused on technical research and product application. China has long lagged behind in international mechanism-building and lacks integrated technological alliances and rule-making communities such as NATO and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Though China has proposed effective solutions, its early implementation faces challenges due to a lack of platforms and ideological biases. Despite these challenges, China has made significant achievements in AI governance, particularly by proposing ways to address global AI governance fragmentation. China’s macro-guidance approach to domestic governance issues also applies to global AI governance. In the current AI governance landscape — where resource, rule and industrial competition are pervasive — advancing the governance process requires leveraging the roles of authoritative institutions and platforms. China believes that the United Nations’ global representativeness, multilateral coordination and cooperation mechanisms enable it to address global AI governance’s fragmentation. On such an internationally authoritative platform, governance frameworks can be established through principles and initiatives, allowing various national governance practices and agenda-setting to be integrated. China supports the establishment of a global AI cooperation network within the United Nations to promote cooperation among countries in data sharing, technology exchange and standard setting. China’s AI governance documents, such as the ‘Shanghai Declaration’ do not limit AI governance cooperation to ‘membership’ or restrict the main lines of AI governance based on its own interests. Instead, it encourages broad international participation and collaboration. This inclusivity means that, while China contributes solutions, it also seeks to collaborate with different countries and stakeholders. This mitigates the risk of governance fragmentation and promotes a more cohesive global approach. China’s active participation in global AI governance demonstrates its responsibility as a major power and brings wisdom and solutions with Chinese characteristics to global governance. China will continue to strengthen cooperation with the international community, promote the healthy development of AI technology and strive to build a more inclusive and sustainable global AI governance system. In this process, China will adhere to the principles of inclusiveness, cooperation and mutual benefit, and work with all countries to contribute to the common good of human society.

Camel wool can weave economic resilience in Mongolia	Since the early 1990s, Mongolia has transitioned from a Soviet-style planned economy to one embracing market forces and global economic cooperation. This shift has led to rapid growth, earning Mongolia the ‘wolf economy’ moniker, with the country’s vast natural resources driving export revenue and industrialisation. But this strategy is not foolproof as commodity price fluctuations naturally generate&nbsp;economic volatility.&nbsp; To minimise volatility, analysts recommend diversifying Mongolia’s&nbsp;natural resource-dependent economy. One promising avenue is to develop niche products and services with&nbsp;unique regional&nbsp;characteristics&nbsp;such as camel wool. The Mongolian government and international donors have devoted&nbsp;considerable&nbsp;effort&nbsp;in promoting these sectors to modernise and revitalise the country’s vast rural terrains. Despite comprising a&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;small share&nbsp;of the country’s total exports, camel wool presents an appealing case for diversifying Mongolia’s exports and enhancing economic resilience. The rise of fashion brands prioritising&nbsp;eco-friendly practices&nbsp;and ethical production standards highlights the commodity’s potential, with&nbsp;surveys indicating&nbsp;that camel wool has become a popular raw material for apparel manufacturers in coastal China. Camel wool offers a more sustainable alternative to cashmere, which is derived from goats. Goats tend to graze heavily on plants, leading to soil degradation and desertification, especially in Mongolia’s water-scarce steppes and deserts. Camels primarily feed on shrubs and hardy plants avoided by other livestock, which helps preserve the ecosystem. But the outcome of developing a robust camel wool production network has been uneven at best. Research identifies several obstacles hindering camel wool’s effective integration into global markets and the socioeconomic advancement needed to capture additional value. One major issue is the limited linkages between camel herders with processors and manufacturers, with traders and middlemen arbitrating information flows. This situation impedes the exchange of knowledge and resources critical to spurring positive externalities. International donors have sought to break this deadlock by organising matchmaking events for herder cooperatives and manufacturers. But bridging information asymmetry remains difficult because these networks are not simply about economic transactions. Many of these&nbsp;traders&nbsp;and&nbsp;middlemen&nbsp;enjoy decades-long relationships with herders and often share familial ties.&nbsp;Flexible financial arrangements&nbsp;are offered to camel herders within these privileged networks, indirectly hampering the prospects of less connected herders.&nbsp; The governance structure of the camel wool industry is also lacking. For example, some entrepreneurial minded herders have explored the potential of grooming and marketing baby camel wool. When combed rather than sheared, camel wool fibres can be as fine as cashmere. But such technical and marketing information has largely been disseminated by international donors, with limited coordination with relevant authorities. As a result, few herders have established a significant market presence in this highly niche and profitable product category.&nbsp; Processing efforts have also been hindered by logistical constraints. Although not considered technology intensive by contemporary standards, wool processing still requires functional processing facilities and public infrastructure. Mongolia’s vast terrain and sparse population add difficulty to establishing and maintaining factories — a challenge compounded by the erosion of&nbsp;previously state-owned infrastructure&nbsp;following post-1990s market reforms — leading to inconsistencies in processed wool quality. To hedge this risk, businesses prefer to directly export most washed and dehaired wool as semi-finished products. Almost all washed wool&nbsp;goes to China, while dehaired wool is further processed and sent to other markets.&nbsp; Demographic factors worsen this issue. Employing workers outside the main urban hubs has been challenging due to&nbsp;Mongolia’s urbanisation drive. In 2020, a total of 31.3 per cent of the population resided in rural areas, a reduction of more than 10 per cent from 2000. Although migration from rural to urban areas was banned between 2017 and 2020, this only prevented&nbsp;official residency&nbsp;registration, not the actual flow of people into cities. The younger generation generally prefer a more settled urban lifestyle with better job opportunities, living conditions and education. Development through value chain integration is a highly context-dependent and place-specific process. Business firms naturally play a key part, but meaningful and far-reaching economic upgrading is unlikely without a conducive institutional milieu. Despite the adage that ‘geography is not destiny’, it would be naive to ignore locational factors when devising development programs. At the very least, a deeper understanding of these issues can prevent the misallocation of financial and technical resources in chasing unproductive leads.&nbsp; Another policy implication concerns the role of agriculture. Agrofood products are crucial for early-stage industrialisation in developing economies, leveraging existing comparative advantage. Agrofood also acts as a catalyst for related economic activities, such as logistics services. The premium on properly processed camel wool also highlights businesses’ growing concern about their role in mitigating&nbsp;climate change. Environmental sustainability is no longer a choice but a necessity to maintain a competitive edge in the global economy.&nbsp; Linda Tjia is Associate Professor at the&nbsp;Department of Public and International Affairs, City University of Hong Kong.

Historical memories haunt South Korea–Japan relations	The rejuvenated relationship between South Korea and Japan, crucial for trilateral US–South Korea–Japan&nbsp;security cooperation, rests upon a wobbly foundation of contentious historical grievances. Despite attempts to address these issues, which trace back to Japanese colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula in the early twentieth century, Japan’s lack of reciprocity and domestic discontent with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol’s approach to Japan complicate progress. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has tried to establish ‘future-oriented’&nbsp;relations with Japan through a&nbsp;magnanimous approach&nbsp;to historical issues. South Korea–Japan relations were at a low point when Yoon was inaugurated, having sharply deteriorated after the South Korean Supreme Court ordered Japanese companies to compensate forced labourers in 2018. In response, Japan removed South Korea from its export whitelist in 2019. To resolve the issue, the Yoon administration created a&nbsp;foundation in early 2023&nbsp;to compensate former forced labourers. This foundation was to be funded by Japanese companies that profited from forced labour and South Korean companies that profited from funds provided by Japan when relations were normalised in 1965. This agreement ushered in the current moment of trilateral cooperation. As emphasised in the&nbsp;Spirit of Camp David&nbsp;document and by&nbsp;Yoon himself, this agreement was a necessary precondition for strengthening trilateral US–South Korea–Japan cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. But the foundation is&nbsp;not panning out as planned. While South Korean companies contributed immediately, Japanese contributions&nbsp;only began in May 2024. Even worse, the Japanese companies that benefitted from forced labour were&nbsp;not among the contributors. Similarly, in July 2024, South Korea and Japan&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;to designate the Sado gold mine as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Initially it was reported that the site would house an exhibit about the plight of Korean forced labourers and hold an annual memorial ceremony in their honour. But soon after the deal was announced, the South Korean media was quick to note that the exhibition installed to satisfy Korean concerns&nbsp;did not actually use&nbsp;the word ‘forced’ to describe Korean labourers. To make matters worse, the South Korean government had requested that Japan use the word ‘forced’ in the exhibition, but the Japanese government&nbsp;refused. For many in South Korea this is another example of concessions by Yoon without reciprocation from Japan. Historical disputes persist across South Korea–Japan relations. In March 2024, the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Japanese diplomats to receive complaints about revisions to Japanese middle school&nbsp;textbooks&nbsp;that it views as historical distortions. In April 2024, Japanese officials received another demarche about renewed&nbsp;Japanese claims&nbsp;to the disputed Dokdo (Takeshima) islets. Outside South Korea, attention is focused on positive trilateral developments, such as the release of a Joint Leaders’ Statement to commemorate the anniversary of the Camp David Summit. In July 2024, the defence ministers of the three countries signed an agreement to institutionalise security cooperation and the three countries held the first ‘Freedom Edge’ multi-domain exercise in June 2024. But for South Koreans, these developments only seem possible because the Yoon administration has muted domestic displeasure. If South Korean anger over Japan’s lack of reciprocity was fully voiced, it is doubtful whether progress in trilateral cooperation would be so brisk. This raises concerns about the future of trilateral cooperation under a progressive South Korean president. The opposition has consistently criticised the Yoon administration’s Japan policy, dubbing it ‘humiliating diplomacy’. Democratic Party Representative Lee Jae-myung, a likely&nbsp;candidate&nbsp;in the 2027 presidential election,&nbsp;lambasted&nbsp;Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, questioning whether the Sado mine decision benefited the pride or interests of the Korean people. Given the trajectory of South Korea–Japan interactions on historical issues and the opposition’s response, it is hard to imagine Lee upholding the current level of bilateral and trilateral cooperation if elected. Criticism of the Yoon administration’s Japan policy has dovetailed with backlash against appointments made by Yoon to history-related government posts. Academics associated with South Korea’s ‘New Right’&nbsp;movement, which argues there were positive outcomes of Japanese colonialism, have been selected to lead key historical institutions. These include the National Institute of Korean History, the Academy of Korean Studies and the Independence Hall of Korea. This has intensified historical disputes within South Korea and a future progressive president will undoubtedly seek to reverse these changes. Recent polling&nbsp;indicates that there is strong South Korean support for strengthening trilateral security cooperation in light of the North Korean nuclear threat. But while Japanese citizens&nbsp;identify&nbsp;North Korea, China and Russia as the top three national security threats, South Koreans identify the top three threats as North Korea, China and Japan. In other words, while most see&nbsp;trilateral security&nbsp;as helpful, many South Koreans do not fully trust Japan and historical issues only further antagonise them. While South Korea must address its own domestic battles over history, Japan could go a long way in selling trilateral cooperation by demonstrating that it is not a threat. The best way to do this is for Japan to confront its colonial past and honour agreements on historical issues, reflecting their professed shared values.

A tale of two futures for Taiwan	‘It was the worst of times, it was the best of times’ might be an appropriate phrase to describe the situation facing Taiwan’s new President, Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). So far, his term has been a mixed bag of challenges and achievements. Taiwan is at a critical juncture, especially on the issue of China, and Lai&#8217;s pro-independence stance is likely to test Beijing’s red lines. On the domestic front, Lai faces significant challenges. Despite winning the presidential election, he secured only 40 per cent of the vote in a three way race. In the Legislative Yuan, the DPP won 51 seats, while the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Taiwan People&#8217;s Party (TPP) won 52 and 8 seats respectively. This double minority situation — lacking both a popular majority and a legislative majority — initially suggested Lai might struggle to implement his agenda. But after a month in office, he appears to have successfully turned this crisis into an opportunity. Before Lai officially assumed office, serious conflicts erupted in the Legislative Yuan. The opposition KMT and TPP proposed parliamentary reform bills that the DPP opposed, leading to physical confrontations. The DPP accused the opposition parties of forcibly passing the bill in violation of parliamentary procedures. The KMT and TPP argued that parliamentary reform had been a long-standing DPP demand when it was in opposition. But critics argued that the bills, which would expand parliament&#8217;s investigative powers, were hastily passed without adequate safeguards, such as thorough committee deliberations, clearer definitions of key terms and careful consideration of separation of powers issues. Some legal scholars even argued that parts of the bills may be unconstitutional. Protesters expressed concerns that it could undermine democracy and national security, leading to large-scale street demonstrations. Finally, the Executive Yuan formally requested that the Constitutional Court review and interpret the legislation to determine its constitutionality. The Constitutional Court has temporarily halted the enforcement of the highly contested parliamentary reform bills enacted in May 2024. The Court concluded its oral arguments on 6 August and will issue a final ruling within the next three months. Despite the bill being passed, the DPP may have gained more in other ways. Prior to the Legislative Yuan and presidential elections, voters had seemingly lost confidence in the DPP, as evidenced by the results of the legislative elections. But the controversy surrounding the parliamentary reform bill led to accusations that the KMT and TPP were aligned with China. The TPP, which voters had initially viewed as a potential agent of change, was subsequently labelled as a mere appendage of the KMT. On the other hand, polls showed that the DPP and Lai’s popularity increased. The presidential inaugural address on 20 May 2024 served as a crucial platform for the new president to redefine cross-strait relations. In his speech, Lai stated that according to the Constitution of the Republic of China (ROC), the sovereignty of the ROC belongs to all its citizens and those who possess the nationality of the ROC are its citizens. From this, it is evident that ROC ‘and the People&#8217;s Republic of China are not subordinate to each other’. This statement drew criticism as a ‘new two-state theory’. During his address, Taiwan’s stock market dipped and China responded by launching military exercises targeting Taiwan. But Taiwanese people have grown accustomed to China’s military drills, and with limited domestic media coverage, daily life in Taiwan continued as usual. Polls indicated that over half of the respondents were satisfied with Lai’s inaugural speech. What truly excited the Taiwanese public was the artificial intelligence fever sparked by Nvida CEO Jensen Huang&#8217;s visit to Computex 2024 in Taipei. Taiwan, producing more than half of the world’s semiconductors, has become a vital link in the artificial intelligence supply chain. But while Taiwan’s economic prospects seem promising, the island faces numerous challenges. Chief among these is an energy shortage. Industrial development demands a stable power supply, but Taiwan experienced multiple power outages even before the summer peak in electricity usage. Though Lai has established three committees, including one addressing climate change, it remains to be seen whether these efforts can resolve Taiwan’s energy crisis. While Lai’s double minority situation might suggest a weak presidency, his past actions indicate otherwise. During his tenure as mayor of Tainan, he boycotted city council inquiries for 234 days due to a dispute over the speaker election. In 2014, while speaking in Shanghai, he declared himself a ‘pragmatic worker for Taiwan’s independence’ without hesitation. These incidents illustrate Lai’s unwavering determination and suggest that he is unlikely to be easily swayed from his convictions. Lai stands out as a unique figure in Taiwan’s political landscape. His party broke the trend of no single party ruling for more than two consecutive terms and he may still dramatically alter the legislative balance through constitutional ruling and legislator recalls. Lai Ching-te, who rose from being the son of a miner to becoming a doctor and now the President, is undoubtedly a person of strong determination. Many find his determination to safeguard Taiwan&#8217;s democracy unquestionable. But he is also a cautious and politically experienced individual who understands the importance of engaging in dialogue and building consensus. Lai must recognise that democracy fundamentally serves the people and a majority of Taiwanese desire to maintain the status quo. Lai’s priorities should be to end internal political strife, unify the nation and lay the groundwork for Taiwan’s future development. The path Taiwan takes — towards prosperity or decline — now rests squarely on President Lai’s shoulders.

Modi must make moves to turn around India’s economy	One of the biggest electoral upsets in 2024 took place in the world’s largest democracy, India. Incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost its parliamentary majority, despite India’s record economic growth under Modi’s decade-long premiership, with the country set to become the world’s fastest-growing major economy. India’s unemployment rate stood at 8 per cent in 2023, double the regional average, with young people bearing the brunt. The opposition capitalised on this, denouncing the BJP’s record of ‘jobless growth’. Now governing through a fragile coalition, Modi has finally acknowledged the unemployment crisis that his administration downplayed. The federal budget released in July 2024 earmarked over US$24 billion for job creation through programs like the Employment Linked Incentive, which provides allowances to graduates and handouts for companies to artificially create jobs. This approach may offer short-term relief but fails to address structural issues of India’s labour market — namely, the lack of labour-intensive industries such as manufacturing. India’s service sector, often proposed as a ‘shortcut’ that would allow the country to bypass the industrialisation phase seen in other emerging markets, ultimately proves to be more capital-intensive than labour-intensive. This mismatch is particularly evident in business services, which contribute 7 per cent to the national GDP and account for a quarter of India’s total exports, yet employ less than 1 per cent of the labour force. The sector also faces elevated risks of technological displacement from artificial intelligence, with 75,000 employees from India&#8217;s seven largest information technology firms being laid off in 2023. Meanwhile, agriculture, which accounts for nearly half of India’s labour force, is threatened by climate change. Rising temperatures and changing monsoon patterns threaten farm productivity, with projections suggesting India could lose up to 34 million jobs by 2030. Given these challenges, manufacturing represents India’s best bet for mass employment. But manufacturing output by the world’s most populous country, which stood at US$450 billion in 2023, is only a fifth of China’s, a third of Japan’s and half of Germany’s. In 2023, India’s FDI reached its lowest level in almost two decades, but the government still maintains foreign direct investment caps and regulatory barriers in nearly 40 so-called ‘sensitive’ sectors. To attract foreign capital, Modi must turn the page on economic reforms, even if it means navigating uneasy coalition politics and resisting the siren song of protectionism within his own party. This will require political dexterity to sideline ideological hardliners like the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, who played key roles in sacking Modi’s top economic reformers and opposing free trade agreements, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Retreating into protectionism will jeopardise jobs. The Indian market alone cannot sustain growth, as heavy debts weigh down domestic demand. Export orientation, rather than import substitution, is key to achieving economies of scale, particularly in labour-intensive sectors. Modi&#8217;s Atmanirbhar doctrine of ‘self-reliance’ has often been cited to support inward-looking views, despite his own clarification that it means producing for both domestic and foreign markets — not just reducing imports. Nevertheless, since the BJP came to power, India’s average import duty rate has risen by nearly 5 per cent. Modi must demonstrate a genuine commitment to economic openness. But simply remaining in power is already a challenge, let alone pursuing reforms — his recent budget had to appease states ruled by coalition partners with near-blank check federal aid, which risks alienating the rest of the country. Historically, states ruled by junior partners have been the most successful in attracting FDI. Modi’s third term could find support from regional partners like Andhra Pradesh’s pro-business Telugu Desam Party. With targeted spending on infrastructure and investment promotion for these states, Modi could build a robust coalition for reforms that go beyond buying support with handouts. India’s ranking in the World Bank&#8217;s Ease of Doing Business index jumped from 132 in 2014 to 63 in 2022. But the gap between policy and implementation remains wide, and alleged harassment of foreign companies continues to frustrate investors. To unlock India’s potential as a regional manufacturing hub, Modi must go all-in on reforms. This requires streamlining India’s overburdened legal and regulatory environment, addressing issues like judicial backlogs and complicated land acquisition processes. Modi also needs to undertake capital-market reforms to create more infrastructure financing instruments for foreign investors, which would help India sustain its much-needed infrastructure drive amidst fiscal constraints. These reforms would allow Modi to better capitalise on India’s strategic position and international standing to attract a wave of diversifying global capital seeking alternatives to China. New Delhi has not been able to do so effectively, partly due to its ‘opaque and unpredictable’ bureaucracy and trade policy which had strained relations with Western governments and businesses alike. The Biden-Harris administration touted India as an ‘indispensable partner’ in its friend-shoring strategy, while a second Donald Trump term could lead to another trade war with China, which India failed to capitalise on last time. New Delhi risks missing out on these opportunities if it does not shed its protectionist baggage and commit to deep-seated reforms. Meanwhile, players like Taiwan are seeking to establish a semiconductor manufacturing hub in India as an alternative to both China and its own vulnerable home base. Ironically, Modi’s reduced mandate has enhanced India’s democratic image and set it apart from other authoritarian regimes in the region as global businesses seek to diversify their supply chains. The pieces are in place for the world’s largest democracy to emerge as the world’s next factory. It will require Modi to turn the page on reforms and translate India’s growing economy and global stature into the jobs Indians want.

Why India must dig in its heels on global tax deal	On the sidelines of the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in May 2024, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen&nbsp;chided India&nbsp;for ‘stalling’ a historic, multilateral deal shepherded by the OECD to address the international tax challenges posed by the&nbsp;digital economy. The tax deal aims to reallocate the taxable income of multinational firms to market or source jurisdictions. The current form of the&nbsp;OECD’s proposal&nbsp;has faced objections from developing nations, including India, who feel that their rights and interests are not sufficiently protected and that there are alternate ways to address the problem. The current principles of international tax law were drafted in the 1920s and were designed by capital-rich nations to protect their taxing rights and economic interests. Today, they restrict India’s right to tax business profits of a foreign company unless the business is carried out through a ‘permanent establishment’. Tax treaties define ‘permanent establishment’ to include a physical presence, through offices or employees, or a representative presence. But this stipulation does not account for today’s highly digitalised economy that relies on hard-to-value intangible assets, data and automation. When the OECD embarked upon an ambitious project to revamp international tax rules in 2013, the issue of digital economy taxation was high on its agenda. But the OECD&nbsp;failed to reach a consensus&nbsp;on tax rights in the digitised economy because ‘it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ring-fence the digital economy from the rest of the economy for tax purposes’. India was left with three options in the absence of a multilateral solution. The first was to amend existing tax treaties to provide for a digital presence. But this was a hard sell for the United States and other treaty partners, especially when the OECD — the world’s de facto international tax organisation — was deliberating upon it. India could also amend its domestic tax law to provide for a digital presence, which it did. But in the absence of corresponding changes to tax treaties, a change in domestic tax law is at best symbolic. Under international tax law, India is obliged to honour treaty obligations in good faith and domestic tax rules cannot override tax treaty provisions. The third solution was to wait for a multilateral fix. India got the ball rolling in 2016 with a levy on advertisement-related receipts earned by foreign digital companies. The levy was expanded in 2020 to cover e-commerce transactions. The OECD’s slow progress led several countries to adopt interim domestic measures. US regulators threatened countries adopting such measures with retaliatory sanctions, which could be counter-productive in many ways. Research&nbsp;suggests&nbsp;that the&nbsp;total impact&nbsp;of imposed and announced tariffs would reduce long-run&nbsp;GDP in the United States&nbsp;by 0.5 per cent, which means lower wages and fewer jobs. Some of the world’s largest digital businesses are US-based and their profits are primarily taxed in the United States. Any reshuffling of taxing rights may mean less revenue for the US government. To allay concerns that tax measures discriminate against US firms and contravene international tax law, the OECD has worked to finalise a Multilateral Convention to Implement Amount A of Pillar One (MLC), setting out key rules to govern the issue. The OECD initially committed to table the MLC for signature by the end of June 2024. That deadline has passed and the prospects of an OECD-led solution continue to hang in the balance. India is one of the largest market jurisdictions for US digital businesses and Washington will not sign the MLC if Delhi backs out. International tax treaties require a two-thirds majority in the US Senate for ratification, but US President Joe Biden and the Democrats may struggle to reach that threshold. Ratification is necessary to meet the required minimum tax base under the MLC to bring it into effect. There is no data-based assessment yet on whether India would be better off under the proposed MLC when compared to the digital levy that is already in force. One&nbsp;study finds&nbsp;that developed and high-income countries would gain more revenues under the proposal than developing and low-income countries. This is vital because, under the MLC, not only would India have to withdraw its levy, but it also could not introduce new levies in the future. This severely restricts India’s sovereign power to legislate on tax law and policy and runs against the canon of equity in tax matters. While unilateral measures are antithetical to fairness and certainty in the international tax law framework, any solution must be consensus-based and reflect India’s rights and interests.&nbsp; The United Nations General Assembly is currently working on a new tax convention to improve governance over the digital economy. The United Nations is perceived as more equitable for non-developed nations and is better placed to lead the reform process, unlike the OECD’s club of developed, capital-exporting nations. Until that happens, India should dig in its heels against the United States.

China’s ambitions for global AI governance	In July 2024, Shanghai hosted its annual World AI Conference, bringing together leading experts, businesses and governments to showcase cutting-edge technologies, explore future AI trends and promote global cooperation. For the first time, the 2024 conference foregrounded questions of global AI governance, with Shanghai’s government using the opening ceremony to issue the Shanghai Declaration on Global AI Governance. The Shanghai Declaration is a short document that lacks detail beyond a high-level emphasis on maintaining AI safety and promoting inclusive global cooperation. When read in isolation, it carries little significance. But the document should be understood in the context of a wider push by the Chinese government to outline and begin implementing a vision for global AI governance. This effort was initiated in October 2023, when Chinese President Xi Jinping used his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to put forward China’s vision — theGlobal AI Governance Initiative.The document stresses that AI should be developed for the good of humanity, while upholding principles of mutual respect and equality. Shortly after, China proposed a resolution on enhancing international cooperation and capacity building for AI, which was unanimously adopted by the 78th session of the UN General Assembly. Like the Shanghai Declaration, the Global AI Governance Initiative and the UN resolution are vague, but common themes can be identified across these documents. Notably, China advocates for a UN-centred approach to AI governance and positions itself as a champion of the Global South by emphasising the importance of technology transfer and inclusive governance. Given China’s aim to become the world’s primary AI innovation centre by 2030, its leading AI research, the maturity of its domestic AI governance initiatives and its efforts to become an international ‘norm maker’ in other policy areas, it is unsurprising that several commentators frame recent global AI governance initiatives as stemming from a position of strength. From this perspective, China is a leading AI power that is proactively trying to shape the emerging governance landscape in line with its political ideology. This argument has some truth. China is a world leading AI developer, exporter and regulator, which undoubtedly places it in an internationally influential position. But a closer examination of the wider context reveals key political and technological weaknesses at the heart of China’s recent efforts to play a more assertive role in global AI governance. First, over the past five years, numerous international and intergovernmental organisations like UNESCO, the OECD and the G7 have published AI governance principles and guidance documents. Most initiatives were pioneered by Western states, at times with the specific intention to exclude China. Because of this, China has played a largely marginal role in global AI governance, with some Chinese commentators arguing that many existing initiatives are an effort by the West to pre-emptively dictate suitable values for governing AI. Second, the release of ChatGPT and other large language models in late 2022 and early 2023 caught policymakers, including those from China, off guard. This led to heightened concerns over the threat these new technologies pose to political stability, with China immediately banning ChatGPT and implementing a strict approvals process for domestic AI companies looking to release public-facing large language models. Third, ChatGPT’s release shifted discussions about global AI governance from a relatively fringe conversation to a policy priority for global leaders, with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres establishing the UN’s High Level Body on AI and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak convening an AI Safety Summit. Combined, these factors meant that by early 2023 Chinese policymakers were increasingly concerned about the potential dangers of cutting-edge AI systems, while also facing the risk of being further sidelined in rapidly advancing global AI discussions. Accordingly, China’s recent efforts to establish and promote a vision for global AI governance should be understood as a reactionary response to technological and political developments, rather than simply being a proactive show of strength. A key issue with this reactionary vision is that rhetoric and reality do not match. While China preaches inclusivity, the actions it has taken largely focus on building partnerships to counter a perceived Western dominance in AI, be that through BRICS or with the G77. This is understandable given the geopolitical reality. Even so, China’s refusal to sign a global agreement presented at the Seoul AI Safety Summit earlier this year could be interpreted as a sign of reticence to meaningfully engage in international initiatives that are not led by China or the United Nations. Such an approach would be hugely damaging for global AI governance efforts. The United Nations will certainly have a role to play in governing AI given its inclusivity and legitimacy. But the technical and general-purpose nature of AI, combined with the ‘gridlock’ the UN faces, leaves it as an unsuitable institution for addressing many of the pressing governance issues associated with AI. For global AI governance initiatives to succeed, pragmatic engagement between China and the West in a variety of institutions is crucial. Failure to do so will see promising initiatives undermined and the fragmentation of the global AI governance ecosystem. This would be detrimental to all.

Japan–Philippines defence deal reflects regional security dynamics	On 8 July 2024, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Secretary of National Defence of the Philippines, along with their Japanese counterparts, signed the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) during the second Japan–Philippines 2+2 Foreign and Defence Ministerial Meeting in Manila. The aim of the agreement is to strengthen bilateral defence cooperation through joint military exercises and training and address shared security concerns — particularly the perceived threat from China and the worsening security situation in the South China Sea.&nbsp; The RAA is Japan’s first defence pact with a Southeast Asian state, following similar agreements with Australia and the United Kingdom in 2022 and 2023 respectively. But the RAA between Japan and the Philippines is mainly focused on maritime security and the protection of sea lanes in the South China Sea, in contrast to those with Australia and the United Kingdom, which broadly address Indo-Pacific strategic cooperation. Compared to Australia and the United Kingdom, which have stronger military capabilities, the Philippines is more vulnerable to regional threats. The Marcos government considers the RAA a critical component of the Philippines’ national security policy as it provides a strategic counterweight to its weaker position. The RAA also represents an important turning point in the evolution of bilateral relations between the two nations, which began with the normalisation of diplomatic ties in 1956, following Japan’s brutal occupation of the Philippines during the Second World War. The agreement signifies the evolution of relations from wartime enemies to close security partners. The fact that the Philippines, which suffered terribly during the occupation, has signed such a defence arrangement with Japan demonstrates the success of the post-war reconciliation process. The RAA has significant implications for the US-led security framework. Traditionally, regional security has relied on bilateral alliances with the United States. But the RAA, along with other similar minilateral arrangements, signifies a shift to a more multilateral approach in which US allies are increasingly collaborating among themselves. The traditional ‘hub-and-spokes’ system is reconfiguring into a more flexible alliance network. The RAA significantly benefits the Philippines by enhancing security cooperation through a legal framework for the increased deployment of Japan&#8217;s Self-Defense Forces in the Philippines. This could serve as a deterrent to potential aggressors, particularly in light of escalating tensions with China. Joint exercises and training programs supported by the RAA will also enhance the capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, particularly in disaster response, maritime security and anti-terrorism. This may pave the way for further defence technology transfer and collaboration, considerably boosting the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ modernisation. The RAA also further strengthens strategic alignment between the Philippines and Japan, both concerned about China&#8217;s growing aggression in the South China Sea. This alignment would contribute to establishing a more robust regional security architecture that includes like-minded countries such as the United States and Australia. It is crucial to acknowledge that the RAA is not without risks. One potential consequence is that China might view it as part of a broader encirclement strategy to limit its regional influence, which could escalate tensions between the Philippines and China. Plus, reliance on Japan and other foreign military powers for security raises concerns about the possible erosion of Philippine sovereignty, especially if it results in a substantial foreign military presence on Philippine territory. There is also the risk that the Philippines may become entangled in the strategic objectives of Japan and, by extension, the United States, which would limit its ability to make independent security and foreign policy decisions. Domestically, the RAA faces opposition from groups wary of foreign intervention. The left-wing Makabayan Bloc in the Philippine Congress contended that the agreement signifies a resurgence of Japan&#8217;s hegemonic ambitions in the region, driven by US imperialism. They also claimed that the signing of the RAA perpetuates a pattern of ‘historical amnesia’, showing disregard for the traumatic history and unresolved injustices of the past. While the legacy of historical injustices — such as the comfort women issue — remains contentious, it is important to acknowledge that Japan’s current defence policies are focused on maintaining regional security, not on repeating past aggressions. The RAA, alongside other key developments, represents an important step in the region&#8217;s security framework. It establishes the legal groundwork for Japan and the Philippines to conduct operations in each other’s territories, signalling a united effort to counter China&#8217;s military assertiveness in the South China Sea, potentially with US support. But the RAA might also exacerbate the security dilemma in the region, as China may see the growing military cooperation between the Philippines and Japan as a threat and move to increase its own military presence and capabilities. To prevent escalation and mitigate this risk, all parties involved must engage in continuous diplomatic dialogue and confidence-building measures. This approach will ensure that the RAA serves as a stabilising force rather than a catalyst for increased tensions.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/09/japan-philippines-defence-deal-reflects-regional-security-dynamics/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=japan-philippines-defence-deal-reflects-regional-security-dynamics	2024-09-09T05:08:07-07:00	
Thailand’s establishment strikes another blow against democracy	On 7 August 2024, the Constitutional Court of Thailand dissolved the Move Forward Party (MFP) and banned its executives from politics for 10 years. A week later, prime minister Srettha Thavisin was dismissed. These episodes marked the return of autocratic politics after a brief period of democratisation. The 2023 Thai elections were supposed to restore hopes of democracy after nearly a decade of military-led rule following the 2014 coup. The forced dissolution of a major party, the removal of a sitting prime minister and another looming cabinet reshuffle have extinguished optimism that Thailand could return to a democratic path, or at least achieve some sort of political stability. The court ruling was handed down to the country’s most popular party on the basis that it sought to amend the country’s lese majeste (offence to majesty) law. Critics have long argued that the law has been used to silence and punish political opposition rather than to protect the monarchical institution. While the ruling was widely expected, the court’s decision to eliminate the largest political bloc in the Thai parliament was a devastating blow to democracy. This follows a familiar pattern. Just a few years prior, the MFP’s predecessor, the Future Forward Party, succumbed to the same fate. The Future Forward Party rose quickly in prominence, becoming the third most popular party in the 2019 elections a year after its founding. The party’s anti-establishment policies and branding captured the hearts and minds of young and progressive Thais who embraced the prospect of a more equal, open and inclusive Thailand and saw the Future Forward Party as a conduit for structural change. Thailand’s political conservatives saw the new party as a major threat to the status quo, wherein the military and the monarchy maintain prominence, and mounted a ‘judicial coup’ to dissolve the party. The MFP — a more radical and popular successor — represented an even bigger threat to the power of these political conservatives. The irony of the MFP’s downfall was that it occurred under the leadership of the ruling Pheu Thai Party, its former ally, whose predecessors had also suffered the same fate. Following the 2006 coup, which dislodged one of Thailand’s most popular prime ministers, Thaksin Shinawatra, his party Thai Rak Thai and its successor Palang Prachachon were also dissolved. Pheu Thai, having ditched the MFP to form a coalition with conservative parties, then saw to it that the MFP would cease to exist. The MFP became Pheu Thai’s biggest rival after Pheu Thai unexpectedly came second to the MFP’s first-place finish in the 2023 elections. The ruling party’s leadership figures blamed its loss of popularity on the party’s poor use of social media and diminished brand appeal. Pheu Thai’s survival in the electoral arena would depend on weakening the MFP’s support base. The MFP, now transformed into the People’s Party, managed to retain all 143 of its members of parliament under the new party banner — a feat the Future Forward Party failed to achieve. The party’s dissolution infuriated Thais beyond its support base and angered some of the country’s closest allies. The real test for the People’s Party will be harnessing voter frustration and redirecting their grievances towards the next election, which could be some time away. Pheu Thai did not escape unscathed. Its leader, prime minister Srettha Thavisin, was dismissed because of an ethics probe widely believed to be politically motivated. Conspiracy theories abound as to why Srettha was targeted, ranging from speculation about a ‘deal’ with Thaksin to install his daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra, to Thailand’s royalist-military political establishment needing Paetongtarn as a ‘political hostage’ to keep Thaksin in line. Either way, Pheu Thai — already struggling to lead its nine-party governing coalition — was beleaguered by the ordeal. The Senate and the Constitutional Court — nominally understood as bulwarks of democracy and institutional protection against the tyranny of the majority — rarely serve their purposes in Thailand. The upper house was cleverly set up to serve the interests of the military junta, which appointed its 250 members after the 2014 coup. It successfully blocked the MFP from coming to power after the 2023 election and has historically stood in the way of democratically elected governments. The Constitutional Court has long engaged in autocratic judicial activism by intervening in democratic processes, including undermining elections and the rule of law. Its politicisation has led the judicial system as a whole to lose its popular legitimacy as an institution serving the people’s interests. Most Thais no longer trust the Constitutional Court to be impartial, transparent or just and would not count on it to uphold the interests of the people. Its interventions against the MFP and Pheu Thai on dubious legal grounds have shown yet again the outsized reach of the country’s highest court in matters that can hardly be justified. The new premier, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, is unlikely to restore democracy and the rule of law given her weakened position as the country’s new leader. She has never possessed democratic ambitions for Thailand. Her government will focus on keeping the coalition together, further developing their signature policies like the Digital Wallet initiative and rebuilding the Pheu Thai brand.

Stability a key legacy of Joko Widodo’s problematic presidency	After a decade in power, Joko Widodo leaves Indonesia a changed country — one that has benefited from healthy economic growth and has greater international standing. But whether the changes in Indonesia are all for the better or mainly for the worse is very much in the eye of the beholder and depends significantly on which element of the outgoing president’s legacy one chooses to emphasise. His administration’s policies have undeniably lifted the living standards of many millions of Indonesians and bolstered the nation’s international influence. He has presided over Indonesia’s shift onto a new economic plane — one where the priorities of escaping the middle-income trap are as urgent an agenda item as dealing with the challenges of extreme poverty — and seen Jakarta claim a&nbsp;greater role in international affairs&nbsp;as an advocate for developing-country interests. A notable achievement in Widodo’s second term was Indonesia’s chairing of the G20 Summit at a difficult time, though it did less well in strategically positioning ASEAN when Indonesia chaired it in 2023. A fair assessment of his legacy must give credit to the technocrats — most prominently his high-performing, tough-as-nails finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, but also others like Retno Marsudi in Foreign Affairs and Basuki Hadimuljono in Infrastructure&nbsp;— who have done much of the intellectual and bureaucratic grunt work behind the presidential photo ops. It also demands acknowledging the risks arising from the fiscal legacy of Widodo’s infrastructure spending spree, the unaddressed challenges of institutional reform that Widodo leaves his successor with and the&nbsp;continued indulgence of national protectionist reflexes&nbsp;that afflict key parts of the policymaking apparatus.&nbsp; But it is the erosion of the institutional achievements of the reformasi movement — a movement aimed at dismantling the legacies of Suharto’s thirty-year dictatorship — that unquestionably casts a shadow over Widodo’s legacy, as Liam Gammon writes in this week’s lead article. With six weeks to go until he hands over power to his successor Prabowo Subianto, says Gammon, ‘Widodo has used the wave of local elections scheduled for November 2024 as a way to shape the political landscape of the first Prabowo term in his favour’. Widodo understands ‘the potential utility of a prominent governorship as a launching pad for the presidency, but also the power of subnational officials in press-ganging neighbourhood and village level officials into getting out the vote for national-level candidates’. A key goal recently has been to frustrate the ambitions of opposition figure Anies Baswedan from mounting a political comeback in the Jakarta gubernatorial election, which has prompted criticism from progressives that Widodo has crossed a line into authoritarian political tactics of disqualifying political rivals. How does Indonesia’s inching towards the grey zone between democracy and authoritarianism affect its regional leadership role? An important point is that even in the plausible scenario that the Prabowo presidency sees an accretion of presidential power beyond Widodo’s, Indonesia will still remain home to a technocratic intelligentsia based in its universities, think tanks and media who don’t feel obliged to parrot the government line, but can freely propose and debate ideas about Indonesia’s approach to its development challenges and its international policy agenda. The relatively open intellectual environment in Indonesia, despite the pressure on many other aspects of its democracy, is a resource for the whole region. ASEAN is at a crucial moment, facing the need to upgrade its institutions and policy agenda to shore up its importance as the fulcrum of multilateral cooperation in East Asia. Indonesian engagement with this effort is necessary to its success, but Prabowo’s attention to ASEAN can’t be assumed. During his first presidential term, Prabowo’s attention to ASEAN issues will not be forced by Indonesia having the chair of the grouping. It will be the job of Indonesia’s foreign policy thinkers, as well as Indonesia’s international partners, to hammer home the message to the Prabowo administration that taking up a leadership role within ASEAN isn’t too small a job for Indonesia but a crucial opportunity, even as it preens its self-image as a great power in waiting. The region will certainly need Indonesian engagement in the coming years to keep any effort at ASEAN reform on-track and the fundamental stability of Indonesia’s politics is an asset in this regard. Malaysia is also at risk of losing focus on ASEAN’s importance to its own national and political interests ahead of its chair year in 2025 as Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim deals with ideological distractions. The Philippines’ chair year in 2026 may be coloured by its establishment’s ambivalence towards ASEAN as it leans into its alliance relationship with the United States in response to its stoush with China in the South China Sea. For ASEAN, the silver lining of the Widodo-era politics is a robust stability that can be mobilised by Indonesia’s foreign policy leadership, inside and outside of government, to build a consensus that it is the critical platform through which Indonesia can leverage its own national interest as well as apply its energies as a leader of the developing and non-aligned world more broadly.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/09/stability-a-key-legacy-of-joko-widodos-problematic-presidency/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=stability-a-key-legacy-of-joko-widodos-problematic-presidency	2024-09-08T15:00:00-07:00	
Indonesia’s president-elect Prabowo steps back from Widodo’s constitutional shenanigans	With six weeks left in Indonesia’s presidential office, Joko Widodo continues to try tie up loose ends before handing over power to his successor, Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto, on 20 October. But as the political centre of gravity has shifted towards Prabowo, Widodo’s political obsolescence is frustrating his efforts to prolong his family’s power and influence. Widodo has used the wave of local elections scheduled for November 2024 as a way to shape the political landscape of the first Prabowo term in his favour. Widodo, himself a local politician turned president, knows a thing or two about the nexus between local and national politics in Indonesia: not only about the potential utility of a prominent governorship as a launching pad for the presidency but also the power of subnational officials in press-ganging neighbourhood and village level officials into getting out the vote for national-level candidates. One focus of this effort has been the big-ticket gubernatorial election in Jakarta. Widodo used Jakarta’s governorship as a launching pad to his presidency in 2014. The previous governor, Anies Baswedan, used the same position to become Indonesia’s de facto opposition leader during Widodo’s presidency and to position himself for an electoral challenge to Prabowo in the February 2024 presidential elections. Polls suggest that Anies would easily have been returned to the governorship if he ran in November, and that would position him as a strong candidate to either run against Prabowo in the 2029 presidential elections, or to run with him as vice-presidential candidate if Prabowo chose to dump the incumbent, Widodo’s son Gibran Rakabuming, from his ticket that year. Widodo’s interest is in stopping Anies’ political comeback in its tracks. Anies had assembled a coalition of parties that had more than the 25 per cent of seats in the local legislature that election laws set as the benchmark to be eligible to run. But in response to pressure from the Widodo administration, Anies’ party allies one by one defected to a government-aligned candidate, former West Java governor Ridwan Kamil, ahead of the nomination deadline on 29 August. Anies’ path to a comeback was seemingly cut off, but a surprise Constitutional Court decision lowered the nomination threshold, allowing him to run with the nomination of only one party. The national parliament then rapidly drafted emergency legislation that effectively reversed the Court’s decision — and confirmed a related court ruling that lowered age limits on contesting local office to allow Widodo’s 29 year old second son, Kaesang Pangarep, to run in the November local polls. Progressives reacted on social media and on the streets of cities around the country with fury to the parliament’s defiance of the Constitutional Court and its manipulation of electoral rules in the Widodo dynasty’s favour. To the surprise of many, the parliament backed away from its legislation. But Anies’ hopes of running were nevertheless dashed after his one remaining supporter, the PDI-P party, declined to nominate him despite the Court opening up the legal right to do so, likely worrying that the government would strip it of the parliamentary speakership as payback. Though civil society scored a rare victory in stopping the emergency election legislation, it wasn’t a case of all’s well that ends well. The Widodo government’s determination to thwart Anies’ comeback highlights potential hazards to Indonesia’s democracy that arise from the combination of its election laws and the overbearing presidency that Widodo has normalised over the past decade. The oversized party coalitions that Indonesian presidents form to support their governments have been described as a political cartels, whose members compete at election times, only to collude afterwards to share the spoils of patronage and manipulate electoral rules to limit the viability of new entrants to the system. What caused such alarm in Indonesian civil society about the campaign to thwart Anies’ comeback was how it represented an unprecedented effort to enforce compliance with a classic cartelistic goal of blocking a competitor’s ability to enter the arena. The crucial ingredient has been that mainstay of Widodo-era governance — behind-the-scenes coercion — with media investigations detailing how Widodo’s coalition partners were deterred from backing the obvious frontrunner for the Jakarta governorship by veiled threats from the presidential palace of legal prosecutions and loss of opportunities for patronage. This is a troubling precedent for a democracy that, for all its illiberal tendencies, is still marked by free and fair electoral competition. Indonesia also applies a system of nomination thresholds in presidential campaigns that, in theory, could be exploited by an unscrupulous president to keep opponents off the ballot. These scenarios may be still well over the horizon. The focus of the Indonesian press now is on speculation about how Prabowo’s interests and tactics are diverging from the incumbent’s in the twilight of the Widodo administration. Prabowo seems, for instance, to have been instrumental in lobbying for the parliament to abort its attempt to reverse the Constitutional Court decision on local election eligibility, as well as in opposing efforts to get Widodo’s second son Kaesang a local government candidacy. With the presidency almost in his grasp, Prabowo has drawn a line around his willingness to back Widodo in controversial stratagems in which Prabowo has little at stake personally. Prabowo is no defender of freewheeling electoral competition — he is the cartel politician extraordinaire. Indeed, after his election victory he has flagged his ambition to bring every party into his governing coalition, recently invoking the Suharto-era trope that the very idea of rivalry between government and opposition is something intrinsically alien to Indonesian culture. Observers wary of Prabowo’s democratic bona fides will worry that the rhetorical and ideological foundation for curtailing electoral competition is already being laid.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/08/indonesias-president-elect-prabowo-steps-back-from-widodos-constitutional-shenanigans/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=indonesias-president-elect-prabowo-steps-back-from-widodos-constitutional-shenanigans	2024-09-08T05:00:00-07:00	
Taiwan must tighten the lid on China’s misinformation campaigns	In the days leading up to Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te’s inauguration on 20 May 2024, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;quiet. But the silence did not last long. On 23 May, the PLA’s Eastern Theatre Command&nbsp;embarked&nbsp;on Joint Sword-2024A — a joint-military drill involving the Army, Navy, Airforce and rocket force that surrounded Taiwan and showcased Beijing’s firepower.&nbsp; The main purpose of the military exercise is retribution. It represents Beijing’s displeasure towards&nbsp;President Lai’s inauguration&nbsp;ceremony, which undermined China’s long-held ‘One China’ principle. Compared to his predecessor President Tsai Ing-wen, who&nbsp;adopted&nbsp;more ambiguous terms like ‘mainland’ or the ‘other side of the Strait’, Lai is far more&nbsp;assertive&nbsp;and has&nbsp;explicitly&nbsp;referred to China as China. In response, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office called President Lai a dangerous separatist, condemning his&nbsp;hardline tendencies&nbsp;that will only bring ‘war and destruction to the island’.&nbsp; But Beijing’s wrath did not end there. Completing its repertoire of grey zone tactics, the PLA has&nbsp;released&nbsp;a dramatic video that simulates an all-out-invasion of Taiwan. Complete with special effects, the video not only amplifies the intended coercive effects of its joint military exercises, but also highlights the vital role of influence operations in Beijing’s efforts to achieve reunification. If the developments surrounding Lai’s inauguration are an indicator of the trajectory of cross-strait relations, it only points to the continued&nbsp;normalisation&nbsp;of Beijing’s escalatory and coercive actions against the self-governed island. Influence operations will also become even more central to China’s mission to&nbsp;legitimise&nbsp;its jurisdiction over Taiwan. By co-opting and penetrating the psyche of its domestic population, Beijing aims to ultimately&nbsp;undermine&nbsp;public&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in Taiwan towards its political institutions. Fortunately, Taiwan has&nbsp;strong stamina&nbsp;when it comes to countering China-sponsored influence operations. After years of experiencing China’s disinformation and misinformation campaigns, the island is home to a vibrant network of traditional media and civil society groups.&nbsp; But&nbsp;the aftermath of Taiwan’s January 2024 election offers fresh lessons that underscore the enormity and sophistication of China’s evolving influence operations. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) took centre stage during Taiwan’s election season. A smear campaign that used generative AI videos to target former president Tsai-Ing Wen circulated on TikTok and Instagram. According to Taiwan AI Labs, 3.5 per cent of the top 200 videos reshared on Facebook in 2023 were found to be automatically generated using text-to-speech and AI. Conventional fact-checking techniques employed by Taiwanese media organisations and civil society groups could hardly keep up with all the AI-fabricated audio and video content. The mass production and proliferation of AI-generated audio, video and text have&nbsp;overwhelmed&nbsp;fact-checkers, while new malicious content propagates instantaneously.&nbsp; Several high-profile influencers were also posting false information that sought to tamper with the integrity of the election process. Such malicious content has led to a high degree of distrust in Taiwan’s electoral systems and procedures. Given the prevalence of China’s coercive tactics against Taiwan and the rapid explosion of generative AI and algorithmic bias, combined with the unpredictable headwinds in today’s geopolitics, Taiwan needs to reboot its counter-influence operations toolkit.&nbsp; Taiwan should encourage its leading tech companies to increase participation in global technical standards setting through formal and informal channels. It should also mobilise civil society groups to proactively participate in multi-stakeholder consultations on emerging technologies like generative AI. For instance, the International Telecommunications Union is currently&nbsp;exploring&nbsp;the development of standards and frameworks to detect deepfakes and other forms of malicious AI-generated media. Taiwanese start-ups and civil society groups can share best practices and lessons learned in fighting state-sponsored influence operations. Because most of the Chinese-linked influence operations propagate faster on social media platforms before being amplified in mainstream media, Taiwan must explore more stringent options to regulate digital platforms to enhance transparency, especially during elections.&nbsp; It would be strategic for Taiwan to reframe the prevailing narratives that it is a mere pawn of the US–China rivalry or that there is only a binary choice of having peace or war in the Taiwan Strait. In highlighting its role as a major economic and semiconductor powerhouse, Taiwan can strengthen its democratic identity and its right to engage and participate in international debates on pertinent issues like regulating AI, reducing carbon emissions and even fighting election-related influence operations.&nbsp; By rebooting its narrative beyond the binaries, Taiwan may help reduce tensions across the Strait and sustain or even open new avenues for regional cooperation.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/07/taiwan-must-tighten-the-lid-on-chinas-misinformation-campaigns/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=taiwan-must-tighten-the-lid-on-chinas-misinformation-campaigns	2024-09-07T05:00:00-07:00	
Recharging Southeast Asia’s energy security strategy	Ensuring energy security is becoming increasingly crucial in Southeast Asia as the region navigates its transition towards a clean energy future. This is not an easy task, particularly for fast-growing Southeast Asian economies with rising demand for energy.&nbsp;At the heart of this challenge lies growing concerns over gas import dependence. Historically, gas has been a crucial component of Southeast Asia’s electricity supply. In 2023, it accounted for roughly 30 per cent of electricity generated, making it the second-largest source of electricity in the region after coal. Led by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, the region is currently developing&nbsp;over 100&nbsp;gigawatts (GW)&nbsp;of gas power capacity. This capacity is approximately equivalent to the United Kingdom’s total installed capacity in 2023. Southeast Asia’s push for gas generation occurs against the backdrop of declining local gas production, mainly due to the gradual depletion of mature fields and the sparse discovery of commercially viable new reserves. Since the mid-2010s the region has seen a steady decline in gas production, with a&nbsp;significant&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;reduction in 2022 compared to the previous year. Proven gas reserves also declined by&nbsp;4.9&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;in 2022 to 3.98 trillion cubic metres. As local gas production diminishes, large energy-consuming countries in the region have started to bolster their liquefied natural gas (LNG) import capabilities. In 2023, Vietnam and the Philippines inaugurated their&nbsp;first LNG import terminals. In Thailand, LNG imports surged by&nbsp;40&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;in 2023 to 11.55 million tonnes despite efforts to diversify fuel sources and reduce reliance on LNG imports. Across Southeast Asia, LNG facilities with a combined capacity of 47 million tonnes are currently under development. If completed, they will boost the region’s LNG import capacity by&nbsp;80&nbsp;per cent. Malaysia, one of the world’s&nbsp;largest LNG exporters, is poised to consider&nbsp;redirecting LNG&nbsp;from its gas fields around Bintulu, Sarawak — currently exported to Asian neighbours — to meet fast-growing domestic demand. This move aligns with the country’s emphasis, articulated in&nbsp;the&nbsp;National Energy Transition Roadmap, on&nbsp;using gas as a vital ‘transitional fuel’ to uphold energy security and affordability while advancing its&nbsp;decarbonisation&nbsp;goals. If the current trend continues, Southeast Asia is set to become a net gas&nbsp;importer&nbsp;as early as 2025. By 2045, its import dependence could reach&nbsp;93&nbsp;per cent, posing a major risk to energy security. Battery storage can be a strategic hedge against future gas risks for Southeast Asia.&nbsp;By providing&nbsp;fast and responsive support to balance the grid when renewable generation fluctuates, either exceeding or falling short of electricity demand,&nbsp;battery storage can&nbsp;reduce the&nbsp;region’s dependence on&nbsp;imported&nbsp;gas for both baseload power and flexibility.&nbsp;This, in turn, could help mitigate exposure to&nbsp;global energy market fluctuations, improving energy independence&nbsp;and security. The 1.5 degree-aligned&nbsp;transition pathways&nbsp;outlined by the International Renewable Energy Agency forecasts a need for over 600 GW of battery storage capacity in Southeast Asia by 2050. This capacity is essential to support the integration of variable renewable energy and reduce reliance on fossil fuel-based generation. The declining costs of battery storage have made large-scale deployment increasingly economically viable.&nbsp;Over the past decade, the price of lithium-ion battery packs has witnessed a significant decrease,&nbsp;dropping by 14&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;year-on-year to US$139 per kilowatt hour (kWh)&nbsp;in 2023, compared to US$780 per kWh in 2013.&nbsp; Falling raw material prices, combined with reduced margins for producers amid fierce competition, drove battery prices down further in 2024. This led to a halving of cell prices in China, where over&nbsp;70&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;of&nbsp;the world’s batteries are made.&nbsp;Further technological innovation and manufacturing improvements are expected to drive battery prices&nbsp;even lower. The attractiveness of battery storage is enhanced by the region’s abundant reserves of&nbsp;crucial battery minerals&nbsp;like nickel, cobalt and manganese. By leveraging these advantages, the deployment of battery storage could catalyse local manufacturing, contributing to the region’s aspiration of becoming a clean tech manufacturing hub. But battery storage has&nbsp;yet to be&nbsp;fully&nbsp;integrated into current&nbsp;policy frameworks in Southeast Asia. Apart from sporadic installations of battery storage in conjunction with distributed solar farms, no significant efforts have been made to support the large-scale deployment of battery storage across the region.&nbsp; In&nbsp;Vietnam&nbsp;— often hailed as a success story in renewable deployment within the region —&nbsp;most&nbsp;wind and solar projects are&nbsp;not paired&nbsp;with battery storage systems. Malaysia’s large-scale solar auctions have similarly&nbsp;not attracted&nbsp;any solar power projects incorporating battery storage, primarily because&nbsp;no specific incentives for battery storage apply to such projects.&nbsp; Historical precedents highlight the profound impacts of international gas market volatility, spanning from soaring prices to supply disruptions. Such instability can significantly hinder economic growth and exacerbate deep-seated sociopolitical tensions and conflicts.&nbsp; Southeast Asia needs a backup plan. Battery storage should be a crucial component of that plan, offering an effective hedge against future gas risks. This strategy would support the region in attaining its climate aspirations while ensuring a secure and affordable energy supply.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/07/recharging-southeast-asias-energy-security-strategy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=recharging-southeast-asias-energy-security-strategy	2024-09-06T23:00:00-07:00	
Deterrence alone cannot prevent war in the Asia Pacific	As tensions rise in the Pacific, the United States and its allies remain committed to peace via deterrence. While many credit the strategy with achieving a peaceful 21st century in the region, it has also contributed to Asia’s current tensions. If left unchecked, China, the United States and other regional actors may fall further into a security dilemma, in which each party is driven to militarise to keep their rapidly militarising rivals from gaining an advantage. For peace to persist, the United States and its allies should beware of overreliance on a deterrence mindset that perpetuates the security dilemma. An approach that balances deterrence with restraint-based strategies can ease tensions and bring us closer to peace. While the United States’ ability to inflict unacceptable costs on China may have played a role in the absence of warfare in the 21st century, this power imbalance also brought the region to its current precarious state. China’s military ascent began in the 1990s, spurred by the Gulf War, which exposed its potential vulnerability against technologically advanced Western forces. Its rate of increase in military spending shot up again after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, which raised alarms in China over the implications for China during a potential Taiwan or North Korea conflict and provided a ‘rhetorical cover’ for Chinese militarism. Significant developments in Chinese technology, the People’s Liberation Army Navy and mainland missile systems have made China much more competitive against a &#8216;strong enemy’. While a hegemonic United States might have deterred some Chinese aggression, it has also encouraged China’s militarisation, bringing us to the present moment. To meet the threat China poses, the United States and its allies are improving their military capabilities and escalating the security dilemma. When China builds new military outposts in the South China Sea, it can be interpreted as either a ‘necessary national defence’ measure or an expansion of offensive capabilities. Similarly, when US military units transit near these outposts, it could be seen as upholding free navigation in international waters or threatening Chinese sovereignty in its territory. Chinese assertiveness either justifies deepening military ties between the United States, Japan and the Philippines or is justified by a United States-led effort to contain China. In the security dilemma, each side sees its rival as aggressive and sees itself as defensive. The United States can no longer deter China with overwhelming military superiority, but instead with the threat of a mutually disastrous war between nuclear powers with devastating economic and social consequences for the entire world. This new reality requires efforts to de-escalate tensions, build trust and demonstrate a genuine desire for peace. While challenging, the United States and its allies can take steps to slow the security dilemma. If Washington and its partners intend to strengthen their military capabilities, they should do so with defence in mind. The Biden administration’s support for Taiwanese aircraft, ships and air defence systems is an improvement over the Trump administration’s long-range missile sales, which have the potential to strike the Chinese mainland. The ‘porcupine strategy’, which utilises short-range weaponry to target ships and aircraft, signals fortitude against an invasion without threatening the mainland. Where feasible, the United States should apply such principles to its military support to signal resolve without aggression. While recent years have not been kind to the ‘rules-based order’, institutions and agreements are another way to reverse the security dilemma. While Chinese non-compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is frustrating, UNCLOS does not address the root cause of dangerous naval confrontations — overlapping territorial claims between China, Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Japan. Accidental escalations are common in many war scenarios, making it crucial for the United States to lead efforts to resolve disputes diplomatically. While a diplomatic solution would be an ambitious undertaking and likely require concessions to China, the potential benefits would be significant. Establishing clear rules and boundaries can prevent dangerous situations where each side thinks it is acting in self-defence. Good-faith negotiations would also signal that the United States is willing to accept a powerful China as a legitimate and influential regional and global actor, easing fears in Beijing that the United States seeks to contain it. The ‘free world’ should also ensure careful and honest communications about countries&#8217; actions on both sides of the growing geopolitical conflict. The United States and its allies should meticulously outline the logic behind their actions, explaining to China how these steps are intended to promote peace, not war. Governments and civil society must also resist framing the conflict as a battle between ‘good and evil’, as this only exacerbates existing tensions. Instead, politicians and other observers should contextualise Chinese actions within the growing security dilemma and address Chinese concerns in good faith. An overreliance on deterrence has brought the United States and its allies to the brink of war. To avoid the worst-case scenario, governments and civil society must develop policies that signal a desire for peace and compromise, balancing deterrence with restraint.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/07/deterrence-alone-cannot-prevent-war-in-the-asia-pacific/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=deterrence-alone-cannot-prevent-war-in-the-asia-pacific	2024-09-06T17:00:00-07:00	
Where are the women in Indonesia’s energy transition?	The term ‘energy transition’ has become increasingly popular in recent years to describe government-mandated green policies. Before, terms like ‘decarbonisation’ and ‘low carbon development’ dominated global policy discourses. This shift reflects ongoing efforts at global and national levels to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, which are linked to significant environmental issues. Like many other countries, Indonesia has long demonstrated a commitment to reducing carbon emissions. Law No. 31 of 2009 mandated the government to engage in climate change mitigation and adaptation activities, including tracking greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2016, the Indonesian government has set official targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions across various sectors by ratifying the Paris Agreement. Advanced measures remain necessary, as Indonesia is among the top three countries most at risk of extreme weather events and climate-related disasters. Climate-related flooding in Indonesia’s coastal areas has caused severe impacts, including the destruction of assets and livelihoods. This situation places economically disadvantaged groups in even more precarious positions, as they lack the adaptive capacities to recover quickly. The transition from fossil fuels must also be managed in a way that supports affected communities to prevent increased inequality. This is crucial given Indonesia’s role as a major global coal producer. In 2023, coal production surged to 770.85 million tonnes, a 12.4 per cent increase from the previous year. The fossil fuel sector is a vital source of employment, directly employing 250,000 workers in coal mining in 2020. In coal-producing regions like East Kalimantan, about 11 per cent of the workforce is engaged in coal-related employment. The adverse impacts of energy transitions are often disproportionately borne by women. Although there is still a lack of publicly available data in the Indonesian context, women in the Global South face the harshest impacts of coal mine closures, as these typically occur in regions where gender relations are marked by unequal economic development. Key impacts include increased rates of gender-based violence due to mass unemployment, a worsening of the ‘triple burden’ of paid labour, unpaid labour and childcare imposed on women, as well as decreased access to essential health and childcare services. Though women are often disproportionately impacted by the energy transition, considerations around gender within energy policymaking remains inadequate. In 2023, the Just Energy Transition Partnership Secretariat released a comprehensive document outlining the investment and policy blueprint for Indonesia’s energy transition. The blueprint emphasises the necessity of equitably distributing risks and opportunities in alignment with human rights, accountability and gender equality principles. This framework corresponds with Presidential Instruction No. 9 of 2000, which mandates the incorporation of gender considerations into the planning, implementation, and monitoring of development policies and programs. The guideline for the formulation of the National Energy Plan and Regional Energy Plan states that their development will involve individuals with knowledge or expertise in energy. Policymakers — especially local governments — typically interpret this as involving a team of experts for data collection, including focus group discussions with the community. But a recent study reveals that sex-disaggregated data was not required for data collection, so the analysis behind energy plans cannot fully comprehend the needs and challenges faced by different segments of the population. Women remain significantly underrepresented in the energy sector, constituting only five per cent of decision-makers in 2022. The lack of specific mechanisms to increase women’s participation in energy policymaking will likely perpetuate gender blindness in programs aimed at a just energy transition, as numerous barriers still hinder women from participating meaningfully. In many communities, societal expectations confine women to domestic roles while men manage public affairs. As a result, women are often neither invited nor allowed to formally participate in governance processes. Meeting spaces often lack considerations that facilitate women’s participation, such as accommodating their paid and unpaid work schedules. Lessons from other countries show that women are crucial advocates for innovative solutions in just transitions. For instance, in Morocco, women&#8217;s active involvement in a concentrating solar power project led to the creation of communal drainage and irrigation channels for the land affected by the construction, rather than cash compensation that would have primarily benefited only the male landowners. Women&#8217;s extensive experience within the household in terms of water, food and energy management tend to effectively address related issues at both household and community levels. &nbsp; A similar trend is evident in Indonesia, where women spend 2.8 times more on unpaid household work than men. Hence, strongly engaging women in just transitions will ensure their insights — such as improving energy accessibility for household appliances — are incorporated, freeing up time for productive economic activities rather than adding to their burdens. As Indonesia aims for net zero emissions by 2060, the energy transition should do more than reduce fossil fuels dependency — it is also a pivotal opportunity to enhance the quality of life for the entire population. Gender equality and a just energy transition are interconnected goals, both striving for the fair and equitable distribution of the benefits arising from development and progress. To achieve this, specific mechanisms must be established to ensure women’s meaningful participation in the policy process, including planning and design. By doing so, Indonesia can harness the full potential of its population, fostering an inclusive and sustainable energy transition.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/06/where-are-the-women-in-indonesias-energy-transition/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=where-are-the-women-in-indonesias-energy-transition	2024-09-06T05:00:00-07:00	
Okinawans must not be overlooked in new US–Japan counter-crime forum	On 22 July 2024, US Forces Japan Commander Lieutenant General Ricky Rupp&nbsp;announced&nbsp;the&nbsp;creation&nbsp;of a new joint US–Japan forum to address the endemic issue of crimes committed off base by US military personnel stationed in Okinawa — particularly sex crimes. How Rupp’s forum will differ from the&nbsp;Cooperative Working Team&nbsp;established in October 2000 to address similar concerns is not clear. The Cooperative Working Team met 27 times until petering out in April 2017. It brought together representatives from the US military and government, Japanese foreign and defence ministries, the Okinawan prefectural government and police, as well as members of the prefecture’s chambers of commerce and bar association. Since its dissolution, active-duty US servicemen in Okinawa have committed&nbsp;several well-documented&nbsp;rapes, abductions and assaults — including against children.&nbsp; The task force must acknowledge Okinawan elected officials’ right to immediate and accurate information about crimes US soldiers commit. This fundamental step does not require changing existing protocols. Instead, it requires that the US government, US military and the Japanese central government adhere to procedures established in the 1997 US–Japan Joint Committee Agreement. This document augmented Okinawans’ rights with regard to Article XVII of the&nbsp;Status of Forces Agreement&nbsp;between the United States and Japan, which&nbsp;concerns jurisdiction over crimes committed on Japanese territory.&nbsp; Notably indiscernible on the Japanese&nbsp;Foreign Ministry website, the Okinawan Prefectural Government wants more publicity for the Agreement’s ‘Notification Channel Details for Okinawa-related Issues’. According to protocol, in the aftermath of a crime committed by a US service member or civilian attached to the US military, the commander responsible must notify the duty officer at command headquarters and the Naha Defence Facilities Administration Bureau.&nbsp; The US side then moves up through military and diplomatic chains of command to the US Embassy in Tokyo, while the Japanese side moves from the Naha-based agency — Okinawa’s capital city — and simultaneously notifies the Okinawan prefectural government, Defence Administration Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Okinawa Office, who then convey information to the Prime Minister’s Office in Tokyo.&nbsp; This&nbsp;did not happen&nbsp;during the first half of 2024, leading Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki to emphasise during his&nbsp;press conference&nbsp;on 7 August at Tokyo’s Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan that he cannot be sure how many crimes he and previous Okinawan prefectural officials have never even learned about.&nbsp; Tamaki accused the Japanese central government of ignoring his right to information about these crimes as Okinawa’s highest elected official. Referencing the 24 December 2023&nbsp;abduction and rape&nbsp;of an Okinawan minor as well as the 26 May 2024&nbsp;sexual assault&nbsp;of an Okinawan woman, Tamaki gave a full explanation of the 1997 Notification Channel Details and the Japanese government’s wilful&nbsp;failure to abide&nbsp;by them. The repetitious nature of the crimes against Okinawan women and girls, and the US and Japanese government’s botched response to them — specifically the failure to notify the Okinawan prefectural government about crimes against their citizens — highlights the need for Commander Rupp’s forum to do something different from the prior Working Team. Reforms are urgent, with a third instance of sexual assault reported on 6 September 2024. Speculation continues concerning Tokyo’s rationale for withholding information from the Governor. The central government may have feared that Okinawans would protest against the dominant presence of the US military, as they did in 1995 following three US servicemen’s abduction and gang rape of an elementary schoolgirl. Such protests could have adversely affected the Okinawa elections held on 16 June 2024. Tokyo’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party wanted victory for the Governor’s opponents in order to resume construction on the unpopular new US base at Henoko, that Tamaki and his supporters blocked.&nbsp;Tamaki&#8217;s opponents won&nbsp;the election, and Tokyo&nbsp;ordered construction of the base&nbsp;to recommence despite ongoing local protests.&nbsp; During the press conference Tamaki also underscored the challenge of overcoming the central government’s perennial disdain for Okinawans’ place in structural matters involving the US–Japan Alliance, despite the centrality of the territory and its people to this calculus. Taking umbrage with Tokyo’s use of ‘privacy’ as justification for not sharing information, Tamaki reiterated his 10 July 2024 Letter of Protest to Japanese Prime Minister Kishida and requested ‘that all crimes, incidents, and accidents involving US military service members and related personnel be reported, without fail, to the prefectural government’. In September, Governor Tamaki will visit Washington to drive home his concerns to members of the US Congress and related bureaucracies. The governor will explain the disproportionate burden he and his constituents bear vis a vis US bases in Japan under the United States’ broader ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy’. Noticeably,&nbsp;this policy&nbsp;emphasises a ‘rules-based order’. For these words to have any meaning at all, the Japanese government and the United States government and military must include Okinawans as equals.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/06/okinawans-must-not-be-overlooked-in-new-us-japan-counter-crime-forum/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=okinawans-must-not-be-overlooked-in-new-us-japan-counter-crime-forum	2024-09-05T23:00:00-07:00	
Fiji’s HIV surge stems from a funding shortfall	In 2024, HIV/AIDS seems to be well and truly back in Fiji. Estimated new infections had been increasing slowly over the past two decades, but rose by 260 per cent from 2010–2022 with a record 415 new cases recorded in 2023. This has risen by a further 552 from January to June of 2024.&nbsp;According to UNAIDS, this spike in newly reported HIV cases makes the severity of this epidemic second only to the Philippines in the Asia Pacific.&nbsp; The Fijian Health Ministry has attributed this increase to a surge in illegal drug usage. In particular, two extremely unsafe practices have been blamed for the increase in HIV infections in Fiji — ‘bluetoothing’ and ‘chem-sex’. But contrary to the assumption that the surge is the result of the drug crisis, a precipitous drop off in funding and research has also been a significant contributor. It is critical to better understand policies, programs and funding developments between 2010 and 2023 in order to explain and respond to the current crisis. Before 2012, the used a combination prevention approach to HIV. Funding had ramped up in 2008 through the HIV and STIs Regional Response Fund, an agreement between AusAID and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) to address HIV and AIDS in the Pacific.&nbsp;The fund supported the SPC-coordinated combined regional HIV and STIs response to ‘support the scale up of the response to HIV and STIs in the Pacific … [to support] effective implementation of regional and national HIV &amp; STI plans, including the capacity building needs identified in those plans’. This funding enabled the use of the joint technical expertise of national, regional and international partners, enforced relevant HIV policies including the 2011 Fiji HIV decree, identified at-risk populations and risky behaviours and funded HIV awareness and response activities. The HIV, AIDS and STI agenda was very visible within the country during this period. In 2013, the HIV Regional Response funding ended. All recipients were informed of this well in advance, and were informed of regional and national strategies for next steps including transitional funds to continue existing activities. Every country was informed of the 2014 grant round of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, where Fiji was to submit its own single-country application.&nbsp; But in 2012 Fiji graduated from lower middle-income to upper middle-income status. This was to have damaging repercussions for its HIV/AIDS national response. The immediate consequence was that Fiji became ineligible to apply to the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS and STI prevention activities, and the single-country application had to be dropped. This led to a drastic decline in HIV/AIDs funding from US$2.3 million in 2011 to US$0.4 million in 2012. Though a combination of international and domestic sources increased HIV funding to US$0.67 million by 2016, the funding never fully recovered. This drop in funding led to drastic budget reductions for HIV/AIDS prevention activities. Media coverage of health promotion and HIV awareness efforts ceased. Services targeting at-risk populations and prevention activities fell off priority lists. In the years since, the country has faced multiple natural disasters, ongoing political instability, chronic under-resourcing of health services and the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the degradation of health infrastructure and workforce stress and further limiting the response. By 2021 it was evident that there were&nbsp;gaps in sexual health knowledge, with only 30 per cent of women and 26 per cent of men aged 15–24 years knowledgeable about HIV prevention. As media and politicians have noted, the past decade has also seen an exponential increase in drug trafficking in the region, with trafficking to Australia and New Zealand via Fiji and Vanuatu contributing to both organised crime and an upsurge in drug consumption. This has clearly resulted in a significant rise in intravenous drug use, sexual violence, transactional sex and other high-risk sexual activity. But this is simply the spark that lit a waiting fuse. Years of underfunding and the deterioration of HIV/AIDS services had left a population unprepared for the storm.&nbsp; Fiji’s country data to February 2024 also illustrates a weak national response to the epidemic so far. The available statistics do not present a clear picture of the current national status, while other critical data to guide the HIV/AIDS national response have not been updated since 2012 when the Regional Response Fund ended. Despite the anecdotal and often sensationalised evidence of the impact of the drug crisis, studies to estimate population sizes and risky behaviours were last conducted in&nbsp;2004–2008, 2011–12 and 2014. There is not sufficient evidence to inform Fiji’s HIV response in 2024. In July 2024 the UN Development Programme and Fiji’s Ministry of Health and Medical Services signed an agreement for 5.4 million Fiji dollars (US$2.4 million) from the Global Fund to jointly address HIV, STIs, hepatitis B and tuberculosis in Fiji. But based on a rapid review of HIV funding from 2008–2016, Fiji would need at least US$10 million to revive, restore and strengthen multi-partner programs, expand services to their peak performance levels and address the 260 per cent increase in HIV.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/06/fijis-hiv-surge-stems-from-a-funding-shortfall/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fijis-hiv-surge-stems-from-a-funding-shortfall	2024-09-05T17:00:00-07:00	
China–Philippines trust in troubled waters	China and the Philippines reached a deal in July 2024 to enable the continuation of Philippine resupply missions at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea. The confrontation reached new heights in June when Manila accused Chinese forces of intercepting Philippine boats, seizing supplies and injuring a Filipino sailor. But the deal has not eased broader tensions as China reportedly fired flares ‘dangerously’ close to Philippine aircraft multiple times in August. The dispute over Second Thomas Shoal — where the security situation has been deteriorating since 2021 — has been a tinderbox in the broader contest in the South China Sea. China has attempted to block the Philippines’ resupply missions to its marines deployed on an old ship that was deliberately grounded on the shoal in 1999 to serve as a Philippine military outpost. After the deal was struck, the Philippines undertook a resupply mission at the Second Thomas Shoal without incident. But while the deal has reduced the rapidly escalating tension between the two countries in the short term, it is not likely to significantly impact the longstanding maritime disputes in the South China Sea between Beijing and Manila. On the contrary, the situation at Second Thomas Shoal can be expected to further deteriorate over time given the deep-seated mistrust between China and the Philippines. Both parties are already disputing the deal’s interpretation, which does not augur well for its durability. The situation at Second Thomas Shoal serves as an indicator reflecting broader China–Philippines disputes in the South China Sea. Any escalation over competing claims to other contested waters will most likely increase tensions at the shoal. Two trends suggest that tensions between China and the Philippines will likely continue to escalate. First, both sides have intensified legal efforts to reinforce their claims in the disputed waters. China has introduced several regulations to justify its actions in the South China Sea. In June 2024, Beijing issued a new maritime rule allowing its coast guard to detain foreign ships and personnel trespassing in its waters for up to 60 days. This builds on a 2021 law permitting the Chinese coast guard to fire on any vessel intruding into its waters. China continues to ignore the 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling which dismissed Beijing’s claims to much of the South China Sea. Manila has also stepped up its legal warfare to reinforce its claims. In June 2024, the Philippines asked the United Nations to register its extended continental shelf claim in the Western Palawan region. Manila is also in the process of introducing the Maritime Zones Act, which aims to reinforce the rights and entitlements of the Philippines over its maritime zones, including in contested areas. The passing of the act has already drawn condemnations from China. The second major trend is the ongoing buildup of military capabilities to counter the other party. China continues to maintain a sizable and permanent military presence in the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone through its military outposts on man-made islands, extending its military power across the South China Sea. The Philippines has modernised its military to avoid being left behind, acquiring anti-ship missile capabilities and stepping up joint exercises with its traditional security partner, the United States, as well as other like-minded partners. Philippine President Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr’s administration has also worked to broaden the Philippines’ strategic partnerships, pushing through new defence agreements with Germany and Japan in 2024. The latter is especially significant. The Reciprocal Access Agreement with Japan allows Japanese forces deployed in the Philippines to participate in expanded exercises and potentially deal with humanitarian and disaster relief. The agreement has drawn criticism from Beijing, fearing that it is part of a broader regional trend of defence agreements targeted against China. The interactions between Chinese and Philippine forces on the ground threaten to derail efforts to build trust and work towards a resolution in the contested waters. The Philippines has accused China of dangerous conduct in the South China Sea multiple times through August 2024, beginning when Chinese combat aircraft reportedly performed dangerous manoeuvres against a Philippine Air Force plane on routine patrol in the South China Sea. This incident marked an escalation in tensions as China had not targeted Philippine aircraft previously. Though the two parties have set up a hotline at their respective presidential offices, it will do little to de-escalate tensions if China does not use it. These legal and military trends reflect a deep mistrust between China and the Philippines. Both countries’ efforts to reinforce their claims through assertive diplomatic and political strategies will likely lay the foundation for a greater escalation of tensions in the medium and long term. While the agreement over resupply missions at the Second Thomas Shoal may provide temporary relief, it fails to address the fundamental drivers of these tensions in an increasingly contested strategic environment.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/05/china-philippines-trust-in-troubled-waters/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=china-philippines-trust-in-troubled-waters	2024-09-05T05:00:00-07:00
