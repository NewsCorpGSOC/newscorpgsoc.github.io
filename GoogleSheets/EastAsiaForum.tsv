Japan–Philippines defence deal reflects regional security dynamics	On 8 July 2024, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Secretary of National Defence of the Philippines, along with their Japanese counterparts, signed the Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) during the second Japan–Philippines 2+2 Foreign and Defence Ministerial Meeting in Manila. The aim of the agreement is to strengthen bilateral defence cooperation through joint military exercises and training and address shared security concerns — particularly the perceived threat from China and the worsening security situation in the South China Sea.&nbsp; The RAA is Japan’s first defence pact with a Southeast Asian state, following similar agreements with Australia and the United Kingdom in 2022 and 2023 respectively. But the RAA between Japan and the Philippines is mainly focused on maritime security and the protection of sea lanes in the South China Sea, in contrast to those with Australia and the United Kingdom, which broadly address Indo-Pacific strategic cooperation. Compared to Australia and the United Kingdom, which have stronger military capabilities, the Philippines is more vulnerable to regional threats. The Marcos government considers the RAA a critical component of the Philippines’ national security policy as it provides a strategic counterweight to its weaker position. The RAA also represents an important turning point in the evolution of bilateral relations between the two nations, which began with the normalisation of diplomatic ties in 1956, following Japan’s brutal occupation of the Philippines during the Second World War. The agreement signifies the evolution of relations from wartime enemies to close security partners. The fact that the Philippines, which suffered terribly during the occupation, has signed such a defence arrangement with Japan demonstrates the success of the post-war reconciliation process. The RAA has significant implications for the US-led security framework. Traditionally, regional security has relied on bilateral alliances with the United States. But the RAA, along with other similar minilateral arrangements, signifies a shift to a more multilateral approach in which US allies are increasingly collaborating among themselves. The traditional ‘hub-and-spokes’ system is reconfiguring into a more flexible alliance network. The RAA significantly benefits the Philippines by enhancing security cooperation through a legal framework for the increased deployment of Japan&#8217;s Self-Defense Forces in the Philippines. This could serve as a deterrent to potential aggressors, particularly in light of escalating tensions with China. Joint exercises and training programs supported by the RAA will also enhance the capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, particularly in disaster response, maritime security and anti-terrorism. This may pave the way for further defence technology transfer and collaboration, considerably boosting the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ modernisation. The RAA also further strengthens strategic alignment between the Philippines and Japan, both concerned about China&#8217;s growing aggression in the South China Sea. This alignment would contribute to establishing a more robust regional security architecture that includes like-minded countries such as the United States and Australia. It is crucial to acknowledge that the RAA is not without risks. One potential consequence is that China might view it as part of a broader encirclement strategy to limit its regional influence, which could escalate tensions between the Philippines and China. Plus, reliance on Japan and other foreign military powers for security raises concerns about the possible erosion of Philippine sovereignty, especially if it results in a substantial foreign military presence on Philippine territory. There is also the risk that the Philippines may become entangled in the strategic objectives of Japan and, by extension, the United States, which would limit its ability to make independent security and foreign policy decisions. Domestically, the RAA faces opposition from groups wary of foreign intervention. The left-wing Makabayan Bloc in the Philippine Congress contended that the agreement signifies a resurgence of Japan&#8217;s hegemonic ambitions in the region, driven by US imperialism. They also claimed that the signing of the RAA perpetuates a pattern of ‘historical amnesia’, showing disregard for the traumatic history and unresolved injustices of the past. While the legacy of historical injustices — such as the comfort women issue — remains contentious, it is important to acknowledge that Japan’s current defence policies are focused on maintaining regional security, not on repeating past aggressions. The RAA, alongside other key developments, represents an important step in the region&#8217;s security framework. It establishes the legal groundwork for Japan and the Philippines to conduct operations in each other’s territories, signalling a united effort to counter China&#8217;s military assertiveness in the South China Sea, potentially with US support. But the RAA might also exacerbate the security dilemma in the region, as China may see the growing military cooperation between the Philippines and Japan as a threat and move to increase its own military presence and capabilities. To prevent escalation and mitigate this risk, all parties involved must engage in continuous diplomatic dialogue and confidence-building measures. This approach will ensure that the RAA serves as a stabilising force rather than a catalyst for increased tensions.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/09/japan-philippines-defence-deal-reflects-regional-security-dynamics/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=japan-philippines-defence-deal-reflects-regional-security-dynamics	2024-09-09T05:08:07-07:00	
Thailand’s establishment strikes another blow against democracy	On 7 August 2024, the Constitutional Court of Thailand dissolved the Move Forward Party (MFP) and banned its executives from politics for 10 years. A week later, prime minister Srettha Thavisin was dismissed. These episodes marked the return of autocratic politics after a brief period of democratisation. The 2023 Thai elections were supposed to restore hopes of democracy after nearly a decade of military-led rule following the 2014 coup. The forced dissolution of a major party, the removal of a sitting prime minister and another looming cabinet reshuffle have extinguished optimism that Thailand could return to a democratic path, or at least achieve some sort of political stability. The court ruling was handed down to the country’s most popular party on the basis that it sought to amend the country’s lese majeste (offence to majesty) law. Critics have long argued that the law has been used to silence and punish political opposition rather than to protect the monarchical institution. While the ruling was widely expected, the court’s decision to eliminate the largest political bloc in the Thai parliament was a devastating blow to democracy. This follows a familiar pattern. Just a few years prior, the MFP’s predecessor, the Future Forward Party, succumbed to the same fate. The Future Forward Party rose quickly in prominence, becoming the third most popular party in the 2019 elections a year after its founding. The party’s anti-establishment policies and branding captured the hearts and minds of young and progressive Thais who embraced the prospect of a more equal, open and inclusive Thailand and saw the Future Forward Party as a conduit for structural change. Thailand’s political conservatives saw the new party as a major threat to the status quo, wherein the military and the monarchy maintain prominence, and mounted a ‘judicial coup’ to dissolve the party. The MFP — a more radical and popular successor — represented an even bigger threat to the power of these political conservatives. The irony of the MFP’s downfall was that it occurred under the leadership of the ruling Pheu Thai Party, its former ally, whose predecessors had also suffered the same fate. Following the 2006 coup, which dislodged one of Thailand’s most popular prime ministers, Thaksin Shinawatra, his party Thai Rak Thai and its successor Palang Prachachon were also dissolved. Pheu Thai, having ditched the MFP to form a coalition with conservative parties, then saw to it that the MFP would cease to exist. The MFP became Pheu Thai’s biggest rival after Pheu Thai unexpectedly came second to the MFP’s first-place finish in the 2023 elections. The ruling party’s leadership figures blamed its loss of popularity on the party’s poor use of social media and diminished brand appeal. Pheu Thai’s survival in the electoral arena would depend on weakening the MFP’s support base. The MFP, now transformed into the People’s Party, managed to retain all 143 of its members of parliament under the new party banner — a feat the Future Forward Party failed to achieve. The party’s dissolution infuriated Thais beyond its support base and angered some of the country’s closest allies. The real test for the People’s Party will be harnessing voter frustration and redirecting their grievances towards the next election, which could be some time away. Pheu Thai did not escape unscathed. Its leader, prime minister Srettha Thavisin, was dismissed because of an ethics probe widely believed to be politically motivated. Conspiracy theories abound as to why Srettha was targeted, ranging from speculation about a ‘deal’ with Thaksin to install his daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra, to Thailand’s royalist-military political establishment needing Paetongtarn as a ‘political hostage’ to keep Thaksin in line. Either way, Pheu Thai — already struggling to lead its nine-party governing coalition — was beleaguered by the ordeal. The Senate and the Constitutional Court — nominally understood as bulwarks of democracy and institutional protection against the tyranny of the majority — rarely serve their purposes in Thailand. The upper house was cleverly set up to serve the interests of the military junta, which appointed its 250 members after the 2014 coup. It successfully blocked the MFP from coming to power after the 2023 election and has historically stood in the way of democratically elected governments. The Constitutional Court has long engaged in autocratic judicial activism by intervening in democratic processes, including undermining elections and the rule of law. Its politicisation has led the judicial system as a whole to lose its popular legitimacy as an institution serving the people’s interests. Most Thais no longer trust the Constitutional Court to be impartial, transparent or just and would not count on it to uphold the interests of the people. Its interventions against the MFP and Pheu Thai on dubious legal grounds have shown yet again the outsized reach of the country’s highest court in matters that can hardly be justified. The new premier, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, is unlikely to restore democracy and the rule of law given her weakened position as the country’s new leader. She has never possessed democratic ambitions for Thailand. Her government will focus on keeping the coalition together, further developing their signature policies like the Digital Wallet initiative and rebuilding the Pheu Thai brand.

Stability a key legacy of Joko Widodo’s problematic presidency	After a decade in power, Joko Widodo leaves Indonesia a changed country — one that has benefited from healthy economic growth and has greater international standing. But whether the changes in Indonesia are all for the better or mainly for the worse is very much in the eye of the beholder and depends significantly on which element of the outgoing president’s legacy one chooses to emphasise. His administration’s policies have undeniably lifted the living standards of many millions of Indonesians and bolstered the nation’s international influence. He has presided over Indonesia’s shift onto a new economic plane — one where the priorities of escaping the middle-income trap are as urgent an agenda item as dealing with the challenges of extreme poverty — and seen Jakarta claim a&nbsp;greater role in international affairs&nbsp;as an advocate for developing-country interests. A notable achievement in Widodo’s second term was Indonesia’s chairing of the G20 Summit at a difficult time, though it did less well in strategically positioning ASEAN when Indonesia chaired it in 2023. A fair assessment of his legacy must give credit to the technocrats — most prominently his high-performing, tough-as-nails finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, but also others like Retno Marsudi in Foreign Affairs and Basuki Hadimuljono in Infrastructure&nbsp;— who have done much of the intellectual and bureaucratic grunt work behind the presidential photo ops. It also demands acknowledging the risks arising from the fiscal legacy of Widodo’s infrastructure spending spree, the unaddressed challenges of institutional reform that Widodo leaves his successor with and the&nbsp;continued indulgence of national protectionist reflexes&nbsp;that afflict key parts of the policymaking apparatus.&nbsp; But it is the erosion of the institutional achievements of the reformasi movement — a movement aimed at dismantling the legacies of Suharto’s thirty-year dictatorship — that unquestionably casts a shadow over Widodo’s legacy, as Liam Gammon writes in this week’s lead article. With six weeks to go until he hands over power to his successor Prabowo Subianto, says Gammon, ‘Widodo has used the wave of local elections scheduled for November 2024 as a way to shape the political landscape of the first Prabowo term in his favour’. Widodo understands ‘the potential utility of a prominent governorship as a launching pad for the presidency, but also the power of subnational officials in press-ganging neighbourhood and village level officials into getting out the vote for national-level candidates’. A key goal recently has been to frustrate the ambitions of opposition figure Anies Baswedan from mounting a political comeback in the Jakarta gubernatorial election, which has prompted criticism from progressives that Widodo has crossed a line into authoritarian political tactics of disqualifying political rivals. How does Indonesia’s inching towards the grey zone between democracy and authoritarianism affect its regional leadership role? An important point is that even in the plausible scenario that the Prabowo presidency sees an accretion of presidential power beyond Widodo’s, Indonesia will still remain home to a technocratic intelligentsia based in its universities, think tanks and media who don’t feel obliged to parrot the government line, but can freely propose and debate ideas about Indonesia’s approach to its development challenges and its international policy agenda. The relatively open intellectual environment in Indonesia, despite the pressure on many other aspects of its democracy, is a resource for the whole region. ASEAN is at a crucial moment, facing the need to upgrade its institutions and policy agenda to shore up its importance as the fulcrum of multilateral cooperation in East Asia. Indonesian engagement with this effort is necessary to its success, but Prabowo’s attention to ASEAN can’t be assumed. During his first presidential term, Prabowo’s attention to ASEAN issues will not be forced by Indonesia having the chair of the grouping. It will be the job of Indonesia’s foreign policy thinkers, as well as Indonesia’s international partners, to hammer home the message to the Prabowo administration that taking up a leadership role within ASEAN isn’t too small a job for Indonesia but a crucial opportunity, even as it preens its self-image as a great power in waiting. The region will certainly need Indonesian engagement in the coming years to keep any effort at ASEAN reform on-track and the fundamental stability of Indonesia’s politics is an asset in this regard. Malaysia is also at risk of losing focus on ASEAN’s importance to its own national and political interests ahead of its chair year in 2025 as Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim deals with ideological distractions. The Philippines’ chair year in 2026 may be coloured by its establishment’s ambivalence towards ASEAN as it leans into its alliance relationship with the United States in response to its stoush with China in the South China Sea. For ASEAN, the silver lining of the Widodo-era politics is a robust stability that can be mobilised by Indonesia’s foreign policy leadership, inside and outside of government, to build a consensus that it is the critical platform through which Indonesia can leverage its own national interest as well as apply its energies as a leader of the developing and non-aligned world more broadly.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/09/stability-a-key-legacy-of-joko-widodos-problematic-presidency/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=stability-a-key-legacy-of-joko-widodos-problematic-presidency	2024-09-08T15:00:00-07:00	
Indonesia’s president-elect Prabowo steps back from Widodo’s constitutional shenanigans	With six weeks left in Indonesia’s presidential office, Joko Widodo continues to try tie up loose ends before handing over power to his successor, Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto, on 20 October. But as the political centre of gravity has shifted towards Prabowo, Widodo’s political obsolescence is frustrating his efforts to prolong his family’s power and influence. Widodo has used the wave of local elections scheduled for November 2024 as a way to shape the political landscape of the first Prabowo term in his favour. Widodo, himself a local politician turned president, knows a thing or two about the nexus between local and national politics in Indonesia: not only about the potential utility of a prominent governorship as a launching pad for the presidency but also the power of subnational officials in press-ganging neighbourhood and village level officials into getting out the vote for national-level candidates. One focus of this effort has been the big-ticket gubernatorial election in Jakarta. Widodo used Jakarta’s governorship as a launching pad to his presidency in 2014. The previous governor, Anies Baswedan, used the same position to become Indonesia’s de facto opposition leader during Widodo’s presidency and to position himself for an electoral challenge to Prabowo in the February 2024 presidential elections. Polls suggest that Anies would easily have been returned to the governorship if he ran in November, and that would position him as a strong candidate to either run against Prabowo in the 2029 presidential elections, or to run with him as vice-presidential candidate if Prabowo chose to dump the incumbent, Widodo’s son Gibran Rakabuming, from his ticket that year. Widodo’s interest is in stopping Anies’ political comeback in its tracks. Anies had assembled a coalition of parties that had more than the 25 per cent of seats in the local legislature that election laws set as the benchmark to be eligible to run. But in response to pressure from the Widodo administration, Anies’ party allies one by one defected to a government-aligned candidate, former West Java governor Ridwan Kamil, ahead of the nomination deadline on 29 August. Anies’ path to a comeback was seemingly cut off, but a surprise Constitutional Court decision lowered the nomination threshold, allowing him to run with the nomination of only one party. The national parliament then rapidly drafted emergency legislation that effectively reversed the Court’s decision — and confirmed a related court ruling that lowered age limits on contesting local office to allow Widodo’s 29 year old second son, Kaesang Pangarep, to run in the November local polls. Progressives reacted on social media and on the streets of cities around the country with fury to the parliament’s defiance of the Constitutional Court and its manipulation of electoral rules in the Widodo dynasty’s favour. To the surprise of many, the parliament backed away from its legislation. But Anies’ hopes of running were nevertheless dashed after his one remaining supporter, the PDI-P party, declined to nominate him despite the Court opening up the legal right to do so, likely worrying that the government would strip it of the parliamentary speakership as payback. Though civil society scored a rare victory in stopping the emergency election legislation, it wasn’t a case of all’s well that ends well. The Widodo government’s determination to thwart Anies’ comeback highlights potential hazards to Indonesia’s democracy that arise from the combination of its election laws and the overbearing presidency that Widodo has normalised over the past decade. The oversized party coalitions that Indonesian presidents form to support their governments have been described as a political cartels, whose members compete at election times, only to collude afterwards to share the spoils of patronage and manipulate electoral rules to limit the viability of new entrants to the system. What caused such alarm in Indonesian civil society about the campaign to thwart Anies’ comeback was how it represented an unprecedented effort to enforce compliance with a classic cartelistic goal of blocking a competitor’s ability to enter the arena. The crucial ingredient has been that mainstay of Widodo-era governance — behind-the-scenes coercion — with media investigations detailing how Widodo’s coalition partners were deterred from backing the obvious frontrunner for the Jakarta governorship by veiled threats from the presidential palace of legal prosecutions and loss of opportunities for patronage. This is a troubling precedent for a democracy that, for all its illiberal tendencies, is still marked by free and fair electoral competition. Indonesia also applies a system of nomination thresholds in presidential campaigns that, in theory, could be exploited by an unscrupulous president to keep opponents off the ballot. These scenarios may be still well over the horizon. The focus of the Indonesian press now is on speculation about how Prabowo’s interests and tactics are diverging from the incumbent’s in the twilight of the Widodo administration. Prabowo seems, for instance, to have been instrumental in lobbying for the parliament to abort its attempt to reverse the Constitutional Court decision on local election eligibility, as well as in opposing efforts to get Widodo’s second son Kaesang a local government candidacy. With the presidency almost in his grasp, Prabowo has drawn a line around his willingness to back Widodo in controversial stratagems in which Prabowo has little at stake personally. Prabowo is no defender of freewheeling electoral competition — he is the cartel politician extraordinaire. Indeed, after his election victory he has flagged his ambition to bring every party into his governing coalition, recently invoking the Suharto-era trope that the very idea of rivalry between government and opposition is something intrinsically alien to Indonesian culture. Observers wary of Prabowo’s democratic bona fides will worry that the rhetorical and ideological foundation for curtailing electoral competition is already being laid.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/08/indonesias-president-elect-prabowo-steps-back-from-widodos-constitutional-shenanigans/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=indonesias-president-elect-prabowo-steps-back-from-widodos-constitutional-shenanigans	2024-09-08T05:00:00-07:00	
Taiwan must tighten the lid on China’s misinformation campaigns	In the days leading up to Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te’s inauguration on 20 May 2024, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;quiet. But the silence did not last long. On 23 May, the PLA’s Eastern Theatre Command&nbsp;embarked&nbsp;on Joint Sword-2024A — a joint-military drill involving the Army, Navy, Airforce and rocket force that surrounded Taiwan and showcased Beijing’s firepower.&nbsp; The main purpose of the military exercise is retribution. It represents Beijing’s displeasure towards&nbsp;President Lai’s inauguration&nbsp;ceremony, which undermined China’s long-held ‘One China’ principle. Compared to his predecessor President Tsai Ing-wen, who&nbsp;adopted&nbsp;more ambiguous terms like ‘mainland’ or the ‘other side of the Strait’, Lai is far more&nbsp;assertive&nbsp;and has&nbsp;explicitly&nbsp;referred to China as China. In response, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office called President Lai a dangerous separatist, condemning his&nbsp;hardline tendencies&nbsp;that will only bring ‘war and destruction to the island’.&nbsp; But Beijing’s wrath did not end there. Completing its repertoire of grey zone tactics, the PLA has&nbsp;released&nbsp;a dramatic video that simulates an all-out-invasion of Taiwan. Complete with special effects, the video not only amplifies the intended coercive effects of its joint military exercises, but also highlights the vital role of influence operations in Beijing’s efforts to achieve reunification. If the developments surrounding Lai’s inauguration are an indicator of the trajectory of cross-strait relations, it only points to the continued&nbsp;normalisation&nbsp;of Beijing’s escalatory and coercive actions against the self-governed island. Influence operations will also become even more central to China’s mission to&nbsp;legitimise&nbsp;its jurisdiction over Taiwan. By co-opting and penetrating the psyche of its domestic population, Beijing aims to ultimately&nbsp;undermine&nbsp;public&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in Taiwan towards its political institutions. Fortunately, Taiwan has&nbsp;strong stamina&nbsp;when it comes to countering China-sponsored influence operations. After years of experiencing China’s disinformation and misinformation campaigns, the island is home to a vibrant network of traditional media and civil society groups.&nbsp; But&nbsp;the aftermath of Taiwan’s January 2024 election offers fresh lessons that underscore the enormity and sophistication of China’s evolving influence operations. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) took centre stage during Taiwan’s election season. A smear campaign that used generative AI videos to target former president Tsai-Ing Wen circulated on TikTok and Instagram. According to Taiwan AI Labs, 3.5 per cent of the top 200 videos reshared on Facebook in 2023 were found to be automatically generated using text-to-speech and AI. Conventional fact-checking techniques employed by Taiwanese media organisations and civil society groups could hardly keep up with all the AI-fabricated audio and video content. The mass production and proliferation of AI-generated audio, video and text have&nbsp;overwhelmed&nbsp;fact-checkers, while new malicious content propagates instantaneously.&nbsp; Several high-profile influencers were also posting false information that sought to tamper with the integrity of the election process. Such malicious content has led to a high degree of distrust in Taiwan’s electoral systems and procedures. Given the prevalence of China’s coercive tactics against Taiwan and the rapid explosion of generative AI and algorithmic bias, combined with the unpredictable headwinds in today’s geopolitics, Taiwan needs to reboot its counter-influence operations toolkit.&nbsp; Taiwan should encourage its leading tech companies to increase participation in global technical standards setting through formal and informal channels. It should also mobilise civil society groups to proactively participate in multi-stakeholder consultations on emerging technologies like generative AI. For instance, the International Telecommunications Union is currently&nbsp;exploring&nbsp;the development of standards and frameworks to detect deepfakes and other forms of malicious AI-generated media. Taiwanese start-ups and civil society groups can share best practices and lessons learned in fighting state-sponsored influence operations. Because most of the Chinese-linked influence operations propagate faster on social media platforms before being amplified in mainstream media, Taiwan must explore more stringent options to regulate digital platforms to enhance transparency, especially during elections.&nbsp; It would be strategic for Taiwan to reframe the prevailing narratives that it is a mere pawn of the US–China rivalry or that there is only a binary choice of having peace or war in the Taiwan Strait. In highlighting its role as a major economic and semiconductor powerhouse, Taiwan can strengthen its democratic identity and its right to engage and participate in international debates on pertinent issues like regulating AI, reducing carbon emissions and even fighting election-related influence operations.&nbsp; By rebooting its narrative beyond the binaries, Taiwan may help reduce tensions across the Strait and sustain or even open new avenues for regional cooperation.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/07/taiwan-must-tighten-the-lid-on-chinas-misinformation-campaigns/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=taiwan-must-tighten-the-lid-on-chinas-misinformation-campaigns	2024-09-07T05:00:00-07:00	
Recharging Southeast Asia’s energy security strategy	Ensuring energy security is becoming increasingly crucial in Southeast Asia as the region navigates its transition towards a clean energy future. This is not an easy task, particularly for fast-growing Southeast Asian economies with rising demand for energy.&nbsp;At the heart of this challenge lies growing concerns over gas import dependence. Historically, gas has been a crucial component of Southeast Asia’s electricity supply. In 2023, it accounted for roughly 30 per cent of electricity generated, making it the second-largest source of electricity in the region after coal. Led by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, the region is currently developing&nbsp;over 100&nbsp;gigawatts (GW)&nbsp;of gas power capacity. This capacity is approximately equivalent to the United Kingdom’s total installed capacity in 2023. Southeast Asia’s push for gas generation occurs against the backdrop of declining local gas production, mainly due to the gradual depletion of mature fields and the sparse discovery of commercially viable new reserves. Since the mid-2010s the region has seen a steady decline in gas production, with a&nbsp;significant&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;reduction in 2022 compared to the previous year. Proven gas reserves also declined by&nbsp;4.9&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;in 2022 to 3.98 trillion cubic metres. As local gas production diminishes, large energy-consuming countries in the region have started to bolster their liquefied natural gas (LNG) import capabilities. In 2023, Vietnam and the Philippines inaugurated their&nbsp;first LNG import terminals. In Thailand, LNG imports surged by&nbsp;40&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;in 2023 to 11.55 million tonnes despite efforts to diversify fuel sources and reduce reliance on LNG imports. Across Southeast Asia, LNG facilities with a combined capacity of 47 million tonnes are currently under development. If completed, they will boost the region’s LNG import capacity by&nbsp;80&nbsp;per cent. Malaysia, one of the world’s&nbsp;largest LNG exporters, is poised to consider&nbsp;redirecting LNG&nbsp;from its gas fields around Bintulu, Sarawak — currently exported to Asian neighbours — to meet fast-growing domestic demand. This move aligns with the country’s emphasis, articulated in&nbsp;the&nbsp;National Energy Transition Roadmap, on&nbsp;using gas as a vital ‘transitional fuel’ to uphold energy security and affordability while advancing its&nbsp;decarbonisation&nbsp;goals. If the current trend continues, Southeast Asia is set to become a net gas&nbsp;importer&nbsp;as early as 2025. By 2045, its import dependence could reach&nbsp;93&nbsp;per cent, posing a major risk to energy security. Battery storage can be a strategic hedge against future gas risks for Southeast Asia.&nbsp;By providing&nbsp;fast and responsive support to balance the grid when renewable generation fluctuates, either exceeding or falling short of electricity demand,&nbsp;battery storage can&nbsp;reduce the&nbsp;region’s dependence on&nbsp;imported&nbsp;gas for both baseload power and flexibility.&nbsp;This, in turn, could help mitigate exposure to&nbsp;global energy market fluctuations, improving energy independence&nbsp;and security. The 1.5 degree-aligned&nbsp;transition pathways&nbsp;outlined by the International Renewable Energy Agency forecasts a need for over 600 GW of battery storage capacity in Southeast Asia by 2050. This capacity is essential to support the integration of variable renewable energy and reduce reliance on fossil fuel-based generation. The declining costs of battery storage have made large-scale deployment increasingly economically viable.&nbsp;Over the past decade, the price of lithium-ion battery packs has witnessed a significant decrease,&nbsp;dropping by 14&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;year-on-year to US$139 per kilowatt hour (kWh)&nbsp;in 2023, compared to US$780 per kWh in 2013.&nbsp; Falling raw material prices, combined with reduced margins for producers amid fierce competition, drove battery prices down further in 2024. This led to a halving of cell prices in China, where over&nbsp;70&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;of&nbsp;the world’s batteries are made.&nbsp;Further technological innovation and manufacturing improvements are expected to drive battery prices&nbsp;even lower. The attractiveness of battery storage is enhanced by the region’s abundant reserves of&nbsp;crucial battery minerals&nbsp;like nickel, cobalt and manganese. By leveraging these advantages, the deployment of battery storage could catalyse local manufacturing, contributing to the region’s aspiration of becoming a clean tech manufacturing hub. But battery storage has&nbsp;yet to be&nbsp;fully&nbsp;integrated into current&nbsp;policy frameworks in Southeast Asia. Apart from sporadic installations of battery storage in conjunction with distributed solar farms, no significant efforts have been made to support the large-scale deployment of battery storage across the region.&nbsp; In&nbsp;Vietnam&nbsp;— often hailed as a success story in renewable deployment within the region —&nbsp;most&nbsp;wind and solar projects are&nbsp;not paired&nbsp;with battery storage systems. Malaysia’s large-scale solar auctions have similarly&nbsp;not attracted&nbsp;any solar power projects incorporating battery storage, primarily because&nbsp;no specific incentives for battery storage apply to such projects.&nbsp; Historical precedents highlight the profound impacts of international gas market volatility, spanning from soaring prices to supply disruptions. Such instability can significantly hinder economic growth and exacerbate deep-seated sociopolitical tensions and conflicts.&nbsp; Southeast Asia needs a backup plan. Battery storage should be a crucial component of that plan, offering an effective hedge against future gas risks. This strategy would support the region in attaining its climate aspirations while ensuring a secure and affordable energy supply.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/07/recharging-southeast-asias-energy-security-strategy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=recharging-southeast-asias-energy-security-strategy	2024-09-06T23:00:00-07:00	
Deterrence alone cannot prevent war in the Asia Pacific	As tensions rise in the Pacific, the United States and its allies remain committed to peace via deterrence. While many credit the strategy with achieving a peaceful 21st century in the region, it has also contributed to Asia’s current tensions. If left unchecked, China, the United States and other regional actors may fall further into a security dilemma, in which each party is driven to militarise to keep their rapidly militarising rivals from gaining an advantage. For peace to persist, the United States and its allies should beware of overreliance on a deterrence mindset that perpetuates the security dilemma. An approach that balances deterrence with restraint-based strategies can ease tensions and bring us closer to peace. While the United States’ ability to inflict unacceptable costs on China may have played a role in the absence of warfare in the 21st century, this power imbalance also brought the region to its current precarious state. China’s military ascent began in the 1990s, spurred by the Gulf War, which exposed its potential vulnerability against technologically advanced Western forces. Its rate of increase in military spending shot up again after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, which raised alarms in China over the implications for China during a potential Taiwan or North Korea conflict and provided a ‘rhetorical cover’ for Chinese militarism. Significant developments in Chinese technology, the People’s Liberation Army Navy and mainland missile systems have made China much more competitive against a &#8216;strong enemy’. While a hegemonic United States might have deterred some Chinese aggression, it has also encouraged China’s militarisation, bringing us to the present moment. To meet the threat China poses, the United States and its allies are improving their military capabilities and escalating the security dilemma. When China builds new military outposts in the South China Sea, it can be interpreted as either a ‘necessary national defence’ measure or an expansion of offensive capabilities. Similarly, when US military units transit near these outposts, it could be seen as upholding free navigation in international waters or threatening Chinese sovereignty in its territory. Chinese assertiveness either justifies deepening military ties between the United States, Japan and the Philippines or is justified by a United States-led effort to contain China. In the security dilemma, each side sees its rival as aggressive and sees itself as defensive. The United States can no longer deter China with overwhelming military superiority, but instead with the threat of a mutually disastrous war between nuclear powers with devastating economic and social consequences for the entire world. This new reality requires efforts to de-escalate tensions, build trust and demonstrate a genuine desire for peace. While challenging, the United States and its allies can take steps to slow the security dilemma. If Washington and its partners intend to strengthen their military capabilities, they should do so with defence in mind. The Biden administration’s support for Taiwanese aircraft, ships and air defence systems is an improvement over the Trump administration’s long-range missile sales, which have the potential to strike the Chinese mainland. The ‘porcupine strategy’, which utilises short-range weaponry to target ships and aircraft, signals fortitude against an invasion without threatening the mainland. Where feasible, the United States should apply such principles to its military support to signal resolve without aggression. While recent years have not been kind to the ‘rules-based order’, institutions and agreements are another way to reverse the security dilemma. While Chinese non-compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is frustrating, UNCLOS does not address the root cause of dangerous naval confrontations — overlapping territorial claims between China, Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Japan. Accidental escalations are common in many war scenarios, making it crucial for the United States to lead efforts to resolve disputes diplomatically. While a diplomatic solution would be an ambitious undertaking and likely require concessions to China, the potential benefits would be significant. Establishing clear rules and boundaries can prevent dangerous situations where each side thinks it is acting in self-defence. Good-faith negotiations would also signal that the United States is willing to accept a powerful China as a legitimate and influential regional and global actor, easing fears in Beijing that the United States seeks to contain it. The ‘free world’ should also ensure careful and honest communications about countries&#8217; actions on both sides of the growing geopolitical conflict. The United States and its allies should meticulously outline the logic behind their actions, explaining to China how these steps are intended to promote peace, not war. Governments and civil society must also resist framing the conflict as a battle between ‘good and evil’, as this only exacerbates existing tensions. Instead, politicians and other observers should contextualise Chinese actions within the growing security dilemma and address Chinese concerns in good faith. An overreliance on deterrence has brought the United States and its allies to the brink of war. To avoid the worst-case scenario, governments and civil society must develop policies that signal a desire for peace and compromise, balancing deterrence with restraint.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/07/deterrence-alone-cannot-prevent-war-in-the-asia-pacific/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=deterrence-alone-cannot-prevent-war-in-the-asia-pacific	2024-09-06T17:00:00-07:00	
Where are the women in Indonesia’s energy transition?	The term ‘energy transition’ has become increasingly popular in recent years to describe government-mandated green policies. Before, terms like ‘decarbonisation’ and ‘low carbon development’ dominated global policy discourses. This shift reflects ongoing efforts at global and national levels to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, which are linked to significant environmental issues. Like many other countries, Indonesia has long demonstrated a commitment to reducing carbon emissions. Law No. 31 of 2009 mandated the government to engage in climate change mitigation and adaptation activities, including tracking greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2016, the Indonesian government has set official targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions across various sectors by ratifying the Paris Agreement. Advanced measures remain necessary, as Indonesia is among the top three countries most at risk of extreme weather events and climate-related disasters. Climate-related flooding in Indonesia’s coastal areas has caused severe impacts, including the destruction of assets and livelihoods. This situation places economically disadvantaged groups in even more precarious positions, as they lack the adaptive capacities to recover quickly. The transition from fossil fuels must also be managed in a way that supports affected communities to prevent increased inequality. This is crucial given Indonesia’s role as a major global coal producer. In 2023, coal production surged to 770.85 million tonnes, a 12.4 per cent increase from the previous year. The fossil fuel sector is a vital source of employment, directly employing 250,000 workers in coal mining in 2020. In coal-producing regions like East Kalimantan, about 11 per cent of the workforce is engaged in coal-related employment. The adverse impacts of energy transitions are often disproportionately borne by women. Although there is still a lack of publicly available data in the Indonesian context, women in the Global South face the harshest impacts of coal mine closures, as these typically occur in regions where gender relations are marked by unequal economic development. Key impacts include increased rates of gender-based violence due to mass unemployment, a worsening of the ‘triple burden’ of paid labour, unpaid labour and childcare imposed on women, as well as decreased access to essential health and childcare services. Though women are often disproportionately impacted by the energy transition, considerations around gender within energy policymaking remains inadequate. In 2023, the Just Energy Transition Partnership Secretariat released a comprehensive document outlining the investment and policy blueprint for Indonesia’s energy transition. The blueprint emphasises the necessity of equitably distributing risks and opportunities in alignment with human rights, accountability and gender equality principles. This framework corresponds with Presidential Instruction No. 9 of 2000, which mandates the incorporation of gender considerations into the planning, implementation, and monitoring of development policies and programs. The guideline for the formulation of the National Energy Plan and Regional Energy Plan states that their development will involve individuals with knowledge or expertise in energy. Policymakers — especially local governments — typically interpret this as involving a team of experts for data collection, including focus group discussions with the community. But a recent study reveals that sex-disaggregated data was not required for data collection, so the analysis behind energy plans cannot fully comprehend the needs and challenges faced by different segments of the population. Women remain significantly underrepresented in the energy sector, constituting only five per cent of decision-makers in 2022. The lack of specific mechanisms to increase women’s participation in energy policymaking will likely perpetuate gender blindness in programs aimed at a just energy transition, as numerous barriers still hinder women from participating meaningfully. In many communities, societal expectations confine women to domestic roles while men manage public affairs. As a result, women are often neither invited nor allowed to formally participate in governance processes. Meeting spaces often lack considerations that facilitate women’s participation, such as accommodating their paid and unpaid work schedules. Lessons from other countries show that women are crucial advocates for innovative solutions in just transitions. For instance, in Morocco, women&#8217;s active involvement in a concentrating solar power project led to the creation of communal drainage and irrigation channels for the land affected by the construction, rather than cash compensation that would have primarily benefited only the male landowners. Women&#8217;s extensive experience within the household in terms of water, food and energy management tend to effectively address related issues at both household and community levels. &nbsp; A similar trend is evident in Indonesia, where women spend 2.8 times more on unpaid household work than men. Hence, strongly engaging women in just transitions will ensure their insights — such as improving energy accessibility for household appliances — are incorporated, freeing up time for productive economic activities rather than adding to their burdens. As Indonesia aims for net zero emissions by 2060, the energy transition should do more than reduce fossil fuels dependency — it is also a pivotal opportunity to enhance the quality of life for the entire population. Gender equality and a just energy transition are interconnected goals, both striving for the fair and equitable distribution of the benefits arising from development and progress. To achieve this, specific mechanisms must be established to ensure women’s meaningful participation in the policy process, including planning and design. By doing so, Indonesia can harness the full potential of its population, fostering an inclusive and sustainable energy transition.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/06/where-are-the-women-in-indonesias-energy-transition/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=where-are-the-women-in-indonesias-energy-transition	2024-09-06T05:00:00-07:00	
Okinawans must not be overlooked in new US–Japan counter-crime forum	On 22 July 2024, US Forces Japan Commander Lieutenant General Ricky Rupp&nbsp;announced&nbsp;the&nbsp;creation&nbsp;of a new joint US–Japan forum to address the endemic issue of crimes committed off base by US military personnel stationed in Okinawa — particularly sex crimes. How Rupp’s forum will differ from the&nbsp;Cooperative Working Team&nbsp;established in October 2000 to address similar concerns is not clear. The Cooperative Working Team met 27 times until petering out in April 2017. It brought together representatives from the US military and government, Japanese foreign and defence ministries, the Okinawan prefectural government and police, as well as members of the prefecture’s chambers of commerce and bar association. Since its dissolution, active-duty US servicemen in Okinawa have committed&nbsp;several well-documented&nbsp;rapes, abductions and assaults — including against children.&nbsp; The task force must acknowledge Okinawan elected officials’ right to immediate and accurate information about crimes US soldiers commit. This fundamental step does not require changing existing protocols. Instead, it requires that the US government, US military and the Japanese central government adhere to procedures established in the 1997 US–Japan Joint Committee Agreement. This document augmented Okinawans’ rights with regard to Article XVII of the&nbsp;Status of Forces Agreement&nbsp;between the United States and Japan, which&nbsp;concerns jurisdiction over crimes committed on Japanese territory.&nbsp; Notably indiscernible on the Japanese&nbsp;Foreign Ministry website, the Okinawan Prefectural Government wants more publicity for the Agreement’s ‘Notification Channel Details for Okinawa-related Issues’. According to protocol, in the aftermath of a crime committed by a US service member or civilian attached to the US military, the commander responsible must notify the duty officer at command headquarters and the Naha Defence Facilities Administration Bureau.&nbsp; The US side then moves up through military and diplomatic chains of command to the US Embassy in Tokyo, while the Japanese side moves from the Naha-based agency — Okinawa’s capital city — and simultaneously notifies the Okinawan prefectural government, Defence Administration Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Okinawa Office, who then convey information to the Prime Minister’s Office in Tokyo.&nbsp; This&nbsp;did not happen&nbsp;during the first half of 2024, leading Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki to emphasise during his&nbsp;press conference&nbsp;on 7 August at Tokyo’s Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan that he cannot be sure how many crimes he and previous Okinawan prefectural officials have never even learned about.&nbsp; Tamaki accused the Japanese central government of ignoring his right to information about these crimes as Okinawa’s highest elected official. Referencing the 24 December 2023&nbsp;abduction and rape&nbsp;of an Okinawan minor as well as the 26 May 2024&nbsp;sexual assault&nbsp;of an Okinawan woman, Tamaki gave a full explanation of the 1997 Notification Channel Details and the Japanese government’s wilful&nbsp;failure to abide&nbsp;by them. The repetitious nature of the crimes against Okinawan women and girls, and the US and Japanese government’s botched response to them — specifically the failure to notify the Okinawan prefectural government about crimes against their citizens — highlights the need for Commander Rupp’s forum to do something different from the prior Working Team. Reforms are urgent, with a third instance of sexual assault reported on 6 September 2024. Speculation continues concerning Tokyo’s rationale for withholding information from the Governor. The central government may have feared that Okinawans would protest against the dominant presence of the US military, as they did in 1995 following three US servicemen’s abduction and gang rape of an elementary schoolgirl. Such protests could have adversely affected the Okinawa elections held on 16 June 2024. Tokyo’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party wanted victory for the Governor’s opponents in order to resume construction on the unpopular new US base at Henoko, that Tamaki and his supporters blocked.&nbsp;Tamaki&#8217;s opponents won&nbsp;the election, and Tokyo&nbsp;ordered construction of the base&nbsp;to recommence despite ongoing local protests.&nbsp; During the press conference Tamaki also underscored the challenge of overcoming the central government’s perennial disdain for Okinawans’ place in structural matters involving the US–Japan Alliance, despite the centrality of the territory and its people to this calculus. Taking umbrage with Tokyo’s use of ‘privacy’ as justification for not sharing information, Tamaki reiterated his 10 July 2024 Letter of Protest to Japanese Prime Minister Kishida and requested ‘that all crimes, incidents, and accidents involving US military service members and related personnel be reported, without fail, to the prefectural government’. In September, Governor Tamaki will visit Washington to drive home his concerns to members of the US Congress and related bureaucracies. The governor will explain the disproportionate burden he and his constituents bear vis a vis US bases in Japan under the United States’ broader ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy’. Noticeably,&nbsp;this policy&nbsp;emphasises a ‘rules-based order’. For these words to have any meaning at all, the Japanese government and the United States government and military must include Okinawans as equals.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/06/okinawans-must-not-be-overlooked-in-new-us-japan-counter-crime-forum/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=okinawans-must-not-be-overlooked-in-new-us-japan-counter-crime-forum	2024-09-05T23:00:00-07:00	
Fiji’s HIV surge stems from a funding shortfall	In 2024, HIV/AIDS seems to be well and truly back in Fiji. Estimated new infections had been increasing slowly over the past two decades, but rose by 260 per cent from 2010–2022 with a record 415 new cases recorded in 2023. This has risen by a further 552 from January to June of 2024.&nbsp;According to UNAIDS, this spike in newly reported HIV cases makes the severity of this epidemic second only to the Philippines in the Asia Pacific.&nbsp; The Fijian Health Ministry has attributed this increase to a surge in illegal drug usage. In particular, two extremely unsafe practices have been blamed for the increase in HIV infections in Fiji — ‘bluetoothing’ and ‘chem-sex’. But contrary to the assumption that the surge is the result of the drug crisis, a precipitous drop off in funding and research has also been a significant contributor. It is critical to better understand policies, programs and funding developments between 2010 and 2023 in order to explain and respond to the current crisis. Before 2012, the used a combination prevention approach to HIV. Funding had ramped up in 2008 through the HIV and STIs Regional Response Fund, an agreement between AusAID and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) to address HIV and AIDS in the Pacific.&nbsp;The fund supported the SPC-coordinated combined regional HIV and STIs response to ‘support the scale up of the response to HIV and STIs in the Pacific … [to support] effective implementation of regional and national HIV &amp; STI plans, including the capacity building needs identified in those plans’. This funding enabled the use of the joint technical expertise of national, regional and international partners, enforced relevant HIV policies including the 2011 Fiji HIV decree, identified at-risk populations and risky behaviours and funded HIV awareness and response activities. The HIV, AIDS and STI agenda was very visible within the country during this period. In 2013, the HIV Regional Response funding ended. All recipients were informed of this well in advance, and were informed of regional and national strategies for next steps including transitional funds to continue existing activities. Every country was informed of the 2014 grant round of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, where Fiji was to submit its own single-country application.&nbsp; But in 2012 Fiji graduated from lower middle-income to upper middle-income status. This was to have damaging repercussions for its HIV/AIDS national response. The immediate consequence was that Fiji became ineligible to apply to the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS and STI prevention activities, and the single-country application had to be dropped. This led to a drastic decline in HIV/AIDs funding from US$2.3 million in 2011 to US$0.4 million in 2012. Though a combination of international and domestic sources increased HIV funding to US$0.67 million by 2016, the funding never fully recovered. This drop in funding led to drastic budget reductions for HIV/AIDS prevention activities. Media coverage of health promotion and HIV awareness efforts ceased. Services targeting at-risk populations and prevention activities fell off priority lists. In the years since, the country has faced multiple natural disasters, ongoing political instability, chronic under-resourcing of health services and the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the degradation of health infrastructure and workforce stress and further limiting the response. By 2021 it was evident that there were&nbsp;gaps in sexual health knowledge, with only 30 per cent of women and 26 per cent of men aged 15–24 years knowledgeable about HIV prevention. As media and politicians have noted, the past decade has also seen an exponential increase in drug trafficking in the region, with trafficking to Australia and New Zealand via Fiji and Vanuatu contributing to both organised crime and an upsurge in drug consumption. This has clearly resulted in a significant rise in intravenous drug use, sexual violence, transactional sex and other high-risk sexual activity. But this is simply the spark that lit a waiting fuse. Years of underfunding and the deterioration of HIV/AIDS services had left a population unprepared for the storm.&nbsp; Fiji’s country data to February 2024 also illustrates a weak national response to the epidemic so far. The available statistics do not present a clear picture of the current national status, while other critical data to guide the HIV/AIDS national response have not been updated since 2012 when the Regional Response Fund ended. Despite the anecdotal and often sensationalised evidence of the impact of the drug crisis, studies to estimate population sizes and risky behaviours were last conducted in&nbsp;2004–2008, 2011–12 and 2014. There is not sufficient evidence to inform Fiji’s HIV response in 2024. In July 2024 the UN Development Programme and Fiji’s Ministry of Health and Medical Services signed an agreement for 5.4 million Fiji dollars (US$2.4 million) from the Global Fund to jointly address HIV, STIs, hepatitis B and tuberculosis in Fiji. But based on a rapid review of HIV funding from 2008–2016, Fiji would need at least US$10 million to revive, restore and strengthen multi-partner programs, expand services to their peak performance levels and address the 260 per cent increase in HIV.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/06/fijis-hiv-surge-stems-from-a-funding-shortfall/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fijis-hiv-surge-stems-from-a-funding-shortfall	2024-09-05T17:00:00-07:00	
China–Philippines trust in troubled waters	China and the Philippines reached a deal in July 2024 to enable the continuation of Philippine resupply missions at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea. The confrontation reached new heights in June when Manila accused Chinese forces of intercepting Philippine boats, seizing supplies and injuring a Filipino sailor. But the deal has not eased broader tensions as China reportedly fired flares ‘dangerously’ close to Philippine aircraft multiple times in August. The dispute over Second Thomas Shoal — where the security situation has been deteriorating since 2021 — has been a tinderbox in the broader contest in the South China Sea. China has attempted to block the Philippines’ resupply missions to its marines deployed on an old ship that was deliberately grounded on the shoal in 1999 to serve as a Philippine military outpost. After the deal was struck, the Philippines undertook a resupply mission at the Second Thomas Shoal without incident. But while the deal has reduced the rapidly escalating tension between the two countries in the short term, it is not likely to significantly impact the longstanding maritime disputes in the South China Sea between Beijing and Manila. On the contrary, the situation at Second Thomas Shoal can be expected to further deteriorate over time given the deep-seated mistrust between China and the Philippines. Both parties are already disputing the deal’s interpretation, which does not augur well for its durability. The situation at Second Thomas Shoal serves as an indicator reflecting broader China–Philippines disputes in the South China Sea. Any escalation over competing claims to other contested waters will most likely increase tensions at the shoal. Two trends suggest that tensions between China and the Philippines will likely continue to escalate. First, both sides have intensified legal efforts to reinforce their claims in the disputed waters. China has introduced several regulations to justify its actions in the South China Sea. In June 2024, Beijing issued a new maritime rule allowing its coast guard to detain foreign ships and personnel trespassing in its waters for up to 60 days. This builds on a 2021 law permitting the Chinese coast guard to fire on any vessel intruding into its waters. China continues to ignore the 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling which dismissed Beijing’s claims to much of the South China Sea. Manila has also stepped up its legal warfare to reinforce its claims. In June 2024, the Philippines asked the United Nations to register its extended continental shelf claim in the Western Palawan region. Manila is also in the process of introducing the Maritime Zones Act, which aims to reinforce the rights and entitlements of the Philippines over its maritime zones, including in contested areas. The passing of the act has already drawn condemnations from China. The second major trend is the ongoing buildup of military capabilities to counter the other party. China continues to maintain a sizable and permanent military presence in the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone through its military outposts on man-made islands, extending its military power across the South China Sea. The Philippines has modernised its military to avoid being left behind, acquiring anti-ship missile capabilities and stepping up joint exercises with its traditional security partner, the United States, as well as other like-minded partners. Philippine President Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr’s administration has also worked to broaden the Philippines’ strategic partnerships, pushing through new defence agreements with Germany and Japan in 2024. The latter is especially significant. The Reciprocal Access Agreement with Japan allows Japanese forces deployed in the Philippines to participate in expanded exercises and potentially deal with humanitarian and disaster relief. The agreement has drawn criticism from Beijing, fearing that it is part of a broader regional trend of defence agreements targeted against China. The interactions between Chinese and Philippine forces on the ground threaten to derail efforts to build trust and work towards a resolution in the contested waters. The Philippines has accused China of dangerous conduct in the South China Sea multiple times through August 2024, beginning when Chinese combat aircraft reportedly performed dangerous manoeuvres against a Philippine Air Force plane on routine patrol in the South China Sea. This incident marked an escalation in tensions as China had not targeted Philippine aircraft previously. Though the two parties have set up a hotline at their respective presidential offices, it will do little to de-escalate tensions if China does not use it. These legal and military trends reflect a deep mistrust between China and the Philippines. Both countries’ efforts to reinforce their claims through assertive diplomatic and political strategies will likely lay the foundation for a greater escalation of tensions in the medium and long term. While the agreement over resupply missions at the Second Thomas Shoal may provide temporary relief, it fails to address the fundamental drivers of these tensions in an increasingly contested strategic environment.	https://eastasiaforum.org/2024/09/05/china-philippines-trust-in-troubled-waters/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=china-philippines-trust-in-troubled-waters	2024-09-05T05:00:00-07:00
