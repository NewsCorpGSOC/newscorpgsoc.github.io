RedNote walks China’s digital tightrope	RedNote, a once little-known app outside of China, gained international attention in January 2025. When the United States banned TikTok, one million US users flocked to the Chinese-owned platform in just two days. RedNote blends social networking with e-commerce and draws over 3.4 million daily active users. Unexpectedly, RedNote has become a bridge for US–China cultural exchanges. Under the hashtag ‘TikTok refugees’, US and Chinese netizens greet each other, exchange memes and swap outfit tips. Even after US President Donald Trump lifted the TikTok ban, many chose to stay. Experts warn of data and national security risks, but some brush them aside. To these users, Silicon Valley also has privacy abuses, and Washington’s digital Cold War rhetoric is under increasing scrutiny. RedNote’s novelty and rare sense of cross-border connection make it worth staying. In China, Western social media such as Facebook, Instagram and X are inaccessible. Even on Chinese platforms, large-scale interaction between Chinese and international users is nearly impossible. This results from China’s prevailing regulatory model for Chinese social media platforms — ‘one app, two systems’ — one version tailored for domestic users, another for the global market, such as TikTok/Douyin, WeChat/Weixin and Kwai/Kuaishou. The domestic versions adapt to China’s unique legal environment, featuring tighter censorship, screen time limits for minors and localised data storage. Some speculate that China will follow the old playbook, splitting RedNote into two systems to curb foreign influence. But Beijing might reconsider this approach. The ‘one app, two systems’ model is Beijing’s go-to strategy in regulating social media. On the one hand, the government places regime stability above all else. It has hardened information control by erecting internet firewalls, enforcing real-name registration and mandating the display of users’ locations. In doing so, it seeks to seal off domestic users from the global internet, where its reach is limited and uncensored narratives proliferate. On the other hand, China is eager to extend its influence abroad. Social media platforms such as TikTok are treated as cultural exports, subtly shaping how the world views China while advancing its technological and economic ambitions. RedNote is currently an outlier — both Chinese and US netizens are in the same system. But this is not how it was meant to operate. Originally aimed at domestic urban users and Chinese diasporas, RedNote had not developed an English version or a separate international system. The sudden influx of foreign users has already brought complications, including how best to respond to foreigners’ thorny questions about the relationship between mainland China and Hong Kong. These interactions, regardless of how small, tread on issues that Beijing wants to keep off the table. Lacking clear guidelines from above, RedNote has resorted to hiring more English-language moderators. Its real concern is how long, and to what extent, Chinese regulators will tolerate a borderless RedNote. Beijing’s ultimate goal is to restore the tightly controlled information cocoon woven for Chinese users. But how authorities plan to achieve this goal with RedNote remains an open question. Beijing’s most intuitive regulatory response would be to adopt the default model — split RedNote into two systems. But this time, the old formula collides with China’s latest rhetoric shift. With Trump back in office, Beijing wants to cast itself as a defender of globalisation. This shift was evident when Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun responded to RedNote’s sudden surge abroad — ‘As a principle, China has consistently supported and encouraged cultural exchanges to foster mutual understanding worldwide’. Splitting RedNote would undercut this message. A more adaptive regulatory approach would use AI-enabled censorship to avoid splitting RedNote. By sorting users based on language and IP address, the platform could discreetly channel specific content to targeted users. This idea has already surfaced in Chinese policy discourse. At one of Shanghai’s annual political meetings in January 2025, a delegate called for expanding AI’s role in social media content control. This approach could also incorporate other subtle restrictions on foreign users’ content, such as disabling RedNote’s copy-and-paste function and translation tool. The adaptive approach aligns more with China’s current policy goals. China’s external propaganda machines have toiled to ‘tell China’s story well’. Yet state efforts to reshape its international image via Western social media have been largely unsuccessful, with persistent struggles overcoming scepticism. With RedNote connecting Chinese and international users directly, Beijing has a rare chance to demonstrate its self-claimed openness. A globally integrated RedNote also enables Beijing to sharpen its AI tools for information control. Over the past decade, China has been doubling down on algorithmic governance. A major part of such efforts is requiring AI-enabled content moderation to adhere to ‘core socialist values’. Such vague censorship guidelines demand continual adaptation of AI algorithms. RedNote offers a larger testing ground for AI-driven information control technologies. A more adaptive regulatory strategy — combining AI censorship with subtle restrictions — allows China to project its soft power while preserving its information bubble. Beijing might hesitate before opting to split RedNote. This mass user movement is also a wake-up call for both Beijing and Washington that users will always gravitate towards the platforms of their choice. Instead of controlling information flow, a better, more sustainable path forward is to foster a robust marketplace of ideas.

China’s export boom is squeezing middle-income Asia	China’s manufacturing-focused stimulus measures have accelerated the extension of its domestic supply chain and caused a surge of exports into world markets. These trends challenge industrial economies all over the world. The effects are felt especially strongly in Asia’s developing, middle-income economies. In addition to geographic proximity, these countries are most closely connected to China as suppliers of intermediates and competitors in world markets for final products. Two other sets of policies in China create an asymmetry in the changes in competitiveness of manufacturers and exporters in middle-income Asia. These are the dramatic increase in the share of tertiary-educated workers in China’s labour force and the high-tech and skill-intensive industrial promotion policies known as Made in China 2025. The fraction of Chinese youth obtaining university degrees has increased for many reasons, but the rise was most dramatic in the decade following a 1999 policy change that relaxed university admission quotas. A growing population of skilled workers has greatly reduced the skill premium — the ratio of wages for university graduates to those of workers with lower qualifications — driving down labour costs in skill-intensive industries relative to manufacturing as a whole. Alongside this change, Made in China 2025 is using subsidies to target high-tech industries. Competition among Chinese firms has ensured that the benefits of Made in China 2025 subsidies are passed down the domestic supply chain, reducing costs and raising international competitiveness across a broad range of sectors. China’s prominence in global trade and the size of these domestic changes ensure that no economy is unaffected. Industrialising middle-income economies will see Made in China 2025 policies alter their existing pattern of production and trade, with longer-term change affecting their future growth and development prospects. The surge in China’s manufactured exports has reduced competitiveness almost across the board for countries whose factor endowments lead them to produce similar goods. The asymmetric effects of China’s labour force upskilling and support for its high-tech manufacturing lowers competitiveness even faster in the most skill-intensive sectors of similar economies — an effect exacerbated by the slowing of intermediate import demand by Chinese firms. The combination of faster manufacturing growth in China and slower growth elsewhere is causing comparative advantage — and perhaps also employment — in middle-income countries to pivot back towards primary sectors such as agriculture, forestry and mineral extraction. The direction of change is opposite to that targeted by policymakers and prescribed by economists for sustained, dynamic growth. The asymmetric sectoral trends can be discovered in data. Counterfactual simulations with a global trade model predict how China’s educational development and industrial policy measures offset other sources of growth. The model predicts that due to these measures alone, China’s exports of electronics and electrical equipment increase by 12.7 per cent and 53.9 per cent respectively over the decade 2015–25. At the same time, Thailand’s exports of those goods are predicted to decline by 22.67 per cent and 12.69 per cent, and agricultural exports rise by 27.21 per cent. Other middle-income countries show consistent patterns of sectoral export change with similar magnitudes. The longer-term implication of these changes is equally serious. Having increased the skill-intensity of its own labour force and product mix, China is exporting the decline in its skill premium to global labour markets. This notably affects countries whose skill-intensive industries are most vulnerable to Chinese competition and whose primary sectors are most responsive to relative input costs and output prices. As their skill-intensive industries decline — in a relative, if not absolute sense — demand for skilled workers grows less quickly than that for blue-collar workers. Model predictions for Thailand indicate a 0.54 percentage point drop, about 6 per cent of the typical returns to education in developing countries. Why does this matter? The skill premium not only measures relative labour costs, it also indicates expected gross returns to educational investments beyond compulsory schooling. A lower skill premium can discourage young people from pursuing further education instead of immediately entering the job market. In Thailand, a 1 percentage point decline in the country’s skill premium contributes to a 1.9 per cent drop in the educational enrolment rate of 15–23 year-olds. In the scenario where China increases its skilled labour endowment and subsidises its skill-intensive industries, the 0.54 percentage point drop in Thailand’s skill premium translates to a decline in the educational enrolment rate of just over 1 per cent. Any trend away from greater investment in human capital is also at odds with policy goals and prescriptions for successful development. As concerns about the costs and benefits of non-compulsory education are strongest for lower-income households, lower returns to education may exacerbate existing gaps in educational attainment and intergenerational economic mobility. While the world’s attention is focused on China’s trade relations with the United States and other advanced economies, it is perhaps middle-income countries whose futures are most at risk. The changes in global markets due to China’s development path and policies demand greater effort by affected countries to ensure that their own educational systems are capable of sustaining increases in skilled labour endowments. To the extent that China raises income from exports of primary and extractive industries, affected countries should aim to leverage this windfall to raise the affordability of education among their credit-constrained populations and promote schooling and skill accumulation. To ensure that university graduates find gainful employment, countries should also aim to raise returns to capital invested in more skill-intensive industries and in the knowledge base from which their dynamism is derived. Picking winners among skill-intensive industries is a futile approach for small economies without global market power. But fostering across-the-board productivity growth and competitiveness will maximise their chances of finding profitable niches within an increasingly fragmented global manufacturing production system.

Keeping the climate agenda on track in a Trumpian world	The election of Donald Trump in November 2024 has seen the United States, in rapid succession, exit the Paris Agreement on climate change and move to impose punishing tariffs on imports from countries around the world. This is a mighty double hit on the world’s ambitions to deal with the existential problem of climate change. As one of the world’s two biggest carbon emitters, the United States’ desertion of the Paris Agreement directly jeopardises reining back emissions and keeping global climate targets on track. Even more dangerous, Trump’s assault on global trade threatens to undermine the transformation of the global energy system through the trade, technology transfer and investment essential to cutting the growth of greenhouse gases. The United States’ walking away from the Paris Agreement and setting out to trash the global economic order creates a whole new level of uncertainty about the future of the international cooperation that is needed if we are to deal with the climate problem. One thing, however, is certain: the United States will not be a constructive national player on climate change for some time to come. And the United States is no longer a responsible custodian of, or even participant in, the rules based international trade order and will not be for an equally long time. Trust of the kind that the United States has enjoyed at the centre of the global economic and political order takes years to build. It has been destroyed in less than 100 days of Trump’s administration. In the face of the US geopolitical maelstrom, can the rest of the world keep the climate agenda on course? What initiatives might help to achieve this? There are people in every country who would deny or wish away the impact of man-made climate change. The United States, at least for the moment, is exceptional in having a national government that is almost totally dominated by such people — though Australia too once had such a government. Most governments, however, still have strong popular mandates for achieving their declared zero carbon goals. Communities around the world are confronted with intensifying natural disasters and their increasing severity and frequency that are its consequence. These events provide the foundation of support for the global climate agenda, minus national leadership in the United States. The global constituency for addressing climate change still provides incentive to businesses and farmers around the world to invest in a zero-carbon future and the innovation that is needed to make it happen. Elon Musk, and other US entrepreneurs, will hopefully continue to capitalise on the opportunities of a green economy future despite the unfavourable national policy environment they face under the Trump administration. In China and Europe where the policy environment has been conducive to building a renewable energy future, new industries and technologies have dramatically lowered the costs of energy transition and begun to claw back on carbon emissions. China and Europe have spawned comparative advantages in decarbonisation in production and consumption. The cost of solar power has fallen by 85 per cent and the cost of wind energy halved in a decade or so and Chinese capacity is rapidly lowering the cost of electric vehicles. Through open trade, technology embedded in green goods and transferred through investment, these centres of industrial innovation and energy transition are the agents of decarbonisation across the world. As the response to climate change reshapes and alters the global economy and supply chains, it opens opportunities for ambitious, strategic corporate and government players. These players will be able to accelerate the uptake of new technologies and practices that reduce emissions, create jobs and underpin economic growth across a wider range of countries and economies. The scale of resources needed to invest in climate change is daunting. The International Energy Agency estimates that, by the early 2030s, the world will need to invest US$4.5 trillion annually to remain on track for a net zero transition by 2050. Mobilising international public funding will now be harder and new sources of public funding will have to be mobilised. China is well placed to step into the breach. Policy frameworks and settings, and their extension through cooperation across national and regional borders, are essential to encourage private funding of sustainable investments, and now more importantly than ever. The problem is that US withdrawal from international climate cooperation and its frontal attack on the global trade regime could both become contagious. The immediate effect of Trump-induced global economic uncertainty is to undermine investor confidence not only in North America but around the world. Elevated international uncertainty is bad for business. It could be fatal for international climate change and trade cooperation unless the rest of the world doubles down on the multilateral, rules-based trade order and keeps the global climate change agenda on track. Like-minded countries will have to step up in an unprecedented way to leverage existing frameworks that create and keep open the markets for low carbon, sustainable goods and services. In this week’s lead essay, Ma Jun suggests that East Asian partners in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) arrangement have incentives to establish a beachhead of international cooperation on climate change and against protectionism through a regional green trade initiative. An RCEP green trade bloc would help to unlock a sustainable transition and enhance economic growth across a large part of the global economy. An open East Asian green trade arrangement, Ma argues, would ‘reduce the costs of green goods and services in most countries, boost green industries and enable faster and wider adoption of low-carbon practices and technologies’. Cementing and deepening cooperation between Europe, China and East Asia on the development of common financial frameworks (through the Multi-Jurisdiction Common Ground Taxonomy) for green investment is an important complement to working together on keeping trade and investment open. East Asia has the platform in place and the leverage to make a difference to global outcomes if it moves swiftly on both fronts.

Regional green trade bloc to fight both climate change and protectionism	US President Donald Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on imports from Canada, China and Mexico, and all imports of aluminium and steel has led the world to brace for major trade disruptions and economic confusion. Protectionism has come back into vogue and countries are cultivating critical sectors at home to bolster their economic security. The retreat from free trade will accelerate under Trump, with far-reaching consequences — especially in the fight against climate change. But the world has changed significantly in recent years. A deeper trend visible beyond the posturing and threats includes growing recognition of the urgency of cultivating home-grown green industries to combat climate change. This climate imperative must serve two mutually reinforcing goals — staving off further temperature increases and boosting economic growth and job creation. Green trade is international trade in green goods and services in areas such as renewable energy, green transportation, energy efficiency, waste management, sustainable agriculture, nature-based solutions and environmental professional services. Allowing free green trade — the trading of green goods, services and technologies as freely as possible across nations — will help decarbonise the economy and protect the environment at low cost. A green trade arrangement would involve reductions in tariffs and non-tariff barriers on a carefully selected list of green goods and services that deliver environmental and climate benefits. This will reduce the costs of green goods and services in most countries, boost green industries and enable faster and wider adoption of low-carbon practices and technologies. Introducing green trade policy on a global scale is challenging as one or two nations can obstruct a complex global deal. But it can be built on the foundations of existing regional trade agreements, among a smaller ‘coalition of the willing’. In the Asia Pacific region, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) offers one avenue for freeing up green trade. As the world’s largest trading bloc, by population and GDP, it comprises 15 countries and accounts for 30 per cent of global economic activity. A green trade arrangement could operate within the terms of RCEP, eliminating tariffs and significantly reducing non-tariff barriers on green goods and services ahead of the bloc’s existing eight-year timeline for full tariff removal. Designing the list of green goods and services that should be covered by the green trade arrangement is the first step that is needed. An initial study by the Institute of Finance and Sustainability (IFS) suggests that this list could include a few dozen categories and a few hundred products and services. Demonstrating the economic benefits of a green trade agreement to all member states will be key. Robust design of the arrangement must ensure that all member countries in the bloc benefit economically, accelerating their pace of decarbonisation and advancing the growth of their green industries. Incentives for green foreign direct investment and technology transfers — such as a more stable policy environment, enhanced protection for investors and intellectual property rights — need to be incorporated into the green trade arrangement to increase trade and encourage cross-border green investment and technology transfers and help low-income countries develop green industries and jobs. If RCEP adopts the idea, a larger number of Chinese, Japanese and South Korean electric vehicle and renewable energy equipment manufacturers are likely to invest in supply chain development and license technologies to local producers across ASEAN countries. There needs to be a balance between the need for policy incentives to stimulate green industries and trade-distorting subsidies. Government incentives for the production and consumption of green goods and services are often viewed favourably, but they can lead to trade disputes. Within the RCEP framework, it would be helpful if some no-significant-harm principles and prohibited subsidies could be agreed upon. Non-tariff barriers not only tariffs must be removed or reduced. Under many free trade arrangements, non-tariff barriers are often more significant impediments than tariffs to international trade and investment in green industries. This requires a serious stocktake of all non-tariff barriers, including import and export quotas, quality inspection against domestic standards, customs clearance processes, product traceability requirements, trade finance and export credit insurance and cross-border payment and settlement. Options should be developed to reduce these barriers, including harmonising green product and traceability standards and reducing the cost of trade finance using green finance instruments. A dialogue that considers all these factors will be crucial and larger economies such as China, Indonesia, Australia, Japan and South Korea can play a key role in forming an initial consensus on the economic and climate merit of a green trade initiative within RCEP. A regional green trade arrangement can be an inclusive approach to support a ‘just’ climate transition. It will promote decarbonisation and mutual economic benefits in all member states — via job creation and revenue growth. A multilateral approach will build mutual trust for broader cooperation on climate and trade issues. The case for green trade arrangements is even stronger compared to the approach being embraced by some advanced economies. While the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) favoured by the European Union can reduce carbon leakage from imports, it harms incomes and employment in developing economies exporting carbon-intensive goods. Such unilateral measures are likely to lead to retaliation and yet more protectionism. CBAM amounts to a ‘stick’ that punishes developing countries for not sacrificing domestic growth and development to reduce emissions. In contrast, a green free trade arrangement provides a ‘carrot’ encouraging green production and trade. Aligning climate goals with trade and development objectives rewards all participating economies for making progress on the green transition with mutual gains from trade, an initiative of the type a just green transition demands.

Mongolia looks to third neighbours for energy reform	Mongolian policymakers are embarking on energy reform that aims to diversify energy sources and work on issues like improving energy infrastructure and decreasing air pollution. The government has proposed ‘14 mega projects’ which will require support from Mongolia’s immediate neighbours — Russia and China — and are also heavily dependent on other nations for financial and technical assistance. These areas are an inseparable aspect of Mongolia’s transition to energy reform. Energy reform has become an increasingly important topic of interest among policy pundits alongside Ulaanbaatar’s foreign partners. Mongolia’s need for energy reform is no longer solely about whether Mongolia should diversify its energy sources — it is now a matter of transition speed and a discussion of the mechanisms that will attract investment and financial support. It has become clear to the Mongolian public in recent years that intermittent shortages of electricity in tandem with deaths and illnesses caused by extreme air pollution are becoming more widespread. It is an increasing view of the public that recalibrating the energy system is necessary. The coalition government headed by Mongolian Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai recognises the need to solve Mongolia’s energy challenges. The government will adhere to Mongolia’s long-term development strategy, ‘Vision 2050’, while implementing the State Policy on Energy 2015–2030. To Ulaanbaatar, increasing third neighbour participation is paramount to the pursuit of greater diversification of energy sources. Aligning foreign investment towards the energy sector, expanding business opportunities in battery storage and installing wind and solar is crucial. ‘Third neighbours’ — nations other than China and Russia — are central participants in Mongolia’s energy transition. For example, the United Kingdom has approved 11 projects with US$460 million in funding targeting the energy transition and other sectors. The Migration Action Facility will work on the ‘Mongolia – Energy Performance Contracting for Residential Retrofitting in Ulaanbaatar City’ project to improve insulation and energy efficiency in old apartment blocks. The European Union is actively funding Mongolia’s energy sector with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The EU partnership targets Mongolia’s ‘greater grid reliability and support for renewable generation’. Mongolia has also been working with Finland as a leading renewable energy country. While Mongolia is striving to diversify its energy sources and transition to renewable energy, its economy continues to depend on the export of natural resources. In 2024, foreign direct investment into Mongolia increased to US$177 million, up from previous years. In the face of rising investment in green energy, Mongolia’s economy continues to depend on its mineral wealth. But it is important for the Mongolian government to attract more investment, particularly in renewable energy infrastructure. With critical minerals exports increasingly relevant, foreign direct investment can be redirected toward these newer initiatives. Yet mining exports will continue to be Mongolia’s economic lifeline. The only concern is that if China stops importing Mongolia’s coal, Ulaanbaatar will need a different strategy. This is why economic diversification — even in the mining sector — is crucial. In 2023, clean energy contributed a record 11.4 trillion RMB (US$1.6 trillion) to China’s economy — becoming a key driver of China’s economy. These notable shifts can influence Mongolia–China mining relations. Though Mongolia exports 90 per cent of its coal to China, it is important for policymakers to divert certain Chinese investments into necessary sectors. A comprehensive strategic partnership with Beijing will present a learning curve for Mongolia’s critical minerals and clean energy market. Russia will play a different role in Mongolia’s energy reform. Russia will continue to see Mongolia as a major energy buyer and likely to maintain that relationship even with Ulaanbaatar’s renewable energy directions. Russia and China — both comprehensive strategic partners of Mongolia — will need to support Ulaanbaatar’s endeavours in improving its energy infrastructure, diversifying energy sources, while assisting development of clean and renewable energy. In addition to relying on its two neighbours, Mongolia is currently eyeing nations in the Indo-Pacific and the Middle East for new partnerships. In the coming years, Mongolia’s diversification of energy sources, transition to renewables and accelerating business investment in energy will continue to be a key priority. Mongolia’s third neighbours including India, France and Australia already have mega projects in place in oil refining, uranium exploration and mining, including one of the world’s largest copper mines with Rio Tinto. Newer partnerships with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain represent an expansion of bilateral relations. Ulaanbaatar’s proposal for energy reform will take years to fully implement. Until the necessary infrastructure is put in place and fully operational, Mongolia will continue to depend on coal-based energy. On a geopolitical level, Mongolia’s success in the energy transition will also depend on the stability of the region and where the flow of finance is heading.

Chinese blockbuster holds a lesson for China’s soft power	The release of Ne Zha 2, an animated feature film about a rebellious boy from Chinese mythology, has been hailed as a DeepSeek moment in China’s film industry. Its success makes the case for market-driven cultural diplomacy rather than government direction. Since its release in cinemas throughout China on 29 January 2025, the film about a god-boy grossed over US$1 billion in China in nine days. This makes Ne Zha 2 the first movie to break US$1 billion in a single market — overtaking Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It is also the first time a film produced outside the Hollywood Studio System has crossed the US$1 billion mark. A few key ingredients may account for the phenomenal box office success of Ne Zha 2. One is certainly its creative energy. The film takes a story from ancient Chinese mythology and turns it into a visual feast that is funny, fast-paced and irreverent. Its release as one of the ‘Chinese New Year Films’ (he sui pian) — a marketing gimmick that can be traced back to the post-war Hong Kong film industry — also contributed to domestic success. Another could be its ability to appeal to the patriotism of domestic audiences by poking light fun at the United States. Above all, like DeepSeek, Ne Zha 2 relied on local talent. The film took five years to make and involved more than 130 Chinese companies. Producer and Director Yang Yu said he initially wanted to engage an overseas animation team to help with the special effects but struggled to win interest. Eventually, China’s Base FX took on the challenge. Ne Zha 2 is a market endeavour, but this does not stop the Chinese government from boasting about it. After all, Party policy thinkers have thought long and hard about how to get mainstream international audiences, especially those in the West, to consume Chinese content. As early as the 1990s, the Chinese government was aware of the undue dominance of Western media in shaping global attitudes towards China. Enamoured of the idea of soft power, Beijing has spent around 6 billion dollars trying to get its state media content to ‘go global’ and compete with Western discourses. The agenda of the ‘go global’ mission was to ‘tell China’s story’ to the world, with its own voice and perspective. Complimentary copies of China’s state media outlet China Daily became widely available in many major cities in the West. Chinese state media organisations also tried to forge collaborations or partnerships with Western media outlets by signing memorandums. But these initiatives have to a large extent backfired, producing widespread suspicion and anxiety about Chinese influence. The rest of the world, especially Western countries, tend to find the content of Chinese media boring, hollow and propagandistic. In turn, the entertainment sector, not primarily tasked with telling China’s story or targeting international audiences, has shown some promising signs of delivering soft power dividends. For instance, the Chinese television dating show If You Are the One took flight in Australia and many other countries. Unlike state news media, entertainment programs like If You Are the One offer a glimpse of Chinese society that is mostly missing from the Western media, thereby offering a much-needed counterbalance — even a healthy antidote — to the China influence narrative. Though not initially tasked with promoting an attractive China, the show presented aspects of contemporary Chinese society that are more convincing, relatable and even endearing to its Western viewers. Like If You Are the One, Ne Zha 2 is a market product that primarily targets Chinese-speaking viewers and has gone global via market mechanisms rather than Party decree. Ne Zha 2 debuted in North America on 14 February 2025 after special screenings on 12 February, and launched in cinemas in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea on 13 February. Additional releases are also planned for other countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Egypt, South Africa, Pakistan, Japan and South Korea. Now six weeks since its initial release, the film has surpassed US$2 billion at the box office. Its grossing figures continue to rise. The phenomenal box-office value of Ne Zha 2 sends a clear message to Disney and its subsidiary Pixar — Chinese audiences may no longer need to be entertained by Hollywood blockbusters. It also puts the heads of other animation studios — including DreamWorks, Warner Bros, and (in Japan) Studio Ghibli — on notice, suggesting that Chinese animations could soon vie to attract a global audience that has so far been almost monopolised by Disney. Most significantly, the Chinese animation industry may soon begin to reverse the Mulan phenomenon — rather than letting the Americans tell a Chinese story, why can’t the Chinese tell a Western story? At the very least, perhaps the Chinese government will get the message this time — keep your hands off and let markets do the job of finding innovative ways of showcasing Chinese culture to the world.

Myanmar shows ASEAN centrality is weakening	On 1 February 2021, General Min Aung Hlaing and the Tatmadaw military orchestrated a coup, seizing control of Myanmar. Four years later, ASEAN remains unable to establish a unified approach to resolving the ongoing crisis. In April 2021, during an emergency summit, ASEAN leaders formulated a Five-Point Consensus. But internal divisions among ASEAN member states continue to undermine ASEAN centrality. Ethnic armed organisations engaged in armed resistance have made steady advances, dealing significant blows to the Tatmadaw. The State Administrative Council military junta has largely lost control of the country’s borders as military forces retreat into the ethnic Bamar heartlands of the central lowlands. The Extended Informal Consultation (EIC) on Myanmar in Bangkok on 20 December 2024 and the ASEAN Foreign Ministers Retreat on 19 January 2025 reflect ASEAN’s current approach in ASEAN. The EIC was attended by senior officials and foreign ministers from Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Cambodia, Brunei and Vietnam and hosted by Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa. All participants publicly agreed that a resolution to the Myanmar conflict consistent with ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus was needed. But beneath the veneer of consensus, ASEAN remains divided and struggles to effect meaningful change. Cambodia and the Philippines pointed out that the Five-Point Consensus may have lost its relevance, with the Philippines advocating for a change in strategy. ASEAN representatives even explored external party engagement, provided ASEAN retained its leadership role and upheld the principle of ‘ASEAN centrality’. On 19 January 2025, at the Langkawi ASEAN Foreign Ministers Retreat, Myanmar was again a main agenda item. While the Philippines again emphasised the need for a new approach to the Five-Point Consensus implementation, it did not offer a concrete alternative. Vietnam, recognising the difficulties facing ASEAN, argued for a comprehensive assessment of the Five-Point Consensus with a view to include more stakeholders. The intimation of involving ethnic armed organisations that are in conflict with the military junta was a striking and strident proposal uncharacteristic of ASEAN. Divisions on this issue demonstrate ASEAN’s policy paralysis when dealing with internal ASEAN issues. But behind this was agreement on non-traditional security issues of urgent concern. At the EIC, while the official agenda item was Myanmar, a full day prior was dedicated to transnational crime, particularly human trafficking and scam centres run out of Myanmar’s border zones. Following China’s forceful prompting, Thai authorities cut electricity and internet access to Myanmar’s notorious border towns. The Myanmar junta plans to hold elections in late 2025 to diffuse tensions across the country. Many observers view the polls as a sham intended to ensure the junta’s survival. At the EIC in December, Thailand and Vietnam highlighted the importance of ASEAN adopting a clear unified stance on the elections to ensure their legitimacy. But Singapore and Malaysia contended that elections were not the appropriate path forward. Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam underscored the necessity of inclusive elections, particularly in border regions, to foster broader acceptance. Cambodia and the Philippines advocated for the deployment of election monitors in Myanmar to uphold election credibility. Following the Foreign Ministers Retreat, Thailand offered to act as a conduit between the military junta and ethnic armed organisations. Singapore pushed for Thailand or Malaysia to convene meetings between all stakeholders to encourage participation of aggrieved parties. Vietnam looked to take advantage of Track II engagement at the upcoming ASEAN Future Forum. ASEAN members are cognisant of instability in Myanmar affecting regional security and stability. But the machinery of ASEAN has left leaders bereft of unified or realistic solutions, partly due to the influence of China, which provides a lifeline to Myanmar’s junta. At the EIC in Bangkok, ASEAN leaders were openly willing to get movement from Myanmar by hinting at external actors playing an active role in conflict resolution. This threat was followed through with China pressuring Thailand regarding scam centres. But in Langkawi, ASEAN leaders reverted to their historical position on ASEAN centrality. Leaders were united in noting that ASEAN must lead on regional issues, emphasising the importance of ASEAN’s convening power. While ASEAN leaders often underscore this point, an important driving force for this is the election of US President Donald Trump and his unorthodox foreign policy approach. ASEAN lacks both coercive mechanisms and a diplomatic culture and norms that supports such measures, which continues to undermine its capacity to address the crisis in Myanmar. ASEAN was unable or unwilling to deal with Myanmar until China became forcefully involved. Its reliance on external motivation to prompt action presents a challenge given the emerging era of great power competition and multipolarity. ASEAN and its member states must be nimble, willing to act and show unified credibility to external actors or it risks being pulled apart and divided. President Trump is upending world politics with his dramatic foreign policy reversal. While much of his focus may be on Europe and the Middle East, he may soon turn his gaze to East Asia. ASEAN must be prepared to present a united front rhetorically and substantively. As Myanmar continues to be ASEAN’s credibility test, it must finally act.

Collaboration crucial to combatting scams in Southeast Asia	In early January 2025, the disappearances of Chinese model Yang Zeqi and actor Wang Xing, orchestrated by a human trafficking ring in Myanmar, provoked public backlash in China. These controversies highlight the concerning growth of complex scam operations across mainland Southeast Asia’s lawless borderlands, especially those targeting Chinese citizens. Civil conflict in Myanmar, weak governance in Cambodia and rapid technological progress has aided the proliferation of these transnational criminal organisations, presenting serious obstacles for international law enforcement and collaboration. Myanmar’s ongoing civil war has created a fertile ground for criminal activities. The conflict has led to widespread lawlessness, particularly in border areas like the Golden Triangle where Myanmar, Thailand and Laos converge. These regions have become havens for criminal networks, with the military coup in 2021 exacerbating the situation. The junta’s focus on maintaining power rather than enforcing law and order has allowed scam operations to flourish, often under the protection or complicity of local militias and officials. Corruption and weak governance in Cambodia is also enabling scam compound activities. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has revealed that Huione Guarantee, a Cambodian holding company closely connected to the country’s ruling party, has emerged as the largest ever online criminal marketplace. Seen as the backbone of Cambodia’s vast elite-driven scam industry, Huione operates a thriving digital platform for various criminal activities and offers extensive money laundering services. More than US$24 billion have been traced through Huione over the last four years, far surpassing Hydra, the largest darknet market to date, which accumulated over US$5 billion in six years. Technological development has enabled these networks to expand their reach and sophistication. Digital communication tools, cryptocurrencies and advanced data analytics have revolutionised the way scams are conducted. Criminals now use social engineering techniques on social media platforms, phishing and other cyber tactics to deceive victims and recruit staff globally. The anonymity of the internet and difficulties in tracing cryptocurrency transactions make it challenging for law enforcement to track and dismantle these operations. And scammers are using AI and machine learning to automate and scale their activities, targeting more victims with greater precision. In 2023, backed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, ASEAN and China initiated a strategic plan to strengthen preventive measures, identify and safeguard scam victims and enhance investigative capabilities. These multilateral initiatives include joint operations, intelligence sharing and capacity-building programs for law enforcement agencies to disrupt scam operations, rescue victims and bring perpetrators to justice in international jurisdictions and under local criminal law. While the rapid rescues of Wang Xing and Yang Zeqi have illustrated the importance of collaboration between authorities in Bangkok and Beijing, increased multilateral efforts to combat scam operations and human trafficking between China and other Southeast Asian countries remains necessary. But scam compounds’ ability to relocate across borders or to other parts of the country hinders the effectiveness of multinational cooperation. Another challenge is the varying levels of commitment and capacity among Southeast Asian countries. Some nations have robust legal frameworks and the capacity to implement serious responses, like Thailand’s decision to cut power to scam centres on the Myanmar border. But other countries, such as Myanmar, struggle with corruption, weak governance and limited resources. This disparity can lead to inconsistent enforcement and gaps in the regional security network. While some Southeast Asian countries have already collaborated to establish the Emergency Response Network with the support of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, China and Myanmar are yet to engage. And rapid collaboration between China and other counterparts typically preferences the rescue of Chinese nationals, even though Chinese syndicates are recognised as high-ranking players in these criminal networks. This could lead to unfair and less transparent objectives for other victims who have equal rights to support. The adaptability and resilience of criminal networks presents another challenge to multinational cooperation. These groups quickly change tactics and move in response to law enforcement efforts, both in cyberspace and between nations, as seen with the relocation of scam operations within the Golden Triangle. Local elites and officials’ participation in illegal activities also hinders efforts to counter these networks. Criminal organisations often receive the implicit backing or direct assistance of powerful individuals, increasing the difficulty of dismantling their operations. And the utilisation of legitimate businesses like casinos and special economic zones as fronts for unlawful activities further masks the real nature of these networks. Despite increased collaboration between China and Southeast Asian nations, substantial obstacles persist. While scammers have professionalised their tactics through various applications in cyberspace, anti-cybercrime enforcement agencies’ resources and capabilities in those countries remain limited. And addressing scam-related criminality requires rapid updates on the modus operandi of criminal groups through intelligence-sharing among relevant authorities. Establishing a trustworthy bilateral or multilateral dialogue between Beijing and ASEAN is essential to rescue scam victims and disrupt the compounds. Dismantling these criminal enterprises requires consistent commitment, regional collaboration and creative strategies. Only through a coordinated and unified approach can the global community combat these sophisticated scam networks and shield at-risk populations from their exploitative practices.

Maximising the potential of the Canada–Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement	The Canada–Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) concluded negotiations in November 2024, with Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto and Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committing to signing the agreement in 2025. While the CEPA has great potential to boost Indonesia’s economy, there are still many challenges that could hinder Indonesia from maximising the benefits of this agreement. Indonesia and Canada begun negotiating the CEPA in 2021, and after 10 rounds of negotiations, the two countries finally reached a deal. This is Indonesia&#8217;s first official economic partnership with a North American country, marking a new chapter of bilateral relations. Through this agreement, Canada aims to tap into Indonesia&#8217;s large consumer market and strengthen its engagement in Southeast Asia, while Indonesia seeks to gain access to North American markets and investments. The agreement will eliminate over 90.5 per cent of import tariffs on Indonesian goods, increase investment and promote greater economic collaboration between the two countries. The CEPA could help Indonesia realise its aspiration to become a high-income country by 2045. The Canadian government’s economic impact assessment projected that the agreement could increase Indonesia’s GDP by US$1.1 billion and its export to Canada by US$877 million, mainly through increased Indonesian export of clothing and leather products. While the economic outlook is hopeful, there are still many challenges facing Indonesia. Indonesian exports may struggle in the Canadian market due to limited public awareness of Indonesia and its products. Many Canadians know little of Indonesia and are more familiar with its smaller neighbours, such as Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore. According to a 2024 poll by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, only 11 per cent of Canadians consider themselves to be ‘knowledgeable’ about Indonesia. Similarly, most Indonesians are only vaguely aware of Canada. It is not surprising that bilateral trade has been lacklustre, totalling only US$3.78 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, Vietnam and Thailand respectively exported US$9.85 billion and US$3.63 billion worth of goods to Canada in 2023. Structural issues, including regulatory complexity, poor infrastructure and a low-skilled workforce, discourage Canadian companies from doing business in Indonesia. According to the World Bank’s 2019 Ease of Doing Business index, Indonesia is ranked 73 out of 190 countries, indicating that Indonesia has a particularly challenging business environment, which is a deterrent for foreign firms. The CEPA does not automatically overcome all the barriers to successful economic cooperation between Indonesia and Canada. The implementation of this agreement requires Canada and Indonesia to proactively work together to strengthen economic ties. Canada has already begun working to support the CEPA. In 2023, Canada set up an Export Development Canada representation office in Jakarta to assist Canadian companies that want to do business in Indonesia. In December 2024, the Team Canada Trade Mission, led by Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development Mary Ng, sent representatives from over 190 Canadian firms and organisations to Indonesia to deepen partnerships between Canadian and Indonesian businesses. The visit also produced several memorandums of understanding between Canadian and Indonesian firms. Further, Canada’s Minister of International Development Ahmed Hussen visited Jakarta in February 2025 to meet with Indonesia’s Minister of Environment and Minister for National Development Planning to explore opportunities for further enhancing the economic cooperation between the two countries. Jakarta must take advantage of the CEPA by delivering reforms that will entice Canadian firms to do business in Indonesia. Though many of Indonesia’s structural issues will take years to resolve, there are practical measures that the Indonesian government should take to help both Canadian and Indonesian firms maximise the benefits of the CEPA. Just as Canada sent its trade mission to Indonesia in December 2024, Jakarta should send Indonesian firms to Canada, especially firms in key sectors identified in the CEPA, such as agriculture, energy, manufacturing and technology. Jakarta should also give preferential treatment to Canadian firms who wish to obtain Indonesian business licenses, which currently involves a lengthy and laborious process. This will alleviate the financial burden and uncertainty faced by Canadian firms in Indonesia. The government should also allocate more resources to the Indonesia Trade Promotion Center and Indonesia Trade Attache in Canada to facilitate more commerce activities between Canada and Indonesia. The government of Indonesia needs to take a proactive role to address existing challenges. The CEPA has great potential to help Indonesia achieve its economic aspirations, but without active participation from Jakarta, the CEPA’s potential will go to waste. Now the CEPA negotiators have returned home, the hard work of building economic ties must begin.

Shifting tides in the Blue Pacific	Security challenges, elections, international meetings and geopolitical shifts shaped the Pacific Islands region in 2024. Climate change and internal stability issues remain major challenges, but there are signs of growing diplomatic agency among Pacific states. In mid-May, the French parliament passed a constitutional amendment that sparked conflict with the indigenous Kanak people in New Caledonia. The unilateral move alters the 1998 Noumea Accords, permitting French nationals with ten years’ residency to vote in local elections. This change affects the demographic balance between pro-independence voters and others following two tight referendums in 2018 and 2020, and one boycotted referendum in 2021 during an evolving and contested decolonisation process. The resulting weeks of protests and unrest in Noumea and surrounds developed into riots, looting and arson. A State of Emergency declaration, 3,500 extra gendarmes, mass arrests and French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit eventually calmed the situation. Seven of the 11 Kanak leaders arrested were flown to France for pretrial detention, 13 people died and local elections were postponed until December 2025. The damage and rebuilding costs are estimated to be US$4.1 billion. Papua New Guinea (PNG) confronted violence and natural disasters. In February, 49 people were murdered in an ambush due to a land dispute fuelled by the availability of illegal small arms. In May, a landslide in Enga Province’s Yambali village killed 2000 people and displaced 70,000. In December, Vanuatu’s capital Port Vila was hit by a 7.3 magnitude earthquake, damaging buildings, bridges, schools and roads. The government declared a State of Emergency, 14 people died, 200 were injured and almost 900 people lost their jobs. Aftershocks hampered cleanup efforts while rebuilding costs are expected to top 29 billion vatu (US$244 million). The Blue Pacific Continent faces climate change challenges daily. In June, Easter Island reported 500 pieces of rubbish per hour washing ashore. Sea level measurements between 1990–2020 showed rises of 21 centimetres in Nuku’alofa, 29 centimetres in Suva and 31 centimetres in Apia. Tuvalu and Australia ratified the Falepili Union, an agreement to accept Tuvaluan climate refugees while Australia gets a right of veto over Tuvalu’s security arrangements. Despite this Tuvalu joined other Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) members in calling out Australia for its ‘immoral and hypocritical’ position on exporting fossil fuels and not setting a deadline for a transition to green energy. PNG withdrew from the November 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference, calling it a ‘total waste of time’. A local councillor in PNG’s Kerema district claimed 40,000 people had moved to higher ground since 2015 due to rising sea levels. In December, Pacific states also led a global push for the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on the responsibility of states for climate harm. Electoral changes reshaped several governments. Tuvalu elected six new parliament members in January, replacing pro-Taiwan prime minister Kausea Natano with current Prime Minister Feleti Teo. Solomon Islands voters returned just 52 per cent of recontesting incumbents in April, with three women joining the chamber. Both government and opposition members lost seats, seemingly for economic reasons rather than ‘anti-China’ sentiment. Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele leads the new coalition after former prime minister Manasseh Sogavare withdrew. In May and June, Ni-Vanuatu voters passed two referendum measures to increase political stability. Kiribati elected five women to its 45-seat parliament in August while PNG’s James Marape won a Vote of No Confidence and remains Prime Minister. In November 2024, Palau re-elected President Surangel Whipps Jr. Visiting dignitaries included UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for the August Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting (PIFLM) in Tonga, Pope Francis in PNG, and King Charles III and Queen Camilla at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Samoa. The King addressed common challenges of development and climate change. He also touched on the ‘painful past’ of slavery, though some present felt the discussion needed to involve concrete actions such as apologies and reparations. Geopolitical tensions were on show at the PIFLM in Tonga. Australia brought two major initiatives. One was the AU$400 million (US$254 million) ‘Pacific Policing Initiative’, involving a multinational ‘opt-in’ police unit to respond to natural disasters or unrest with a coordination hub in Brisbane and four new police training centres. Another was the AU$100 million (US$63 million) Pacific Resilience Facility for research into climate change disaster preparedness, to be based in Tonga. Consideration of China’s views is an important matter for PIF members. Nauru’s January switch of diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing left just three Pacific states that recognise Taiwan — Tuvalu, Palau and Marshall Islands. The annual PIF Communique dropped references to Taiwan as a development partner after Chinese objections. Solomon Islands will host 2025’s PIFLM, with Taiwan’s invitation status uncertain. Pacific states hold over 60 agreements with their Western allies and China on defence, security, infrastructure and equipment. Small states have showed increasing agency in leveraging larger powers — the Nauru–Australia Treaty, announced in December 2024, provides AU$140 million (US$89 million) for its budget and security support, plus banking services. Pacific Island nations demonstrated growing diplomatic agency amid intensifying great power competition in 2024, while climate change and internal stability remained key challenges.

Beijing treads water in the South China Sea	2024 brought increased tensions between China and Southeast Asian nations over South China Sea disputes. China continued down the same dangerous but ultimately ineffective path it has walked since 2022, failing to make and consolidate gains in the region. Beijing modestly increased the intensity of China Coast Guard (CCG) patrols in the exclusive economic zones of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. It also employed new and more frequent forms of grey zone violence, particularly against the Philippines. In the face of this pressure, Southeast Asian claimants made modest gains while Beijing failed in both its tactical and strategic aims. Tensions between China and the Philippines at Second Thomas Shoal posed a dangerous risk of escalation. The Philippines maintains a tenuous military base at the shoal via the grounded BRP Sierra Madre. The 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration award ruled that the shoal is part of the Philippine exclusive economic zone, but China still claims it. CCG and militia ships blockaded Philippine resupply missions to the Sierra Madre in 2023 and early 2024. This was an attempt to prevent the Philippines from delivering construction materials to repair the ship. The CCG and militia presence around Second Thomas Shoal remained elevated in the first six months of 2024. They changed their tactics to more aggressively damage Philippine vessels, leading to multiple injuries to Filipino personnel and a growing anxiety that an accidental fatality might trigger US defence obligations under the US–Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty. This came to a head on 17 June 2024 when the Philippines was unable to complete a resupply mission due to CCG personnel ramming and boarding Philippine vessels while armed with knives and other weapons. A Filipino sailor had his thumb severed during the clash, and it took hours for China to allow his evacuation. The tone of US–China and Philippines–China meetings shifted as Beijing seemed concerned that the incident came close to triggering US intervention due to the near death of a Filipino sailor. The Philippines was willing to cut a deal to return to the status quo ante, having sufficiently repaired the Sierra Madre. Manila had achieved its tactical aim, while Beijing had not. At the next Bilateral Consultative Mechanism between Manila and Beijing, the two sides reached a provisional agreement — the Philippines would bring only necessary supplies to the Sierra Madre, and China would end the blockade. The deal has held, though violence and collisions continue at other sites, particularly Sabina and Scarborough Shoals. Farther south, Indonesia and Malaysia faced an increased number of CCG vessels in their waters harassing oil and gas operations. A diplomatic letter leaked in September 2024 revealed China had pressured Malaysia to halt oil and gas exploration near Luconia Shoals. This was not mere rhetoric — for the first time, at least one CCG vessel patrolled Malaysian waters around Luconia Shoals every day of the year. China also challenged a seismic survey in Indonesia’s Natuna D-Alpha gas field conducted by PT Pertamina. During a three-week standoff between CCG, Indonesian law enforcement and naval vessels in October 2024, Indonesia publicly released photos and footage of China’s harassment. Despite Chinese operations, Malaysia drilled 15 new exploratory wells off Sarawak in 2024 and Indonesia completed its survey operations — another tactical success by Southeast Asian claimants standing up to grey zone pressure. China also failed to contain Vietnam’s operations — Vietnam undertook the most significant expansion of its outposts in a single year, focusing on Barque Canada Reef, now the fourth-largest outpost in the Spratly Islands. By mid-2024, Vietnam had created more than two-thirds as much land as China in the Spratlys and may match China’s acreage in 2025. Satellite imagery shows that while Vietnam is still building its second runway at Barque Canada Reef, Pearson Reef has been expanded to fit another runway. While tensions and the risk of escalation reached a new high point in 2024, it is worth asking which claimants, if any, improved their positions. The Philippines repaired the Sierra Madre while barely avoiding a major escalation. It instrumentalised the violence it faced to persuade 27 countries, plus the European Union, to call for Beijing to comply with the 2016 arbitral award. On the ground, the Philippines modernised its alliance with the United States, signed a major new Reciprocal Access Agreement with Japan, and deepened defence ties with other partners, including Australia, Germany, France, New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam. This is a major strategic setback for Beijing and is far more costly than its tactical failure to prevent repairs to the Sierra Madre. Vietnam built out its islands and began constructing dual-use infrastructure without facing significant costs from Beijing. Indonesia successfully surveyed the Natuna D-Alpha field, while Malaysia developed more oil and gas projects in the South China Sea in 2024 than in any previous year. In contrast, China controlled no more water or airspace on 31 December 2024 than on 1 January. It had not stopped a single major oil and gas project and was unable to attain its most public goal — preventing the Philippines from delivering construction materials to repair the Sierra Madre. It also pushed the Philippines deeper into the emerging alliance network that Beijing insists is contrary to its own strategic interests. If China pursues the same tactics in 2025, it is likely to get the same results — no tactical gain, further deterioration of the regional strategic environment and an unacceptably high risk of accidental escalation.

Indonesia’s online privacy protections are falling short of the mark	With nearly a third of its 270 million-strong population under the age of 18, Indonesia’s youth form a powerful consumer base in the digital economy. But this young generation has been left largely unprotected from the hidden risks of data exploitation. While Indonesia is taking steps to regulate online platforms, its current approach remains largely based on reactive measures rather than preventive steps that prioritise children’s data privacy from the outset. Millions of Indonesians engage with online platforms, generating vast amounts of data that is often collected, analysed and monetised without their awareness. While this pervasive data exploitation affects all users, children are uniquely vulnerable as their digital footprints are shaped before they can fully comprehend the risks. Indonesia has taken steps to bolster online safety through foundational regulations like the Government Regulation 71 of 2019 on Electronic Systems and Transactions, which regulates electronic system operators, and the landmark 2022 Personal Data Protection (PDP) Law, Indonesia’s equivalent to the EU’s GDPR. Indonesia’s 2025 plan on digital regulation is considering blocking children from opening social media accounts. But such a policy overlooks the more critical issue of the lack of digital literacy, especially for children, and has no measures to enforce data collection, platform transparency and meaningful consent. The policy is s step forward, but remains narrowly focused on reactive measures instead of disseminating the idea of safeguards for children’s data. The plan also fails to bring to the attention of the wider public the conflict between the need for online privacy and the corporate desire for profit from capitalism surveillance. The Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs is making strides in addressing the need for digital child protection through initiatives designed to shield minors from online threats. The ministry’s ‘Content Moderation Compliance System’, abbreviated SAMAN, was implemented in February 2025 and holds platforms accountable for swiftly removing harmful content under threat of fines. But broader frameworks like the PDP Law — which mandate age verification and parental consent mechanisms — reveal areas where more attention is needed. While the communications ministry’s plan focus on access limiting is critical, it does not fully address systemic challenges surrounding child data privacy. Indonesia must build a framework that prioritises preventive measures and builds safeguards into platforms, rather than relying on SAMAN’s reactive takedowns. As the IT policy expert Joel Reidenberg aptly puts it, ‘technological capabilities and system design choices impose rules on participants’, suggesting that regulation must go beyond punitive measures and include safeguards built into platforms themselves. The shallow approach taken by the ministry in addressing the issue of children’s social media use through content blocking overlooks deeper and more systemic concerns related to digital privacy and child protection. While content moderation may seem like a straightforward solution, experts have warned more essential measures are needed to address digital literacy levels. Despite Indonesia’s mandates on private electronic system operators to moderate illegal content, platforms like X, Telegram and Facebook still face significant challenges in consistently enforcing content removal. Rather than focusing solely on penalties and content blocking, Indonesia could adopt a more proactive, comprehensive strategy that aligns with privacy-by-design principles. This would involve embedding protections into platform architectures through measures such as data minimisation requirements under PDP Law and guidelines for age-appropriate defaults, which prioritise user privacy from the outset. Another major gap in the ministry’s approach is the lack of attention given to algorithmic bias and behavioural tracking from data, which represent hidden threats to children’s safety online. A key example is the 2021 report involving Indonesian e-learning platform Ruangguru, where children’s educational data was transmitted and exploited for advertising purposes. Without proper mechanisms to audit and regulate AI systems, platforms can exploit children’s engagement without facing meaningful consequences. Algorithmic bias exacerbates the issue, as automated tools often fail to detect vulnerabilities or account for the nuances of children’s behaviour. This failure allows platforms to design manipulative, addictive experiences that further compromise children’s digital well-being without the transparency necessary for meaningful protection. The current focus on content policing risks turning the issue of child protection into a form of surveillance, rather than fostering the kind of digital literacy that could empower children to make informed choices online. Effective protection requires a holistic approach that involves not only government regulation but also the active participation of parents and educators. Indonesia could initiate this by integrating digital literacy into its school curricula. Policy reforms should include measures like age-appropriate privacy settings, verifiable parental consent and data minimisation policies that limit data retention, all in line with existing PDP Law. By combining initiatives like SAMAN with mandatory workshops on data rights and privacy, Indonesia could equip children with the tools they need to navigate the digital landscape safely.

Empowering economic integration through ASEAN’s digital payment system	ASEAN’s pursuit of regional economic integration hinges on developing a cross-border digital payment system to enable seamless financial transactions, strengthening economic ties and driving inclusive growth. Beyond economic benefits, this system carries geopolitical weight, enhancing ASEAN’s economic sovereignty and influence in the Indo-Pacific by reshaping trade, reducing external reliance and solidifying ASEAN’s global role. The 2023 ‘ASEAN Leaders’ Declaration on Advancing Regional Payment Connectivity and Promoting Local Currency Transactions’ emphasises innovation-driven approaches, leveraging local currencies for cross-border payments and establishing a task force to develop an ASEAN Local Currency Transaction Framework. The objectives include enhancing infrastructure, fostering digital payment adoption, strengthening cybersecurity and reducing reliance on external currencies. This drive for self-reliance is particularly important given the current geopolitical climate. By fostering greater financial integration and promoting the use of local currencies, ASEAN aims to insulate itself from fluctuations in global financial markets and potential disruptions caused by geopolitical events. This vision aligns with the goals set forth in the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025, a comprehensive roadmap designed to achieve a cohesive and competitive ASEAN economy. This blueprint, adopted in 2015, envisions an ASEAN economy resilient to global economic disruptions. It sets forth objectives to extend financial services to underserved populations and micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, deepen financial integration to bolster trade and investment and ensure stability through robust infrastructure. The blueprint also addresses challenges like the digital divide and demographic changes by facilitating cross-border capital flows, standardising payment systems for trade and remittances and implementing capacity-building initiatives to reduce disparities. In 2024, ASEAN made significant strides in financial integration through digital payment standardisation. Malaysia and Singapore launched the NETS-DuitNow QR system — a cross-border platform also including Thailand — while Indonesia’s Quick Response Code Indonesia Standard also established cross-border linkages with Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. Project Nexus, a collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements, further enabled near-instantaneous digital payments between five ASEAN countries. QR-based payments simplify transactions for tourists, expatriates and small businesses, promoting financial inclusion, boosting local economies. Micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises can leverage the system for international trade. The adoption of digital payments — particularly QR code transactions — has grown significantly in ASEAN, representing 50 per cent of total transaction value in six member states in 2023. With over 80 e-wallets in ASEAN linking 205 million users and 25 million merchants, Southeast Asia is clearly shifting towards integrated financial systems. The push for a local currency transaction framework is perhaps the most significant geopolitical aspect of this initiative. Currently, local currency settlements are limited to bilateral agreements between Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. By reducing reliance on the dominant US dollar, ASEAN can gain greater control over its economic destiny and reduce its vulnerability to US monetary policy. This shift has broader implications for the region’s geopolitical landscape. As ASEAN’s economic influence grows, it is likely to play a more prominent role in shaping regional and global economic governance. The use of local currencies in trade and investment can also strengthen ASEAN’s relationships with other emerging economies, potentially leading to a more multipolar world order. To realise the full potential of ASEAN’s cross-border digital payment system, several key challenges need to be addressed. Regulatory harmonisation is crucial for consistency and interoperability, demanding common standards for data privacy, consumer protection, cybersecurity and electronic signatures. ASEAN could establish a regional regulatory sandbox, allowing policymakers to test digital payment solutions in controlled environments, ensuring uniform compliance and interoperability. Disparities in broadband penetration remain, particularly in rural areas of ASEAN member states. Robust digital infrastructure, including expanded internet connectivity, broadband penetration and strengthened cybersecurity, is essential. This will require collaborative efforts between governments and private entities, as exemplified by Project Nexus. ASEAN could accelerate this by creating a regional public–private investment fund dedicated to digital infrastructure, similar to the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund, with incentives for telecommunications companies to enhance rural and cross-border connectivity. Promoting financial literacy and consumer protection is vital for responsible system use. This includes raising awareness, fostering safe online practices and establishing dispute resolution mechanisms. ASEAN could launch a digital payment literacy campaign, leveraging social media and educational platforms, to ensure widespread understanding. Strengthening the existing ASEAN Committee on Consumer Protection to include a dedicated digital finance action plan would help address emerging risks, ensure consistent consumer safeguards and promote safe digital payment practices. Effective implementation depends on close collaboration among ASEAN members, financial institutions, technology providers and regulators through shared best practices and coordinated efforts to ensure seamless operation. Addressing these challenges through collective action will unlock the full potential of ASEAN’s digital payment initiatives. ASEAN’s cross-border digital payment system is a strategic tool for regional economic integration and a more resilient economy. But realising its full potential requires addressing regulatory, infrastructural and educational challenges. While the US dollar remains dominant, ASEAN’s initiatives demonstrate its commitment to tech-driven economic growth. Prioritising common data protection and region-wide cybersecurity through collaboration between central banks, governments and the private sector is crucial for ASEAN to achieve greater economic sovereignty.

Renewed US–China tensions spell trouble for Australia’s economy	Trump 2.0 is in full swing and it is already causing major anxieties for the global economy. Australia must navigate US–China tensions with careful consideration of its economic realities. Ongoing negotiations for exemptions from US President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on imported metals do not shield Australia from reinvigorated US protectionism, especially as most of Trump’s ire has been targeted at China. While Australia’s trade relationship with China gets a lot of attention, its importance is not always fully grasped. Australia’s access to the Chinese market has significantly impacted how Australia’s political economy developed, creating path dependencies that are costly to break. The China-fuelled mining boom of the 2000s influenced the allocation of economic resources, raised its standard of living and affected its political culture. It has also shaped expectations on government dealings with issues like fiscal policy and economic prosperity that benefit from the booming Chinese commodity imports and deflationary exports. What about now? When China banned Australian coal imports in 2020, many assumed that the industry would be devastated. Yet it was not. Australia found other buyers for its coal. In 2021, China accounted for less than 1 per cent of its coal exports, even as Australia’s total coal exports increased by US$19 billion. By 2023, trade in coal had resumed but China still accounted for only 8 per cent of Australian coal exports, less than half the share in 2020. If Australia could adapt to losing the Chinese market for its coal, will Trump’s tariffs on China really be so bad? It is important not to draw the wrong lessons from this experience. Australia’s vulnerability lies in how much its exports rely on the Chinese market, the high share of these goods on Australia’s total exports and China’s share of the market for these goods globally. Energy is crucial to Australia’s trade with China, but its most important commodity is by far iron ore. In 2023, China purchased 84 per cent of Australia’s US$85.4 billion iron ore exports. Iron ore accounted for 23 per cent of Australia’s total exports in 2023. Finding alternative buyers would be difficult — China purchased 69 per cent of global iron ore exports in the same year. Australia’s third largest export is petroleum gas, with a 13 per cent share of its export mix. China, the largest importer of petroleum gas in the world, accounts for just under a third of these exports. China is a big importer of Australian services as well as goods. In the 2024 financial year, China was the largest importer of Australian education services, with a 24 per cent share. Australia’s trade surplus with China accounted for 4 per cent of its GDP in the 2024 financial year. The growth in the trade surplus with China also accounted for 10 per cent of the growth in GDP — measured in current prices — from 2023–24. If the trade surplus with China was to shrink or even fail to grow due to tariffs imposed by Trump, it would have a significant impact on Australia’s economy. Australia must also understand that the threat is not just tariffs or Trump. Political consensus on US–China economic relations is souring in the United States. Trump started the trade war with China in 2018, but president Joe Biden retained the Trump-era tariffs. Trump first sanctioned Huawei and proposed a ban on TikTok, but Biden expanded these sanctions to the entire Chinese semiconductor industry and shepherded a TikTok ban through Congress. China is flexing its economic power too, imposing its own export bans on materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. Rising economic tensions between the United States and China is the new normal — and Australia is caught in the middle. The big risk for Australia is increasing US demands on its allies to join efforts to decouple from China. This is happening in semiconductors already. Can we expect the United States to demand Australia to follow a path of decoupling from China or else face sanctions, risks to AUKUS and ANZUS or other forms of coercion? And what would that mean for Australia’s economy, standard of living and political stability? These are the questions Canberra should be considering. Decoupling from China will be costly for Australia not just because of exports. If Australia and other US allies stop buying Chinese computers, toys or smartphones, where will they turn? China supplies 49, 60 and 59 per cent of global exports of these products respectively and dominates many other markets. Of course, all of this could be manufactured elsewhere, but that would require substantial investment in domestic manufacturing or foreign production. It could also significantly increase inflation, as new manufacturing would likely incur higher costs. Meanwhile, Australia’s ability to afford these higher priced imports would weaken as foreign exchange earnings from commodity exports and mining investments decline, ultimately lowering incomes. Despite the legitimate security concerns over China’s policies, Australia must be realistic about its economic vulnerabilities. The Australian government should embrace the ‘pragmatic’ approach that had previously characterised Australia’s foreign policy towards China. Policymakers should also focus on deepening ties within the Asia Pacific to reduce Australia’s security reliance on the United States and economic reliance on China. Existing institutions, such as the ASEAN-centred Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, provide good mediums to engage with China productively. Cooperation with other regional actors which face common challenges is key to navigating the ramifications of rising great power tensions.

Impeachment a key weapon in the Philippines’ Marcos–Duterte divide	On 5 February 2025, the Philippine House of Representatives impeached Vice President Sara Duterte. Several allegations prompted the impeachment, including her implied death threats towards President Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr, irregularities in her use of office funds, unexplained wealth, incitement of sedition, abuse of power and betrayal of public trust. Following the impeachment, political commentaries have drawn attention to the rupture of UniTeam — Sara Duterte and Bongbong’s 2022 electoral alliance. But beyond this rupture, Duterte’s impeachment also signifies a shift at the heart of the Philippines’ democratic institutions. Impeachment, as a constitutional mechanism, has shifted from being primarily a tool of moral accountability to becoming a mainly political strategy without clear ethical or democratic direction. This is not to argue against its political use or the progression of Duterte’s impeachment. Rather, it is an acknowledgement of how current political alliances exploit the process, sidelining impeachment’s role as a public safeguard as enshrined in the Constitution. High-ranking officials have traditionally reserved impeachment for clear violations of ethical or legal duties, pursuing it alongside popular mobilisation. But the context surrounding Duterte’s impeachment suggests a strategic utility of this process, particularly as the country approaches the 2025 midterm elections and Duterte’s anticipated 2028 presidential bid (President Marcos is constitutionally limited to a single six-year term). Impeaching public officials is not foreign to the Philippines’ recent political history. The 1987 Constitution, ratified after the fall of the Ferdinand Marcos Sr regime, included impeachment as an accountability mechanism for the highest constitutional officers. The House of Representatives has impeached five officials, including Duterte. Only two have advanced to trial in the Senate. The first trial, that of former president Joseph Estrada in 2001, was pre-terminated by his resignation after mass protests. The second, that of former Supreme Court chief justice Renato Corona in 2012, concluded in conviction. Civil society supported Estrada and Corona’s impeachments, organising movements around moral governance and accountability. These impeachments were respectively seen as against a ‘gambler womaniser’ president and a chief justice who often ruled for the president who appointed him — acts which are not illegal per se, but undermine the moral fitness of these high officials. Notably, after Estrada resigned, active civic vigilance continued to fend off attempts to bypass term limits and protest the corruption of his successor. Unlike these prior cases, the complaint that impeached Duterte in February stands out for lacking a clear moral or democratic actor or direction. While civic leaders, activists and religious figures opposed to both Duterte and Bongbong filed three impeachment complaints against Duterte, the House largely ignored them. Duterte’s impeachment advanced only when Bongbong’s congressional allies launched their own complaint via a rare procedural manoeuvre just as the House was supposed to go on a four-month recess. While corruption is among these charges, the principal allegation revolves around Duterte’s bizarre admission that she hired an assassin to kill Bongbong’s family. The charges, since transmitted to the Senate for trial, raise serious concerns about the misuse, if not plundering, of public funds by Duterte and her fitness for public office. But with Bongbong’s allies dominating Congress, the impartiality and integrity of the impeachment process are in question. Duterte’s impeachment illustrates how the moral framing of impeachment’s constitutional design is transitioning to pure political strategy. The articulation is crucial because while impeachment’s political utility is not in doubt, it was not intended to be a strategic tool. Rather, like in the United States, it was intended to be a moral crucible — a ‘national inquest into the conduct of public men’, before a Senate that is ‘sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent’. The accusation of a betrayal of public trust, one of the grounds for Duterte’s impeachment, is a special legal concept that significantly affects Philippine politics. The Constitution’s framers intended this ground to be a ‘catchall phrase’ for any acts that make an official unfit for office. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that the Constitution sets no specific standards and that these matters were truly ‘political questions’ — better suited for Congress to decide than the courts. The crux of the current difficulty lies in the erosion of trust in democratic institutions, which are supposed to wield impeachment powers with moral authority. After all, the Constitution’s premise is that democratically elected institutions can clearly assert moral accountability. But with the decline in the quality of the Philippine Senate over the years and its capture by political dynasties, impeachment has become increasingly untethered from its moral foundations. When such bodies are perceived as compromised or biased, their decisions might further shake, rather than reinforce, democratic institutions. This does not mean that the current impeachment is illegal and should not proceed, or that Duterte should not be removed from office. But this shift in the utilisation of impeachment highlights the need for heightened vigilance in the workings of supposed genuine democratic processes. This transformation also shows the perils of relying solely on grand institutions for moral accountability instead of more popular modes, like elections or sustained mass action and civic participation. Such reliance is risky if these institutions themselves are flawed or compromised. Beyond the constitutional nature of impeachment, public perception and political narratives are likely to change in this particular case. For political observers inside the country and within the region, the Duterte impeachment will be an instructive case on constitutional tools and their sway in shaping political fortunes.

Australia’s chance to champion a rules-based economic order	It’s hard to remember the last time an advanced economy embarked on a course of self-destructive behaviour as damaging as the United States has pursued in the month or so since Donald Trump returned to the White House. Brexit — an emblematic act of economic self-sabotage — pales in comparison. The new protectionists describe tariffs as a way to ensure a manufacturing revival, or as a negotiating tool. By far the most honest description of the economics of a tariff, though, is a special tax on the most efficient source of supply for businesses and consumers. Put like that, the idea of ‘retaliation’ seems much less obvious than it does to politicians who want to impress voters with the image of strength against foreigners. Trump’s imposition of punitive tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports brought back dark memories of the beginning of the Great Depression, which became ‘Great’ partly because of a destructive spiral of protectionism that originated in Washington in a world economy that was splintered into imperial blocs. Barely a day after the tariffs came into force, Trump ‘paused’ their application on US neighbours for now — likely in response to the clear evidence of their destructive potential for US growth, inflation and financial markets. This is little reason for relief. Regardless of whether Trump’s tariffs on the United States’ neighbours ‘stick’, the President has sent a message to all of its partners that the word of the White House is worthless: it is prepared to ignore any trade agreement or treaty, and the US government will not necessarily honour contracts that have been entered into in good faith. Herein lies the danger of the erraticism that marks Trump’s trade warfare. How can businesses have faith that if they invest in the United States the government will not destroy the value of that investment with wild, damaging trade policy changes at a moment’s notice? Since the Second World War, the United States has enjoyed what monetary economists call ‘exorbitant privilege’: the ability to borrow cheaply from the rest of the world and run chronic trade deficits without ever risking a balance of payments crisis, secure in the knowledge that America’s ability to print the global reserve currency would allow the party to go on more or less indefinitely. But there are signs that the institutional foundations of US economic dominance are starting to crack. That the US dollar has always been seen as a safe haven might have led you to think that the dollar would have appreciated after Trump’s tariff announcements, as it did when Trump made similar threats in his inaugural address. Instead, the dollar tanked. It’s unlikely that this will mean any rapid collapse in America’s central role in the global financial system. But it does point to a serious challenge facing the country even after Trump’s term is over in four years. Trust takes a long time to build, and is quickly dissipated. This takes place at a time when — ironically thanks to Trump’s demolition of trans-Atlantic political trust — there will be a lot of Euro-denominated sovereign debt on the market as Europe rearms to meet the challenge of deterring Russia without reliable American security patronage. The lesson for Australia? Whatever Trump is doing to the institutional foundations of the American economy, do the opposite. For countries that have been left out of the trade spats, now is the time to show the world that reliable institutions and stable markets can be found outside the United States. For developed economies like Australia, this means tangibly demonstrating that Australia is committed to maintaining stable, economically sensible institutions. As Bryan Clark from the Australian Centre for International Trade and Investment argues in this week’s lead article, one way to signal that Australia is open for business in a time of growing trade protectionism would be to do away with tariffs for good. Though Australia’s tariffs are admittedly very low already, as Clark points out, nuisance tariffs still have price effects that hurt low-income consumers the most. Removing all tariffs would also mean Australia could do away with the bureaucratic apparatus that administers them, slimming our government in a smart way. It would make life a little easier for Australian businesses engaged in international trade without sacrificing anything of value. And — perhaps most of all — it would be a clarion signal in support of openness and international trade by a country where those values have had bipartisan commitment, going back as far as Gough Whitlam’s unilateral and universal tariff cut of 25 per cent in 1973. Australia can and should bring this opposition to the protectionist zeitgeist to its international economic diplomacy more broadly. We’re enmeshed in a regional economy that is the best place in the world to witness the reality that getting rich, and staying rich, involves countries embracing a place in the international division of labour based on comparative advantage and trade. Some governments in Southeast Asia are prone to touting the potential benefits of a trade war for encouraging the inflow of foreign investment. In Australia, it hasn’t escaped the notice of many that there are potential gains for Australian exporters in China’s levying retaliatory tariffs on a range of US agricultural products. Such thinking is to miss the wood for the trees. Whatever sectional economic benefits might be had in the short term from a trade war are outweighed by the long-term damage to economies from the weakening of the rules-based international trade and the weakening of confidence, certainty and growth that come from chaotic policymaking in Washington. Australia and its region have instruments of political and economic cooperation — from the CPTPP to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to the G20 — to safeguard rules-based trade in a world where some have forgotten the lessons of last century’s trade wars.

Time for Australia to abolish tariffs	As the global economy grapples with challenges from inflationary pressures to geopolitical tensions, there is heightened interest in trade tariffs as a policy tool. The United States and members of the European Union have threatened to reintroduce or increase tariffs, citing the need to protect domestic industries or respond to strategic imperatives. In Australia, no political constituency is in favour of raising tariffs. But as the world shifts, Canberra finds itself at a crossroads: should it maintain, reduce, or abolish its remaining tariffs? Their economic inefficiency, the hidden costs they impose on businesses and consumers and the domestic and international studies that expose these costs recommend that Australia should take the bold step of abolishing the last vestiges of its tariff regime. Australia has progressively liberalised its trade policies over the last three decades, transforming from a highly protected economy to one of the most open in the world. Yet ‘nuisance tariffs’ persist, typically ranging from 3 to 5 per cent on a range of imported goods. In 2024, the Australian government accepted the Productivity Commission’s argument to abolish nuisance tariffs, removing around 500 tariffs unilaterally. But in doing so, it still retained around 4500 tariff lines, seemingly as ‘negotiating coin’ to trade off in currently stalled bilateral trade agreements, such as that with the EU. These tariffs compel businesses to navigate complex customs procedures, adding compliance costs and reducing efficiency. At a time when Australia’s economic competitiveness hinges on seamless integration into global supply chains, these barriers are counterproductive. While low, Australia&#8217;s remaining tariffs — as the Productivity Commission, an independent advisory body, has argued — are not merely harmless irritants. They create significant administrative burdens, distort supply chains and impose costs on both businesses and consumers without delivering meaningful protection to domestic industries. The Productivity Commission’s 2017 report on Australia’s tariffs labelled them ‘outdated’ and ‘ineffectual’, highlighting their negligible contribution to government revenue, the high costs of collecting them and their disproportionate impact on small- to medium-sized enterprises. The international evidence is clear — tariffs generally harm more than they help. In the United States, the imposition of steel and aluminium tariffs under Donald Trump’s first presidency provides a cautionary tale. A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that these tariffs cost American consumers and businesses US$650,000 for every steel-related job they created. Far from revitalising domestic industries, the tariffs triggered retaliation from trade partners, disrupted global supply chains and raised input costs for US manufacturers, reducing their international competitiveness. IMF research similarly shows that even low tariffs act as a drag on productivity, innovation and unemployment, as well as aggravating inequality and promoting self-defeating real exchange rate appreciation. By insulating domestic industries from competition, tariffs discourage firms from investing in new technologies and improving operational efficiencies. The net effect is an economy that grows more slowly, offers fewer high-quality jobs and provides fewer choices to consumers. Retaining nuisance tariffs has both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include increased prices for imported goods, disproportionately affecting low-income households that spend a larger share of their income on consumables. Higher prices also raise businesses’ input costs, particularly in sectors like manufacturing, construction, agriculture and retail where imported materials and goods are integral to efficient operations. Abolishing the remaining tariffs would yield significant benefits for Australia. It would lower costs for businesses and consumers, helping combat inflationary pressures and improve living standards. The Productivity Commission estimates that eliminating nuisance tariffs would also save Australian businesses hundreds of millions of dollars annually in administrative and compliance costs alone, not to mention the savings from lower input prices and streamlined government processes. The abolition of Australian tariffs would also enhance Australia’s economic resilience by simplifying supply chains. In a world marked by increasing trade disruptions and geopolitical uncertainties, the ability to source goods flexibly and cost-effectively is a critical competitive advantage and source of resilience. While some might highlight that Australia has reduced applied tariffs across numerous so-called ‘free’ trade agreements, even a zero per cent tariff line still imposes higher administrative costs on businesses. These costs arise from the need to comply with the terms of preferential trade agreements to seek the tax relief available. If businesses make mistakes when requesting preferential treatment for imports, they face potential penalties under the Customs Act’s strict liability provisions for false and misleading statements. Removing tariffs altogether would ensure that Australian businesses can procure the best quality inputs at the lowest prices, regardless of their origin. Tariff abolition would also strengthen Australia’s leadership in global trade policy. As the United States and European Union backtrack on trade liberalisation, Australia has an opportunity to position itself as a model for the benefits of open markets, reinforcing its credibility in international negotiations. With the 2025 national Australian election approaching, an incoming government has the opportunity to eliminate the remaining tariff system. This would overcome the cost of operating a system that collects less revenue than it costs to administer. It would simultaneously remove imposts on imports and materially reduce inflation, while removing administrative burdens for businesses through import simplification, removing tariff concession orders and duty drawbacks. The global reintroduction of trade tariffs is a concerning trend, but it also provides an opportunity for Australia to distinguish itself as a leader in economic openness, to its own benefit.

Culture meets contagion in Indonesia’s cattle country	Anthrax is a recurring zoonotic disease in Yogyakarta Special Region, Indonesia, with annual fatalities among animals and affected humans. Gunungkidul district, a major cattle supplier for Yogyakarta, has reported anthrax cases every year since. Despite government interventions like animal vaccination and behavioural change programs, anthrax persists in Gunungkidul. Anthrax’s persistence and future prevention is best understood through the ‘One Health’ concept, which acknowledges the interdependence between animal, human and environmental health and places sensitivity on local structural and social relations. The anthrax-inducing bacillus anthracis bacteria that lives in animal blood can produce spores when it interacts with air, remaining viable for decades. In humans, anthrax can manifest cutaneously, causing digestive and respiratory problems. While curable by antibiotics if detected early, delayed treatment can be fatal. In animals, anthrax spreads quickly, necessitating strict preventive action such as regular six-monthly vaccinations, area isolation and disinfection, as well as immediate antibiotic treatment. Animal carcasses must be burnt or buried at least two meters deep. Anthrax has appeared globally — from outbreaks recorded in Indonesia’s Lampung Province in 1884, to endemic cases among Canada’s bison. Anthrax has also been weaponised in war, highlighting its broader socio-political implications. From February to March 2024, two cattle and ten goats died from anthrax in two neighbouring Gunungkidul villages, with unreported animal fatalities likely increasing the actual death toll. There were 45 suspected human cases of anthrax in Yogyakarta Special Region. In 2023, three human deaths and numerous cases of anthrax among animals were documented. Similar patterns were recorded in 2022, with 15 animal deaths and 23 people affected. Indonesia’s government has long recognised anthrax as a zoonotic threat. Since 1972, regulations have been in place to coordinate responses between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture. Presidential Instruction No.4/2019, the Coordinating Ministry of Human Development and Culture’s Regulation No.7/2022, the Ministry of Agriculture’s Regulation No.39/2023 and District Regulation No.13/2023 all prioritise zoonotic disease prevention and establish district-level guidelines for anthrax control. In response to anthrax outbreaks, authorities have conducted case investigations, tested samples, vaccinated animals and raised public awareness. These public awareness campaigns promote healthy meat consumption, encourage people to report any suspected animal deaths in the local area and emphasise the importance of animal vaccination. Many stakeholders, including the government and development practitioners, have tried to promote this initiative to strengthen disease prevention and detection. But these interventions fall short, having no observable impact on the livestock trade. Studies have shown that farmers’ knowledge of anthrax has no bearing on their decision to trade cattle in Gunungkidul’s anthrax-affected villages. Indonesia’s agricultural farms also often play the role of middlemen or brokers who link sellers, traders and consumers. But brokers could be a potentially negative facilitator for cattle owners, enabling cattle trade regardless of the animals’ health. Community compliance with reporting also remains inconsistent, with some farmers failing to report animal deaths, opting instead to consume, distribute or bury the meat. This suggests that government interventions do not match the community’s way of life, especially in relation to their livelihood and livestock management. In 2024, some studies found that the local people of Gunungkidul have a social security practice of collective giving towards their peers who have lost cattle, in the form of buying the owner’s dead animal and distributing it to the community for consumption. This tradition of showing sympathy towards others, known as purak or brandu, is believed to be a positive gesture of gotong royong — an Indonesian cultural and social value meaning to ‘carry cooperatively’. This is used to show social solidarity in taking the burden of the lost cattle, despite the associated health risks. Controlling the spread of anthrax in Indonesia requires a nuanced approach that integrates economic, cultural and social factors. Given that livestock is a farmer’s main source of income, changing this economic way of life will be difficult, especially when there is fear of economic loss from cattle fatalities and existing regulations and campaigns’ inability to provide a financially viable alternative to purak/brandu. Given the complexity of interactions between humans, animals and the environment, stakeholders implementing government-led interventions may overlook these social dynamics in villages. As such, raising awareness of anthrax, promoting safe meat consumption and encouraging the use of reporting mechanisms requires persistent and regular efforts. It also necessitates the use of suitable methodologies to understand local people’s knowledge. Methods such as online surveys or one-day consultations are insufficient — stakeholders must build rapport with locals, which takes time, financial and human resources to ensure an actual presence in the community. The One Health approach links clinical health with other aspects of life, including social relations. By providing insight into interactions between humans, animals and the environment, this approach can help to understand why people still trade diseased livestock despite having an awareness of anthrax. Effective anthrax control requires sustained engagement with local communities, integrating scientific expertise with an understanding of cultural practices. By prioritising local knowledge and addressing socioeconomic determinants, stakeholders can better develop interventions that not only prevent disease but also resonate with the communities they aim to protect. This approach could provide a relevant effort for zoonotic disease control amid Indonesia’s slim government budget. Gita Nasution is an independent researcher focusing on gender, carework and health.

Syncing trade standards can unlock Australia’s digital potential	The digital economy is not a niche sector — it is the economy itself. Digital trade is no longer an abstract concept confined to online sales or intangible services. It is the backbone of modern economies, driving connectivity, innovation and cross-border commerce. As businesses and individuals embrace digitalisation, the traditional distinctions between physical and digital trade have eroded. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this shift as businesses relied on digital platforms, proving the necessity of resilient digital infrastructure. Between 2020 to 2021, Australia’s digital activity value added grew by AUD$8.6 billion (US$5.4 billion) as firms turned to e-commerce to remain operational. But the potential of digital trade cannot be realised without clear and consistent rules governing data flows, cybersecurity and digital transactions. Fragmented regulations across countries have created uncertainty and increased costs for businesses. The WTO’s Joint Statement Initiative on Electronic Commerce (JSI) offers a solution, with Australia cementing its role as a leader in the digital economy as a joint chair of JSI negotiations. By promoting streamlined rules, the JSI reduces barriers to cross-border data transfers, facilitates e-commerce and promotes trust in digital platforms. The JSI also allows nations to regulate personal data in a national manner, provided it is WTO consistent. This translates into a more predictable trading environment, reduced compliance costs and enhanced opportunities to reach global markets. The JSI provides international regulations to facilitate a stable digital commerce environment, harmonising legal frameworks by improving safeguards for digital transactions. The agreement encompasses six areas — enabling electronic commerce; openness; trust and digital trade; transparency, cooperation and development; telecommunications; and exceptions. As digital platforms increasingly drive economic growth, harmonising regulations across borders is essential to ensure businesses — particularly small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) — can compete and innovate without being stifled by trade barriers. The JSI offers Australia a critical opportunity to address domestic challenges, unlock economic growth and secure a fairer and more competitive digital future. The benefits of the JSI are particularly noticeable for Australia’s SMEs, which represent 42 per cent of the private sector workforce. Digital platforms allow SMEs to overcome geographical barriers and connect with international customers, crucial for a geographically isolated economy like Australia. Digitalisation also allows SMEs to compete with larger corporations by reducing transaction costs and improving operational efficiencies. Yet SMEs still face hurdles, including limited resources, digital illiteracy and inadequate infrastructure. A 2018 report revealed only one in five Australian small businesses had a digital strategy, and many lacked the capabilities to implement new technologies. Targeted government support is essential to change this. Initiatives to upskill workers, incentivise digital transformation and improve regional infrastructure can help SMEs overcome these barriers. Bridging the digital divide, particularly in rural and remote communities, must also be a priority. While urban centres thrive with high-speed internet and advanced digital tools, many regional businesses struggle with poor connectivity, hindering participation in the digital economy. The JSI’s focus on data flows also highlights the critical role of cybersecurity. As cross-border data transfers become the norm, protecting sensitive information and ensuring consumer trust will be paramount. Australia has made significant progress in addressing cyber risks through initiatives such as the Cyber Security Strategy and legislation governing critical infrastructure. But more must be done to streamline these frameworks and align them with the JSI’s principles. SMEs are particularly vulnerable, as their limited resources make them attractive targets for cyberattacks. Strengthening cyber resilience through education, investment and governance will ensure businesses can engage confidently in digital trade. While the JSI opens doors to growth and innovation, Australia cannot ignore the implications of the United States’ absence from the agreement. As one of Australia’s largest services export partners, the United States’ divergence from JSI rules could increase compliance costs and regulatory complexity for Australian businesses engaging with their US counterparts. US disengagement could also challenge multilateralism, affecting regional cooperation and other WTO efforts. This could disproportionately affect SMEs, which may lack the capacity to navigate competing regulatory systems. Australia must continue to advocate for greater US involvement in the JSI. To maximise the benefits of the JSI, Australia needs a coordinated and forward-looking strategy. This includes enhancing digital infrastructure, particularly in regional areas, to ensure all businesses can participate in the digital economy. Upskilling the workforce is equally vital, as businesses will require employees with advanced digital and data skills to remain competitive. The JSI can help address market openness and job creation shortfalls. Introducing technology advancement initiatives, such as incentives for SMEs to adopt digital tools, will also foster innovation and growth across industries. The government should consider enacting a comprehensive omnibus law that consolidates digital trade regulations, aligning Australia’s legal framework with the JSI and reducing regulatory complexity for businesses. These suggestions equally apply to other signatories in the Asia Pacific, where a unified approach will foster regional development. The JSI offers a unique opportunity for Australia to solidify its role as a global leader in digital trade. By reducing barriers, fostering innovation and promoting a fairer digital economy, it creates a pathway for sustainable economic growth. But realising this potential requires more than rhetoric. It demands targeted investments, robust governance and a commitment to bridging the digital divide.

Asian democracies in doubt about DeepSeek	The release of China’s DeepSeek R1 generative AI model, purportedly built on significantly less computing power and money than comparable models, made headlines across the world. While much discussion is focused on how this moves US–China AI competition, the rest of Asia is assessing the impact of this new player on their AI governance and industrial policies from practical and rights-based perspectives. Examining policy moves by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in response to DeepSeek shows the importance of AI governance. Particularly in the areas of privacy protection and national security, AI governance is necessary for a successful cross-border AI industry to thrive in Asia and positioning these countries to take advantage of industry volatility. South Korea’s Personal Information Privacy Commission suspended the use of DeepSeek in South Korea due to concerns about the company’s collection and processing of personal data. The privacy regulator indicated that DeepSeek expressed its interest in actively cooperating with the authorities by appointing a local agent. South Korea’s approach has been balanced in that it noted that the deficiencies can be remedied and the services restored after improvements are made. It cited similar concerns that were raised by US-based AI services, such as OpenAI and Google AI services. South Korea is not favouring US-based AI over China’s tech sector, despite being a US ally, and privacy rules for AI companies are applied in a geopolitically non-discriminatory way. But the government’s actions do underscore the important role that AI governance will play in the country’s AI sector. This follows the passage of South Korea’s AI Basic Act, which contains provisions on AI governance, such as requirements for transparency, accountability and a risk-based tiered system of regulation. Such legislation is aligned with the growing international consensus on trustworthy AI, such as the OECD framework. At the same time, it promotes industrial policy to foster the AI industry at home and support the creation of more data centres, accessible training data and education for AI talent. In Taiwan, the Ministry of Digital Affairs imposed a moratorium on the use of DeepSeek in the public sector, citing national security concerns about data leakage. The concerns are bolstered by reports that DeepSeek spouts Chinese Communist Party propaganda regarding the status of Taiwan as an independent democratic society. Though Taiwan has blocked other Chinese apps from being used by the public sector, its overall policy regarding AI and algorithmic technology from China has been based on principles supporting freedom of speech and access to technology. Taiwan has not blocked TikTok, despite concerns from civil society that the app could be used to manipulate public opinion or spread disinformation. Taiwan also expects to pass an AI Basic Act, which will institutionalise the need for AI governance processes to adhere to international standards on trust, accountability and transparency. In Japan, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has taken note of the implications of DeepSeek’s release as a reason to continue moving towards the passage of an AI Basic Act. He said that legislation on AI, expected to come in 2025, should boost the technology while minimising risks and dangers. Tokyo banned the use of DeepSeek on government devices, as did numerous companies, citing data security and privacy concerns. Should the claims about DeepSeek’s compute intensity be accurate — and doubts exist about the very low price tag — this also spells an opportunity for many countries in Asia to enter the AI race without access to the advanced chips available in larger economies. But the moral of the DeepSeek story is that ignoring AI governance, including data security and privacy concerns, is not a recipe for long-term success. Countries that foster trustworthy AI, respect privacy and data protection and do not have objectionable political bias will be able to compete long-term across borders. Policies that ensure data and AI governance rules are interoperable will be key for building internationally competitive AI. Japan has led the way in developing rules for data free flow with trust at multilateral venues, such as APEC and the OECD. South Korea has taken the lead in global AI governance discussions. In 2024, it hosted the second iteration of the AI Safety Summit and the Responsible AI in the Military Domain Conference. Taiwan’s importance to global AI efforts cannot be understated, given that it produces the vast majority of the world’s advanced chips. The current administration has emphasised the importance of Taiwan to the ‘Democratic Supply Chain’. Taiwan is also considering an AI Basic Act to foster responsible AI development and use. With the right policies, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are well positioned to boost their domestic AI industries, despite regional volatility and geopolitical tension between the United States and China. As low-cost providers like DeepSeek continue to pick up steam, AI governance — complemented by rational infrastructure inputs — is crucial for a democratic AI supply chain.

The Taliban’s long game out of isolation	When the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021, the prevailing sentiment was that the regime would be an international pariah if it did not moderate its hardline positions. The Taliban’s violent past also made it inconceivable for some states to engage with it as the government of Afghanistan. Despite the Taliban’s repressive rule worsening considerably since it seized control in 2021, with restrictions on women taken to a new extreme and the reintroduction of brutal punishments for alleged moral crimes, the regime is overcoming its international isolation. More governments are prepared to look past the ethical dilemma of dealing with the Taliban and quasi-recognise it as the government of Afghanistan. India stepped up its outreach to the Taliban in January 2025, with India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Afghanistan’s acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi holding their first meeting. This is the highest level meeting between the two sides since India began small and indirect engagements with the Taliban after its return to power in 2021. For the Taliban, its meeting with India’s foreign secretary is a major diplomatic breakthrough given its tense and fractious relations with India since the 1990s. After this January 2025 meeting, the Taliban referred to India as a ‘significant regional and economic partner’. The sea change in relations likely stems from New Delhi not sensing any significant terrorist threats from the Taliban or groups allegedly linked to the Taliban. Worsening Taliban–Pakistan relations may have played a role in India’s outreach to the Taliban. Pakistan firmly backed the Taliban when it was mounting a comeback in Afghanistan. But since the Taliban’s return, border disputes and the rise of Pakistani Taliban militancy inside Pakistan have sent their relations into a downward spiral. The souring Pakistan–Afghanistan relations suggest New Delhi’s interests may not be as affected as feared when the Taliban took over in 2021. Despite India’s growing outreach, its relations with the Taliban are still very calibrated and limited — paling in comparison to China’s. Yet India’s outreach may be more diplomatically significant for the Taliban than China’s as it sets a precedent for Western democracies that also seek to strike a balance between not recognising the Taliban as the legitimate government, while engaging with it on necessary matters. Western governments, particularly the United States, were unfazed by some of India’s initial engagements, but now seem to recognise the necessity of limited engagements with the Taliban. It was revealed in January 2025 that the former Joe Biden administration negotiated with the Taliban to secure the release of two US prisoners in Afghanistan. In 2024, the Biden administration debated expanding direct engagements and cooperation with the Taliban to mount more effective counterterrorist activities. The return of US President Donald Trump is likely to change US–Taliban relations. Under Trump’s first administration, the United States pursued talks with the Taliban, culminating in the 2020 Doha Agreement that facilitated the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump’s return increases the possibility of greater US engagements with the Taliban, though it has also created uncertainties. President Trump was critical of how the US departure from Afghanistan was handled under the Biden administration. In January 2025, Trump said that the Taliban needed to return US military equipment in Afghanistan as a precondition for future financial assistance. The Taliban have also said that they seek a ‘new chapter’ in their relations with the United States under the second Trump administration. The biggest roadblock for the West engaging with the Taliban has been its repressive policies and human rights violations. But there are now compelling reasons for the West to engage with the Taliban. Western sanctions, in addition to having no effect on the Taliban’s draconian governance, have worsened humanitarian conditions in Afghanistan. Despite the sanctions’ ineffectiveness, it is unclear whether the West would go as far as to lift the sanctions. Instead, Western countries might find ways to work with the regime on specific issues. Foremost among these issues is addressing the growing presence of terrorist groups in Afghanistan — such as Al-Qaeda, a Taliban ally, and the reviving Islamic State–Khorasan Province. The growing Chinese influence in Afghanistan also has Western countries concerned that turning their backs on Afghanistan may work to China’s advantage. China perceives Afghanistan as a gateway for China’s Belt and Road Initiative projects in Central Asia and seeks to exploit the country’s vast and untapped natural reserves. Though more governments are now prepared to engage with the Taliban, the Taliban’s most strategic relationship will likely remain with China. China–Taliban relations are comprehensive and long-term, spanning economic, political and security cooperation. China does not recognise the Taliban but was the first to accept a Taliban envoy. China and the Taliban have inked several notable agreements, including China granting the Taliban tariff-free trade access in October 2024, which could provide an economic boost to the cash-strapped regime. But China’s relations with the Taliban are also not without problems. Some Afghanistan-based terrorist groups have China on their radar and pose security concerns in the sensitive Chinese border provinces. The Taliban’s affiliates have previously attacked Chinese interests in neighbouring Pakistan. Despite these concerns, Beijing appears committed to strengthening its relationship with the Taliban, focusing on mutual security, technological exchanges and investments. Another diplomatic breakthrough for the Taliban is its improving relations with Russia. Russia invited the Taliban to the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum, among other meetings held in Russia in 2024. Russia also decided to remove the Taliban from its list of terrorist organisations. These overtures suggest Russia is seeking closer relations with the Taliban. The Taliban played a long waiting game, biding its time since the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. It ultimately prevailed by returning to power as soon as the United States withdrew 20 years later. Growing diplomatic engagements prove that the Taliban is again capable of playing a long game to wear down governments into a quasi-acceptance and recognition of its draconian rule.

Indonesia’s BRICS accession underscored by Prabowo’s self interest	In his 2025 Annual Press Statement, Indonesian Foreign Minister Sugiono provided justifications for President Prabowo Subianto&#8217;s decision for Indonesia to formally join BRICS. He touted Indonesia&#8217;s fast acceptance into BRICS as a personal accomplishment of Prabowo and described Indonesia&#8217;s positioning in the grouping as an advocate for the interests of developing countries. Sugiono also described Indonesia&#8217;s decision to join BRICS as a manifestation of its ‘independent and active’ (bebas aktif) foreign policy. Indonesia is also active in other multilateral groupings, including its ongoing process to join the OECD. In other words, Indonesia&#8217;s entry into BRICS is a manifestation of Prabowo&#8217;s ambition to be the leader of the Global South, who will actively bridge between the Global ‘North’ and ‘South’. Prabowo believes that Indonesia had the capability and willingness to do so — and that he is the right person to take the lead. There are undoubtedly some potential benefits in joining BRICS for Indonesia. BRICS is seen as a credible alternative to other major Western-centric groupings, making it attractive to countries in the Global South tired of Western dominance. It could also expand Indonesia&#8217;s potential export markets, considering that BRICS states account for 46 per cent of global GDP and over half of the world&#8217;s population, if Indonesia gains access to preferential trade treatment with BRICS members. The problem is that at this point, the benefits of joining BRICS are mostly symbolic. First, it will be difficult for Prabowo to become the leader of the Global South when many loud voices already exist within BRICS. South African President Cyril Rhamaposa, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have all already staked their claims to this role. Prabowo is essentially stepping into an already rapacious bunch, making it difficult to be heard above the din. A parallel can be drawn with the 1961 Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Belgrade, former Yugoslavia, where then-Indonesian president Sukarno and then-Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who both regarded themselves as the leaders of the Third World, clashed over their vision of the Third World Movement ‘to a point necessitating friendly intervention by third parties on the very first day of the conference’. And with China dominating BRICS through the sheer force of its economy and Russia trying to steer the grouping to challenge US global leadership, it is difficult to see how Prabowo can effectively use BRICS to lead the Global South while maintaining Indonesia&#8217;s independent and active foreign policy. Second, regardless of economic potentials from joining BRICS, China — a key member of BRICS — has already been Indonesia&#8217;s biggest trading partner. And most trade between BRICS members comes from trade with China, while trade between other members remains low. The exception is trade between India and Russia, which skyrocketed in the aftermath of Western sanctions after Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine. Adding the economic problems currently facing BRICS states to the calculus, the economic gains Indonesia can expect from joining BRICS remains questionable. Third, the United States under President Donald Trump seems less willing to play the usual diplomatic niceties. This is clearly shown by the new administration&#8217;s shoot-from-the-hip approach, including in its imposition of tariffs on its closest neighbours and partners in what has been called ‘the dumbest trade war in history’. Considering the ongoing tariff war between the United States and Indonesia’s ‘sleepwalking’ into strategic alignment with China in pursuit of economic gains, Indonesia&#8217;s entry into BRICS may cause more problems than it is worth. And more troubling is how Prabowo, in his desire to accrue foreign policy accomplishments, is seeming to neglect ASEAN. In December 2024, Indonesian Foreign Minister Sugiono skipped an informal ASEAN foreign ministers&#8217; meeting in Bangkok to accompany Prabowo to Cairo to attend the Developing Eight (D–8) Summit. In his Annual Press Statement, Sugiono barely mentioned ASEAN and did not articulate any new agendas, commitments or policies about Indonesia&#8217;s leadership in ASEAN. In his haste to portray himself as a global leader, Prabowo seems to be abdicating from Indonesia&#8217;s regional leadership. This could prove unwise — ASEAN is arguably the most effective platform that Prabowo can use to advance Indonesia&#8217;s ambitions to become the leader of the Global South. While Prabowo may see many benefits in joining BRICS, he seems to be motivated more by personal ambition for international recognition and to be able to declare achievements his first 100 days as president, rather than clear strategic considerations around strengthening Indonesia&#8217;s position as the leader of the Global South.

India’s double standards on minority rights	India’s democratic traditions and secular constitution stand in growing contradiction to its treatment of minorities. While the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticises the treatment of Hindus in Bangladesh, it oversees systemic marginalisation and discrimination against Indian Muslims. This duplicity not only undermines India’s claim to moral high ground but also risks destabilising regional relations in South Asia. In late 2024, the Hindu monk Chinmoy Das was arrested in Bangladesh on charges of alleged ‘anti-state activities’ and subsequently denied bail. When his followers attacked the High Court and killed a Muslim government lawyer, Bangladesh’s stakeholders acted decisively to prevent the situation from escalating into communal violence. Mahfuj Alam, an influential cabinet member and a key coordinator of Bangladesh’s uprising against the government of former prime minister Sheikh Hasinah, posted on social media calling for ensuring security for innocent minorities. Indian media and pro-BJP and Hindutva organisations ignored the killing, instead portraying Das’s arrest as evidence of Hindu oppression in Bangladesh. Hindu groups staged protests outside Bangladeshi embassies in Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai. In Agartala, protesters attacked the Bangladeshi consulate. Indian politicians escalated the matter by calling for a blockade of India–Bangladesh trade. It is undeniable that attacks on Hindus have occurred in Bangladesh, but India tends to politicise these incidents. According to Ain o Salish Kendra, a prominent rights group in Bangladesh, 3679 attacks on the Hindu community took place between January 2013 and September 2021, while Sheikh Hasina was in power. But the interim government in Bangladesh, led by Mohammad Yunus, acknowledged attacks on minorities in August, reporting 88 cases filed and 70 arrests. Despite this, Indian media outlets focus on issues that serve their clickbait-driven journalism. The contrast with India’s domestic response to anti-Muslim violence is significant. In November 2024, while Indians protested nationwide for Das, three Muslim men in Uttar Pradesh were killed for opposing a archaeological survey of the Mughal-era Shahi Jama Masjid, which was accused of being built over a Hindu temple. The Indian media largely ignored these deaths. In India, Muslims live under constant threat of violence. They are often accused of carrying beef — anathema to some devout Hindus — or face baseless allegations of being Bangladeshi or Rohingya migrants. This hostility extends beyond online hate speech and manifests in real-life incidents. Shortly after Hasina fled to Ghaziabad from Bangladesh, members of the Hindu Raksha Dal vandalised a local slum, assaulting residents and labelling them as Bangladeshis and Rohingya solely based on their Muslim identity. In August 2024, Saabir Malik, a Muslim boy from West Bengal was beaten to death in Haryana on false accusations of carrying beef. Between 2010–17, 28 Indians — 24 of them Muslims — were killed, and 124 others injured in cow-related violence. The so-called ‘cow vigilante’ violence targeting Muslims tends to increase during election periods. In 2019, eight Muslims were killed under accusations of carrying beef or stealing cows. In 2024, during the general election campaign, nine Muslims were murdered in similar circumstances. These incidents are aimed at capturing the support of radical Hindu voters. The oppression of Muslim minorities in India has intensified under BJP rule, particularly since 2014. The irony is stark — while the BJP accuses Bangladesh of persecuting its minorities, it fails to address the plight of its own. Bangladeshi issues have frequently become a focal point in Indian election campaigns in Assam, West Bengal and Jharkhand. BJP leaders have made inflammatory comments about Bangladeshis, labelling them as infiltrators. Issues related to Bangladesh and its people are amplified to serve Indian electoral interests while domestic incidents of communal violence often receive muted responses. This approach fuels bigotry and deepens societal divides, weaponising fear for political gains. India’s selective approach to minority rights raises serious questions about its regional and moral leadership. While the BJP claims to champion the rights of Bangladesh’s minorities, it ignores the plight of Indian Muslims and other marginalised communities. This hypocrisy erodes India’s credibility both regionally and globally, tarnishing its image as a democratic leader. The politicisation of Bangladesh’s minority issues for domestic electoral gains is a dangerous precedent, undermining the aspirations of millions who seek peace and dignity on both sides of the border. By scapegoating Bangladesh, India also risks alienating a trusted ally and destabilising regional relations that are crucial for South Asia’s collective development. India must uphold higher standards by prioritising minority rights and regional cooperation over divisive politics. The path forward lies in mutual respect, dialogue and a shared commitment to regional stability and prosperity. To address religious tensions, India and Bangladesh could establish a joint regional commission dedicated to addressing communal violence and minority rights. Non-state actors could provide independent assessments of communal incidents to prevent political exploitation. Media organisations have a critical role, countering misinformation and ensuring that minority issues are not manipulated for electoral gains. Initiatives such as youth exchanges, interfaith festivals and cross-border media collaboration could counter divisive narratives and promote greater understanding between communities.

Can Vietnam’s ‘era of rising’ break the middle-income trap?	Vietnam has set its sights on becoming a high-income country by 2045, a bold ambition that marks a critical turning point in its economic trajectory. General Secretary To Lam’s vision for an ‘era of rising’ focuses on technology-driven growth and industrial modernisation. But turning this vision into reality demands more than just rhetoric, with the country facing major structural hurdles from institutional bottlenecks to global economic headwinds. The ruling Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) is expected to officially endorse the ‘era of rising’ at its 14th National Congress in January 2026. To Lam and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh are pushing for economic modernisation, digital transformation and industrial upgrading. But so far the execution has been uneven. Vietnam remains heavily reliant on low-cost manufacturing and foreign direct investment (FDI), raising concerns about its long-term economic resilience. Despite government incentives for high-tech industries and digital infrastructure, bureaucratic inefficiencies and regulatory inconsistencies continue to stifle private sector growth. Without institutional reforms that enhance transparency and streamline decision-making, Vietnam risks stagnation rather than an economic take-off. Vietnam’s current economic strategy lacks a vision for how to respond to rising US trade protectionism. Washington’s push for reshoring production and imposing higher tariffs could disrupt Vietnam’s export-driven model. While Vietnam is part of major trade agreements like the CPTPP and RCEP, structural limitations prevent it from fully capitalising on these deals. Deepening economic ties with the US, especially in high-value sectors such as semiconductor manufacturing and digital services, will position Vietnam favourably. Vietnam must also adopt a more proactive trade diplomacy strategy to navigate shifting global supply chains and maintain its competitive edge. Vietnam targets annual GDP growth of 6–7 per cent, but inefficient resource allocation threatens this goal. While the Red River Delta and Southeast regions receive the highest public investment, some high-growth regions remain underfunded, leading to infrastructure and service bottlenecks. Urbanisation is accelerating, with Vietnam’s urban population rising from 30.5 per cent in 2010 to 41.5 per cent in 2022. Larger population centres such as Ho Chi Minh City face mounting infrastructure pressures, while rural provinces such as Thanh Hoa struggle with depopulation. A longer-term and more dynamic investment strategy is needed to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth across the country. On the political front, the CPV’s anti-corruption campaign — dubbed the ‘burning furnace’ — has bolstered public trust in governance but has also created unintended consequences. Fear of scrutiny has led to bureaucratic paralysis, with officials hesitant to approve major economic and infrastructure projects. A more balanced approach is necessary — one that enforces accountability without stifling decision-making. Transparent regulatory mechanisms can provide much-needed clarity for both domestic and foreign investors. The World Bank defines high-income economies as those with a GNI per capita above US$13,205 (the 2023 threshold). Vietnam’s current GNI per capita stands at around US$4,110 — a significant gap that will require major economic transformation to overcome. The experiences of South Korea and Singapore offer valuable lessons. Both nations successfully transitioned to high-income status through targeted reforms, human capital development and investment in innovation. On the other hand, other Southeast Asian nations have been left behind due to persistent structural constraints. Vietnam’s next steps should be to prioritise education reform, research and development and the integration of domestic firms into global supply chains. Decree No. 111/2015/ND-CP aims to boost Vietnam’s supporting industries, but progress has been slow. But escaping the middle-income trap is not just about hitting an income threshold. Long-term success depends on institutional quality, economic complexity and a strong innovation ecosystem. At the National Conference on Breakthroughs in Science, Technology, Innovation and National Digital Transformation in January 2025, To Lam underscored the need for investment in science and technology. While the government has allocated 3 per cent of its annual budget to research and development, actual implementation remains weak. To address this, Vietnam plans to increase funding to 2 per cent of GDP by 2030, aligning with the Politburo’s Resolution No. 57 (December 2024). The ‘era of rising’ is more than a slogan — it is a test of Vietnam’s ability to break free from structural limitations and emerge as a high-income economy. The next two decades will determine whether the country achieves this goal or remains stuck in economic stagnation. The path forward requires decisive action: institutional reforms to enhance governance, policies that attract high-value investment and a strategic shift towards innovation-driven growth. With the right balance of state-led direction and market-driven dynamism, Vietnam has the potential to rise to new heights in the global economy.

Pakistan’s path forward requires more than economic recovery	Pakistan’s 2024 witnessed economic uncertainties, political instability, social unrest and the resurgence of terrorism, marking a grim period. These challenges were not isolated incidents, but manifestations of a broader systemic failure that has persisted for decades. The inability to address these issues comprehensively has left the country in a state of crisis, demanding a transformational change in governance and planning. The February 2024 election was one of the most rigid and contested elections in Pakistan’s history, resulting in a fragile coalition government led by the Pakistan Muslim League with the support of the Pakistan People’s Party. The election deepened polarisation and raised questions about the legitimacy of key institutions such as the election commission, the judiciary and the central authority. 2024 saw a significant increase in terrorist activities along the border, especially with Afghanistan, exacerbating national security concerns. Pakistan’s abysmally low ranking in political stability deterred investment, hampered governance and undermined the long-term prospects of the nation. But the completion of the IMF Stand-By Arrangement and the signing of a new US$7 billion Extended Fund Facility for three years provided much-needed economic support. Additional support through rollovers of deposits from China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates stabilised the external account. These developments were accompanied by significant macroeconomic improvements. The policy rate fell from 22 per cent to 12 per cent, inflation dropped from 29.7 per cent in December 2023 to 4.1 per cent by December 2024 and remittances surged by 32.8 per cent. This helped the current account post a provisional US$1.2 billion surplus for the second half of 2025. The stock market reflected renewed confidence, with unprecedented gains signalling optimism among investors. Despite macroeconomic stabilisation, GDP growth in July–September 2024 was 0.9 per cent, driven primarily by agriculture. The industrial sector — which holds the key to export-driven growth — continued to struggle with negative growth, a worrying sign for a country striving to build export surpluses. Pakistan will hardly manage 3 per cent GDP growth in 2025. Rising poverty and persistent unemployment further compounded the socioeconomic challenges. Pakistan’s tax base remained critically narrow and fiscal deficits are raising concerns about debt sustainability. Public debt-to-GDP ratios remained high, with increasing reliance on external borrowing to meet fiscal obligations. Despite efforts to improve investor confidence, actual foreign direct investment inflows in 2024 fell short of projections. The Federal Board of Revenue also failed to meet its tax collection targets despite imposing heavy taxes. Pakistan continues to lag in adopting modern technology-driven economic solutions. Internet access remained slow and inconsistent, hindering e-business and innovation, while public sector inefficiencies continued to plague governance. As 2025 begins, Pakistan faces a critical juncture. Pakistan launched the Uraan Pakistan five-year plan to redefine the country’s economic trajectory, but its success hinges on a fundamental shift in how challenges are addressed. The Vision 2025 and Vision 2047 initiatives had been presented with similar ambitions but lacked effective government assessment and follow-up. Uraan Pakistan is following the same pattern, not incorporating lessons from past failures, risking the repetition of unfulfilled promises rather than ensuring implementation. Pakistan needs a new direction — a systems-based framework that addresses the interconnectedness of its challenges and charts a path towards sustainable progress. A systems-based model views Pakistan’s challenges as interconnected elements of a larger ecosystem. Each stakeholder — the parliament, the establishment, the judiciary, the media, civil society, academia and the public — represents a critical node in this system. Any dysfunction in one node inevitably disrupts the entire system, as was evident in 2024. Parliament’s inability to legislate effectively created policy gridlock, while judicial overreach undermined executive authority. Media sensationalism fuelled social unrest and bureaucratic inefficiency stalled reforms. Economic transformation must be predicated upon systemic reform. Pakistan needs to transition from a fragmented and crisis-driven model to an integrated ecosystem that prioritises innovation, inclusivity and sustainability. Regulatory simplification is essential to make it easier for businesses to operate, while the tax base must be broadened to reduce fiscal deficits and directed towards digital infrastructure and human capital development. Industrial revitalisation is critical — targeted incentives and technological improvements can drive export-led growth and integrate Pakistan into global value chains. The Uraan plan must be recalibrated to reflect these priorities. Digital transformation should be at the forefront, with investments in high-speed internet and digital infrastructure that enable e-commerce and innovation. Education reforms are equally vital and research and development should be incentivised to foster innovation. Political stability is the linchpin of systemic reform. A national dialogue involving all political parties and civil society is essential to build consensus on critical reforms. Transparent electoral processes are needed, and governance must focus on long-term objectives that transcend party lines. Transparency and accountability must begin at the top, with the prime minister and cabinet leading by example. 2025 must not be another year of inertia. It must be the year Pakistan breaks free from the cycles of crisis that have defined its past. This is not an easy path, but it is the only path forward. The systemic approach is not just about solving problems — it is about creating a framework where problems are less likely to arise in the first place. It is about shifting from reactive governance to proactive, integrated planning. Pakistan has the potential to emerge stronger, but this requires bold decisions, unwavering commitment and a shared vision for the future.

India needs a strategy reboot after US AI controls	Just before leaving office, former US president Joe Biden passed two policies on artificial intelligence (AI). The policies are said to be the most vital releases since the October 2023 Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of AI as it marks a major shift in US AI export control policy and introduces a roadmap to build AI infrastructure domestically. The Trump Administration did not immediately revoke the two policies — unlike other AI decisions of the Biden Administration — reflecting an unexpected policy continuity. These policies will have a spillover effect onto other countries, including India, which will need to effect subtle short- and long-term policy shifts to cope with the new Cold War. The Framework for AI Diffusion — the first of the two policies instituted by former president Biden – aims to implement export controls on AI diffusion. It seeks to protect US tech hegemony against efforts by China, Iran, Russia and North Korea to use high-tech US AI accelerator chips like Nvidia H100-equivalent chips and innovations in AI and computing infrastructure. The Framework divides countries into three tiers based on their relative alignment with US interests and ability to prevent US adversaries from using their territory as indirect routes to buy US chips. Tier 1 countries include 18 US allies that do not face AI import restrictions. Tier 2 countries, including India, must create data centre authorisation programs or individual licenses to engage with US companies and implement safeguards against tier 3 country interference. Tier 3 countries such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea face stringent import restrictions on US technologies. The second of the two policies — the Presidential Executive Order on Advancing United States Leadership in Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure — aims to enhance the country’s domestic energy capacity so that it can build energy-intensive frontier AI data centres and computing infrastructure with the help of clean energy. The Framework mandates US companies keep 50 per cent of their compute capacity within domestic territory. This makes the Executive Order important in helping develop energy capacity to support this domestic focus and attracting investments in computing infrastructure. Industry players have criticised these restrictions as they complicate efforts to build overseas AI infrastructure, while mandatory indigenisation increases costs. It is not immediately clear why the United States put India on the tier 2 list given growing India–US technological collaboration. Some experts argue that the United States is concerned that Indian companies may be used to divert US resources to adversaries like Russia. This is the case for other countries on the tier 2 list — Israel and Singapore were both gateways for illegal imports of US technology to China. These policy decisions create impediments for the India–US technology partnership, which had otherwise been improving since the signing of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies. Similarly to previous US restrictions on sharing critical technologies with India, such as nuclear reactors for civilian purposes and cryogenic engines for space rockets, recent decisions will raise questions about US credibility in helping build India’s technological capabilities. The Framework challenges India’s efforts to build AI infrastructure and buy high-end chips. India should co-opt the US Framework by negotiating a bilateral arrangement that allows companies from both countries to cooperate without regulatory hindrances. The Framework itself facilitates this through a special review mechanism called the General Validated End User which gives Indian companies leeway to purchase restricted items for civilian and military — excluding nuclear — purposes. During Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Trump’s meeting on 13–14 February 2025, both nations agreed to launch the US–India TRUST (‘Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology’) initiative, representing a significant step towards accelerating US AI infrastructure in India. Continuous US–India engagement on critical technology has built enough confidence to effectively negotiate authorisation and licensing agreements as required for tier 2 countries. The latest joint statement by Modi and Trump reaffirmed cooperation on building next-generation data centres, advancing AI-focused computing and processor development and easing regulatory barriers. But the Framework obstructs India’s ambitions to build local AI data centres by mandating companies based in tier 1 countries retain 75 per cent of their total AI computing power within tier 1 nations, while limiting their computing capacity in tier 2 countries to just 7 per cent. If India implements the data localisation provisions in its Draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules 2025, it may be practically impossible for India to get tier 1 nations to establish data centres in India or even store Indian data within its physical boundaries. India must pursue a bilateral arrangement with the United States for cross-border data flows and protection of its citizens’ data stored in US data centres, like the US–EU Privacy Shield. New Delhi must adopt a clear policy on data localisation amid the confusion created by the Data Protection law’s multiple iterations since 2018. India must also substantially enhance its energy capacity to accommodate AI data centre operators’ energy needs. Bipartisan support within the United States for a nationalist AI policy to tackle competition with China means that India must adapt its strategy. The Trump Administration will likely continue — if not expand — the policy. India must pivot to navigate geopolitical challenges while balancing its technological progress and security needs.

Rebuilding trust in China’s food safety system	A food scandal has rocked China, following a report from state-backed media The Beijing News on 2 July 2024, which revealed that Hopefull Grain &amp; Oil Group and China Grain Reserves Oil and Fat had used fuel trucks to transport edible oils without undergoing a mandatory cleaning process for years. The government reacted rapidly, initiating joint investigations, detaining the truck owner and drivers and launching a nationwide rectification campaign towards edible oil transportation. Still, the event evoked harsh criticism and extensive anxiety over China’s food safety. The Chinese government has long been struggling with food safety issues. In 2009, China enacted its Food Safety Law, followed by amendments in 2015, 2018 and 2021. Since 2016, China has been committed to implementing a ‘zero tolerance’ policy for food safety violations and established two national networks to monitor food contamination risks and food-borne illnesses. According to the 2024 ‘Research Report on Food Safety Status in China’, the pass rate for food sampling inspections remained above 97 per cent from 2019–23. But public trust in food safety remains low. A survey conducted by Jiangnan University in 2022 showed that only 47.2 per cent of respondents were satisfied with local food safety, though 59.4 per cent expressed confidence in prospects for future changes to food safety procedures. The oil scandal has once again pushed China’s food safety issue to the forefront. Now the concern is not only coming from the Chinese public, but also the international community given China’s recent visa-free policies attracted 8.54 million international tourists in the first half of 2024, a 190.1 per cent increase from 2023. The sense of insecurity regarding China’s food system could undermine the willingness of tourists to travel to China. China’s food safety problem has also severely damaged the international reputation of Chinese food businesses and sparked concerns about the loss of competitiveness for food exports. China’s food safety problem primarily lies in its weak regulatory enforcement. Complex food supply chains and the emergence of internet-based sales platforms call for cross-departmental, cross-level and cross-regional regulatory enforcement, which remain lax and clumsy. Inadequate punishments for food safety violations incentivise producers to produce and sell non-compliant food as the benefits of violating safety laws exceed the costs. Corruption is also a significant challenge. There have been numerous reports of canteen contractors and school principals colluding to provide poor quality food to students. The framework of co-regulation with businesses and the public remains underdeveloped, which weakens regulatory oversight. Beijing must urgently implement concrete solutions to regain the public’s trust in food safety measures. The government must improve its enforcement capacity to respond effectively to public outrage in the wake of food safety scandals. Mainstream media channels, especially official ones, must take the lead in providing accurate and timely information to minimise the spread of inaccurate information on social media during food crises. Administrative procedures for official media responses should be simplified to improve the efficiency of communication with the public. Stakeholders outside government must also improve public communication channels. Businesses should establish or support non-profit public information centres that provide science-based food safety information. China can also leverage social media by creating portals for reporting food safety problems to foster public awareness and participation. China must also strengthen its whistleblower protection system and raise rewards for reporting violations. The government must also fix loopholes and weaknesses in its food safety management system. China should expand nationally unified standards and align them to international benchmarks. Though China has issued 1610 entries of food safety standards — covering over 340 food types — several problems remain, including relatively low standards, an incomplete food classification system and insufficient mandatory standards. More severe punishments should be imposed on businesses for food safety violations. China should implement a risk-based rating mechanism and system to allocate regulatory measures with different intensities based on comprehensive assessments of businesses’ risk levels according to factors such as business characteristics, random inspection records and regional attributes. Beijing must strengthen cross-regional supervision. With the development of retail food markets, especially food e-commerce, production and consumption of food products increasingly involve multiple jurisdictions. Data sharing platforms and joint law enforcement mechanisms between different regions are necessary to enable a more coordinated response to food safety risks and curb the challenges of administrative division. China has one of the most advanced information technology systems in the world, which could be more extensively employed to empower food safety regulation by integrating online and offline regulation and facilitate fast information dissemination and transparent state–citizen interaction.

China stands to gain from South Korea’s political crisis	On 15 January 2025, Yoon Suk-yeol cemented his name in the history books, becoming the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested. In the month following this event, one of Asia’s most vibrant democracies and a key global economic player has found itself mired in political chaos. This chaos came to a head with Yoon’s impeachment following his controversial declaration of martial law in December 2024. Yoon’s arrest by the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials sealed the fate of his political career. His impeachment, indictment and ongoing criminal trial has left the nation in leadership limbo. South Korea’s political crisis stems from deep domestic fissures. Yoon’s martial law declaration — justified as a move against pro-North Korean anti-state forces — was widely perceived as a self-serving gambit to retain power amid declining approval ratings and opposition dominance in the National Assembly. While public opinion overwhelmingly supports Yoon’s removal, mistrust in the opposition Democratic Party (DP) also remains high, reflecting a broader disillusionment with both major parties. The uncertainty has sparked mass protests, shaken public trust and destabilised South Korea’s political institutions. Acting president Han Duck-soo has also been impeached, leaving Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as the interim leader. But this turmoil is not just a domestic affair. South Korea’s ambitions to move beyond middle power status to a ’global pivotal actor’ while being a strategic US ally and an economic powerhouse means its internal challenges carry global significance. Its political paralysis comes at a time of heightened US–China competition, with Seoul caught in the middle. Interestingly, South Korea’s political crisis has drawn ethnic Chinese into the narrative as a scapegoat, even as Beijing emerges as a beneficiary. The role of ethnic Chinese residents in South Korea is becoming a strategic angle of discussion. The Hwagyo (ethnic Chinese immigrants) community is politicised in South Korea, with discriminatory policies and social bullying reported since the 1950s even as China continues to dominate immigration numbers to South Korea. The recent crisis has seen a rise in anti-Chinese sentiments, with members of Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) accusing ethnic Chinese residents of supporting pro-impeachment rallies. Beijing was also made a central issue during the trial as Yoon’s attorneys raised concerns about alleged Chinese interference in South Korea via its ‘companies and people residing in South Korea’ to ’fund and support’ pro-China activities. Disinformation in South Korean media has fuelled Sinophobia, with a striking example being the circulation of a false story claiming that United States Forces Korea had arrested 99 Chinese spies linked to election rigging and transferred them to Okinawa. Although debunked, this narrative has gained traction among conservative commentators, reflecting the deeply polarised information ecosystem shaping public discourse. A known follower of far-right YouTube channels, Yoon has been influenced by these conversations. On 12 December 2024, Yoon framed his martial law declaration as a necessary response to growing security threats and foreign interference. Pointing to two incidents of Chinese nationals allegedly surveilling US–South Korean military sites in June and November, he further accused opponents of obstructing anti-espionage legislation. Beijing swiftly condemned these claims. The Chinese embassy in Seoul issued a direct warning to Chinese expatriates, advising them to avoid political gatherings to prevent legal repercussions, including potential deportation. By issuing this warning and framing Seoul’s actions as discriminatory, Beijing is positioning itself as a defender of overseas Chinese communities, reinforcing its extraterritorial influence. Allegations of Chinese espionage and involvement in pro-impeachment protests have fuelled Sinophobia in South Korea, playing into Beijing’s hands by deepening domestic discord. Chinese state media like Global Times and Xinhua have amplified narratives of South Korean democratic dysfunction, contrasting it with China’s own model of political stability. This allows Beijing to simultaneously deflect criticism of its own governance while sowing doubt about the efficacy of US-led alliances. Despite increasing Sinophobia, Beijing stands to gain from South Korea’s political crisis. Beyond a favourable change in political leadership, the turmoil has also provided China with opportunities in the maritime domain. The resumption of Chinese installations in the Yellow Sea amid Seoul’s leadership vacuum is not a coincidence but a calculated move to push for control over disputed waters. Beijing’s approach mirrors its South China Sea strategy — gradually altering facts on the ground through infrastructure development and military presence while dismissing diplomatic protests as baseless. With South Korea’s political institutions paralysed and its security apparatus preoccupied with internal instability, China faces minimal resistance, making this an opportune moment to expand its influence. The timing of these actions suggests that Beijing sees South Korea’s domestic unrest as a window to consolidate territorial claims that would otherwise face strong diplomatic and military pushback. Beyond allowing for territorial manoeuvres, South Korea’s internal division continues to work in Beijing’s favour should the DP come to power in place of Yoon’s PPP. Viewed as a largely pro-China and anti-Japan party, a DP government would bode ill for South Korea–Japan relations and influence the stability of the US–South Korea alliance. South Korea’s political crisis underscores the fragility of democracies in a polarised world. For China, it is a chance to exploit divisions and project itself as a stabilising force. For South Korea, it is a reminder of the importance of resilience — in both governance and regional strategy. The crisis is a pivotal moment, testing alliances, exposing vulnerabilities and reshaping regional dynamics.

An intelligent approach to the artificial intelligence boom	Big technological breakthroughs always bring major economic upheaval. From the Industrial Revolution onwards, economies that are nimble and able to adapt to productivity shocks are the ones that enjoy the most growth during periods of rapid technological change. Managing the transition is never easy and requires a delicate balance between facilitating innovation, mitigating job displacement when it happens and ensuring that the macroeconomic settings are right so that countries can capture the long-term benefits of a technological change. The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution that is now hard upon us will be no different. Predicting how new technologies affect structural change is always difficult, and their impacts have historically been both overestimated and underestimated: many everyday items like the microwave were on their introduction heralded as capable of revolutionising our lives. On the other hand, as eminent economist Paul Krugman famously suggested, the internet might have the same productivity effect as the fax machine. It’s too early to tell whether AI is more microwave or Internet, but the rapid pace of improvement suggests that even if its full impact is limited to a segment of the economy, the increase it brings in the productivity of labour will not be minor. AI also promises to push productivity upward in the services sector, which typically lags behind productivity growth in the goods sector. This could revive economies like Japan’s, or the eurozone’s, that are stagnating in the face of major demographic headwinds. In this week’s lead article, Amit Singh and Adam Triggs argue that AI’s disruptive potential is fundamentally a macroeconomic challenge rather than a purely technological one. Their simulation of an AI-driven productivity boom highlights some major policy imperatives — increasing the investment capacity of national economies, reforms that make financial markets more efficient and making sure that labour can adapt and talented workers can easily move to areas where the return to their skills are most needed. It’s a compelling roadmap and one that should help policymakers in the Asia Pacific region plan for what will likely be a turbulent decade. ‘Upskilling the workforce will be key’, say Singh and Triggs. ‘The AI boom creates new jobs and higher wages, particularly in STEM fields, which will encourage more people to train in those areas. But the lag-time in this upskilling means that it is crucial to get ahead of the curve and use direct subsidies to start upskilling quickly in STEM capabilities. And developed economies need to increase skilled migration, not reduce it. If businesses can’t expand due to a lack of skilled workers, the economy won’t get the full benefits of the AI boom’. Just as the Huguenot refugees in England helped provide the skilled labour necessary for the first Industrial Revolution, skilled migrants will play a major role in building capacity in AI. The growing global backlash against immigration will only hold economies back from building the workforce they need. Singh and Triggs emphasise the importance of access to savings, arguing that countries with deeper capital markets and sound fiscal policies will be best positioned to make the most of AI-driven growth. Doing so requires policymakers to swim against a strong protectionist and regulatory current, made more dangerous with the re-election of US President Donald Trump. The mood in Europe as well as Washington is darkening and the world economy is at risk of fracturing on geopolitical as well as economic lines. Technological revolutions like AI do not respect national boundaries, though. Policymakers in Asia will need to be bold in rejecting the inward turn of the North Atlantic economies. If the global economy fractures into competing blocs, access to AI-related technology, talent and capital may be determined more by geopolitical alliances than by market forces. Responding to the deteriorating institutional environment and the AI boom both ought to point in the same policy direction — a buttressing of the liberal economic order among countries for which it is an economic necessity and the pursuit of sound macroeconomic policy. On the domestic front, labour mobility will be key. Removing barriers to that mobility — such as non-compete clauses and occupational licensing restrictions — are tangible reforms that can help, but the real challenge will be in managing the social and political dimensions of AI-driven structural change. It’s too soon to tell what shape this labour market disruption might take, but the experience of the United States during the ‘China shock’, where poorly functioning tax and transfer systems did little to cushion the economic blow for workers in manufacturing, suggests that a failure to manage the politics of economic change could have big long-run political consequences. For policymakers this is a marathon, as Singh and Triggs suggest, not a sprint. Policy needs to be responsive to new developments but also offer stability for investors. Far from an easy challenge at the best of times, this is a challenge that will prove extremely daunting for a world that seems to be daily retreating into isolation, driven by baffling policy decisions in Washington. But for those leaders who value economic growth and social cohesion, Singh and Triggs offer as good a blueprint as is out there for getting policy settings right for the next major technological revolution.

Getting macro-ready for the AI race	If there was any doubt that we’re in an artificial intelligence (AI) race, Donald Trump’s 21 January 2025 announcement of a US$500 billion private investment in building data centres and advancing AI chips removes it. Even the UK government is joining in, unveiling an AI plan on 13 January 2025 with 50 recommendations to boost innovation and efficiency. All this was before China’s DeepSeek rocked the foundations of the AI world, delivering the same results as Western companies at dramatically lower cost. With AI coming in fast, a common question is how we can minimise the risks from the technology. But an equally important question which doesn’t get asked as much is: how can we maximise its benefits? After all, for any given level of risk, we will want to make sure we are getting the biggest bang for our buck. This might sound like a tech question. But it’s largely a question for macroeconomics. Olivier Blanchard said recently that DeepSeek was ‘probably the largest positive total factor productivity shock in the history of the world’. So we used a computable general equilibrium model to simulate exactly that: an AI boom where productivity takes off across countries as firms and households adopt new AI technologies to explore how the benefits to GDP from this boom differed depending on the government’s policy settings. We identify four key lessons for policymakers in Asia and around the world if they want to get the most out of the AI boom. First, the AI boom will see a major increase in investment, along with a significant increase in demand for savings to finance that investment. This could lead to a problem — if the demand for savings outstrips the supply of savings, interest rates rise, dampening the investment boom and offsetting some of the benefits to the community. Unsurprisingly, we found that the countries that have access to more savings will do better than the countries that don’t. For policymakers, this means that governments should continue to reduce debt and deficits and find more efficient ways to deliver services, remove restrictions on foreign investment and get comfortable running trade deficits since exports will fall as the exchange rate appreciates with capital inflows. Second, countries will need to compete for the world’s scarce savings. Countries with a higher return on capital unsurprisingly do better at attracting savings to finance the AI boom and hence reap more of its benefits. For policymakers, this means two things — lifting productivity and tax reform. Simplifying and reducing taxes on capital and investment will increase the return on capital, encouraging more savings to flow into the economy and delivering bigger benefits from the AI boom. It will also lead to better energy markets, improved resource management and the removal of duplication in development approvals. Third, financial markets will need to direct the capital to where it’s needed. Key to this is flexibility. Countries with more financial rigidities experience the same negative consequences as countries with insufficient savings — the investment boom is muted. For policymakers, this means making sure that financial regulations are not unnecessarily preventing firms and households from getting the capital they need. Bank asset risk weightings, along with regulations on pension funds and fintech, should all be reviewed with this in mind. It also means being strategic and targeted about where countries can most succeed in the AI tech stack — in Australia, for example, these opportunities lie in applications, infrastructure and datasets. Fourth, it’s not all about capital. Booming industries will need workers and many new AI businesses will be created by workers who leave their current jobs. Policymakers need to make sure that workers can switch jobs easily, that they are equipped with the right skills and that the entrepreneurs who start new businesses aren’t stopped from doing so. This means getting rid of the things that make it hard for workers to switch jobs. Non-compete clauses should be scrapped, taxes that punish relocation should be phased out and barriers to entry to certain occupations (think: licencing requirements) should be reviewed. Regulatory and tax inconsistencies between sub-national governments should also be addressed. Upskilling the workforce will be key. The AI boom creates new jobs and higher wages, particularly in STEM fields, which will encourage more people to train in those areas. But the lag-time in this upskilling means that it is crucial to get ahead of the curve and use direct subsidies to start upskilling quickly in STEM capabilities. And developed economies need to increase skilled migration, not reduce it. If businesses can’t expand due to a lack of skilled workers, the economy won’t get the full benefits of the AI boom. The AI race is an ironman event, not a track meet, and success depends on getting all the settings right. Policymakers must approach it comprehensively. Getting our macro settings right should be the first step.

Fixing the fractures in ASEAN’s digital health services	As Southeast Asia embraces digital innovation, the healthcare sector is seeing significant advancements, especially with eHealth initiatives aimed at improving healthcare access and quality. The Asia Pacific emerged in 2024 as the third most significant region for digital health funding globally with around US$2 billion raised across 244 deals. Digital health innovation not only improves patient outcomes but also enhances public health surveillance, supports medical research and drives economic growth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine platforms surged in popularity, enabling remote consultations and ensuring continued care. These innovations underscore the potential of eHealth in overcoming geographical barriers and resource constraints. ASEAN member states, led by Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines, attract substantial investments in critical healthcare domains. Digital platforms like Indonesia’s SATUSEHAT platform, Thailand’s Mor Prom and Singapore’s HealthHub exemplify the region’s efforts to bridge these gaps. These tools aim to integrate patient data, enhance telehealth services and streamline medical record access, heralding a new era of healthcare delivery in Southeast Asia. But to fully leverage these advancements, ASEAN must continue addressing foundational challenges that could hinder its progress. Critical and lingering issues like interoperability, cybersecurity and trust potentially impede the bloc’s efforts to devise a robust and integrated regional healthcare ecosystem. Interoperability is the backbone of an integrated, cross-border digital health ecosystem. It enables seamless data exchange across borders, ensuring continuity of care for patients traveling within ASEAN. Most ASEAN countries operate in silos, with national health systems that lack standardised data formats and shared protocols. The lack of consensus on operational standards is a significant barrier to effective data sharing and interoperability in the public health context. This is particularly salient in the ASEAN context, where a diversity of health systems and regulatory environments can create additional complexities. The European Union’s eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure may serve as an exemplar. Its integrated cross-border services like ePrescriptions and Patient Summaries result in a more seamless provision of health services. ASEAN’s own Digital Health Framework similarly intends to establish regional standards for electronic health records and data sharing. It remains imperative for the bloc to go the extra mile towards a unified digital health framework by adopting best practices from its member states, harmonising regulations and enhancing cross-border collaboration. ASEAN’s six biggest economies — Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines — can significantly spearhead these actions and devise a more collaborative, regionally-endorsed effort in advancing digital health in the region. Enhancing regional cooperation and taking concrete steps beyond multilateral agreements will be critical in driving the progress. ASEAN can mirror European initiatives such as the joint action Towards the European Health Data Space that may serve as concrete guidelines and technical specifications for using health data across country borders. ASEAN can adopt similar measures by strengthening national cybersecurity regulations, promoting data encryption technologies and fostering cross-border collaboration on digital protection. It can also establish secure data-sharing sandboxes for testing, and innovation can help mitigate risks while promoting interoperability. Trust also remains as a potential barrier to the widespread adoption of digital health in the region. Many patients still prefer in-person consultations due to concerns about the reliability, security and quality of digital services. A recent study emphasises that, while digital health initiatives could enhance healthcare access and quality, considerable barriers such as patient distrust and concerns about the effectiveness of remote consultations may hinder its widespread adoption. In rural areas, healthcare infrastructure is often lacking, leading to a reliance on traditional methods of consultation. These perceptions are exacerbated by inconsistent service delivery and occasional data privacy breaches. Addressing this challenge requires huge effort. Public awareness campaigns can educate users about the benefits and safety of digital health services. Governments must enforce transparent policies on data usage and privacy. Fostering patient-centric design in eHealth platforms, such as user-friendly interfaces and real-time data access, can improve adoption rates and satisfaction. To move forward, ASEAN must establish comprehensive regional standards for data sharing, supported by digital public infrastructure investments and strengthened multilateral collaboration. Member states should also devise a balanced approach to data protection — one that actually safeguards users’ digital rights while also ensuring it does not hamper innovation. Aligning with international best practices, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation may provide a regulatory foundation. Still, regulations must be adapted to support both security and the dynamic growth of the digital health ecosystem. This is to ensure it gives users confidence through education, transparency and patient-centric innovation — factors essential for driving adoption.

Indonesia must pursue a progressive value-added tax system	Indonesia’s value-added tax (VAT) system is struggling to balance the need for sufficient revenue to fund public services against the risk of regressivity. A progressive VAT, featuring a single rate with real-time compensation for low-income earners, offers a viable solution. By integrating a modern VAT, Indonesia could set an example for how digital solutions can help mitigate the regressivity of consumption taxes in developing countries. Indonesia’s tax-to-GDP ratio has stagnated at around 10–12 per cent for the last decade, falling short of financing the increasing demand for investment in health, education and infrastructure development. The government initially proposed raising the VAT rate to 12 per cent to strengthen revenue collection. But in response to public concerns and protests, the policy was revised, maintaining the effective rate at 11 per cent, with the 12 per cent rate applied exclusively to luxury goods. The global average VAT rate of 15 per cent suggests room for a modest rate increase. Such reforms, combined with a more progressive VAT system, could raise several billions in revenue without overburdening Indonesia’s poor. A modern VAT system is designed for simplicity and efficiency by taxing all goods and services at a uniform rate, eliminating complex exemptions and reduced rates for essentials like food, medicine and utilities. But VAT’s regressive nature disproportionately burdens lower-income households, who spend a larger share of their income on consumption. A modern VAT system can address this issue by incorporating a compensation mechanism that provides direct, real-time reimbursements to eligible low-income consumers. In Indonesia, the integration of the Core Tax Administration System with existing digital payment platforms presents a viable solution for implementing such a system. By identifying eligible consumers at the point of purchase, the system could automatically transfer VAT reimbursements directly to their bank or e-money accounts. With the increasing adoption of QR code-based payment systems, real-time compensation is not just an ambitious idea — it is a practical and achievable step towards a more equitable tax system. The digital reimbursement mechanism proposal was supported in the International Monetary Fund’s Designing a Progressive VAT working paper. But implementation requires improved data integration between Indonesian institutions. A crucial step is merging citizen identification and taxpayer identification systems to identify eligible recipients accurately. The reform must also address barriers to access and usage in rural areas where digital infrastructure remains limited. The retention of Indonesia’s VAT credit system is crucial. The government can implement reforms while still preserving this established mechanism and the support it offers vulnerable groups by targeting non-VAT entrepreneurs — primarily small businesses with a turnover that qualifies them for exemption. Implementing a progressive VAT system presents several challenges. Data privacy concerns, fraud risks and the system’s intrusiveness require robust regulations and enhanced transparency. Strong data protection measures, including secure authentication protocols for both consumers and tax authorities, are essential for safeguarding sensitive information. Transparency will also play a crucial role in maintaining public trust. Clear communication about how data is collected, processed and used must be provided to taxpayers, alongside accessible channels for them to raise any concerns. Political obstacles also pose a significant challenge. Implementing a broad-based VAT system that eliminates exemptions and special rates requires overcoming entrenched interests and established practices. This is particularly difficult in Indonesia, where exemptions enjoy political popularity. Indonesia’s unique geographic and economic structure presents additional complexities. While urban areas have seen rapid advancements in mobile payments and digital platforms, many rural regions still lack access to reliable internet and mobile payment systems. The proposed system offers significant advantages despite these challenges. Incorporating a single VAT rate on all goods and services with real-time compensation to low-income households would boost revenue, reduce the VAT’s regressive impact and support small businesses. This approach goes beyond tax policy — it serves as a blueprint for inclusive growth. A progressive VAT system would create a virtuous cycle where increased revenue is used to fund investments that foster economic growth, reduce inequality and enhance long-term productivity. Successfully implementing a modern VAT in Indonesia could set a powerful precedent for other Southeast Asian states, demonstrating that fairness and efficiency can coexist. The stakes are high. Indonesia has a unique opportunity to position itself as a high-income economy by 2045. Indonesia must seize this opportunity to invest in the future and ensure a prosperous, equitable society.

Mongolia keeps mining for growth amid economic uncertainty	Following Mongolia’s 2024 election, a new government faces the challenge of sustaining economic growth amid rising global uncertainty. Strong export performance and fiscal expansion fuel optimism, but structural challenges may test the country’s resilience. The Mongolian economy is continuing its recovery from COVID-19-related slowdown. Economic growth was 4.9 per cent in 2024, which is significantly lower than the 7.4 per cent growth in 2023 and the average growth rate of 6.4 per cent over the past 18 years. The industrial sector grew by 5 per cent, with the mining sector expanding by 5.7 per cent. But the agricultural sector, which accounted for around 10 per cent of GDP, contracted by 25 per cent in the first three quarters of 2024. This decline is attributed to severe winter and spring weather conditions, known as the ‘Dzud’, which led to the loss of 8.1 million animals — 12.5 per cent of total livestock. Total exports increased moderately by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year, reaching US$15.8 billion, while imports rose sharply by 25.5 per cent to reach US$11.6 billion, both marking historical highs. Export growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in copper exports. The volume of copper exports reached a record 1.7 million tons, up 11.1 per cent from the previous year, while the average border price of copper increased by US$236 per ton, boosting the value of copper exports by 26 per cent. Though coal export volume grew by over 20 per cent to a historic high of 83.7 million tons in 2024, the price of coal fell by US$25.4 per ton, leading to a 2.3 per cent decline in the value of coal exports. Economic growth in 2024 was fuelled by significant expansion on the demand side. With relatively favourable conditions for commodity exports and a positive outlook of the near future, the state budget revenue and grants increased by 28.7 per cent from 2023, reaching a historic high of 31.4 trillion Mongolian togrog (US$9.1 billion). Budget expenditure expanded by 34.9 per cent, reaching another historic high of 30.4 trillion Mongolian togrog (US$8.8 billion). Private consumption and investment also rose by 27.8 per cent and 26.8 per cent respectively in the first three quarters of 2024. Inflation remained within the central bank’s target range, averaging 6.6 per cent in 2024. This was despite ongoing uncertainties in the external environment, capacity constraints in energy, transport and logistics sectors, significant demand-side expansion and negative supply shocks in animal husbandry. The labour force participation rate continued its steady rise, reaching 63 per cent in the third quarter of 2024, while the unemployment rate rose to 6.1 per cent. The rise in exports also improved the country’s foreign exchange reserves, which registered a record high of US$5.5 billion. This milestone is especially significant considering the Bank of Mongolia made payments of around US$1.1 billion in foreign debt. The togrog remained relatively stable against the US dollar throughout 2024. The government’s debt management strategy for 2023–25 stipulates that new foreign securities will be issued solely for the purpose of refinancing existing debt. Following implementation, as well as abovementioned positive changes in the economy, the government’s sovereign bond spread reached the lowest in history — 2.3 per cent — in 2024. As a result, credit rating agencies S&amp;P Global and Fitch Ratings upgraded the country’s credit rating to B+ and B2 respectively, marking the highest rating in the past decade. Mongolia saw the formation of its first 126-member parliament following the 2024 parliamentary election. The election — based on a mixed electoral system — led to five parties winning seats, with 78 members elected from constituencies and 48 from party lists. Notably, 25 per cent were women — the highest level of female participation in recent generations. Though the Mongolian People’s Party won the majority of seats, it formed a coalition government with the Democratic Party and the HUN Party, giving it a 94 per cent supermajority. The current coalition government is aiming to implement 14 mega-projects in the next four years, having endorsed linking the railway border connection with China — which should boost coal export revenue by 2.8 times — and uranium mining in collaboration with the French ‘Orano’ group. The new parliament finally adopted the Law on the Sovereign Wealth Fund after many years of deliberation. The fund is composed of three sub-funds, designed to accumulate wealth, finance large state investments and support social measures. Budget discussions were notably intense, resulting in the adoption of a zero-deficit budget for 2025. But the Fiscal Stability Law, which has been in effect since 2013, was amended to remove the upper limit on the overall budget deficit, replacing it with a lower limit on the primary balance surplus. The long-term impact of this change has not been fully assessed, nor has its potential to ensure fiscal stability. Looking ahead to 2025, factors such as disruptions in petroleum supply from Russia, a slowdown in Chinese economy, expanding budget spending, spiralling wage increase, surges in electricity and heat prices and the continued impact of the Dzud will continue to put pressure on inflation and economic growth.

Cambodia struggles to harvest its agricultural potential while Vietnam reaps the benefits	Cambodia’s trade with Vietnam has increased significantly, with a noticeable reduction in the bilateral trade deficit over time. But the relationship remains imbalanced, with Cambodia heavily reliant on exporting raw materials while importing higher-value goods. This dynamic has left Cambodia unable to fully capitalise on its agricultural potential, putting its farmers and economy at a disadvantage. While ASEAN promotes trade among its members through initiatives like the ASEAN Economic Community, small states like Cambodia struggle to benefit due to limited production and export capacity. From Cambodia’s perspective, ASEAN is standing by as Vietnam imports raw materials from Cambodia, rather than helping the Kingdom develop its own agro-processing industry. From January to November 2024, trade between Cambodia and Vietnam reached US$7.08 billion, a 20.6 per cent increase, making Vietnam Cambodia’s second-largest export market behind the United States. Cambodia’s exports to Vietnam reached US$3.29 billion, up 26.3 per cent, mostly consisting of cashews, corn, bananas, mangoes, tobacco, rice and rubber. Vietnam&#8217;s main exports to Cambodia, worth US$3.79 billion, include building supplies, machinery, fuel, electronics and electrical equipment, fertilisers, animal feed, vegetables and fruits. Cambodian farmers produce agricultural products, but these goods are often unprofitable due to low selling prices and high production costs of fertilisers, fuel and machinery. Vietnam benefits from Cambodia’s limited industrial capacity, importing raw materials at lower prices and processing them into finished goods for export to global markets like Europe and China under Vietnam’s own branding. Rice is Cambodia’s primary agricultural product, occupying nearly 70 per cent of cultivated land, with subsidiary and industrial crops at 19 per cent, rubber at 7 per cent and permanent crops at 4 per cent. The country has significant potential for high-value agricultural exports due to its fertile land and favourable climate. Government initiatives have focused on enhancing productivity and diversifying exports towards higher-value products. Although agriculture’s contribution to GDP has decreased from 50 per cent in the early 1990s to about 22 per cent in 2023, it still accounts for nearly 40 per cent of employment. But the Kingdom heavily relies on sourcing fertilisers from neighbouring countries, including Vietnam (US$207 million), Thailand (US$139 million), China (US$12 million), Japan (US$5.61 million) and South Korea (US$1.61 million). Despite this, farmers and other individuals continue to encounter difficulties, such as the rising cost of fertiliser and high living expenses. Cambodia is primarily reliant on raw material exports, limiting its agricultural benefits. Farmers grow lucrative commodities such as cassava, rubber and cashews, but they are frequently exported to Vietnam for processing. In 2022–23, Cambodia exported over 3.5 million tonnes of paddy rice to Vietnam, where it is processed and then exported to international markets. These include Europe and some ASEAN countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia — Vietnam’s largest rice export markets. Cambodia has enough rice mills capable of meeting international export standards, but lacks capital to purchase rice grains for stocking and production and struggles to reduce processing costs, particularly in transportation. Cambodian farmers encounter challenges such as low yields due to outdated techniques, limited access to advanced technology and high production costs. As a result some farming households in Takeo, Kandal, Prey Veng and Svay Rieng have decided to rent their farmland to Southwestern Vietnamese farmers for rice cultivation. Cambodia faces challenges in job creation, income growth, economic diversification and industrial development, largely because it relies heavily on exporting raw materials. Developing value-added industries, such as packaging and food processing, remains a significant underexplored opportunity. In 2024, 95 per cent of raw cashew nuts were exported, leaving only 5 per cent for domestic processing. This leads to significant value loss for farmers, traders and local communities. Cambodia’s limited domestic processing capacity allows Vietnam to dominate the value-added stage of its agricultural exports. This situation is further compounded by high export costs and stringent entry requirements for processed agricultural goods in global markets. Electricity is a crucial input for processing, yet Cambodia has one of the highest costs of electricity in the region. The education system also lacks specialised training in food technology, quality control and agro-industrial engineering. To develop a strong agro-processing industry, Cambodia must reduce electricity and logistics costs to boost local competitiveness. Investment in modern food processing technology would improve efficiency and product quality, opening doors to international markets. Developing a skilled workforce in agro-industrial engineering is essential for sustaining technological advancements. Expanding financial access through targeted incentives and low-interest loans can attract investment in processing facilities. There is also a need to strengthen the country’s branding and export strategies, shifting from raw exports to high-value agricultural products. These actions are expected to boost industrial growth, generate employment opportunities and consolidate Cambodia&#8217;s position in global trade. Cambodia’s growing trade with Vietnam presents both challenges and opportunities. As ASEAN removes regional trade barriers, the Kingdom is losing its competitive advantage in agricultural products to Vietnam, leaving citizens facing high expenses and low incomes.

Canada’s trade tightrope with ASEAN needs flexibility	On the sidelines of the 2024 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Lima, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jointly announced the ‘substantive conclusion of negotiations’ for a Canada–Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement. Set to come into effect in 2025, this agreement highlights Canada’s progress as a latecomer to the Southeast Asian economic stage just three years after introducing its Indo-Pacific Strategy. Ottawa’s modus operandi for accessing Southeast Asia’s markets combines both bilateral and regional approaches. For years, Canada has been negotiating a regional free trade agreement with the ten ASEAN member states, including Indonesia. Prior to Canada, the European Union attempted to reach an interregional agreement with ASEAN. But the European Union’s ambitious vision ‘clashed with the actual heterogeneity of ASEAN member states’. In 2009, facing disagreements within ASEAN, the European Union chose a cooperative approach focusing on bilateral agreements. While the European Union opted for a regional first, bilateral later approach, Canada is pursuing both at the same time. But negotiating with ASEAN is far from easy. Canada is progressive, even when it comes to international trade. Canada’s Progressive Trade Agenda (PTA), which was launched in 2017, sets high standards in areas such as environmental protection, labour rights and gender equality through its trade agreements provisions. These ‘new generation’ agreements are on the rise, but may prove dissuasive due to financial, institutional or political obstacles to their implementation — especially for developing economies focusing on competitiveness. With some ASEAN member states counted among Asia’s least developed economies, they likely would not be receptive to Canada’s progressive demands. The scope of the agreement may need to be adapted for these less resilient economies. Agriculture is a telling example. Lowering tariff barriers in the agricultural sector exposes small farmers to economically devastating competition, not to mention other serious social consequences. And given Canada’s supply management system for products such as dairy, poultry and eggs — relying on quotas and high tariffs to protect domestic producers — full agricultural liberalisation is probably not on Canada’s agenda either. Exclusions are to be expected. Considering these less resilient economies, adapted or differentiated liberalisation schedules are essential. When ASEAN’s free trade area was established in the 1990s, advanced countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore were given shorter implementation periods than less-developed ones like Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. Yet ASEAN’s member states exceeded expectations, completing liberalisation ahead of schedule. A similar two-track liberalisation model is not out of the question for the Canada–ASEAN partnership. ASEAN’s signature free trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), is a prime example of a trade agreement tailored to the economic realities of its parties. Member states’ autonomy over concession lists has resulted in significant exclusions such as agricultural products, labour-intensive manufactured goods, strategic products such as vehicles and goods with negative externalities. The RCEP also sets a 20-year ceiling for tariff reduction, granting leeway to Southeast Asia’s least resilient economies. Its a la carte design lets states opt for either a single concession list for all, or individual lists for each. Flexibility and inclusivity come at the cost of simplicity. A flexible, RCEP-style agreement could be the favoured approach for ASEAN’s less-developed economies as it provides control over concession lists, exclusion of sensitive sectors and long implementation timelines. But it doesn’t serve the immediate interests of more developed ASEAN member states such as Indonesia or Singapore. Alternatively, a high-standard and progressive ASEAN–Canada agreement is a scenario worth considering given Ottawa’s commitment to its PTA. Keeping exclusions minimal and shortening timelines would swiftly unlock the agreement’s full potential. To avoid less-developed economies’ vetoes, Canada is likely to propose compensatory measures such as expert deployment, capacity-building initiatives or financial support, likely through official development assistance channels. The application of the agreement would be contingent upon compliance with the PTA standards, rendering the ‘Canada–ASEAN minus X’ model the most realistic option. Unlike the European Union’s rigid approach, ASEAN’s open regionalism allows for a more flexible and accommodating integration process. Be that as it may, Canada is walking a tightrope. To secure preferential access to the ASEAN market, Ottawa should adopt a flexible and conciliatory approach, especially as it braces for a major trade storm with the protectionist Trump administration back in the White House.

Malaysia’s reform aspirations clashed with political realities in 2024	After focusing on political survival in 2023, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim entered 2024 with ambitious plans to restore Malaysia’s standing as one of Asia’s leading economies and middle powers. Economic growth exceeded expectations — fuelled in part by a surge in foreign investment — particularly in the semiconductor sector, the Malaysian ringgit saw a modest recovery and Anwar’s active diplomacy elevated Malaysia’s global profile. Yet 2024 also demonstrated that ambition alone is insufficient to overcome Malaysia’s entrenched political divisions. Anwar’s government, constrained by an unwieldy coalition and the volatile pull of identity politics, struggled to advance significant reforms. Race and religion remained potent political flashpoints. In March, a convenience store inadvertently sold socks embossed with the word ‘Allah’, triggering viral outrage. Several political leaders used the incident to paint Anwar’s government — and its Chinese-majority coalition partner, the Democratic Action Party — as insufficiently protective of Malay-Muslim interests. Even the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a key member of the ruling coalition, saw its Youth Chief join the fray, highlighting the coalition’s internal tensions. In May, Universiti Teknologi MARA — a university historically reserved for ethnic Malays and other bumiputera — proposed temporarily admitting students from other ethnic backgrounds to its postgraduate cardiothoracic programme to address a critical shortage of qualified surgeons. The backlash was swift, with students and Malay nationalist groups mobilising in protest. In August, former prime minister and opposition leader Muhyiddin Yassin was charged with sedition for appearing to question a royal decision which followed the 2022 election. While his comments drew public criticism, the sedition charge itself reignited debates over selective prosecution. After years of politicising Malaysia’s race, religion and royalty, identity-based populism has become a force unto itself, with no clear way to contain or navigate it in pursuit of substantive reform. Another former prime minister, Najib Razak — serving time for his role in the 1MDB corruption scandal — remains a political liability for Anwar. Though popular within UMNO and its base, he is widely denounced as a kleptocrat elsewhere. In February, a Pardons Board unexpectedly halved Najib’s sentence and slashed his fines, fuelling backlash from the public and government. Anwar’s predicament is unenviable — he needs UMNO’s backing to govern, but Najib’s preferential treatment undermines his reformist credentials. Beyond politics, Malaysia faced compounding crises in late 2024. Severe flooding in the northern states displaced hundreds of thousands, while sporadic shortages of local white rice deepened food security concerns. Transnational haze persisted and a string of incidents, from power outages in East Malaysia to a tourist vanishing into a Kuala Lumpur sinkhole, exposed pressing infrastructure gaps. None of these challenges have easy fixes. Still, Anwar may find some relief in Perikatan Nasional’s waning momentum. The opposition, which surged in 2023, has been increasingly fractured. Merdeka Center polling also suggests strengthening support for the government, which could give Anwar more manoeuvring room in 2025. The upcoming Sabah state election will be another key test of his coalition’s stability. Malaysia’s foreign policy in 2024 reflected ongoing strategic balancing. Anwar sought to maintain ties with both China and the West while amplifying Malaysia’s support for Palestine, often through sharp critiques of Western hypocrisy and the rules-based international order. Mid-year, he announced Malaysia’s application to join BRICs while making high-profile visits to Beijing and New Delhi, prompting speculation about Malaysia’s geopolitical realignment. That interpretation is premature, as Malaysia continues to seek strong ties with the United States and other Western partners. Malaysia’s relationship with China, while robust, has had tension. A leaked Chinese diplomatic note ordering Malaysia to halt exploration in its own South China Sea exclusive economic zone underscored the complexities of this balancing act. Anwar, who made dozens of international trips in 2024, frequently spoke off-the-cuff to build rapport with global leaders while also addressing domestic concerns. Many of his statements, shaped by shifting political pressures, reflect tactical positioning rather than a cohesive foreign policy shift. Malaysia’s 2025 ASEAN Chairmanship will be a pivotal test for Anwar’s leadership. Expectations are high for meaningful progress on regional challenges, particularly the crisis in Myanmar and tensions in the South China Sea. Failure to secure tangible results could deepen ASEAN’s fragmentation, prompting member states to pursue mini-lateral alternatives. Simultaneously, Malaysia must build momentum for the successor plans to the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint — frameworks that will shape the region’s future. Negotiations on the Digital Economy Framework Agreement and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area upgrade are set to conclude under Malaysia’s leadership, giving Kuala Lumpur leverage in shaping their final forms. While loftier objectives — such as finalising the South China Sea Code of Conduct or facilitating Timor Leste’s formal ASEAN accession — may prove elusive, Malaysia’s Chairmanship will be central to shaping the agenda and fostering consensus. With global politics in flux, Malaysia’s ambitious 2025 agenda will require not just bold leadership, but also pragmatic goal setting, stronger coordination and effective delegation. These may be Anwar’s real tests. Kai Ostwald is the HSBC Chair in Asian Research and Associate Professor in the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

India’s economic growth engine begins to stall	2024 began with the Indian economy continuing to show remarkable resilience in the face of growing global uncertainties. The macroeconomic fundamentals were buoyant and India’s economy continued to be the fastest growing of the major economies, registering growth of 8.2 per cent during fiscal year 2023–24 (April–March). But India’s growth momentum was considerably dented in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, with its economy growing at a rate of 5.4 per cent. This was the slowest growth in six quarters, almost three percentage points slower than the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. The slowdown of the Indian economy was confirmed by the National Statistics Office when its advance estimates of GDP for the 2024–25 fiscal year showed that the economy could grow by just 6.4 per cent, nearly two percentage points slower than in the previous year. Even though at 6.4 per cent India would continue to be the fastest growing major economy, sub-7 per cent growth does cast a shadow over India’s aspirations of joining the ranks of developed countries by 2047. To get back on course, the Indian economy has to overcome a series of weaknesses, not the least of which is depressed consumer demand. Private consumption expenditure is the main driver of GDP, but this component has remained sluggish ever since the effect of the government stimulus packages provided during the COVID-19 pandemic wore out. Private consumption expenditure exceeded 60 per cent in several quarters between 2021–23, while in the following period it mostly remained in the mid-50 per cent range, even declining to 53 per cent in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023–24. These trends are largely attributable to the wage squeeze suffered by India’s large informal workforce. Still, the small share of workers employed in the formal sector have also experienced a decline in their real wages over the past few years. A report prepared by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Quess Corp Ltd showed that while nominal wages across six major manufacturing and infrastructure sectors increased by 0.8–5.4 per cent, retail inflation was between 4.8 per cent and 5.7 per cent, implying either stagnant or declining real wages for Indian workers. The cost of living may be higher than retail inflation numbers suggest. Food inflation in India was consistently much higher during this period, often close to double digits. In sharp contrast, corporate profits increased fourfold during the same period. Growth in profit-share and a reduction in the wage-share in India’s formal sector has, unsurprisingly, caused sluggish demand conditions in the Indian economy. Data on India’s labour market dynamics available from the Periodic Labour Force Survey support the findings of the FICCI–Quess Corp report. In 2023–24, the share of workers earning a regular wage in the formal sector was just a fifth of the total workforce. Among this group, the share of workers without a written job contract was 58 per cent, while the share of workers not eligible for any specified social security benefit was 53 per cent. Almost 80 per cent of the total workforce was employed in the informal sector, which includes self-employed and casual workers who face uncertain earnings. The government has set an objective of formalising the informal workforce and has embarked on initiatives aimed at creating employment opportunities in the manufacturing sector that would improve workers’ overall economic conditions. India’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme is an ambitious plan to strengthen the country’s manufacturing sector by targeting 14 key sectors with high growth. The PLI scheme has delivered less than expected and the government has made several course corrections to put this key initiative back on the right track. But the employment challenge that the country faces may have to be addressed through more than just one scheme. In 2024, concerns also emerged regarding both the current and capital accounts of India’s balance of payments. The merchandise trade deficit was nearing an all-time high during the first eight months of the current fiscal year, but this did not adversely affect the current account deficit due to higher services exports. But the capital account remains strained due to large outflows of both foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment. Though FDI inflows between April–October 2024 were US$49 billion, higher than in the previous two years, divestments by foreign investors reached a high of over US$34 billion during this period. Outflows of FPI increased during the closing weeks of 2024, causing net inflows during the year to remain in negative territory. A continuation of this trend could put additional pressure on the Indian rupee, which experienced creeping depreciation towards the end of 2024, a trend that has somewhat quickened in the New Year.

Trump 2.0 puts India’s trade policy to the test	US President Donald Trump’s targeted tariff and protectionist policy proposals mean that 2025 will be a landmark year for global trade, creating fresh challenges and opportunities for India. As a major US trading partner, India must explore where it stands to gain under Trump’s second administration and innovate strategies to navigate impending trade turbulence. Though India was not among the countries initially subjected to tariffs, Trump has labelled India the ‘tariff king’. But India’s average trade-weighted tariff rates are low and comply with World Trade Organization rules, while countries like the United States, Japan and South Korea impose significantly higher tariffs on protected products. India’s core export sectors like pharmaceuticals, textiles and IT may face higher US tariffs. India’s strength lies in focusing on the relationship between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Trump to negotiate bilaterally for reciprocal tariff reductions. India’s statement welcoming US energy imports following President Trump’s move to increase domestic oil and gas production is an example of this strategy. But while India must maintain export flows to the United States to sustain short-term growth and employment, export market diversification is crucial for long-term stability and growth. Trump’s imposition of higher tariffs on Chinese exports places immense pressure on businesses to decouple from China, reinvigorating the ‘China Plus One’ strategy that aims to hedge against the risks of investment and trade relations with China. While India can provide the base for the impending capital flight, a report by government think tank NITI Aayog notes that India has been ineffective in capturing the gains from businesses’ China Plus One strategy so far. But by simplifying tax laws, engaging in proactive trade policies and creating a regulatory environment that attracts foreign investment, India can become the alternative trade destination for manufacturing.To weather potential headwinds in the manufacturing sector, India must focus on its Production Linked Incentive schemes to incentivise domestic manufacturing and exports. ‘Friendshoring’ and ‘nearshoring’ provide opportunities that India should leverage in the event of major global trade shifts. Opportunities for India to turn East demand industrial policy reforms geared towards raising productivity and exports in key sectors. President Trump’s proposals of restrictions on skilled and unskilled labour movement could pose substantial challenges for India. India’s outsourcing and IT sector is highly US-centric, with US links contributing to over 80 per cent of India’s IT sector earnings. If President Trump penalises US companies employing imported talent, India’s outsourcing and IT services industry will see significant constraints. But shortages in US STEM graduates and high costs for US IT services to employ local skilled workers mean that in the short run, India’s outsourcing sector may not be impacted. But diversifying the activities of outsourcing and IT sectors to other regions will help the industry withstand US protectionism. India’s IT sector is already exploring new markets in Africa and Latin America to diversify and expand business activities and acquisitions. India will stand to gain from the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) regardless of US engagement. Based on our applied general equilibrium model, deeper trade liberalisation in the IPEF region increases the region&#8217;s growth rate from 3.7 to 4.2 per cent without US involvement. With growing interest in minilateralism, IPEF members will seek to strategically collaborate on shared supply chain and other interests, regardless of US involvement. While India has only maintained an observer status in IPEF’s trade pillar, there is much to gain from its involvement in IPEF’s supply chain, fair economy and clean economy pillars, including by expanding trade ties with countries like Japan and Australia on supply chain and clean economy issues. President Trump’s renewed emphasis on fossil fuels under his ‘drill baby drill’ mantra may not stimulate its desired response from the fossil fuel industry which would like to maintain high oil prices by restraining supply. India’s oil import ties with Russia and export ties to Europe will only be impacted if there’s a boost in US oil production. Energy sector uncertainty means that India must leverage opportunities for cooperation under IPEF’s clean economy pillar and the Quad Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Package. By collaborating with countries like Japan and Australia, India can ramp up the deployment of climate-friendly technologies and promote climate-related projects and zero-emission products. President Trump’s protectionist policies and lack of interest in the World Trade Organization and IPEF may create global trade disruptions. But what Trump will be able to achieve may be limited to a realignment in the global trade and outsourcing matrix due to the global economic interdependencies established during the globalisation era. While this new era will challenge India’s trade relationship with the United States, it will also offer opportunities for trade diversification. Prime Minister Modi must pursue these opportunities while capitalising on his relationship with President Trump to negotiate mutual gains, particularly in critical sectors.

Duterte’s impeachment and the spectacle of Philippine politics	On 5 February 2025, the Philippine House of Representatives impeached Vice President Sara Duterte after 240 lawmakers affixed their signatures to the fourth impeachment complaint lodged against her. Duterte makes history as the first Philippine vice president to be impeached, exposing the deep-rooted political divides in the Philippines. The impeachment complaint hinges on several grounds, including the misuse of public funds, unexplained wealth, allegations of plotting murder and betrayal of public trust. The articles of impeachment were forwarded to the Philippine Senate on the same day but its session adjourned without tackling Duterte’s impeachment. Senate President Francis Escudero explained that the impeachment trial will not commence until the Senate’s session resumes and later announced that the trial will start in July 2025 after President Marcos delivers his third State of the Nation Address. Notable legal luminaries are divided on the procedural aspect of the impeachment. Former Supreme Court justice Adolfo Azcuna, who is also one of the present constitution’s framers, argued that the impeachment trial could proceed even during a Senate recess. Azcuna asserted that the constitution mandates that the impeachment ‘shall forthwith proceed’, meaning it is not bound by the legislative calendar. But fellow retired justice Antonio Carpio opposed President Marcos’ remark that he can call for a special Senate session to proceed with the trial, positing that such a call can only be used for the enactment of laws. Some have cautioned that extending this trial to the succeeding Congress presents a constitutional grey area. Already, a petition has been filed with the Philippine Supreme Court seeking to order the Senate to immediately proceed with Duterte’s impeachment trial. As a countermeasure, Duterte herself filed a petition asking the high court to nullify the impeachment complaint against her. No matter when the trial commences, Duterte’s impeachment could not have come at a worse time. With Filipinos heading to the polls before the Senate resumes its session in June and the trial commences in July, the road ahead looks far from smooth. Half of the Senate’s 24 seats will be up for grabs in the 12 May 2025 midterm election, the outcome of which will be crucial in determining Duterte’s fate. A two-thirds vote in the Senate is required for conviction, which means that at least 16 senators must vote to convict Duterte. The impending change in the Senate’s membership post-election casts a long shadow over Duterte’s impeachment trial. If Duterte does not have enough allies to win the election and evade conviction, her conviction will not only remove her as vice president but may also disqualify her from holding any future public office. But an acquittal would give Duterte a new lease on her political career. The constitutional limitation that allows only one impeachment proceeding to be initiated against any impeachable official within a one-year period would buy Duterte enough time to recover from the blowback of impeachment. If Duterte is convicted, the succession rules outlined in the 1987 Philippine Constitution will take effect by operation of law. The rules provide that in case of a vacancy in the vice presidency, the president may nominate from among the members of the Senate or the House of Representatives, which must be confirmed by a majority in both houses. In this scenario, President Marcos gains leverage by having a choice to select someone he trusts to occupy the vice presidency. Duterte’s conviction will seriously undermine her political clout and will derail her ambition of becoming the next Philippine president. Duterte’s impeachment has added fire to the feud between the Duterte and Marcos families, further polarising the Philippine political landscape. Even with Marcos’ consistent denial of any involvement in the proceedings, Duterte’s impeachment has sounded the death knell for their hollow political alliance. Davao City Congressman Paolo Duterte, the vice president’s brother, described Duterte’s impeachment as another saga in their family’s political persecution by the Marcos administration. The family patriarch, former president Rodrigo Duterte, is at risk of being arrested by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for his regime’s violent war on drugs. In January 2025, the Marcos administration said that it would favourably respond to any request from the ICC concerning Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest. While the impeachment proceedings could restore public trust in the country’s institutions by showing that mechanisms which hold public officials accountable are working, the resulting political instability and increasing polarisation may outweigh its benefits. The selective nature of impeachment, often wielded as a political weapon against the incumbent’s opponents, belies the logic that it reinforces the rule of law. At the end of the day, an impeachment is a spectacle of political partisanship. Duterte’s impeachment does not resolve the deeper issues of lack of accountability, failure of good governance and corruption within the ranks of the Philippines’ political establishment. Only this time, Sara Duterte must take the fall. Josiah Patrick P. Bagayas is a Lawyer and Associate Law Professor at Mariano Marcos State University, Philippines.

ASEAN adapts and advances as global politics shift	ASEAN is better equipped than many in the international community to handle the challenges of 2025. Expanding competition between the United States and China, the slowing Chinese economy and the new US leader’s unpredictability will trouble Southeast Asian countries — and many others. But ASEAN, now under experienced Malaysian leadership, enters 2025 with a relatively vibrant economy. ASEAN’s GDP is about the same as India’s, it has healthy growth rate predictions, strong foreign investment and is China’s largest trade partner. In political matters, ASEAN has moved more slowly, but it possesses a strategic toolkit that can help the organisation to assert agency in a more fluid regional order. Throughout 2024, Southeast Asia drew investment from many quarters, helped by the contest between the United States and China. US technology companies are investing in the region, including setting up elaborate energy-consuming data centres. Japanese, South Korean, European and Chinese manufacturers are also relocating to Southeast Asia to avoid crushing US tariffs. ASEAN countries have avoided being locked into one side or another in the contest of major powers. For instance, Indonesia joined BRICS in January 2025 but also declared a determination to enter the Western-led Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Though some see Southeast Asia as the biggest winner in global trade over the next decade, the dangers are obvious. The United States may impose tariffs not just on China but also on countries like Vietnam where trade is unbalanced and import-heavy. If this happens, ASEAN’s investment advantages would be reduced, even where workforces are being upskilled to handle semiconductor and other higher-value manufacturing. Another risk is that US actions will damage China–ASEAN trade, for instance by driving China to dump products on Southeast Asia, undermining local manufacturing. In security matters, Southeast Asian countries again engage in every direction. Singapore’s military has been cooperating with China and in mid-2024 six ASEAN countries took part in maritime exercises with the United States. Under its present leadership, the Philippines has been more combative towards China, bolstered by closer alignment with the United States — though it also engages in the ‘China–Philippines Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea’. Meanwhile, China has been helping Cambodia with naval training and is involved in developing the Ream Naval Base. The United States supported this initiative in the past, but cut funding in 2018. Despite China’s strong role today, Cambodia insists it is the owner, not China — and that the base is open to all friendly navies. Whether Southeast Asian states can maintain their strategic autonomy if the US–China contest sharpens even further remains to be seen. US President Donald Trump has already displayed antagonism toward BRICS and Southeast Asia may also face a more muscular minilateralism — which was hinted at in the renewed stress on security concerns at the 2024 Quad Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. But in handling this increasingly turbulent region, ASEAN brings economic vitality and a valuable — and historically grounded — set of approaches to foreign relations. Southeast Asian countries have been portrayed as quintessentially pragmatic, advancing their own interests — especially economic interests — and hedging between major powers. But ASEAN’s strategic heritage has more substance than this. For example, Malaysia insists its foreign policy is both principled and pragmatic. ASEAN’s stress on regional community building and on unity being essential to Southeast Asia’s security means the organisation, again under Malaysian leadership, will act with meticulous care regarding South China Sea contests or Myanmar. There is a contrast to be negotiated in 2025 between Philippines’ combativeness and Indonesia’s declared support for practical cooperation with China in disputed maritime areas. Another element in ASEAN’s heritage is an insistence on inclusivity. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s moves toward China and Russia, while affirming his friendship with EU countries and the United States, should be viewed in this light — not as mere hedging. The willingness to be open to all sides, despite differences in governing ideology, has been emphasised time and again across Southeast Asia. ASEAN leaders will not be bothered when Trump’s United States speaks less about the liberal rules-based order and puts more stress on transactional engagement. ASEAN gives institutional expression to inclusivity with bodies such as the East Asia Summit, the ASEAN Regional Forum and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, with their wide membership and patient dialogue. Like-minded minilaterals such as the Quad may move more quickly in practical areas — but they tend to be adversarial and liable to exacerbate regional divisions. Though alliance-forging is a typical response to a rising power in certain parts of the world, Southeast Asian regimes seem relatively comfortable working with hierarchies and their success in asserting agency is caught in the Southeast Asian folk image of the little mouse deer. Small but shrewd, the mouse deer is portrayed as outmanoeuvring the larger animals in the forest. In the emerging Indo-Pacific, with less stress on alliances and ideological commitments, ASEAN countries possess valuable historical experience. Flexibility in political and economic engagement — and a record in building inclusive relations and institutions — may prepare them to negotiate, and even assist in shaping, a post-liberal Indo-Pacific order.

Strong reactions to a weak yen shake Japan’s economy	The Japanese real effective exchange rate is now at its lowest level in 54 years. Despite the pressures of a depreciating yen — from import prices to debt repayment — Japan’s global competitiveness and financial markets make it well-equipped to handle these challenges. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has tightened monetary policy cautiously. It abandoned negative rates on the uncollateralised overnight call rate in March 2024 and raised the target to 0.25 per cent in July 2024 and to 0.5 per cent in January 2025. The move in July sparked a 6 per cent appreciation of the yen and a 12 per cent drop in the stock market, while the move in January proved uneventful. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has been waiting for what he calls good inflation — inflation driven by wage increases that increase consumption and aggregate demand — to tighten policy. Despite years of easy monetary policy and wages increasing 5.1 per cent in the 2024 spring wage offensive, real disposable income has not increased. This has led to sluggish growth in real consumption. The BOJ may face pressure to tighten in order to resist a disorderly depreciation of the yen. This is especially true as the US Federal Reserve may slow monetary policy easing because of inflationary risks due to tariffs, large US budget deficits and the repatriation of illegal immigrants. The weak yen increases the prices of imported energy and food. This has raised average household costs in 2024 by 90,000 yen (US$590). To combat this, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba implemented stimulus measures to subsidise utility bills and provide cash for poorer households. But one problem with both the BOJ’s tightening and Ishiba’s stimulus package is that they increase budget deficits. By raising interest rates, the BOJ raises the cost of servicing Japan’s public debt. At 1.2 per cent, yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds are at their highest level in 14 years. Debt service costs in 2025 are already forecasted to be above 4 per cent of GDP. Ishiba’s package, along with increased spending on military and social security categories, will turn the forecasted primary budget — the budget excluding interest payments — from a surplus into a deficit of 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2025. With a public debt of 250 per cent of GDP, Japan needs to eschew additional borrowing. It should instead allow entrepreneurs to play a larger role in allocating resources. The weak yen also impacts Japan’s international transactions. It raises the costs of imports of food, fuels and other items. Yet the stimulus to exports is mitigated as many manufacturers relocated factories abroad during the strong yen period that lasted until 2012. Since the weak yen increases the cost of imports and has a tenuous impact on exports, it contributed to a trade deficit in 2024. But the weak yen raised the yen value of repatriated profits and contributed to a 47 per cent increase in tourism. Primary income inflows and tourism revenues more than offset the trade deficit, pushing the overall Japanese current account to a surplus of 4 per cent of GDP. The Nikkei 225 stock market index also benefitted from the weak yen. It increased 19 per cent in 2024 and finished at its highest year-end level ever. Much of this occurred because the weak yen increased the yen profitability of companies such as Toyota and Komatsu, who obtain revenues from abroad. It has yet to be seen whether many Japanese firms who moved factories abroad during strong yen episodes — such as after the 1985 Plaza Accord and the 2008–09 Global Financial Crisis — will return production to Japan as the yen remains weak. The government has pushed to return semiconductor manufacturing to Japan. The weak yen may help this plan succeed. As an oil importer, Japan faces challenges from high energy costs which are only raised with yen depreciation. It is seeking to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and to promote renewables and safe nuclear power. Somewhat paradoxically for an oil importer, oil price increases raise stock prices for Japanese industrial firms. This is because Japanese companies produce niche goods and services that are needed as energy prices increase. These high-quality niche products also improve the resilience of the Japanese economy. Japanese firms produce the lion’s share of photoresists and image sensors, used in the electronics industry and medical equipment. Japanese firms are also major suppliers of inputs to the semiconductor industry. With Japan consistently ranking as the most sophisticated economy, finding substitutes for many Japanese goods is hard. This provides Japanese companies with a stable source of demand for their products across Southeast Asia, Taiwan, South Korea, China, Europe and the United States. This diversification reduces their exposure to difficulties in individual markets such as China. Japan will face challenges in 2025, including uncertainties from United States President Donald Trump, competition from South Korean and Chinese firms, dangers from wars and natural disasters, a shrinking workforce and an aging population. Japanese companies have navigated difficulties associated with the Russia–Ukraine war, the COVID-19 pandemic and the weak yen. These past successes provide reason for optimism that Japan can weather the coming shocks. Willem Thorbecke is Senior Fellow at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, Japan.
