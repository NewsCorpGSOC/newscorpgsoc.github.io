China stands to gain from South Korea’s political crisis	On 15 January 2025, Yoon Suk-yeol cemented his name in the history books, becoming the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested. In the month following this event, one of Asia’s most vibrant democracies and a key global economic player has found itself mired in political chaos. This chaos came to a head with Yoon’s impeachment following his controversial declaration of martial law in December 2024. Yoon’s arrest by the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials sealed the fate of his political career. His impeachment, indictment and ongoing criminal trial has left the nation in leadership limbo. South Korea’s political crisis stems from deep domestic fissures. Yoon’s martial law declaration — justified as a move against pro-North Korean anti-state forces — was widely perceived as a self-serving gambit to retain power amid declining approval ratings and opposition dominance in the National Assembly. While public opinion overwhelmingly supports Yoon’s removal, mistrust in the opposition Democratic Party (DP) also remains high, reflecting a broader disillusionment with both major parties. The uncertainty has sparked mass protests, shaken public trust and destabilised South Korea’s political institutions. Acting president Han Duck-soo has also been impeached, leaving Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok as the interim leader. But this turmoil is not just a domestic affair. South Korea’s ambitions to move beyond middle power status to a ’global pivotal actor’ while being a strategic US ally and an economic powerhouse means its internal challenges carry global significance. Its political paralysis comes at a time of heightened US–China competition, with Seoul caught in the middle. Interestingly, South Korea’s political crisis has drawn ethnic Chinese into the narrative as a scapegoat, even as Beijing emerges as a beneficiary. The role of ethnic Chinese residents in South Korea is becoming a strategic angle of discussion. The Hwagyo (ethnic Chinese immigrants) community is politicised in South Korea, with discriminatory policies and social bullying reported since the 1950s even as China continues to dominate immigration numbers to South Korea. The recent crisis has seen a rise in anti-Chinese sentiments, with members of Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) accusing ethnic Chinese residents of supporting pro-impeachment rallies. Beijing was also made a central issue during the trial as Yoon’s attorneys raised concerns about alleged Chinese interference in South Korea via its ‘companies and people residing in South Korea’ to ’fund and support’ pro-China activities. Disinformation in South Korean media has fuelled Sinophobia, with a striking example being the circulation of a false story claiming that United States Forces Korea had arrested 99 Chinese spies linked to election rigging and transferred them to Okinawa. Although debunked, this narrative has gained traction among conservative commentators, reflecting the deeply polarised information ecosystem shaping public discourse. A known follower of far-right YouTube channels, Yoon has been influenced by these conversations. On 12 December 2024, Yoon framed his martial law declaration as a necessary response to growing security threats and foreign interference. Pointing to two incidents of Chinese nationals allegedly surveilling US–South Korean military sites in June and November, he further accused opponents of obstructing anti-espionage legislation. Beijing swiftly condemned these claims. The Chinese embassy in Seoul issued a direct warning to Chinese expatriates, advising them to avoid political gatherings to prevent legal repercussions, including potential deportation. By issuing this warning and framing Seoul’s actions as discriminatory, Beijing is positioning itself as a defender of overseas Chinese communities, reinforcing its extraterritorial influence. Allegations of Chinese espionage and involvement in pro-impeachment protests have fuelled Sinophobia in South Korea, playing into Beijing’s hands by deepening domestic discord. Chinese state media like Global Times and Xinhua have amplified narratives of South Korean democratic dysfunction, contrasting it with China’s own model of political stability. This allows Beijing to simultaneously deflect criticism of its own governance while sowing doubt about the efficacy of US-led alliances. Despite increasing Sinophobia, Beijing stands to gain from South Korea’s political crisis. Beyond a favourable change in political leadership, the turmoil has also provided China with opportunities in the maritime domain. The resumption of Chinese installations in the Yellow Sea amid Seoul’s leadership vacuum is not a coincidence but a calculated move to push for control over disputed waters. Beijing’s approach mirrors its South China Sea strategy — gradually altering facts on the ground through infrastructure development and military presence while dismissing diplomatic protests as baseless. With South Korea’s political institutions paralysed and its security apparatus preoccupied with internal instability, China faces minimal resistance, making this an opportune moment to expand its influence. The timing of these actions suggests that Beijing sees South Korea’s domestic unrest as a window to consolidate territorial claims that would otherwise face strong diplomatic and military pushback. Beyond allowing for territorial manoeuvres, South Korea’s internal division continues to work in Beijing’s favour should the DP come to power in place of Yoon’s PPP. Viewed as a largely pro-China and anti-Japan party, a DP government would bode ill for South Korea–Japan relations and influence the stability of the US–South Korea alliance. South Korea’s political crisis underscores the fragility of democracies in a polarised world. For China, it is a chance to exploit divisions and project itself as a stabilising force. For South Korea, it is a reminder of the importance of resilience — in both governance and regional strategy. The crisis is a pivotal moment, testing alliances, exposing vulnerabilities and reshaping regional dynamics.

An intelligent approach to the artificial intelligence boom	Big technological breakthroughs always bring major economic upheaval. From the Industrial Revolution onwards, economies that are nimble and able to adapt to productivity shocks are the ones that enjoy the most growth during periods of rapid technological change. Managing the transition is never easy and requires a delicate balance between facilitating innovation, mitigating job displacement when it happens and ensuring that the macroeconomic settings are right so that countries can capture the long-term benefits of a technological change. The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution that is now hard upon us will be no different. Predicting how new technologies affect structural change is always difficult, and their impacts have historically been both overestimated and underestimated: many everyday items like the microwave were on their introduction heralded as capable of revolutionising our lives. On the other hand, as eminent economist Paul Krugman famously suggested, the internet might have the same productivity effect as the fax machine. It’s too early to tell whether AI is more microwave or Internet, but the rapid pace of improvement suggests that even if its full impact is limited to a segment of the economy, the increase it brings in the productivity of labour will not be minor. AI also promises to push productivity upward in the services sector, which typically lags behind productivity growth in the goods sector. This could revive economies like Japan’s, or the eurozone’s, that are stagnating in the face of major demographic headwinds. In this week’s lead article, Amit Singh and Adam Triggs argue that AI’s disruptive potential is fundamentally a macroeconomic challenge rather than a purely technological one. Their simulation of an AI-driven productivity boom highlights some major policy imperatives — increasing the investment capacity of national economies, reforms that make financial markets more efficient and making sure that labour can adapt and talented workers can easily move to areas where the return to their skills are most needed. It’s a compelling roadmap and one that should help policymakers in the Asia Pacific region plan for what will likely be a turbulent decade. ‘Upskilling the workforce will be key’, say Singh and Triggs. ‘The AI boom creates new jobs and higher wages, particularly in STEM fields, which will encourage more people to train in those areas. But the lag-time in this upskilling means that it is crucial to get ahead of the curve and use direct subsidies to start upskilling quickly in STEM capabilities. And developed economies need to increase skilled migration, not reduce it. If businesses can’t expand due to a lack of skilled workers, the economy won’t get the full benefits of the AI boom’. Just as the Huguenot refugees in England helped provide the skilled labour necessary for the first Industrial Revolution, skilled migrants will play a major role in building capacity in AI. The growing global backlash against immigration will only hold economies back from building the workforce they need. Singh and Triggs emphasise the importance of access to savings, arguing that countries with deeper capital markets and sound fiscal policies will be best positioned to make the most of AI-driven growth. Doing so requires policymakers to swim against a strong protectionist and regulatory current, made more dangerous with the re-election of US President Donald Trump. The mood in Europe as well as Washington is darkening and the world economy is at risk of fracturing on geopolitical as well as economic lines. Technological revolutions like AI do not respect national boundaries, though. Policymakers in Asia will need to be bold in rejecting the inward turn of the North Atlantic economies. If the global economy fractures into competing blocs, access to AI-related technology, talent and capital may be determined more by geopolitical alliances than by market forces. Responding to the deteriorating institutional environment and the AI boom both ought to point in the same policy direction — a buttressing of the liberal economic order among countries for which it is an economic necessity and the pursuit of sound macroeconomic policy. On the domestic front, labour mobility will be key. Removing barriers to that mobility — such as non-compete clauses and occupational licensing restrictions — are tangible reforms that can help, but the real challenge will be in managing the social and political dimensions of AI-driven structural change. It’s too soon to tell what shape this labour market disruption might take, but the experience of the United States during the ‘China shock’, where poorly functioning tax and transfer systems did little to cushion the economic blow for workers in manufacturing, suggests that a failure to manage the politics of economic change could have big long-run political consequences. For policymakers this is a marathon, as Singh and Triggs suggest, not a sprint. Policy needs to be responsive to new developments but also offer stability for investors. Far from an easy challenge at the best of times, this is a challenge that will prove extremely daunting for a world that seems to be daily retreating into isolation, driven by baffling policy decisions in Washington. But for those leaders who value economic growth and social cohesion, Singh and Triggs offer as good a blueprint as is out there for getting policy settings right for the next major technological revolution.

Getting macro-ready for the AI race	If there was any doubt that we’re in an artificial intelligence (AI) race, Donald Trump’s 21 January 2025 announcement of a US$500 billion private investment in building data centres and advancing AI chips removes it. Even the UK government is joining in, unveiling an AI plan on 13 January 2025 with 50 recommendations to boost innovation and efficiency. All this was before China’s DeepSeek rocked the foundations of the AI world, delivering the same results as Western companies at dramatically lower cost. With AI coming in fast, a common question is how we can minimise the risks from the technology. But an equally important question which doesn’t get asked as much is: how can we maximise its benefits? After all, for any given level of risk, we will want to make sure we are getting the biggest bang for our buck. This might sound like a tech question. But it’s largely a question for macroeconomics. Olivier Blanchard said recently that DeepSeek was ‘probably the largest positive total factor productivity shock in the history of the world’. So we used a computable general equilibrium model to simulate exactly that: an AI boom where productivity takes off across countries as firms and households adopt new AI technologies to explore how the benefits to GDP from this boom differed depending on the government’s policy settings. We identify four key lessons for policymakers in Asia and around the world if they want to get the most out of the AI boom. First, the AI boom will see a major increase in investment, along with a significant increase in demand for savings to finance that investment. This could lead to a problem — if the demand for savings outstrips the supply of savings, interest rates rise, dampening the investment boom and offsetting some of the benefits to the community. Unsurprisingly, we found that the countries that have access to more savings will do better than the countries that don’t. For policymakers, this means that governments should continue to reduce debt and deficits and find more efficient ways to deliver services, remove restrictions on foreign investment and get comfortable running trade deficits since exports will fall as the exchange rate appreciates with capital inflows. Second, countries will need to compete for the world’s scarce savings. Countries with a higher return on capital unsurprisingly do better at attracting savings to finance the AI boom and hence reap more of its benefits. For policymakers, this means two things — lifting productivity and tax reform. Simplifying and reducing taxes on capital and investment will increase the return on capital, encouraging more savings to flow into the economy and delivering bigger benefits from the AI boom. It will also lead to better energy markets, improved resource management and the removal of duplication in development approvals. Third, financial markets will need to direct the capital to where it’s needed. Key to this is flexibility. Countries with more financial rigidities experience the same negative consequences as countries with insufficient savings — the investment boom is muted. For policymakers, this means making sure that financial regulations are not unnecessarily preventing firms and households from getting the capital they need. Bank asset risk weightings, along with regulations on pension funds and fintech, should all be reviewed with this in mind. It also means being strategic and targeted about where countries can most succeed in the AI tech stack — in Australia, for example, these opportunities lie in applications, infrastructure and datasets. Fourth, it’s not all about capital. Booming industries will need workers and many new AI businesses will be created by workers who leave their current jobs. Policymakers need to make sure that workers can switch jobs easily, that they are equipped with the right skills and that the entrepreneurs who start new businesses aren’t stopped from doing so. This means getting rid of the things that make it hard for workers to switch jobs. Non-compete clauses should be scrapped, taxes that punish relocation should be phased out and barriers to entry to certain occupations (think: licencing requirements) should be reviewed. Regulatory and tax inconsistencies between sub-national governments should also be addressed. Upskilling the workforce will be key. The AI boom creates new jobs and higher wages, particularly in STEM fields, which will encourage more people to train in those areas. But the lag-time in this upskilling means that it is crucial to get ahead of the curve and use direct subsidies to start upskilling quickly in STEM capabilities. And developed economies need to increase skilled migration, not reduce it. If businesses can’t expand due to a lack of skilled workers, the economy won’t get the full benefits of the AI boom. The AI race is an ironman event, not a track meet, and success depends on getting all the settings right. Policymakers must approach it comprehensively. Getting our macro settings right should be the first step.

Fixing the fractures in ASEAN’s digital health services	As Southeast Asia embraces digital innovation, the healthcare sector is seeing significant advancements, especially with eHealth initiatives aimed at improving healthcare access and quality. The Asia Pacific emerged in 2024 as the third most significant region for digital health funding globally with around US$2 billion raised across 244 deals. Digital health innovation not only improves patient outcomes but also enhances public health surveillance, supports medical research and drives economic growth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine platforms surged in popularity, enabling remote consultations and ensuring continued care. These innovations underscore the potential of eHealth in overcoming geographical barriers and resource constraints. ASEAN member states, led by Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines, attract substantial investments in critical healthcare domains. Digital platforms like Indonesia’s SATUSEHAT platform, Thailand’s Mor Prom and Singapore’s HealthHub exemplify the region’s efforts to bridge these gaps. These tools aim to integrate patient data, enhance telehealth services and streamline medical record access, heralding a new era of healthcare delivery in Southeast Asia. But to fully leverage these advancements, ASEAN must continue addressing foundational challenges that could hinder its progress. Critical and lingering issues like interoperability, cybersecurity and trust potentially impede the bloc’s efforts to devise a robust and integrated regional healthcare ecosystem. Interoperability is the backbone of an integrated, cross-border digital health ecosystem. It enables seamless data exchange across borders, ensuring continuity of care for patients traveling within ASEAN. Most ASEAN countries operate in silos, with national health systems that lack standardised data formats and shared protocols. The lack of consensus on operational standards is a significant barrier to effective data sharing and interoperability in the public health context. This is particularly salient in the ASEAN context, where a diversity of health systems and regulatory environments can create additional complexities. The European Union’s eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure may serve as an exemplar. Its integrated cross-border services like ePrescriptions and Patient Summaries result in a more seamless provision of health services. ASEAN’s own Digital Health Framework similarly intends to establish regional standards for electronic health records and data sharing. It remains imperative for the bloc to go the extra mile towards a unified digital health framework by adopting best practices from its member states, harmonising regulations and enhancing cross-border collaboration. ASEAN’s six biggest economies — Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines — can significantly spearhead these actions and devise a more collaborative, regionally-endorsed effort in advancing digital health in the region. Enhancing regional cooperation and taking concrete steps beyond multilateral agreements will be critical in driving the progress. ASEAN can mirror European initiatives such as the joint action Towards the European Health Data Space that may serve as concrete guidelines and technical specifications for using health data across country borders. ASEAN can adopt similar measures by strengthening national cybersecurity regulations, promoting data encryption technologies and fostering cross-border collaboration on digital protection. It can also establish secure data-sharing sandboxes for testing, and innovation can help mitigate risks while promoting interoperability. Trust also remains as a potential barrier to the widespread adoption of digital health in the region. Many patients still prefer in-person consultations due to concerns about the reliability, security and quality of digital services. A recent study emphasises that, while digital health initiatives could enhance healthcare access and quality, considerable barriers such as patient distrust and concerns about the effectiveness of remote consultations may hinder its widespread adoption. In rural areas, healthcare infrastructure is often lacking, leading to a reliance on traditional methods of consultation. These perceptions are exacerbated by inconsistent service delivery and occasional data privacy breaches. Addressing this challenge requires huge effort. Public awareness campaigns can educate users about the benefits and safety of digital health services. Governments must enforce transparent policies on data usage and privacy. Fostering patient-centric design in eHealth platforms, such as user-friendly interfaces and real-time data access, can improve adoption rates and satisfaction. To move forward, ASEAN must establish comprehensive regional standards for data sharing, supported by digital public infrastructure investments and strengthened multilateral collaboration. Member states should also devise a balanced approach to data protection — one that actually safeguards users’ digital rights while also ensuring it does not hamper innovation. Aligning with international best practices, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation may provide a regulatory foundation. Still, regulations must be adapted to support both security and the dynamic growth of the digital health ecosystem. This is to ensure it gives users confidence through education, transparency and patient-centric innovation — factors essential for driving adoption.

Indonesia must pursue a progressive value-added tax system	Indonesia’s value-added tax (VAT) system is struggling to balance the need for sufficient revenue to fund public services against the risk of regressivity. A progressive VAT, featuring a single rate with real-time compensation for low-income earners, offers a viable solution. By integrating a modern VAT, Indonesia could set an example for how digital solutions can help mitigate the regressivity of consumption taxes in developing countries. Indonesia’s tax-to-GDP ratio has stagnated at around 10–12 per cent for the last decade, falling short of financing the increasing demand for investment in health, education and infrastructure development. The government initially proposed raising the VAT rate to 12 per cent to strengthen revenue collection. But in response to public concerns and protests, the policy was revised, maintaining the effective rate at 11 per cent, with the 12 per cent rate applied exclusively to luxury goods. The global average VAT rate of 15 per cent suggests room for a modest rate increase. Such reforms, combined with a more progressive VAT system, could raise several billions in revenue without overburdening Indonesia’s poor. A modern VAT system is designed for simplicity and efficiency by taxing all goods and services at a uniform rate, eliminating complex exemptions and reduced rates for essentials like food, medicine and utilities. But VAT’s regressive nature disproportionately burdens lower-income households, who spend a larger share of their income on consumption. A modern VAT system can address this issue by incorporating a compensation mechanism that provides direct, real-time reimbursements to eligible low-income consumers. In Indonesia, the integration of the Core Tax Administration System with existing digital payment platforms presents a viable solution for implementing such a system. By identifying eligible consumers at the point of purchase, the system could automatically transfer VAT reimbursements directly to their bank or e-money accounts. With the increasing adoption of QR code-based payment systems, real-time compensation is not just an ambitious idea — it is a practical and achievable step towards a more equitable tax system. The digital reimbursement mechanism proposal was supported in the International Monetary Fund’s Designing a Progressive VAT working paper. But implementation requires improved data integration between Indonesian institutions. A crucial step is merging citizen identification and taxpayer identification systems to identify eligible recipients accurately. The reform must also address barriers to access and usage in rural areas where digital infrastructure remains limited. The retention of Indonesia’s VAT credit system is crucial. The government can implement reforms while still preserving this established mechanism and the support it offers vulnerable groups by targeting non-VAT entrepreneurs — primarily small businesses with a turnover that qualifies them for exemption. Implementing a progressive VAT system presents several challenges. Data privacy concerns, fraud risks and the system’s intrusiveness require robust regulations and enhanced transparency. Strong data protection measures, including secure authentication protocols for both consumers and tax authorities, are essential for safeguarding sensitive information. Transparency will also play a crucial role in maintaining public trust. Clear communication about how data is collected, processed and used must be provided to taxpayers, alongside accessible channels for them to raise any concerns. Political obstacles also pose a significant challenge. Implementing a broad-based VAT system that eliminates exemptions and special rates requires overcoming entrenched interests and established practices. This is particularly difficult in Indonesia, where exemptions enjoy political popularity. Indonesia’s unique geographic and economic structure presents additional complexities. While urban areas have seen rapid advancements in mobile payments and digital platforms, many rural regions still lack access to reliable internet and mobile payment systems. The proposed system offers significant advantages despite these challenges. Incorporating a single VAT rate on all goods and services with real-time compensation to low-income households would boost revenue, reduce the VAT’s regressive impact and support small businesses. This approach goes beyond tax policy — it serves as a blueprint for inclusive growth. A progressive VAT system would create a virtuous cycle where increased revenue is used to fund investments that foster economic growth, reduce inequality and enhance long-term productivity. Successfully implementing a modern VAT in Indonesia could set a powerful precedent for other Southeast Asian states, demonstrating that fairness and efficiency can coexist. The stakes are high. Indonesia has a unique opportunity to position itself as a high-income economy by 2045. Indonesia must seize this opportunity to invest in the future and ensure a prosperous, equitable society.

Mongolia keeps mining for growth amid economic uncertainty	Following Mongolia’s 2024 election, a new government faces the challenge of sustaining economic growth amid rising global uncertainty. Strong export performance and fiscal expansion fuel optimism, but structural challenges may test the country’s resilience. The Mongolian economy is continuing its recovery from COVID-19-related slowdown. Economic growth was 4.9 per cent in 2024, which is significantly lower than the 7.4 per cent growth in 2023 and the average growth rate of 6.4 per cent over the past 18 years. The industrial sector grew by 5 per cent, with the mining sector expanding by 5.7 per cent. But the agricultural sector, which accounted for around 10 per cent of GDP, contracted by 25 per cent in the first three quarters of 2024. This decline is attributed to severe winter and spring weather conditions, known as the ‘Dzud’, which led to the loss of 8.1 million animals — 12.5 per cent of total livestock. Total exports increased moderately by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year, reaching US$15.8 billion, while imports rose sharply by 25.5 per cent to reach US$11.6 billion, both marking historical highs. Export growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in copper exports. The volume of copper exports reached a record 1.7 million tons, up 11.1 per cent from the previous year, while the average border price of copper increased by US$236 per ton, boosting the value of copper exports by 26 per cent. Though coal export volume grew by over 20 per cent to a historic high of 83.7 million tons in 2024, the price of coal fell by US$25.4 per ton, leading to a 2.3 per cent decline in the value of coal exports. Economic growth in 2024 was fuelled by significant expansion on the demand side. With relatively favourable conditions for commodity exports and a positive outlook of the near future, the state budget revenue and grants increased by 28.7 per cent from 2023, reaching a historic high of 31.4 trillion Mongolian togrog (US$9.1 billion). Budget expenditure expanded by 34.9 per cent, reaching another historic high of 30.4 trillion Mongolian togrog (US$8.8 billion). Private consumption and investment also rose by 27.8 per cent and 26.8 per cent respectively in the first three quarters of 2024. Inflation remained within the central bank’s target range, averaging 6.6 per cent in 2024. This was despite ongoing uncertainties in the external environment, capacity constraints in energy, transport and logistics sectors, significant demand-side expansion and negative supply shocks in animal husbandry. The labour force participation rate continued its steady rise, reaching 63 per cent in the third quarter of 2024, while the unemployment rate rose to 6.1 per cent. The rise in exports also improved the country’s foreign exchange reserves, which registered a record high of US$5.5 billion. This milestone is especially significant considering the Bank of Mongolia made payments of around US$1.1 billion in foreign debt. The togrog remained relatively stable against the US dollar throughout 2024. The government’s debt management strategy for 2023–25 stipulates that new foreign securities will be issued solely for the purpose of refinancing existing debt. Following implementation, as well as abovementioned positive changes in the economy, the government’s sovereign bond spread reached the lowest in history — 2.3 per cent — in 2024. As a result, credit rating agencies S&amp;P Global and Fitch Ratings upgraded the country’s credit rating to B+ and B2 respectively, marking the highest rating in the past decade. Mongolia saw the formation of its first 126-member parliament following the 2024 parliamentary election. The election — based on a mixed electoral system — led to five parties winning seats, with 78 members elected from constituencies and 48 from party lists. Notably, 25 per cent were women — the highest level of female participation in recent generations. Though the Mongolian People’s Party won the majority of seats, it formed a coalition government with the Democratic Party and the HUN Party, giving it a 94 per cent supermajority. The current coalition government is aiming to implement 14 mega-projects in the next four years, having endorsed linking the railway border connection with China — which should boost coal export revenue by 2.8 times — and uranium mining in collaboration with the French ‘Orano’ group. The new parliament finally adopted the Law on the Sovereign Wealth Fund after many years of deliberation. The fund is composed of three sub-funds, designed to accumulate wealth, finance large state investments and support social measures. Budget discussions were notably intense, resulting in the adoption of a zero-deficit budget for 2025. But the Fiscal Stability Law, which has been in effect since 2013, was amended to remove the upper limit on the overall budget deficit, replacing it with a lower limit on the primary balance surplus. The long-term impact of this change has not been fully assessed, nor has its potential to ensure fiscal stability. Looking ahead to 2025, factors such as disruptions in petroleum supply from Russia, a slowdown in Chinese economy, expanding budget spending, spiralling wage increase, surges in electricity and heat prices and the continued impact of the Dzud will continue to put pressure on inflation and economic growth.

Cambodia struggles to harvest its agricultural potential while Vietnam reaps the benefits	Cambodia’s trade with Vietnam has increased significantly, with a noticeable reduction in the bilateral trade deficit over time. But the relationship remains imbalanced, with Cambodia heavily reliant on exporting raw materials while importing higher-value goods. This dynamic has left Cambodia unable to fully capitalise on its agricultural potential, putting its farmers and economy at a disadvantage. While ASEAN promotes trade among its members through initiatives like the ASEAN Economic Community, small states like Cambodia struggle to benefit due to limited production and export capacity. From Cambodia’s perspective, ASEAN is standing by as Vietnam imports raw materials from Cambodia, rather than helping the Kingdom develop its own agro-processing industry. From January to November 2024, trade between Cambodia and Vietnam reached US$7.08 billion, a 20.6 per cent increase, making Vietnam Cambodia’s second-largest export market behind the United States. Cambodia’s exports to Vietnam reached US$3.29 billion, up 26.3 per cent, mostly consisting of cashews, corn, bananas, mangoes, tobacco, rice and rubber. Vietnam&#8217;s main exports to Cambodia, worth US$3.79 billion, include building supplies, machinery, fuel, electronics and electrical equipment, fertilisers, animal feed, vegetables and fruits. Cambodian farmers produce agricultural products, but these goods are often unprofitable due to low selling prices and high production costs of fertilisers, fuel and machinery. Vietnam benefits from Cambodia’s limited industrial capacity, importing raw materials at lower prices and processing them into finished goods for export to global markets like Europe and China under Vietnam’s own branding. Rice is Cambodia’s primary agricultural product, occupying nearly 70 per cent of cultivated land, with subsidiary and industrial crops at 19 per cent, rubber at 7 per cent and permanent crops at 4 per cent. The country has significant potential for high-value agricultural exports due to its fertile land and favourable climate. Government initiatives have focused on enhancing productivity and diversifying exports towards higher-value products. Although agriculture’s contribution to GDP has decreased from 50 per cent in the early 1990s to about 22 per cent in 2023, it still accounts for nearly 40 per cent of employment. But the Kingdom heavily relies on sourcing fertilisers from neighbouring countries, including Vietnam (US$207 million), Thailand (US$139 million), China (US$12 million), Japan (US$5.61 million) and South Korea (US$1.61 million). Despite this, farmers and other individuals continue to encounter difficulties, such as the rising cost of fertiliser and high living expenses. Cambodia is primarily reliant on raw material exports, limiting its agricultural benefits. Farmers grow lucrative commodities such as cassava, rubber and cashews, but they are frequently exported to Vietnam for processing. In 2022–23, Cambodia exported over 3.5 million tonnes of paddy rice to Vietnam, where it is processed and then exported to international markets. These include Europe and some ASEAN countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia — Vietnam’s largest rice export markets. Cambodia has enough rice mills capable of meeting international export standards, but lacks capital to purchase rice grains for stocking and production and struggles to reduce processing costs, particularly in transportation. Cambodian farmers encounter challenges such as low yields due to outdated techniques, limited access to advanced technology and high production costs. As a result some farming households in Takeo, Kandal, Prey Veng and Svay Rieng have decided to rent their farmland to Southwestern Vietnamese farmers for rice cultivation. Cambodia faces challenges in job creation, income growth, economic diversification and industrial development, largely because it relies heavily on exporting raw materials. Developing value-added industries, such as packaging and food processing, remains a significant underexplored opportunity. In 2024, 95 per cent of raw cashew nuts were exported, leaving only 5 per cent for domestic processing. This leads to significant value loss for farmers, traders and local communities. Cambodia’s limited domestic processing capacity allows Vietnam to dominate the value-added stage of its agricultural exports. This situation is further compounded by high export costs and stringent entry requirements for processed agricultural goods in global markets. Electricity is a crucial input for processing, yet Cambodia has one of the highest costs of electricity in the region. The education system also lacks specialised training in food technology, quality control and agro-industrial engineering. To develop a strong agro-processing industry, Cambodia must reduce electricity and logistics costs to boost local competitiveness. Investment in modern food processing technology would improve efficiency and product quality, opening doors to international markets. Developing a skilled workforce in agro-industrial engineering is essential for sustaining technological advancements. Expanding financial access through targeted incentives and low-interest loans can attract investment in processing facilities. There is also a need to strengthen the country’s branding and export strategies, shifting from raw exports to high-value agricultural products. These actions are expected to boost industrial growth, generate employment opportunities and consolidate Cambodia&#8217;s position in global trade. Cambodia’s growing trade with Vietnam presents both challenges and opportunities. As ASEAN removes regional trade barriers, the Kingdom is losing its competitive advantage in agricultural products to Vietnam, leaving citizens facing high expenses and low incomes.

Canada’s trade tightrope with ASEAN needs flexibility	On the sidelines of the 2024 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Lima, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jointly announced the ‘substantive conclusion of negotiations’ for a Canada–Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement. Set to come into effect in 2025, this agreement highlights Canada’s progress as a latecomer to the Southeast Asian economic stage just three years after introducing its Indo-Pacific Strategy. Ottawa’s modus operandi for accessing Southeast Asia’s markets combines both bilateral and regional approaches. For years, Canada has been negotiating a regional free trade agreement with the ten ASEAN member states, including Indonesia. Prior to Canada, the European Union attempted to reach an interregional agreement with ASEAN. But the European Union’s ambitious vision ‘clashed with the actual heterogeneity of ASEAN member states’. In 2009, facing disagreements within ASEAN, the European Union chose a cooperative approach focusing on bilateral agreements. While the European Union opted for a regional first, bilateral later approach, Canada is pursuing both at the same time. But negotiating with ASEAN is far from easy. Canada is progressive, even when it comes to international trade. Canada’s Progressive Trade Agenda (PTA), which was launched in 2017, sets high standards in areas such as environmental protection, labour rights and gender equality through its trade agreements provisions. These ‘new generation’ agreements are on the rise, but may prove dissuasive due to financial, institutional or political obstacles to their implementation — especially for developing economies focusing on competitiveness. With some ASEAN member states counted among Asia’s least developed economies, they likely would not be receptive to Canada’s progressive demands. The scope of the agreement may need to be adapted for these less resilient economies. Agriculture is a telling example. Lowering tariff barriers in the agricultural sector exposes small farmers to economically devastating competition, not to mention other serious social consequences. And given Canada’s supply management system for products such as dairy, poultry and eggs — relying on quotas and high tariffs to protect domestic producers — full agricultural liberalisation is probably not on Canada’s agenda either. Exclusions are to be expected. Considering these less resilient economies, adapted or differentiated liberalisation schedules are essential. When ASEAN’s free trade area was established in the 1990s, advanced countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore were given shorter implementation periods than less-developed ones like Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. Yet ASEAN’s member states exceeded expectations, completing liberalisation ahead of schedule. A similar two-track liberalisation model is not out of the question for the Canada–ASEAN partnership. ASEAN’s signature free trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), is a prime example of a trade agreement tailored to the economic realities of its parties. Member states’ autonomy over concession lists has resulted in significant exclusions such as agricultural products, labour-intensive manufactured goods, strategic products such as vehicles and goods with negative externalities. The RCEP also sets a 20-year ceiling for tariff reduction, granting leeway to Southeast Asia’s least resilient economies. Its a la carte design lets states opt for either a single concession list for all, or individual lists for each. Flexibility and inclusivity come at the cost of simplicity. A flexible, RCEP-style agreement could be the favoured approach for ASEAN’s less-developed economies as it provides control over concession lists, exclusion of sensitive sectors and long implementation timelines. But it doesn’t serve the immediate interests of more developed ASEAN member states such as Indonesia or Singapore. Alternatively, a high-standard and progressive ASEAN–Canada agreement is a scenario worth considering given Ottawa’s commitment to its PTA. Keeping exclusions minimal and shortening timelines would swiftly unlock the agreement’s full potential. To avoid less-developed economies’ vetoes, Canada is likely to propose compensatory measures such as expert deployment, capacity-building initiatives or financial support, likely through official development assistance channels. The application of the agreement would be contingent upon compliance with the PTA standards, rendering the ‘Canada–ASEAN minus X’ model the most realistic option. Unlike the European Union’s rigid approach, ASEAN’s open regionalism allows for a more flexible and accommodating integration process. Be that as it may, Canada is walking a tightrope. To secure preferential access to the ASEAN market, Ottawa should adopt a flexible and conciliatory approach, especially as it braces for a major trade storm with the protectionist Trump administration back in the White House.

Malaysia’s reform aspirations clashed with political realities in 2024	After focusing on political survival in 2023, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim entered 2024 with ambitious plans to restore Malaysia’s standing as one of Asia’s leading economies and middle powers. Economic growth exceeded expectations — fuelled in part by a surge in foreign investment — particularly in the semiconductor sector, the Malaysian ringgit saw a modest recovery and Anwar’s active diplomacy elevated Malaysia’s global profile. Yet 2024 also demonstrated that ambition alone is insufficient to overcome Malaysia’s entrenched political divisions. Anwar’s government, constrained by an unwieldy coalition and the volatile pull of identity politics, struggled to advance significant reforms. Race and religion remained potent political flashpoints. In March, a convenience store inadvertently sold socks embossed with the word ‘Allah’, triggering viral outrage. Several political leaders used the incident to paint Anwar’s government — and its Chinese-majority coalition partner, the Democratic Action Party — as insufficiently protective of Malay-Muslim interests. Even the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a key member of the ruling coalition, saw its Youth Chief join the fray, highlighting the coalition’s internal tensions. In May, Universiti Teknologi MARA — a university historically reserved for ethnic Malays and other bumiputera — proposed temporarily admitting students from other ethnic backgrounds to its postgraduate cardiothoracic programme to address a critical shortage of qualified surgeons. The backlash was swift, with students and Malay nationalist groups mobilising in protest. In August, former prime minister and opposition leader Muhyiddin Yassin was charged with sedition for appearing to question a royal decision which followed the 2022 election. While his comments drew public criticism, the sedition charge itself reignited debates over selective prosecution. After years of politicising Malaysia’s race, religion and royalty, identity-based populism has become a force unto itself, with no clear way to contain or navigate it in pursuit of substantive reform. Another former prime minister, Najib Razak — serving time for his role in the 1MDB corruption scandal — remains a political liability for Anwar. Though popular within UMNO and its base, he is widely denounced as a kleptocrat elsewhere. In February, a Pardons Board unexpectedly halved Najib’s sentence and slashed his fines, fuelling backlash from the public and government. Anwar’s predicament is unenviable — he needs UMNO’s backing to govern, but Najib’s preferential treatment undermines his reformist credentials. Beyond politics, Malaysia faced compounding crises in late 2024. Severe flooding in the northern states displaced hundreds of thousands, while sporadic shortages of local white rice deepened food security concerns. Transnational haze persisted and a string of incidents, from power outages in East Malaysia to a tourist vanishing into a Kuala Lumpur sinkhole, exposed pressing infrastructure gaps. None of these challenges have easy fixes. Still, Anwar may find some relief in Perikatan Nasional’s waning momentum. The opposition, which surged in 2023, has been increasingly fractured. Merdeka Center polling also suggests strengthening support for the government, which could give Anwar more manoeuvring room in 2025. The upcoming Sabah state election will be another key test of his coalition’s stability. Malaysia’s foreign policy in 2024 reflected ongoing strategic balancing. Anwar sought to maintain ties with both China and the West while amplifying Malaysia’s support for Palestine, often through sharp critiques of Western hypocrisy and the rules-based international order. Mid-year, he announced Malaysia’s application to join BRICs while making high-profile visits to Beijing and New Delhi, prompting speculation about Malaysia’s geopolitical realignment. That interpretation is premature, as Malaysia continues to seek strong ties with the United States and other Western partners. Malaysia’s relationship with China, while robust, has had tension. A leaked Chinese diplomatic note ordering Malaysia to halt exploration in its own South China Sea exclusive economic zone underscored the complexities of this balancing act. Anwar, who made dozens of international trips in 2024, frequently spoke off-the-cuff to build rapport with global leaders while also addressing domestic concerns. Many of his statements, shaped by shifting political pressures, reflect tactical positioning rather than a cohesive foreign policy shift. Malaysia’s 2025 ASEAN Chairmanship will be a pivotal test for Anwar’s leadership. Expectations are high for meaningful progress on regional challenges, particularly the crisis in Myanmar and tensions in the South China Sea. Failure to secure tangible results could deepen ASEAN’s fragmentation, prompting member states to pursue mini-lateral alternatives. Simultaneously, Malaysia must build momentum for the successor plans to the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint — frameworks that will shape the region’s future. Negotiations on the Digital Economy Framework Agreement and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area upgrade are set to conclude under Malaysia’s leadership, giving Kuala Lumpur leverage in shaping their final forms. While loftier objectives — such as finalising the South China Sea Code of Conduct or facilitating Timor Leste’s formal ASEAN accession — may prove elusive, Malaysia’s Chairmanship will be central to shaping the agenda and fostering consensus. With global politics in flux, Malaysia’s ambitious 2025 agenda will require not just bold leadership, but also pragmatic goal setting, stronger coordination and effective delegation. These may be Anwar’s real tests. Kai Ostwald is the HSBC Chair in Asian Research and Associate Professor in the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

India’s economic growth engine begins to stall	2024 began with the Indian economy continuing to show remarkable resilience in the face of growing global uncertainties. The macroeconomic fundamentals were buoyant and India’s economy continued to be the fastest growing of the major economies, registering growth of 8.2 per cent during fiscal year 2023–24 (April–March). But India’s growth momentum was considerably dented in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, with its economy growing at a rate of 5.4 per cent. This was the slowest growth in six quarters, almost three percentage points slower than the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. The slowdown of the Indian economy was confirmed by the National Statistics Office when its advance estimates of GDP for the 2024–25 fiscal year showed that the economy could grow by just 6.4 per cent, nearly two percentage points slower than in the previous year. Even though at 6.4 per cent India would continue to be the fastest growing major economy, sub-7 per cent growth does cast a shadow over India’s aspirations of joining the ranks of developed countries by 2047. To get back on course, the Indian economy has to overcome a series of weaknesses, not the least of which is depressed consumer demand. Private consumption expenditure is the main driver of GDP, but this component has remained sluggish ever since the effect of the government stimulus packages provided during the COVID-19 pandemic wore out. Private consumption expenditure exceeded 60 per cent in several quarters between 2021–23, while in the following period it mostly remained in the mid-50 per cent range, even declining to 53 per cent in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023–24. These trends are largely attributable to the wage squeeze suffered by India’s large informal workforce. Still, the small share of workers employed in the formal sector have also experienced a decline in their real wages over the past few years. A report prepared by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Quess Corp Ltd showed that while nominal wages across six major manufacturing and infrastructure sectors increased by 0.8–5.4 per cent, retail inflation was between 4.8 per cent and 5.7 per cent, implying either stagnant or declining real wages for Indian workers. The cost of living may be higher than retail inflation numbers suggest. Food inflation in India was consistently much higher during this period, often close to double digits. In sharp contrast, corporate profits increased fourfold during the same period. Growth in profit-share and a reduction in the wage-share in India’s formal sector has, unsurprisingly, caused sluggish demand conditions in the Indian economy. Data on India’s labour market dynamics available from the Periodic Labour Force Survey support the findings of the FICCI–Quess Corp report. In 2023–24, the share of workers earning a regular wage in the formal sector was just a fifth of the total workforce. Among this group, the share of workers without a written job contract was 58 per cent, while the share of workers not eligible for any specified social security benefit was 53 per cent. Almost 80 per cent of the total workforce was employed in the informal sector, which includes self-employed and casual workers who face uncertain earnings. The government has set an objective of formalising the informal workforce and has embarked on initiatives aimed at creating employment opportunities in the manufacturing sector that would improve workers’ overall economic conditions. India’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme is an ambitious plan to strengthen the country’s manufacturing sector by targeting 14 key sectors with high growth. The PLI scheme has delivered less than expected and the government has made several course corrections to put this key initiative back on the right track. But the employment challenge that the country faces may have to be addressed through more than just one scheme. In 2024, concerns also emerged regarding both the current and capital accounts of India’s balance of payments. The merchandise trade deficit was nearing an all-time high during the first eight months of the current fiscal year, but this did not adversely affect the current account deficit due to higher services exports. But the capital account remains strained due to large outflows of both foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment. Though FDI inflows between April–October 2024 were US$49 billion, higher than in the previous two years, divestments by foreign investors reached a high of over US$34 billion during this period. Outflows of FPI increased during the closing weeks of 2024, causing net inflows during the year to remain in negative territory. A continuation of this trend could put additional pressure on the Indian rupee, which experienced creeping depreciation towards the end of 2024, a trend that has somewhat quickened in the New Year.

Trump 2.0 puts India’s trade policy to the test	US President Donald Trump’s targeted tariff and protectionist policy proposals mean that 2025 will be a landmark year for global trade, creating fresh challenges and opportunities for India. As a major US trading partner, India must explore where it stands to gain under Trump’s second administration and innovate strategies to navigate impending trade turbulence. Though India was not among the countries initially subjected to tariffs, Trump has labelled India the ‘tariff king’. But India’s average trade-weighted tariff rates are low and comply with World Trade Organization rules, while countries like the United States, Japan and South Korea impose significantly higher tariffs on protected products. India’s core export sectors like pharmaceuticals, textiles and IT may face higher US tariffs. India’s strength lies in focusing on the relationship between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Trump to negotiate bilaterally for reciprocal tariff reductions. India’s statement welcoming US energy imports following President Trump’s move to increase domestic oil and gas production is an example of this strategy. But while India must maintain export flows to the United States to sustain short-term growth and employment, export market diversification is crucial for long-term stability and growth. Trump’s imposition of higher tariffs on Chinese exports places immense pressure on businesses to decouple from China, reinvigorating the ‘China Plus One’ strategy that aims to hedge against the risks of investment and trade relations with China. While India can provide the base for the impending capital flight, a report by government think tank NITI Aayog notes that India has been ineffective in capturing the gains from businesses’ China Plus One strategy so far. But by simplifying tax laws, engaging in proactive trade policies and creating a regulatory environment that attracts foreign investment, India can become the alternative trade destination for manufacturing.To weather potential headwinds in the manufacturing sector, India must focus on its Production Linked Incentive schemes to incentivise domestic manufacturing and exports. ‘Friendshoring’ and ‘nearshoring’ provide opportunities that India should leverage in the event of major global trade shifts. Opportunities for India to turn East demand industrial policy reforms geared towards raising productivity and exports in key sectors. President Trump’s proposals of restrictions on skilled and unskilled labour movement could pose substantial challenges for India. India’s outsourcing and IT sector is highly US-centric, with US links contributing to over 80 per cent of India’s IT sector earnings. If President Trump penalises US companies employing imported talent, India’s outsourcing and IT services industry will see significant constraints. But shortages in US STEM graduates and high costs for US IT services to employ local skilled workers mean that in the short run, India’s outsourcing sector may not be impacted. But diversifying the activities of outsourcing and IT sectors to other regions will help the industry withstand US protectionism. India’s IT sector is already exploring new markets in Africa and Latin America to diversify and expand business activities and acquisitions. India will stand to gain from the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) regardless of US engagement. Based on our applied general equilibrium model, deeper trade liberalisation in the IPEF region increases the region&#8217;s growth rate from 3.7 to 4.2 per cent without US involvement. With growing interest in minilateralism, IPEF members will seek to strategically collaborate on shared supply chain and other interests, regardless of US involvement. While India has only maintained an observer status in IPEF’s trade pillar, there is much to gain from its involvement in IPEF’s supply chain, fair economy and clean economy pillars, including by expanding trade ties with countries like Japan and Australia on supply chain and clean economy issues. President Trump’s renewed emphasis on fossil fuels under his ‘drill baby drill’ mantra may not stimulate its desired response from the fossil fuel industry which would like to maintain high oil prices by restraining supply. India’s oil import ties with Russia and export ties to Europe will only be impacted if there’s a boost in US oil production. Energy sector uncertainty means that India must leverage opportunities for cooperation under IPEF’s clean economy pillar and the Quad Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Package. By collaborating with countries like Japan and Australia, India can ramp up the deployment of climate-friendly technologies and promote climate-related projects and zero-emission products. President Trump’s protectionist policies and lack of interest in the World Trade Organization and IPEF may create global trade disruptions. But what Trump will be able to achieve may be limited to a realignment in the global trade and outsourcing matrix due to the global economic interdependencies established during the globalisation era. While this new era will challenge India’s trade relationship with the United States, it will also offer opportunities for trade diversification. Prime Minister Modi must pursue these opportunities while capitalising on his relationship with President Trump to negotiate mutual gains, particularly in critical sectors.

Duterte’s impeachment and the spectacle of Philippine politics	On 5 February 2025, the Philippine House of Representatives impeached Vice President Sara Duterte after 240 lawmakers affixed their signatures to the fourth impeachment complaint lodged against her. Duterte makes history as the first Philippine vice president to be impeached, exposing the deep-rooted political divides in the Philippines. The impeachment complaint hinges on several grounds, including the misuse of public funds, unexplained wealth, allegations of plotting murder and betrayal of public trust. The articles of impeachment were forwarded to the Philippine Senate on the same day but its session adjourned without tackling Duterte’s impeachment. Senate President Francis Escudero explained that the impeachment trial will not commence until the Senate’s session resumes and later announced that the trial will start in July 2025 after President Marcos delivers his third State of the Nation Address. Notable legal luminaries are divided on the procedural aspect of the impeachment. Former Supreme Court justice Adolfo Azcuna, who is also one of the present constitution’s framers, argued that the impeachment trial could proceed even during a Senate recess. Azcuna asserted that the constitution mandates that the impeachment ‘shall forthwith proceed’, meaning it is not bound by the legislative calendar. But fellow retired justice Antonio Carpio opposed President Marcos’ remark that he can call for a special Senate session to proceed with the trial, positing that such a call can only be used for the enactment of laws. Some have cautioned that extending this trial to the succeeding Congress presents a constitutional grey area. Already, a petition has been filed with the Philippine Supreme Court seeking to order the Senate to immediately proceed with Duterte’s impeachment trial. As a countermeasure, Duterte herself filed a petition asking the high court to nullify the impeachment complaint against her. No matter when the trial commences, Duterte’s impeachment could not have come at a worse time. With Filipinos heading to the polls before the Senate resumes its session in June and the trial commences in July, the road ahead looks far from smooth. Half of the Senate’s 24 seats will be up for grabs in the 12 May 2025 midterm election, the outcome of which will be crucial in determining Duterte’s fate. A two-thirds vote in the Senate is required for conviction, which means that at least 16 senators must vote to convict Duterte. The impending change in the Senate’s membership post-election casts a long shadow over Duterte’s impeachment trial. If Duterte does not have enough allies to win the election and evade conviction, her conviction will not only remove her as vice president but may also disqualify her from holding any future public office. But an acquittal would give Duterte a new lease on her political career. The constitutional limitation that allows only one impeachment proceeding to be initiated against any impeachable official within a one-year period would buy Duterte enough time to recover from the blowback of impeachment. If Duterte is convicted, the succession rules outlined in the 1987 Philippine Constitution will take effect by operation of law. The rules provide that in case of a vacancy in the vice presidency, the president may nominate from among the members of the Senate or the House of Representatives, which must be confirmed by a majority in both houses. In this scenario, President Marcos gains leverage by having a choice to select someone he trusts to occupy the vice presidency. Duterte’s conviction will seriously undermine her political clout and will derail her ambition of becoming the next Philippine president. Duterte’s impeachment has added fire to the feud between the Duterte and Marcos families, further polarising the Philippine political landscape. Even with Marcos’ consistent denial of any involvement in the proceedings, Duterte’s impeachment has sounded the death knell for their hollow political alliance. Davao City Congressman Paolo Duterte, the vice president’s brother, described Duterte’s impeachment as another saga in their family’s political persecution by the Marcos administration. The family patriarch, former president Rodrigo Duterte, is at risk of being arrested by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for his regime’s violent war on drugs. In January 2025, the Marcos administration said that it would favourably respond to any request from the ICC concerning Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest. While the impeachment proceedings could restore public trust in the country’s institutions by showing that mechanisms which hold public officials accountable are working, the resulting political instability and increasing polarisation may outweigh its benefits. The selective nature of impeachment, often wielded as a political weapon against the incumbent’s opponents, belies the logic that it reinforces the rule of law. At the end of the day, an impeachment is a spectacle of political partisanship. Duterte’s impeachment does not resolve the deeper issues of lack of accountability, failure of good governance and corruption within the ranks of the Philippines’ political establishment. Only this time, Sara Duterte must take the fall. Josiah Patrick P. Bagayas is a Lawyer and Associate Law Professor at Mariano Marcos State University, Philippines.

ASEAN adapts and advances as global politics shift	ASEAN is better equipped than many in the international community to handle the challenges of 2025. Expanding competition between the United States and China, the slowing Chinese economy and the new US leader’s unpredictability will trouble Southeast Asian countries — and many others. But ASEAN, now under experienced Malaysian leadership, enters 2025 with a relatively vibrant economy. ASEAN’s GDP is about the same as India’s, it has healthy growth rate predictions, strong foreign investment and is China’s largest trade partner. In political matters, ASEAN has moved more slowly, but it possesses a strategic toolkit that can help the organisation to assert agency in a more fluid regional order. Throughout 2024, Southeast Asia drew investment from many quarters, helped by the contest between the United States and China. US technology companies are investing in the region, including setting up elaborate energy-consuming data centres. Japanese, South Korean, European and Chinese manufacturers are also relocating to Southeast Asia to avoid crushing US tariffs. ASEAN countries have avoided being locked into one side or another in the contest of major powers. For instance, Indonesia joined BRICS in January 2025 but also declared a determination to enter the Western-led Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Though some see Southeast Asia as the biggest winner in global trade over the next decade, the dangers are obvious. The United States may impose tariffs not just on China but also on countries like Vietnam where trade is unbalanced and import-heavy. If this happens, ASEAN’s investment advantages would be reduced, even where workforces are being upskilled to handle semiconductor and other higher-value manufacturing. Another risk is that US actions will damage China–ASEAN trade, for instance by driving China to dump products on Southeast Asia, undermining local manufacturing. In security matters, Southeast Asian countries again engage in every direction. Singapore’s military has been cooperating with China and in mid-2024 six ASEAN countries took part in maritime exercises with the United States. Under its present leadership, the Philippines has been more combative towards China, bolstered by closer alignment with the United States — though it also engages in the ‘China–Philippines Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea’. Meanwhile, China has been helping Cambodia with naval training and is involved in developing the Ream Naval Base. The United States supported this initiative in the past, but cut funding in 2018. Despite China’s strong role today, Cambodia insists it is the owner, not China — and that the base is open to all friendly navies. Whether Southeast Asian states can maintain their strategic autonomy if the US–China contest sharpens even further remains to be seen. US President Donald Trump has already displayed antagonism toward BRICS and Southeast Asia may also face a more muscular minilateralism — which was hinted at in the renewed stress on security concerns at the 2024 Quad Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. But in handling this increasingly turbulent region, ASEAN brings economic vitality and a valuable — and historically grounded — set of approaches to foreign relations. Southeast Asian countries have been portrayed as quintessentially pragmatic, advancing their own interests — especially economic interests — and hedging between major powers. But ASEAN’s strategic heritage has more substance than this. For example, Malaysia insists its foreign policy is both principled and pragmatic. ASEAN’s stress on regional community building and on unity being essential to Southeast Asia’s security means the organisation, again under Malaysian leadership, will act with meticulous care regarding South China Sea contests or Myanmar. There is a contrast to be negotiated in 2025 between Philippines’ combativeness and Indonesia’s declared support for practical cooperation with China in disputed maritime areas. Another element in ASEAN’s heritage is an insistence on inclusivity. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s moves toward China and Russia, while affirming his friendship with EU countries and the United States, should be viewed in this light — not as mere hedging. The willingness to be open to all sides, despite differences in governing ideology, has been emphasised time and again across Southeast Asia. ASEAN leaders will not be bothered when Trump’s United States speaks less about the liberal rules-based order and puts more stress on transactional engagement. ASEAN gives institutional expression to inclusivity with bodies such as the East Asia Summit, the ASEAN Regional Forum and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, with their wide membership and patient dialogue. Like-minded minilaterals such as the Quad may move more quickly in practical areas — but they tend to be adversarial and liable to exacerbate regional divisions. Though alliance-forging is a typical response to a rising power in certain parts of the world, Southeast Asian regimes seem relatively comfortable working with hierarchies and their success in asserting agency is caught in the Southeast Asian folk image of the little mouse deer. Small but shrewd, the mouse deer is portrayed as outmanoeuvring the larger animals in the forest. In the emerging Indo-Pacific, with less stress on alliances and ideological commitments, ASEAN countries possess valuable historical experience. Flexibility in political and economic engagement — and a record in building inclusive relations and institutions — may prepare them to negotiate, and even assist in shaping, a post-liberal Indo-Pacific order.

Strong reactions to a weak yen shake Japan’s economy	The Japanese real effective exchange rate is now at its lowest level in 54 years. Despite the pressures of a depreciating yen — from import prices to debt repayment — Japan’s global competitiveness and financial markets make it well-equipped to handle these challenges. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has tightened monetary policy cautiously. It abandoned negative rates on the uncollateralised overnight call rate in March 2024 and raised the target to 0.25 per cent in July 2024 and to 0.5 per cent in January 2025. The move in July sparked a 6 per cent appreciation of the yen and a 12 per cent drop in the stock market, while the move in January proved uneventful. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has been waiting for what he calls good inflation — inflation driven by wage increases that increase consumption and aggregate demand — to tighten policy. Despite years of easy monetary policy and wages increasing 5.1 per cent in the 2024 spring wage offensive, real disposable income has not increased. This has led to sluggish growth in real consumption. The BOJ may face pressure to tighten in order to resist a disorderly depreciation of the yen. This is especially true as the US Federal Reserve may slow monetary policy easing because of inflationary risks due to tariffs, large US budget deficits and the repatriation of illegal immigrants. The weak yen increases the prices of imported energy and food. This has raised average household costs in 2024 by 90,000 yen (US$590). To combat this, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba implemented stimulus measures to subsidise utility bills and provide cash for poorer households. But one problem with both the BOJ’s tightening and Ishiba’s stimulus package is that they increase budget deficits. By raising interest rates, the BOJ raises the cost of servicing Japan’s public debt. At 1.2 per cent, yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds are at their highest level in 14 years. Debt service costs in 2025 are already forecasted to be above 4 per cent of GDP. Ishiba’s package, along with increased spending on military and social security categories, will turn the forecasted primary budget — the budget excluding interest payments — from a surplus into a deficit of 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2025. With a public debt of 250 per cent of GDP, Japan needs to eschew additional borrowing. It should instead allow entrepreneurs to play a larger role in allocating resources. The weak yen also impacts Japan’s international transactions. It raises the costs of imports of food, fuels and other items. Yet the stimulus to exports is mitigated as many manufacturers relocated factories abroad during the strong yen period that lasted until 2012. Since the weak yen increases the cost of imports and has a tenuous impact on exports, it contributed to a trade deficit in 2024. But the weak yen raised the yen value of repatriated profits and contributed to a 47 per cent increase in tourism. Primary income inflows and tourism revenues more than offset the trade deficit, pushing the overall Japanese current account to a surplus of 4 per cent of GDP. The Nikkei 225 stock market index also benefitted from the weak yen. It increased 19 per cent in 2024 and finished at its highest year-end level ever. Much of this occurred because the weak yen increased the yen profitability of companies such as Toyota and Komatsu, who obtain revenues from abroad. It has yet to be seen whether many Japanese firms who moved factories abroad during strong yen episodes — such as after the 1985 Plaza Accord and the 2008–09 Global Financial Crisis — will return production to Japan as the yen remains weak. The government has pushed to return semiconductor manufacturing to Japan. The weak yen may help this plan succeed. As an oil importer, Japan faces challenges from high energy costs which are only raised with yen depreciation. It is seeking to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and to promote renewables and safe nuclear power. Somewhat paradoxically for an oil importer, oil price increases raise stock prices for Japanese industrial firms. This is because Japanese companies produce niche goods and services that are needed as energy prices increase. These high-quality niche products also improve the resilience of the Japanese economy. Japanese firms produce the lion’s share of photoresists and image sensors, used in the electronics industry and medical equipment. Japanese firms are also major suppliers of inputs to the semiconductor industry. With Japan consistently ranking as the most sophisticated economy, finding substitutes for many Japanese goods is hard. This provides Japanese companies with a stable source of demand for their products across Southeast Asia, Taiwan, South Korea, China, Europe and the United States. This diversification reduces their exposure to difficulties in individual markets such as China. Japan will face challenges in 2025, including uncertainties from United States President Donald Trump, competition from South Korean and Chinese firms, dangers from wars and natural disasters, a shrinking workforce and an aging population. Japanese companies have navigated difficulties associated with the Russia–Ukraine war, the COVID-19 pandemic and the weak yen. These past successes provide reason for optimism that Japan can weather the coming shocks. Willem Thorbecke is Senior Fellow at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, Japan.
