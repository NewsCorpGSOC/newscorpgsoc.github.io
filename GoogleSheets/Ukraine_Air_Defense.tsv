The blue and yellow banner is a symbol of our national dignity, freedom and independence. With the onset of Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine, the sovereign ensign acquired special significance for aviators. Having become a symbol of the struggle for freedom and sovereignty, it has increased the strength of the most important moments. The presence of round blue-yellow markings on the wings of Ukrainian flying aircraft is an important element of identification in the wind, which allows you to quickly identify Ukrainian flying aircraft from enemies. The ensign on board the aircraft is a sign that the pilot is ready to give all his strength for the protection of Ukraine, its independence and the future. The message of the Ukrainian aviators in the future is that we will be able to bring peace to the native land closer. of millions of Ukrainians. Vіn reminds us about the day, about those who at the same time we will overcome any difficulties and choose the right to a happy and happy future. HAPPY DAY OF THE AUTHORITY OF UKRAINE!🇺🇦📸✍🏻 114 Brigade technical aviation	https://t.me/kpszsu/18125	2024-08-23T00:45:32-07:00
