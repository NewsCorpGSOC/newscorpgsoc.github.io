Ukraine Air Defense	Forwarded From Commander of the Air Force Mykola Oleschuk?? "Victory on the ground is forged in the sky!" With this slogan, I addressed the commanders of the air forces of NATO countries a year ago, urging my colleagues to create a strong aviation coalition, about the closed skies over Ukraine and the need to strengthen the Ukrainian air defense had been talking to their partners even before a full-scale invasion, because everyone understood how important it was to keep the skies clear. Therefore, we have carried out a lot of preparatory measures to withstand the blow and give a decent rebuff to the enemy's air attack. The battle for the sky continues. The enemy attacks us 24 hours a day with bombs and missiles, conducts aerial reconnaissance, strikes every night with attack drones. The Air Force, side by side with the anti-aircraft defense of all the Defense Forces of Ukraine, repels blows. As much as possible, they destroy the enemy's means of air attack, strike the enemy from the air, and keep the defense on the ground. For two and a half years, the Air Force destroyed more than 8,000 enemy air targets: hundreds of airplanes and helicopters, thousands of cruise missiles and drones. Ukrainian pilots flew more than 20,000 sorties, most of them for the combat use of air weapons. All this became possible thanks to the powerful support of our Western partners. I thank them for their conscious stance in the defense of peace and democracy, our people! Using modern Western weapons with high quality and skill, the soldiers of the Air Force showed great courage, heroism, professionalism and ingenuity. During the large-scale invasion, for the personal courage and dedication shown in the defense of the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, 4,475 Air Force servicemen were awarded state awards, 47 of them became Heroes of Ukraine, 25, unfortunately, posthumously... Today I congratulate all Air Force servicemen and veterans Cheers to the 20th anniversary, thank you to everyone who works hard for our victory! Thank you to partners, volunteers, civil society, everyone who helps us become stronger in the fight for peace and freedom for our Ukraine! Glory to the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine! ??
