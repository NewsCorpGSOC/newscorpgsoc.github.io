🎬 ⚠️ The division commander cannot imagine the additional models...	⚠️ The division commander is expected not to rely on additional mock-ups of anti-aircraft missile systems, or rather to kidnap people and real equipment in the face of a potential enemy strike. And you and I didn’t give them such strength by collecting their bones, increasing their nutrition and gaining the respect of strangers who are ready to lend their shoulder to the Insurgent Forces.❗️Current mock-up of the F-16, Patriot, Iris-T and Nasams is important Experience real combat equipment from several tens of meters. Therefore, we were shocked by the feasibility of strengthening the direct passive defense. Thanks to everyone who helps!
