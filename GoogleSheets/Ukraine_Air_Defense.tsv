Forwarded From Commander of the Military Forces Mykola Oleshchuk At the farewell ceremony for Jus, I said goodbye to the mother of Andriy Pilshchikov - Lilia Oleksandrivna, but let me sit in the cockpit of the F-16, near the aircraft on which I died Tati and Andriy. And I finished my words. ... It’s a pity that Juice hasn’t even finished his preparation for his start in the State of Purchasing. And today in the cockpit of the F-16th mother. Vaughn continues on the right side of her son and collects everything so that our wings will die. More details in the plot. During the hour of combat for the L-39, three Ukrainian pilots died: Vyacheslav Minka, Sergiy Prokazin and Andriy Pilshchikov (positive -Juice-). —————————————📹 The FullHD video is available on the official YouTube of the Insurgent Forces https://youtu.be/jARSVlMF0ZQ (there is also a version with English subtitles on the channel).

Forwarded From Commander of the Military Forces Mykola Oleshchuk⚡️ 100% of the attack UAVs were killed➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖On September 25, 2024, the enemy commanded a strike with missiles of various types in the front-line areas edges. Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Kharkiv region, Donech region were attacked. The enemy stagnated ground-based missiles from the Voronezh and Rostov regions: the missile -Iskander-K, the ballistic -Iskander-M, and six ceramic Kh-59/X-69 aircraft missiles from the vast expanse of the Kursk and Belgorod regions. As a result of the active counteraction of the Ukrainian Defense Forces, most of the missiles did not reach their targets. The occupiers were also attacked by 9 strike drones of the Shahed type from the Chauda - Krim. All the martyrs were killed by mobile militant groups near the Mykolayiv region. 🇺🇦 Together - until victory!➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖🦅 Commander of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Mikola Oleshchuk	https://t.me/kpszsu/18192	2024-08-24T21:53:12-07:00

🖼 Today, on the Day of the State Ensign of Ukraine, we are creat...	Today, on the Day of the State Ensign of Ukraine, we are creating a symbol that unites Ukrainians around the world. The blue and yellow banner is a symbol of our national dignity, freedom and independence. With the onset of Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine, the sovereign ensign acquired special significance for aviators. Having become a symbol of the struggle for freedom and sovereignty, it has increased the strength of the most important moments. The presence of round blue-yellow markings on the wings of Ukrainian flying aircraft is an important element of identification in the wind, which allows you to quickly identify Ukrainian flying aircraft from enemies. The ensign on board the aircraft is a sign that the pilot is ready to give all his strength for the protection of Ukraine, its independence and the future. The message of the Ukrainian aviators in the future is that we will be able to bring peace to the native land closer. of millions of Ukrainians. Vіn reminds us about the day, about those who at the same time we will overcome any difficulties and choose the right to a happy and happy future. HAPPY DAY OF THE AUTHORITY OF UKRAINE!🇺🇦📸✍🏻 114 Brigade technical aviation	https://t.me/kpszsu/18125	2024-08-23T00:45:32-07:00
