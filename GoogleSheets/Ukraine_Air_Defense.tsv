Vin is a lieutenant colonel, commander of an anti-aircraft missile division. Since the first day of Russian large-scale aggression, it has demonstrated hostile effectiveness and courage in the battles for heaven. Having started to fight on the anti-aircraft missile system -Buk M1-.Zranka 25 fierce combat deployments, having hit their first target - a Russian helicopter approaching the Gostomel airport. - After defending the airport, we stopped the destruction of the Kiev area protect the sky of the capital from enemy aircraft. Already before the hour of march, they lost their money and found a Russian plane. They celebrated in various areas around the capital: from Vasilkov to Svyatoshin. -Bil Svyatoshin was hit by two more helicopters,- says Oleksandr. – Then we took up positions 10 kilometers from the line of the battle line and our troops covered the battlefield during the first important month of the war. and the development of a self-propelled fire installation, having defeated twenty enemy targets. All aircraft, helicopters and unmanned aircraft of the occupiers. – One night they lost two Su-34s in just one year. What do you feel when you shoot down a Su-34 with a full load of bombs that are going to be dropped at our mercy? There is a feeling of joy and contentment. I’m still calm. I responded to everything calmly. -I calmly finished the combat robot,- Oleksandr guessed. – It’s not good to worry and create a nervous situation. And you still need to be careful. Underestimation of risks is the first step to defeat. The Russian Mi-28 helicopter became an extremely poor goal at the time of our visit to the Kiev region. How did we fare in anti-violent battles? Zavdyaki vitrimtsi, tricks and cold rozrahunka. We stayed behind the scenes, didn’t show ourselves, turned on at work only when we picked up information that was in the zone of our attention. After that, we had about 30 seconds to discover, search, and find them, and sooner or later lose our position. Immediately the enemy pilots fired anti-radar missiles at us. Then we also learned that the brightest face of all illnesses is the adrenaline in your blood from everything that comes around. During the first month of the great war, we all ran on adrenaline. At a temperature of minus 15 degrees, with wet feet, we sat at the cold self-propelled fire installation with breaks at the frozen dugout. We couldn’t open the rot and unmask ourselves. And no one is sick. However, without coughing, Oleksandr was transferred to the Odessa region on Sunday. Here the anti-aircraft gunners captured ten missiles and attack UAVs of the Russians. After the end of the mission, on the day of the yth division flew beyond the cordon. At the initial center in Nimechchyna, the rocket launchers neared the end of the new anti-aircraft missile system and turned to Batkivshchyna. – At which complex we have already destroyed 45 air targets. This is for singing rock. Bye bye...,- said Oleksandr. – The most effective anti-shock attack – the number of winged missiles in one hostile missile and air strike. We had two such episodes. One missile is spent on one target. This is the effectiveness of Stovidsotkov. We were supposed to destroy six hostile missiles with five of our own. The Russian missile swelled due to the impact of our missile and, with its tricks, destroyed another creepy missile. With a target on Oleksandr’s shell - 75 destruction of enemy targets. For his combat work he was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the third, second and first stages, the Order - For Courage - third stage and the medal - For the Defense of Ukraine -.	https://t.me/kpszsu/18013	2024-08-19T23:34:03-07:00
