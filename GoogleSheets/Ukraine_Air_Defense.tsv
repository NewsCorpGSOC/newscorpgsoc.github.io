It's not just "doors open, next station..." It's one and a half thousand people behind you, especially at rush hour. And their safety largely rests on your shoulders. A radar station is a CRAZY responsibility. It's not just identifying targets and their characteristics, it's millions of people behind you, especially during massive missile attacks... Vadim is a senior soldier. Serves as an operator of a modern Ukrainian-made radar station. He admits: his "battlefield" is the airspace of Ukraine. His weapon is a computer mouse in his right hand, a keyboard in his left.

Ukraine Air Defense	#?????????_????_20????? #??20 #??????? HELICOPTER "CARNAGE" ABOUT 132 COMBAT LAUNCHES AND SECRETS OF ACHIEVEMENT ????????????
