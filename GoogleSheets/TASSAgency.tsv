Bitcoin can easily overcome the $100 thousand mark in the coming days, according to experts interviewed by TASS: ▪BitRiver financial analyst Vladislav Antonov: The cryptocurrency only needs to rise in price by 13% to conquer an important psychological level. There is currently quite strong interest from institutional investors. At the same time, a correction in cryptocurrency is inevitable. The higher the price rises, the more it will correct. The probable range is a decrease from 10% to 20%.▪Director of Strategy at Finam Investment Company Yaroslav Kabakov: The increase in the price of cryptocurrency is due to several factors. Trump’s promises play an important role, including ambitious plans to transform the United States into a global cryptocurrency hub. He also promised to create reserves from Bitcoin.▪Increased investor attention to cryptocurrency is also caused by the fact that during periods of geopolitical crises, Bitcoin and stablecoins are often seen as a potential 'defensive' asset, Kabakov explained.▪Bitcoin is likely to continue its growth above $100 thousand. with possible short-term fluctuations influenced by political and regulatory news.	https://t.me/tass_agency/284970	2024-11-12T23:27:46-08:00
