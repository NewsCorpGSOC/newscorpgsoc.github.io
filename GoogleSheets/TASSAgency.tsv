Video: Kremlin. ru What experts say about the response to strikes deep into Russia and the new missile:‚ñ™Chairman of the Foundation for Development and Support of the Valdai International Discussion Club Andrei Bystritsky: 'There were conversations about whether there are 'red lines' or not. They are. Now the ball is on that side. This is a very serious challenge. Let's hope that this will make people think';‚ñ™Vice-Rector for Scientific Affairs of the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Foreign Ministry Oleg Karpovich: 'If you look at what lies at the core, the West continues to wage a hybrid war against Russia. But the fact that the US administration allowed Ukraine to launch strikes deep into Russian territory means that, of course, the Americans are playing to raise the stakes';‚ñ™Bulgarian expert Boyan Chukov: 'Vladimir Putin acted honestly, he clearly warned that any new step against Russia the answer will be given with the latest weapons, including at facilities outside the territory of Ukraine, which are unique weapons hubs. Those who can think logically understand that supporters of the escalation of the conflict have been presented with a 'red card';‚ñ™Expert of the Valdai International Discussion Club Dmitry Suslov: 'A very important message was contained in Putin's speech that Russia is ready for further escalation from the West. If anyone in the West has hopes or opinions that Russia will falter, then they think so in vain. Russia is ready for any development of events';‚ñ™Matthew Saville, an expert at the Royal United Nations Institute for Security and Defense Studies in London: 'In reality, this is a signal to the West: 'We are happy to enter the competition in the field of medium-range ballistic missiles. They may also have nuclear warheads. Do you really want to take that risk?';‚ñ™Security expert Abdullah Agar:'&lt;...&gt; In essence, the Russian Federation has made it clear that if the current policy of the West continues, there will be a response, which is now given in the usual way, but may also be in the nuclear option.'	https://t.me/tass_agency/286719	2024-11-21T23:19:21-08:00
