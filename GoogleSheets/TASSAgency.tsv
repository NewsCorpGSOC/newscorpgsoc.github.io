There are three options: ‚ñ™Ô∏èThe first option assumes the 'German model', that is, dividing the country into two blocks. The part controlled by Kyiv would be accepted into NATO. ‚ñ™Ô∏èThe second scenario is the transformation of Ukraine into a 'European Israel'. That is, countries outside NATO, but with support in the form of weapons provision from members of the Western military alliance.‚ñ™Ô∏èThe third option is that Ukraine is divided with the establishment of some kind of international mission, which may include states that are not members of NATO, such as China, India and other countries Persian Gulf.	https://t.me/tass_agency/289380	2024-12-06T01:52:01-08:00
