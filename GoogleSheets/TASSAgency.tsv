They are. Now the ball is on that side. This is a very serious challenge. Let's hope that this will make people think';▪Vice-Rector for Scientific Affairs of the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Foreign Ministry Oleg Karpovich: 'If you look at what lies at the core, the West continues to wage a hybrid war against Russia. But the fact that the US administration allowed Ukraine to launch strikes deep into Russian territory means that, of course, the Americans are playing to raise the stakes';▪Bulgarian expert Boyan Chukov: 'Vladimir Putin acted honestly, he clearly warned that any new step against Russia the answer will be given with the latest weapons, including at facilities outside the territory of Ukraine, which are unique weapons hubs. Those who can think logically understand that supporters of the escalation of the conflict have been presented with a 'red card';▪Expert of the Valdai International Discussion Club Dmitry Suslov: 'A very important message was contained in Putin's speech that Russia is ready for further escalation from the West.
