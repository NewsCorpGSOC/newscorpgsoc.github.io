Dmitry Medvedev's full answer to TASS's question about Western companies: On March 10, 2022, I wrote on social networks: 'Whatever the reasons for the exodus, foreign companies must understand that returning to our market will not be easy. An example is 2014, when the efforts of the West also created a panic out of nowhere and imposed sanctions. However, over the past time, our country, having responded to these actions with symmetrical restrictions, has managed to ensure food security and resolve a number of issues in the field of import substitution. We can cope now.' Life has proven the truth of these words. We didn‚Äôt kick anyone out - they left on their own. Some under pressure from their governments, some out of fear, some out of solidarity with neo-Nazis. Many niches today are filled by our companies, they are just great. New competencies, new industries and even entire industries have emerged that have grown as a result of sanctions. They honestly won their place in the sun, and they are ours, Russian. And foreigners? Firstly, no one has officially applied yet. So, informally they are testing the waters. Secondly, they will wait for a go-ahead from their superiors. Thirdly, most likely, those who left but left the door ajar for returning (kept an option, etc.) will want to return. We need to have a separate conversation with them on the principles that the Head of State outlined the day before yesterday when meeting with the RSPP. Fourthly, some will not return at all. To hell with them, I don't mind. And fifthly, in some cases, lifting sanctions will not benefit our producers at all.
