Terrorists control attacks, store weapons and hold Israeli hostages. This also includes hospitals throughout the Gaza Strip, which Hamas and Islamic Jihad repeatedly entered and used for military purposes, and terrorist tunnels were found in them. The book is often used by civilians as military installations, command and control centers, to store weapons and carry out terrorist activities.

Today we published the names of 19 of the terrorists who worked in this compound. We also have intelligence indications that the terrorist Ashraf J'udah, the commander of the Islamic Jihad's center division, was in the compound. This military facility was located inside the school building. After we received clear intelligence information about the threat posed by terrorists, and in accordance with international law, we took many steps to reduce the risk to civilians, including the use of aerial surveillance before the attack and the selection of highly accurate weapons to prevent harm to civilians.

This pattern of systematic exploitation of schools for military activities by Hamas and Islamic Jihad is poor. Both Gazan citizens and Israeli citizens, and it has been condemned by the international community. Following the attack, the government ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, published the number of casualties that has not been verified - which has been shared since then around the world. These data do not distinguish between terrorists and civilians, and do not match the information. שביד צע-ל.יחיא Sanwar, the architect of the massacre on October 7th, the day on which Hamas brutally massacred Israelis who were guilty and led to this war.
