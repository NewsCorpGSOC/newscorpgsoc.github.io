Sambhal: Fear grips Indian city after deadly weekend clashes targeting minorities	Local authorities have imposed a ban on entry of outsiders, social activists and politicians to the city until 1 December. Internet services have been suspended and schools have been shut. In the Tabela Kot area, Idro Ghazi continues to grieve inconsolably. Her 34-year-old son, Naeem Ghazi, was among the dead. Her son, she said, was not a part of the protest and had gone to the market to purchase oil. He was surrounded and shot near the mosque, she alleged. Despite her grief, the devastated mother has decided not to lodge a case against the police. -We do not have the courage to fight the police and the government,- she said, her voice heavy with sorrow.	https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalNews/comments/1h6577f/sambhal_fear_grips_indian_city_after_deadly/	2024-12-03T18:17:41-08:00	https://external-preview.redd.it/-jO3yGzWpNLMalfnkgCxDkfFdUPZUBR7qSFBpELPFfE.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0ff8e6bc2a9cb3e4c13fcc50d5ec03302c416fa1
