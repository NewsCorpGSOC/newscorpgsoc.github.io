-He must be released immediately and unconditionally- Amnesty International demands immediate release of Dr Hussam Abu Safiya upon his abduction	-We are extremely concerned over the fate & wellbeing of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan hospital who was detained by Israeli forces along with others during a raid on the hospital on 27 December. He must be released immediately and unconditionally. For months Dr. Abu Safiya has been the voice of Gaza’s decimated health sector, appealing for the protection of his hospital and working under inhumane conditions, including following the killing of his son. The raid, the latest in a series of attacks on healthcare facilities in North Gaza over the past two months, put Kamal Adwan, the last remaining major hospital in the area, out of service.
