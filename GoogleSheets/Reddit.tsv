U.S. to revoke legal status of more than a half-million migrants, urges them to self deport	-A total of 532,000 migrants entered the U.S. under that policy, which was paused soon after President Trump took office, though it's unclear how many have been able to secure another status that will allow them to stay in the country legally. CBS News first reported in early February that the Trump administration was planning to revoke the legal status of individuals who entered the U.S. under the CHNV process. The Department of Homeland Security said it will seek the arrest and deportation of those subject to the policy change if they fail to depart the U.S. in the next 30 days. Officials are urging migrants to use the newly repurposed CBP Home smartphone app to register for self-deportation.	https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalNews/comments/1jgttn0/us_to_revoke_legal_status_of_more_than_a/	2025-03-21T15:47:17-07:00	https://external-preview.redd.it/9PS1mTbQktJVE3cpOuvcyYULFVWNXCigizYu_WcUoPg.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=65e030157925546245b6a7dfea82dd96396c8d67
