On the student who shed her clothes: If she's crazy, so are we all	A bold act of defiance by a university student in Iran, allegedly named Ahou Daryaei, has captured the nation's attention and reignited debates over the mandatory hijab and women's rights in the Islamic Republic. Daryaei, a senior French Literature student, reportedly stripped down to her underwear on campus in protest against enforcement of hijab rules, leading to her arrest by security forces.
