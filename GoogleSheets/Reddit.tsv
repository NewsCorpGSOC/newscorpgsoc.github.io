Boycott Captain America and Snow White	Human rights groups, including ‘Jewish Voice for Peace,’ are urging a global boycott of Marvel’s Captain America: Brave New World and Disney’s Snow White remake for their role in whitewashing Israel’s occupation of Palestine and apartheid regime. Captain America introduces Ruth Bat-Seraph, aka Sabra, a character steeped in anti-Palestinian propaganda and the demonization of Palestinian children as -terrorists.- Portrayed by Shira Haas, an actress with direct ties to the Israeli government and military, this portrayal deepens the normalization of Israel’s ongoing genocide in Palestine. Meanwhile, Disney’s Snow White casts Gal Gadot, a vocal supporter of Israel’s apartheid and former IOF soldier, as the Evil Queen, further legitimizing Israel’s war crimes.	https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalNews/comments/1gw1a4q/boycott_captain_america_and_snow_white/	2024-11-20T15:01:02-08:00	https://preview.redd.it/osssbqre052e1.jpeg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=2d1d6e50704a8f50617590b284fdc740f027630f
