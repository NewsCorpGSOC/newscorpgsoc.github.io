The remarks were made during a tumultuous evening at Israel’s parliament, where the families of hostages booed Netanyahu, and came as negotiations between Israel and Hamas over the future of a fragile ceasefire in Gaza appeared to stall. -I tell Hamas: If you do not release our hostages, there will be consequences that you cannot imagine,- Netanyahu told lawmakers. Defence Minister Katz later struck a similar tone, saying if the group did not free the hostages, -the gates of Gaza will be locked, and the gates of hell will open-. -We will return to fighting, and they will face the (army) with forces and methods they have never encountered—until a decisive victory,- he said in a statement.	https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalNews/comments/1j33x6p/israel_warns_hamas_to_return_remaining_gaza/	2025-03-03T21:41:58-08:00	https://external-preview.redd.it/firZM5beX5u5PMdMCAi1HEPOw-MAPj0hrnCTJZttg9s.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=073c5c7e8a140f887161517385e77ebfa612ef66
