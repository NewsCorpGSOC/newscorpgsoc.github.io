Trump Doubles Tariffs on Canadian Steel and Aluminum to 50% Amid Escalating Trade Tensions	In a significant escalation of trade tensions, President Trump announced on March 11, 2025, that the United States will double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, effective March 12. This decision comes in direct response to Ontario’s recent imposition of a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to U.S. states such as New York, Michigan, and Minnesota. This move is anticipated to have several repercussions for American consumers. The increased tariffs are likely to raise costs for U.S. manufacturers reliant on Canadian steel and aluminum, leading to higher prices for consumer goods, including automobiles and appliances. The construction industry, a significant consumer of these metals, may face increased material costs, potentially resulting in higher home prices ...	https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalNews/comments/1j8smq3/trump_doubles_tariffs_on_canadian_steel_and/	2025-03-11T07:54:53-07:00	https://external-preview.redd.it/W3Qjjjlf5BnWQRDz7g5KYGnIa_vLY4BQGFV18c98ehw.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c1182dd73bdec76a4615fa28ad8f43f3a4ba95ae
