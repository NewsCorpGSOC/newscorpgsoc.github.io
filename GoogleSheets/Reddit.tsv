Israeli soldiers are exposing their genitals at checkpoints.	During hearings by the UN Commission of Inquiry on Palestine on 11 March 2025, Kifeya Khraim, International Advocacy Officer at the Women's Centre for Legal Aid and Counseling, and Witness 3, a Women Human Rights Defender, testified about sexual violence by Israeli forces and settlers. Women in Hebron reported that at certain checkpoints, soldiers deliberately expose themselves. One university student recounted how a soldier positioned himself in a blind spot, exposed himself, and ordered her in Arabic to come closer and touch him. Another case in Jerusalem involved a 14-year-old schoolgirl who was molested by soldiers under the pretense of a security search.
