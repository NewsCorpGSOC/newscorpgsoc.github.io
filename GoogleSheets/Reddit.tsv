12/26 | Egypt deny Israel claim of Hamas reneging on the deal	Egyptian sources emphasized that the Hamas movement responded well and dynamically and efficiently during the negotiations and even withdrew some of its conditions to facilitate the process of obtaining a ceasefire agreement. The Egyptian sources further added that the failure of the negotiations and their failure to reach a conclusion stems from the return of the Zionist occupiers to issues that were previously agreed upon, including the distance that separates the occupying regime's military from residential areas and rejection of the names of Palestinian prisoners who were previously on the list of people who were supposed to be released under this agreement.

At exactly 1 p.m. on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel’s military leadership issued an order that unleashed one of the most intense bombing campaigns in contemporary warfare.

In each strike, the order said, officers had the authority to risk killing up to 20 civilians. The order, which has not previously been reported, had no precedent in Israeli military history.
