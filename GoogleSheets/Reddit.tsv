Algerian Foreign minister , Ahmed Attaf expels former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni from a UNAOC Forum in Portugal	Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf and his accompanying delegation informed the organizing authorities that Tzipi Livni must leave the meeting hall and not participate in the forum's activities taking place in the Portuguese city of Cascais. The organizers of the forum, as a result of the efforts of the Algerian delegation, apologized and withdrew the invitation extended to the Israeli Foreign Minister and asked her to leave the hall. Back in January 2017, Livni cancelled a trip to Brussels after Belgian prosecutors confirmed they wanted to question her over her role in war crimes and crimes against humanity during Israel’s offensive in Gaza in 2008-2009.
