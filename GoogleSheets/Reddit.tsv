See What the Occupation Did to My Home in Northern Gaza and How We Were Forcibly Displaced	This is our home in northern Gaza, where we lived in a house we built with effort and hard work. Then came the day that turned our lives upside down. On that day, we were shocked to see the occupation forces enter our area, raiding homes without mercy. There was no time to prepare or even say goodbye to the place where we grew up. They suddenly raided our home and destroyed everything in their path. We were forcibly displaced from our home, a place filled with countless memories. We began living in constant fear and displacement. That moment was extremely painful, as we lost not only our shelter but also a huge part of our lives. Our home, once filled with love and hard work, became nothing but ruins.

Congress hiding Gaza death toll	A little-noticed provision in the annual defense bill would bar the Pentagon from citing the Gaza Health Ministry as an authoritative source. The death toll provision of the must-pass bill, which passed 281-140 with 81 Democratic votes, has received significantly less attention. It would bar the Pentagon from publicly citing as -authoritative- casualty data from the Gaza Health Ministry, effectively concealing the full extent of the death toll in Gaza in the military’s public communications. The data from Palestinian authorities has been the only consistent and reliable count of the death toll out of Gaza over the last 14 months, with Israel consistently denying human rights workers access to the enclave and preventing foreign media journalists from entering.	https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalNews/comments/1hf85m7/congress_hiding_gaza_death_toll/	2024-12-15T17:44:25-08:00	https://external-preview.redd.it/vfNNG516BxIGiap9q4Gkvuzzk_cXQPzlw80USbXQGfE.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=26f2692c0fb0df585a26bc2effc58b7939d0ea17
