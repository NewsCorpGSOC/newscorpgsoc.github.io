Herzi Halevi says Israel is on high alert and will be able to carry out a quick response to any attack.We will know how to launch a very quick attack anywhere in Lebanon, anywhere in Gaza, anywhere in the Middle East, above ground and below ground, Halevi says.We will send a very clear message to our enemies, those who attack us, those who in every speech talk about how they seek to destroy the State of Israel, we will strike them, and we will continue to grow stronger, he says.On Hamass Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, who was promoted to head the terror groups politburo after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Halevi says his title change wont stop Israel from hunting him down.Yahya Sinwar yesterday received a new title, he is the head of the political bureau of Hamas. This title, a political one, will not absolve him from the fact that he is a murderer who was involved in the entire planning and execution of what happened on October 7, and therefore the change in his name, not only does it not prevent us from looking for him, it spurs us on and we will make an effort to find him, attack him, and [cause Hamas to] replace the head of the political bureau once more, he says.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46584	2024-08-07T08:37:03-07:00
