This title, a political one, will not absolve him from the fact that he is a murderer who was involved in the entire planning and execution of what happened on October 7, and therefore the change in his name, not only does it not prevent us from looking for him, it spurs us on and we will make an effort to find him, attack him, and [cause Hamas to] replace the head of the political bureau once more, he says.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46584	2024-08-07T08:37:03-07:00
