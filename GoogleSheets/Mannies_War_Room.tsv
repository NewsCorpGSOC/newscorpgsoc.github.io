Mannies War Room: The IDF in an update on the deadly Gaza City school strike says that according to its intelligence, at least 20 terror operatives and senior commanders were at the site when it was struck. According to the military, the active Hamas and Palestinian Islamic? The Hamas terror group in a statement claims that there were no militants in the Tabaeen school in Gaza Citys Daraj neighborhood when it was struck this morning by the IDF.More than 100 people were killed in the strike, according to Hamas authorities. The IDF expressed heavy skepticism toward the claim, saying the numbers appeared to have been inflated.Hamas falsely claims that its fighters and members of other armed groups follow a strict policy of not being present among civilians. In recent months, dozens of airstrikes have been carried out against Hamas sites embedded within schools and other sites used as shelters for civilians, according to the IDF.Just last week, the commander of Hamass Sheikh Radwan Battalion was killed in an IDF strike on a school in Gaza City.According to military assessments, Hamas operatives are struggling to remain inside tunnels for such a long period and are therefore increasingly moving to above-ground sites, while hiding among civilians.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46636	2024-08-10T04:17:18-07:00
