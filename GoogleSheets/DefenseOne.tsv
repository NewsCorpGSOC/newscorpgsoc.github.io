The D Brief: Israel strikes in Iran; Russia advances in Ukraine; ...	Nearly 100 Israeli jets carried out a series of daring airstrikes inside Iran early Saturday, ending nearly four weeks of suspense following Iran's October 1 missile attack on Israel, which featured at least 180 ballistic missiles. The Israeli strikes were conducted in three waves, and 'targeted around 20 locations around Tehran and western Iran, including vital air defense assets and facilities tied to the Iranian drone and missile programs,&rdquo; according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. The strikes killed four Iranian soldiers, 'presumably at the air defense sites that the [Israeli jets] struck,&rdquo; ISW reports. One target included a solid-propellant rocket motor plant in Parchin, southeast of Tehran. The facilities were inaugurated just three years ago, according to researcher Fabian Hinz of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, based in London. 'Targeted buildings appear to be related to propellant mixing and casting,&rdquo; which suggests 'Israel targeted a critical bottleneck in the missile production process (similar to its previous campaigns against missile production infrastructure in Syrian and Lebanon),&rdquo; Hinz wrote Saturday on social media. The Iranians had also used the Parchin facilities 'for high explosives testing in support of its nuclear weapons program,&rdquo; according to ISW. One suspected consequence: 'The mixers are highly sophisticated equipment that Iran cannot produce on its own and must purchase from China,&rdquo; which could take several months, Israeli officials told Axios. Other targets included a radar installation and an alleged drone factory. In photos: The Associated Press published post-strike satellite imagery from Planet Labs on Sunday. Review those images, here. Tactical note: 'The IDF struck several locations in Iraq and Syria...likely targeting early warning radars and sensors that would have given Iran advanced notice,&rdquo; ISW writes. 'Iran has in recent years worked to build an early detection network across Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon in order to better defend against Israeli airstrikes,&rdquo; the think note explained. The Israelis also destroyed four Russian-made S-300 air defense batteries inside Iran, which are 'the most advanced air defense system that Iran operates,&rdquo; ISW reported. Why that matters: 'Russia's traditional customers have lost faith in the country's defense industry and are looking for new suppliers,&rdquo; Singapore-based researcher Ian Storey told the Wall Street Journal. Relatedly, 'Moscow's foreign weapons sales fell 52% last year from 2022,&rdquo; according to researchers in Stockholm, who predicted (PDF) this past March that 'Russian arms exports are likely to remain well below the level reached in 2014-18, for at least the short term.&rdquo; According to the White House, 'The President and his national security team, of course, worked with the Israelis over recent weeks to encourage Israel to conduct a response that was targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm, and that appears to have been precisely what transpired this evening,&rdquo; U.S. officials said after the Israeli strikes. 'Should Iran choose to respond, we are fully prepared to once again defend against any attack,&rdquo; the official said. Big-picture consideration: 'Israel remains in control of the escalation and could decide to press home its advantage,&rdquo; writes Emile Hokayem of IISS. 'Israeli officials believe that the country's operational competence and success on the battlefield will overcome whatever political and moral qualms the Americans, Europeans and Arabs have about its conduct of these wars,&rdquo; he added. Meanwhile, Israeli 'defence planners are probably putting more ideas on the table,&rdquo; said Hokayem. 'But, like the Iranians, Netanyahu should beware the seductions of hubris,&rdquo; he warned.

'Russian advances have accelerated over the past week on the Selydove, Kurakhivka, and Vuhledar fronts,&rdquo; he said. However, none of the advances seem to be terribly decisive, according to ISW's Sunday analysis. Update: Ukrainian officials claim 'North Korean shells are poor quality and do not hit their targets or explode at the right time&rdquo; around the Kharkiv front, where an estimated 60 percent of the 122mm and 152mm artillery ammunition Russia uses is from North Korea. Developing: Russia's economy is on the verge of 'overheating&rdquo; due in large part to its excessive defense spending, the Washington Post reported Sunday. Still, 'Russia can afford to fund its war in Ukraine for several more years&hellip;because of massive oil revenue and Western sanctions failures.&rdquo; Russia's Central Bank also recently raised its key rate to 21%, which is 'the highest rate of the Putin era,&rdquo; economist Janis Kluge noted Friday. He added, 'One reason why the Russian Central Bank struggles to control inflation is that interest rates hardly influence the ruble exchange rate. Before 2022, higher rates would lead to a stronger ruble, leading to lower prices in Russia. This doesn't work anymore due to war & sanctions.&rdquo; However, none of this means Vladimir Putin is at all interested in slowing his Ukraine invasion, Kluge noted Friday as well.

American aid was key to the recent free and fair elections in Moldova, whose citizens overcame Russian influence to assert their desire to join the European Union. Donald Trump tried to cut that aid as president and has promised to do so again. More, here.

China’s chip chokepoints	Earlier this year, American investigators were tipped off about a plan to ship semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China. The alarm was sounded after two Chicago-based buyers of a Dynatex DTX-MDB 150 'scribe and break' machine asked the California manufacturer to file export paperwork that omitted the machine's final destination: Chengdu GaStone Technology Company, a firm in southwest China under U.S. sanction for an illegal 2021 scheme to purchase military-grade integrated circuits. In April, Lin Chen was arrested and charged while Han Li escaped to China. The case illuminates the complex U.S.-China competition to produce ever-more-advanced chips. CGTC sought the Dynatex machine to handle a final step in making military-grade gallium arsenide chips, which can better withstand extreme temperatures and radiation than ordinary silicon devices. Had they succeeded, the Chengdu firm could have improved their chip-manufacturing 'success rate' and therefore their ability to meet customer demand&mdash;including from China's military. While companies such as SMIC have turned China into a chip-manufacturing powerhouse, the country remains unable to mass-produce the most advanced chips on its own. Despite massive government investment, China continues to rely on foreign companies for the chips that power everything from the AI revolution to the internet of things to the most advanced military equipment. This problem remains a huge vulnerability for China's economy, its military, and its global ambitions. Commentators inside China identify advanced chips as one of the 'chokepoint&rdquo; technologies that keep the country from technological parity with the world's most advanced economies. In 2018, the government's S&T Daily publication named 35 such technologies, most in the fields of information technology, electronics, manufacturing, biotech, and new-energy vehicles. Eight of these chokepoints related to the design and manufacture of advanced chips, casting doubt on the country's ability to produce such chips anytime soon. Western leverage While China's struggle is hardly secret, few stop to think about what exactly it means, why it is so difficult to overcome&mdash;and what leverage it might give U.S. and allied governments. To paraphrase Boromir, one does not simply insert silicon into one end of a machine and wait for an advanced chip to emerge from the other. Producing these chips is a complex, multi-stage process. And each stage, in turn, provides numerous avenues for U.S. and allied governments to apply pressure on China's efforts at its own advanced chip production. Before the chips can even be manufactured, they must be designed. This necessitates the use of electronic design automation software, which brings order to the billions of transistors that go into a modern chip, a task impossible for human engineers to accomplish on their own. Here lies China's first chokepoint. Chinese-made EDA software from companies such as Beijing Empyrean and Primarius Technologies can handle analog designs and simpler IoT applications but appear unable to compete at the high end. Thus, the Chinese market for this specialized software is dominated by the three largest U.S. developers: Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens EDA, who collectively hold 90 percent of the PRC market. In 2022, the U.S. Commerce Department placed export controls on the most advanced versions of this software, which is needed to design top-of-the-line 3nm chips. Next, raw materials must be turned into the silicon wafers that will eventually become chips. Silicon is extracted from sand, refined to 99.9999999% purity, melted, and fashioned into a single-crystal ingot. This ingot, called a 'boule,&rdquo; is sliced into thin wafers and polished to create an ultra-flat, mirror-like surface. To achieve the extraordinary nanometer-level smoothness that is required, ultra-precise polishing equipment is needed. Herein lies a second chokepoint: China appears to lack companies that can produce this equipment, although their research is showing some promising results. The leading manufacturers are in the U.S. and Germany. In 2020, the U.S. government slapped export controls on the most advanced versions of this equipment. Once the wafers are ready, one side is coated with a light-sensitive chemical called photoresist to prepare it for photolithography. Production of this chemical is a third chokepoint. 'Extreme ultraviolet&rdquo; photoresist is needed for the densest chips below 20nm, and this market is dominated by Japanese companies bound by strict export-control policies. Even South Korean and Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers depend on Japan's advanced resists. Chinese companies make less-advanced photoresists, which are in high demand worldwide for manufacturing inexpensive commodity chips such as those found in automobiles and consumer products. But their products are insufficient for leading-edge devices. Chinese firms such as Jingrui, Red Avenue, and its subsidiary Beijing Kempur, a U.S.-China joint venture, are pouring research into making advanced photoresists. This will not be easy, because older photoresist chemicals based on bis-azide photoresists cannot create circuits below two micrometers (2,000 nanometers). Further, the most advanced core technologies, including fine-particle filtering for new chemicals such as fullerenes (a zero-dimension carbon nanomaterial for high-resolution photoresists) may not be exported from the U.S. and its allies to China without a license. Next, the light-sensitive wafers are sent through a photolithography machine, which projects light through a series of reticles to produce microscopic circuit patterns. Herein lies yet another chokepoint. The most advanced machines, manufactured by Dutch company ASML, have more than 100,000 parts and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. They have carried a 'presumption of denial&rdquo; in the export application process led by Washington since 2022. While China manufactures huge amounts of less advanced chips, it remains incapable of reproducing the complex photolithography machinery needed for the most advanced devices. Based on past performance, the prospects for quickly catching up with the world's photolithography industry leaders are not good: China has striven to do so since the 1980s and has historically been a decade or two behind. China's leading producer, SMIC, can reportedly make 28nm chips, far from the global leading edge of 2 to 3nm. And while China is reportedly now producing a 7nm chip for the latest Huawei smartphone, this is believed to use a less advanced and less efficient form of lithography from a machine acquired from ASML before U.S. controls went into effect. SMIC's success rate for chips on each wafer may be low and commercially unacceptable, keeping costs high and production limited. And Washington is trying to further restrict sales and service of the lithography machines SMIC used to make them. There are almost certainly other chokepoints buried in the intricate process that produces modern semiconductors, perhaps in the stages of etching, ion implantation, metal deposition, dicing, and final assembly and testing. For instance, Chen and Li's efforts in Chicago indicate that China depends on foreign 'scribe and break&rdquo; machines to dice military-grade gallium arsenide chips, making this yet another potential chokepoint not named in S&T Daily's 2018 list. The multiple chokepoints China must contend with provide a dual picture. They show the difficulties it faces in its quest for world-class chips. Meanwhile, they show how Washington's efforts to keep cutting-edge semiconductor technology out of China have achieved some successes, but still face significant hurdles. Export controls have only been partly updated since the Cold War and rely on a network of nations and companies. The United States needs a new multilateral export regime powered by consensus among key partners that make semiconductor manufacturing tools, many of whom would prefer to continue selling to China at some level. China will continue to improve its chip-making through overt and covert means, for the one certainty about the future of the economy and warfare is that they will be powered by semiconductors. The question is where those technologies will come from, and how much volume in chips and equipment clandestine actors can manage to smuggle to China.

US efforts to protect democracy in Europe could fade under Trump	The Oct. 20 election in Moldova went off successfully&mdash;despite record Russian attempts to disrupt it&mdash;because of U.S. efforts to help, U.S. and Moldovan officials said this week. Such efforts could be imperiled should Donald Trump return to office. Last Sunday, more than one and a half million Moldovans took to the polls and narrowly passed a referendum to join the European Union, an outcome Russian President Vladimir Putin worked hard to prevent. 'Every single tool from the Soviet hybrid-war toolbox was used&rdquo; to undermine the outcome Viorel Ursu, Moldova's ambassador to the United States, said this week during a CSIS event. 'There are armies of online trolls and call centers that were established to spread deepfake videos and false information about the EU, about selling land to Europeans or hosting immigrants from Europe.&rdquo; Russia also 'created an elaborate Ponzi scheme&rdquo; to buy votes, a scam that poor Moldovans were particularly vulnerable to, Ursu said. He said other Russian efforts included 'training of young adults on conducting cyber actions and provoking violence during protests&hellip;engaging criminal groups, including foreigners, to disrupt the work of public offices in order to provoke a sense of fear and mistrust, constant bomb alerts that took resources from investigating the deeds of these criminal groups, paying religious community leaders to engage in political campaigning.' Such efforts laid bare Russia's determination to 'undermine its democracy in a truly unprecedented fashion,&rdquo; said Christopher Smith, the State Department's deputy assistant secretary for Eastern Europe and policy and regional affairs. So why did the effort not succeed? One huge factor, said Ursu, was U.S. help&mdash;millions of dollars in aid, cybersecurity training, and more&mdash;all to build up the country's resilience to attacks. 'The European Union and the U.S. partners here, the State Department, and particularly USAID, have been on on our side, on reinforcing that infrastructure&hellip;of the electoral process,&rdquo; he said. The scale of the Kremlin's effort was unprecedented: 6.5 million attacks between December and May alone, a top USAID official said. All aimed to disrupt the electoral process directly or indirectly, targeting government actors, journalists, and elements of infrastructure, said Mark Simakovsky, deputy assistant administrator of USAID's Bureau for Europe and Eurasia. 'It continues to grow, and it grew as we approached the election and even on election day,&rdquo; Simakovsky said. 'Moldova's digital infrastructure, including the site of the presidency, came under attack.&rdquo; To counter those attacks, he said, USAID worked for months to 'really ramp up our assistance&rdquo; in various ways, such as sharing intelligence about Russian cyber actors, training a cyber workforce, and providing cybersecurity tools. Smith said the United States also helps protect Moldovan elections by sanctioning pro-Russian operators such as the fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, 'All of these cyber attacks, all of these trolls, all of these bots require money. Russia can field these instruments because they use Ilan Shor's network of influence in order to support these campaigns. And throughout this year, we have leveled sanctions against multiple elements of Ilan Shor's network,&rdquo; he said. Moldova is hardly the only Russian neighbor under stress. In Georgia, which will hold parliamentary elections on Saturday, the rise of the pro-Kremlin Georgia Dream party Is beginning to bend the country to Putin's will. Western observers say a 'foreign agent&rdquo; law passed in May is modeled closely after a Russian law used to crush dissent. The law, which targets aid and non-governmental organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from foreign sources, is used to target pro-Western dissident groups and complicate Georgia's ascension into the European Union more difficult, they said. What does that have to do with Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate? As president, he repeatedly pushed to slash foreign aid, particularly through agencies like USAID. To the extent that the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 accurately reflects his agenda, foreign aid would face sweeping changes and a change in focus away from Europe toward the Pacific. Perhaps most importantly, Trump has both denied and welcomed Russian interference in U.S. elections and even briefly proposed to establish a joint Russian-U.S. cybersecurity project. And given Trump's vocal support for pro-Kremlin strongmen in Europe such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, it's unlikely he would find much urgency to help fledgling democracies protect themselves from Russian meddling.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/us-efforts-protect-democracy-europe-could-fade-under-trump/400585/	2024-10-25T16:06:07-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/25/GettyImages_1152460422/large.jpg
The D Brief: Musk, Putin talk; Trump’s record; Houthis’ satellite...	The rich man and the despot: Elon Musk has been in secretive contact with Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the past two years, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday (gift link). The private talks between the world's richest man and the world's most nuclear-armed autocrat reportedly 'raise potential national-security concerns&rdquo; among U.S. officials since conversation topics have included denying Taiwan access to Musk's Starlink service ('as a favor to Chinese leader Xi Jinping&rdquo;) and Musk has blocked Ukraine from using certain Starlink terminals in its defense against Russia's full-scale invasion. Recall that 'Musk has forged deep business ties with U.S. military and intelligence agencies, giving him unique visibility into some of America's most sensitive space programs,&rdquo; the Journal notes. For example, 'SpaceX, which operates the Starlink service, won a $1.8 billion classified contract in 2021 and is the primary rocket launcher for the Pentagon and NASA.&rdquo; Musk's duplicity doesn't end there: 'Through the first months of the year, Musk said he would refrain from backing any presidential candidate while at the same time holding private conversations discussing how he could get Trump elected,&rdquo; the Journal reminds readers. But that changed in July when Musk endorsed Trump and began campaigning on his behalf&mdash;an effort that has since morphed into a possibly illegal scheme of handing out millions of dollars to incentivize citizens in battleground states to vote so long as they sign a Trump-aligned pledge. Trump is also alleged to have been in contact with the Russian despot. Citing a Trump aide, journalist Bob Woodward reported in a new book that there have been 'maybe as many as seven&rdquo; conversations between Trump and Putin since the former left office in 2021. For details on Musk's contract with, and influence over, the federal government, see this New York Times report from earlier in the week. Musk has been doing Trump's work in the online information space this year, too. That includes spreading misleading claims about immigration and conspiracies about alleged voter fraud, which are his most popular topics to tweet about, according to an analysis of Musk's writing on X published Thursday by Bloomberg. The analysis covers more than 13 years of Musk's posts, which changed noticeably as the election season got underway in 2024. And as November 5 has gotten closer, 'Musk's effort to popularize his views on voting and migrants has become relentless &mdash; and more effective in terms of engagement,&rdquo; Bloomberg reports. Why it matters: 'In Musk, the former president has found an influential ally who is willing to launder a false conspiracy theory for the masses, helping lay the groundwork for Trump to once again dispute the results of next month's election, should they not be in his favor, according to Melissa Ryan, founder of CARD Strategies, a consulting firm that researches disinformation.&rdquo; But perhaps most importantly, 'as the most-followed account on X, Musk is the platform's single most important influencer,&rdquo; and 'He is still the most widely read person on the site today,&rdquo; Bloomberg reports. Read over the full analysis (gift link), here. Reminder: If re-elected, 'Donald Trump says he will order mass deportations, use soldiers against citizens, prosecute his enemies, abandon allies, and play politics with disasters,&rdquo; the New York Times Editorial Board writes in a multimedia presentation published Friday. 'Believe him,&rdquo; the editorial board cautions. 'The record shows that Mr. Trump often pursues his stated goals, regardless of how plainly they lack legal or moral grounding,&rdquo; they write. In contrast to his first term, 'Trump has learned from that experience to surround himself with supplicants who would instead obey his wishes and bring his words and ideas to life even if they contradict facts, the public interest or the Constitution.&rdquo; Using his own words, the board encourages readers to 'take the painful step of imagining America were his plans and promises to come to pass, to imagine the impacts to our culture, to our economy, to our security, to our shared commitment to the rule of law.&rdquo; Dive in (gift link), here.

North Korean soldiers are expected to begin arriving in Ukraine 'combat zones&rdquo; as early as Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy said Friday, citing intelligence officials. 'North Korea's actual involvement in combat should not be met with indifference or uncertain commentary, but with tangible pressure on both Moscow and Pyongyang, to uphold the UN Charter and to hold them accountable for this escalation,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said. The first tranche of North Korean troops arrived in Russia's western Kursk region Wednesday, Ukrainian intelligence officials claimed the following day. 'North Korea has transferred roughly 12,000 North Korean personnel, including 500 officers and three generals, to Russia and that Russian Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Yunus-Bek Yevkurov is responsible for overseeing the training and adaptation of the North Korean military personnel,&rdquo; the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War wrote in its Thursday assessment, citing Ukraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate. South Korea's military chief described the North Korean troops as 'mere cannon fodder mercenaries.&rdquo; North Korea's soldiers are 'being disguised with a Russian uniform and acting under Russian military command without any operational authority,&rdquo; Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun told parliamentarians Thursday in Seoul.

New: Russia helped the Houthi terrorist group attack commercial vessels in the Red Sea and along Yemen's coasts, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing 'a person familiar with the matter and two European defense officials.&rdquo; The help consisted of Russian satellite data that was 'passed through members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who were embedded with the Houthis in Yemen.&rdquo; Why it matters: The targeting data 'shows how far Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to go to undermine the U.S.-led Western economic and political order,&rdquo; the Journal writes.

That's no surprise, but perhaps this is: 'Although the Navy's 2025 plan calls for buying more ships and costs more than the alternatives in the 2024 plan, the capability that it would provide is in the middle of the range of the capabilities that would result from those alternatives.&rdquo; Read the slides for yourself, here. Northrop expects next B-21 production award by year's end. That would be Low-Rate Initial Production Contract 2, the second of five annual LRIPs that are expected to total 21 aircraft&mdash;and to cost the company a total of $1.2 billion. The Air Force expects to pay roughly $780 million per LRIP aircraft&mdash;officially, $550 million per plane in 2010 dollars&mdash;based on its overall plan to buy at least 100 Raiders. Northrop executives say the program will eventually be profitable. The company has negotiated a higher cost ceiling for the 19 aircraft that will follow the first 21. Defense One's Audrey Decker reports off CEO Kathy Warden's Thursday third-quarter earnings call with investors. Lastly today: Problems with a German railroad contract slowed U.S. munitions to Ukraine, IG says. Shipments were delayed in December 2022 and January 2023 because of problems with a U.S. European Command contract with Germany's Deutsche Bahn railways, according to a Defense Department Inspector General report. In at least one instance, 'no rail service was available to transport the ammunition.&rdquo; The problem was eventually solved by chartering boats to deliver it instead, at a cost of $1.6 million to the United States. The report was released, in much-redacted form, to Defense One on Thursday in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The delays hit around the same time Ukraine began to run out of U.S.-supplied ammunition&mdash;making it one of several instances in which U.S. aid shortfalls have affected the Ukrainian military since Russia's full-scale invasion.

U.S. shipments of ammunition to Ukraine were delayed for at least two months last year because of problems with a U.S. military contract with Germany's Deutsche Bahn railways, according to a Defense Department Inspector General report. The 'multiple delays&rdquo; happened between December 2022 and January 2023, according to the report, around the same time Ukraine began to run out of U.S.-supplied ammunition&mdash;making it one of several instances in which U.S. aid shortfalls have affected the Ukrainian military since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The report was released to Defense One on Thursday in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. In at least one instance, 'no rail service was available to transport the ammunition.&rdquo; The problem was eventually solved by chartering boats to deliver it instead, at a cost of $1.6 million to the United States. The IG report said the delays were caused by the U.S. European Command agreement with Deutsche Bahn failing to account for some criteria or factor, but the specifics of the deficiency are redacted. [[Related Posts]] Another section of the report says the agreement 'does not contain any requirement for Deutsche Bahn,&rdquo; to take some action, but the nature of the action is redacted. The wording suggests that Deutsche Bahn denied the military's request for some kind of service. Germany's federal government owns Deutsche Bahn, which is Germany' largest rail provider. Without a revised agreement, future delays that would be 'disruptive to the flow of critical ammunition to Ukraine,&rdquo; could still occur, the report said. When the report was published in July 2023, the military had not yet fixed its agreement with Deutsche Bahn. The report also recommended that European Command investigate other means of shipping ammunition to Ukraine. European Command's deputy director for logistics agreed with the recommendation to review the military's agreement with Deutsche Bahn and enact any necessary changes. And the command agreed with the report's call to find other shipping options, saying it would look at other seaports and logistics. Germany's rail network's ability to move military goods is hampered by extensive bureaucracy, too little investment in infrastructure, and not enough flat-bed wagons for military goods, according to a June report by the German Council on Foreign Relations. Military shipments also must compete with commercial goods, the report noted. While the Germany military signed a 2023 agreement to reserve 343 flat wagons, Deutsche Bahn Cargo would struggle to do more because of commercial transport reservations, it said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/problems-german-railroad-contract-slowed-us-munitions-ukraine-ig-says/400551/	2024-10-24T16:36:13-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/24/Screenshot_2024_10_24_at_1.35.17PM/large.png
Northrop expecting next B-21 production award by end of the year	Northrop Grumman anticipates getting a second contract to continue producing the Pentagon's new B-21 Raider by the end of the year, executives announced today. 'With B-21, we are on track for meeting the milestones associated with an award&rdquo; for Low-Rate Initial Production Contract 2, or LRIP 2 'and so we are expecting that to happen in the fourth quarter,&rdquo; CEO Kathy Warden told investors during the company's third-quarter earnings call Thursday. Warden didn't say how many planes the contract would cover. But it would be the second of five annual LRIPs that are expected to total 21 aircraft&mdash;and to cost the company a total of $1.2 billion, she has said, blaming the losses on inflation, supply-chain problems, and the company's commitment to a fixed-price contract before they had a mature design. The Air Force expects to pay roughly $780 million per LRIP aircraft&mdash;officially, $550 million per plane in 2010 dollars&mdash;based on its overall plan to buy at least 100 Raiders. Northrop executives say the program will eventually be profitable. The company has negotiated a higher cost ceiling for the 19 aircraft that will follow the first 21. [[Related Posts]] The service doesn't plan to buy more than 100 Raiders&mdash;although some think tankers argue that it should&mdash;since the future may bring new and improved technology, officials say. The service is taking another look at all of its next-gen plans, as previous concepts of air superiority and adversary capabilities have changed. Said Warden, 'They are undertaking a force structure design review and the [Air Force] Secretary has been open about looking at the various options they have for increasing their force size, and has talked specifically about NGAD, and we know that B-21 is in the mix as well. It would be premature for me to suggest where that force structure review will end up, but I do think in the coming months, we may get a better indication from the Air Force as to how they're thinking about B-21 quantities in the long run.&rdquo; In the meantime, flight testing and production are moving along well, Warden said. 'The B-21 program has also made solid progress in achieving ground and flight testing milestones on the development contract, and is continuing to execute the aircraft production contract in line with our estimates,&rdquo; she said. Last month, Northrop said it has three aircraft in test, two for ground testing and one for flight testing, and has been able to conduct flight tests twice a week.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/northrop-expecting-next-b-21-production-award-end-year/400526/	2024-10-24T11:31:47-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/24/Screenshot_2024_10_24_at_8.30.09AM/large.png
The D Brief: US confirms N. Korean deployment; WH’s natsec AI mem...	After nearly two weeks of warnings from Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence officials, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed Wednesday 'there is evidence that there are [North Korean] troops in Russia.&rdquo; Ukraine's president claimed last week at least 10,000 North Koreans will be helping Russia fight Ukrainian troops, possibly in and around Russia's Kursk region, bordering Ukraine. On Tuesday, President Zelenskyy said that number could be as high as 12,000 spread across two brigades. South Korean intelligence officials said Friday the North Koreans began their journey on October 8, beginning with 1,500 or so traveling via 'four amphibious landing ships and three escort vessels owned by Russia,&rdquo; according to Yonhap news agency. White House officials said Wednesday at least 3,000 North Korean soldiers traveled to eastern Russia for military training earlier this month. 'We assess that these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wonsan area in North Korea to Vladivostok,&rdquo; National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby told reporters. 'We do not yet know whether these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military, but this is certainly a highly concerning probability,&rdquo; Kirby said. 'If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they're fair targets, and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they are defending themselves against Russian soldiers,&rdquo; Kirby told reporters. Russian leader Vladimir Putin 'may be even in more trouble than most people realize,&rdquo; Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin told reporters Wednesday. Referring to the North Korean soldiers, Austin said, 'If they're co-belligerents, if their intention is to participate in this war on Russia's behalf, that is a very, very serious issue, and it will have impacts not only in Europe. It will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific as well.&rdquo; Mapped: See the path North Koreans are believed to be traveling to training sites inside Russia via this graphic published Wednesday by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Expert reax: 'In addition to sending 8 million rounds of 122 millimeter (mm) and 152mm munitions and scores of ballistic missiles, North Korea is now providing the ultimate sign of an alliance commitment in the spirit of the renewed mutual defense treaty signed by the two leaders in June 20,&rdquo; Victor Cha of CSIS wrote in an explainer Wednesday. 'It's unclear whether these are technicians or combat troops,&rdquo; he cautioned. But 'Either way, this makes DPRK the most visible and committed supporter of Russia's aggression in Europe,&rdquo; he said. Worth noting: 'Thus far, China's reaction to North Korea's support of Russia has been caught somewhere between paralysis and incompetence, lacking either the political will or policy ingenuity to create disincentives for either party,&rdquo; said Cha. 'For one, China does not like Russia to have so much influence over the North,&rdquo; he said. 'In addition, if the longer-term ramifications of this cooperation lead to greater DPRK capabilities that invite even more U.S. military presence and allied capabilities in China's region, that does not benefit China.&rdquo; More on Ukraine after the jump...

Update: The White House won't greenlight long-range strikes inside Russia, and for reasons that have been known for months&mdash;including Russia's movement of equipment out of the range of relevant U.S.-provided weapons (ATACMS, in particular) as well as the unpredictability of second-order effects from nuclear-armed Moscow, Fox's Jacqui Heinrich reported Wednesday afternoon, citing a U.S. official. This week in data: Russia's military has used at least 36 types of missiles to attack Ukraine, CSIS researchers Benjamin Jensen and Yasir Atalan reported Wednesday. 'This diversity reflects an operational approach to firepower strikes of combining different models like long-range attack drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles to complicate the ability of Ukraine to defend its skies. Of note, many of these unique combinations were launched from different geographic sites further complicating air defense.&rdquo; That would seem to suggest 'The United States and its partners need to do more to curb the ability of [Iran, China, and North Korea] to replenish Russia's arsenal,&rdquo; they warn. What's more, 'An overall intercept rate of 79.8 percent suggests effective defense mechanisms in place,&rdquo; but 'Keeping this intercept rate high will require continued Western support for Ukraine.&rdquo; Read on, here.

That's why so many of the most notable military and national security leaders of the past two decades of war have recently broken with long tradition to publicly warn that he is manifestly unfit to serve again as commander-in-chief. No fewer than 741 former high-ranking national security and military leaders&mdash;including 233 general and flag officers, 15 four-star generals, and 10 former service secretaries&mdash;recently signed a letter endorsing Kamala Harris for president. They warn that Trump is 'too impulsive and ill-informed&rdquo; to entrust with the world's most powerful fighting force.

New AUKUS experiment shows how allies with autonomy will speed up...	U.S., Australian, British, and Japanese defense officials converged on Australia's Jervis Bay this week for a weeklong experiment to test how to integrate new, developmental tech from different countries in order to speed up intelligence and reconnaissance data transmission at sea. The results: 'Things that would have taken perhaps months were taking place minutes in terms of common operating pictures,&rdquo; one senior defense official told reporters. The so-called Maritime Big Play exercise is part of the broader AUKUS partnership between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The first pillar of AUKUS focuses on the co-development of a nuclear-powered submarine, while the second pillar involves co-development and deployment of emerging technologies like autonomous drones. Madeline Mortelmans, the current acting assistant defense secretary for strategy, plans and capabilities, told reporters Wednesday that progress on AUKUS pillar II is already changing the way the allies think about joint operations and fielding new technologies. 'We're advancing our undersea warfare capabilities by expanding our ability to launch to and recover uncrewed underwater systems from the torpedo tubes on current classes of British and U.S. submarines,&rdquo; she said. 'That will increase the range and capability of our undersea forces. We're integrating the [BAE] Sting Ray lightweight torpedo into the P-8A maritime patrol aircraft, which will support our forces in being more interchangeable while providing resilience to munitions stockpiles across AUKUS nations.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] The experimentation in Jervis Bay served as a showcase for a lot of new drone tech and other systems, both in the water and above, from across the alliance. 'Much of the gear that was brought to the party was from the partners,&rdquo; one official said. Some of the systems the United States brought include the GARC unmanned surface boat, the Vanilla long-endurance UAV, and the Ocean Aero underwater and surface vessel (Triton.) 'This was all industry. We had 30 different systems, from the sea bed to the stratosphere, involved here,&rdquo; an official said. The experiments tested how well the systems and the militaries could collect and disseminate intelligence and data. 'The testing and experimentation was driven by specific scenarios. So think of the need to use a mix of uncrewed and crewed assets to do very large area [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] for example, and to maintain a common operating picture,&rdquo; an official said. Another focus of the experiment was to identify how allies could modify or develop specific tactics, techniques and procedures to allow for faster data and intelligence sharing across the alliance&mdash;and to do so from the wide array of drones and other assets. 'We demonstrated not only the systems&hellip; but also how we would employ those systems. So the specific TTPs that will help us do that more effectively, that will accelerate our adoption, and then further it helps us understand how we would do it together, through connecting and communicating and command and controlling the devices,&rdquo; another official said. Japanese officials attended the briefings this week, as the AUKUS nations are considering closer collaboration with Japan in these areas. One former senior defense official told Defense One, 'Integrating increasingly autonomous capabilities is critical to the future success of all three navies.&rdquo; The experiment 'provides a unique platform for experimentation to ensure each country benefits from the advances of the other, helping the AUKUS partners scale better than future capabilities faster,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/new-aukus-experiment-shows-how-allies-autonomy-will-speed-naval-operations/400513/	2024-10-24T04:30:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/24/Screenshot_2024_10_23_at_11.39.49PM/large.png
White House signs national security memo on AI	President Joe Biden will issue a new national security memorandum today on artificial intelligence, aimed at helping the U.S. government deploy AI and retain its advantage over China. The United States must 'ensure that our national security agencies are adopting this technology in ways that align with our values,&rdquo; a senior White House official told reporters ahead of the unveiling. A failure to do so 'could put us at risk of a strategic surprise by our rivals, such as China,&rdquo; the official said. The memorandum provides guidance&mdash;via a framework&mdash;on how to employ AI for national security missions. 'These requirements require agencies to monitor, assess, and mitigate AI risks related to invasions of privacy, bias and discrimination, the safety of individuals and groups, and other human rights abuses,&rdquo; according to a fact sheet from the White House. The guidance will allow the government to take better advantage of the new AI tools coming out of Silicon Valley, the White House said. 'The innovation that's happened, particularly in this current wave of frontier artificial intelligence, has really been driven by the private sector, and it's critical that we continue to both foster that leadership,&rdquo; the official said. 'AI is rooted in the premise that capabilities generated by the transformer and large language model revolution in AI, often called frontier AI, are poised to shape geopolitical, military, and intelligence competition.&rdquo; There are still major concerns about applying those AI tools, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, to high-stakes areas like national security, given the propensity of such models to hallucinate and produce false positives. And the publicly available data sets those models are largely trained on can contain personal (but legally obtainable) personal information on U.S. civilians, as Defense One has reported. The national security community is 'well aware&rdquo; of the concerns, the official said. 'We have to go through a process of accrediting systems. And that's not just for AI systems, but, you know, national security systems generally,&rdquo; he said, pointing to Biden's previous executive order on AI and the establishment of the AI Safety Institute as two steps the White House has taken to mitigate AI risks, particularly in government use. The new memo designates the Commerce Department's AI Safety Institute as 'U.S. industry's primary port of contact in the U.S. government,&rdquo; according to the fact sheet. Those efforts join already existing Defense Department and Intelligence Community guidelines on AI development and deployment. The official agreed that the availability of U.S. citizens' data is a growing problem. 'We have been very concerned about the ways in which Americans' sensitive data can be sold, really through the front door, first collected in bulk, then sold through data brokers, and then end up in the hands of our adversaries. And so that's something that the President issued an executive order on [in February] to try to restrict adversary access to some of that data.&rdquo; But while the risks are real, the government still must establish a way for the national security community to 'experiment&rdquo; with AI through 'pilots,&rdquo; the official said. 'There are going to be challenges associated with adopting any new technology,&rdquo; they said. 'The framework&hellip;is one that's going to be continuously updated.&rdquo; And those updates may be subject to political disruption: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has vowed to repeal Biden's executive order on AI safety.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/white-house-signs-national-security-memo-ai/400512/	2024-10-24T03:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/24/GettyImages_1765529254/large.jpg
Heed the generals who call Trump unfit to lead	As a coda to two decades covering the post-9/11 conflicts as a correspondent, I wrote a book in 2021 profiling the 25 Medal of Honor recipients from the nation's longest wars. Theirs are stories of never surrendering despite harrowing odds, of facing death and finding the courage and faith not to be cowed, of wearing their profound scars&mdash;both physical as well as mental&mdash;like badges of honor. There is wisdom and warrior fierceness in those narratives, but also acts of profound tenderness and love. The common theme running throughout is troops united in a cause greater than themselves, caught in a brush with eternity and choosing to risk and even forfeit their own lives to save their brothers in arms. Their heroism and self-sacrifice is awe-inspiring, and explains why those privileged to lead them in combat consider these uniformed volunteers and their teammates America's 'New Greatest Generation.&rdquo; Donald Trump cannot fathom any of that. As if we needed reminding, the former and possibly future commander-in-chief continues to prove in the crudest terms imaginable that he views the U.S. military from a deep well of incomprehension, not as a sacred trust to be honored by any leader, but rather as an instrument of self-aggrandizement and brute force. That was the message behind Trump's recent description of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which he has bestowed on supporters and major campaign donors, as 'much better&rdquo; than the Medal of Honor, because service members who receive the nation's highest military honor have either 'been hit so many times by bullets, or they're dead.&rdquo; Militaries always have an irresistible allure to 'wannabe dictators,&rdquo; to borrow a phrase from Gen. Mark Milley, whom Trump appointed Joint Chiefs chairman. Trump has made no secret of his yearning to deploy the active force onto the streets of America to strike fear into his domestic political opponents, who he chillingly called 'the enemy from within&rdquo; in a recent Fox interview. He has also repeatedly telegraphed his intention to use the military to quell a supposed crime wave in Democratic-led cities, and to conduct the largest deportation in our nation's history of immigrants and 'radical left thugs&rdquo; that 'live like vermin&rdquo; inside the United States and are 'poisoning the blood of our country.&rdquo; Given Trump's Nazi-esque rhetoric, it's not surprising&mdash;yet still extraordinary&mdash;that his former chief of staff, retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, recently confirmed that Trump repeatedly praised Adolf Hitler's generals for their perceived blind loyalty, and wanted U.S. military leaders more in the mold of the German Wehrmacht under the Nazis. Nor is it surprising that Milley, now retired, has called his former boss the 'most dangerous person to this country&rdquo; and a 'fascist to the core.&rdquo; Decades of covering the U.S. military as a reporter taught me that even retired generals and admirals are instinctively resistant to engaging in partisan politics. They have been inculcated from their first days as cadets or newly minted lieutenants with the principle that the military must stay above the partisan fray in a democracy and submit to civilian authority. Their leaders know that the nonpartisan nature of the U.S. military helps explain why it has long remained the nation's most respected institution. I also know from talking with many of Milley's contemporaries, both on-the-record and privately, that they share his dire assessment, and genuinely fear for their country should Trump return to the Oval Office. That's why so many of the most notable military and national security leaders of the past two decades of war have recently broken with long tradition to publicly warn that he is manifestly unfit to serve again as commander-in-chief. No fewer than 741 former high-ranking national security and military leaders&mdash;including 233 general and flag officers, 15 four-star generals, and 10 former service secretaries&mdash;recently signed a letter endorsing Kamala Harris for president. They warn that Trump is 'too impulsive and ill-informed&rdquo; to entrust with the world's most powerful fighting force. Roughly half of my fellow citizens have chosen to ignore those warnings, and that is certainly their right. Before they vote, however, I hope they reconsider why the nation's guardians have chosen to break with tradition. Consider just one recent, revealing incident that was quickly buried beneath the media coverage of Trump's non-stop outrages and falsehoods. In August, Trump and the bully boys of his campaign pushed past an Army employee into the highly restricted Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery, the section largely reserved for the fallen of Afghanistan and Iraq, in order to illegally film a TikTok campaign video and snap a picture of the candidate with Gold Star Family members. Take a close look at that photograph of the former president grinning broadly and giving the thumbs-up over the graves of Marines who lost their lives in the Biden administration's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, and ask yourself: What must he have been thinking? Perhaps his thoughts were similar to the ones he expressed privately during a 2018 trip to France for the centennial anniversary of the end of World War I, when then-President Trump cancelled visits to cemeteries for America's fallen because he said they were filled with 'losers&rdquo; and 'suckers.&rdquo; Or perhaps his thoughts tracked with those Trump expressed to General Milley, who as JCS chairman had arranged for a severely wounded Army captain to sing at a ceremony for the president. 'Why do you bring people like that here?&rdquo; Trump reportedly asked Milley afterwards, before instructing him not to let the soldier appear in public again. 'No one wants to see that, the wounded.&rdquo; Trump has repeatedly shown that such blasphemy comes from a deep hollowness of character. How else to explain the then-president's casual cruelty during an earlier visit to Arlington National Cemetery, there supposedly to pay respects at gravesite No. 9480. It held the remains of a young Marine killed in action in Afghanistan: 1st Lt. Robert Michael Kelly, the son of Trump's soon-to-be chief of staff. 'I don't get it,&rdquo; Trump told the grieving Kelly. 'What was in it for them?&rdquo; Why young American men and women volunteered after 9/11&mdash;knowing they would be subjected to the horrors of war, running to the sound of guns as their fathers and uncles had in Vietnam, and their grandfathers had in Korea and World War II&mdash;was not something that could ever be explained to Donald Trump. Yet in his own grief, John Kelly, himself a retired four-star Marine general and decorated combat veteran, understood that his son Robert had already given the answer to the question of whether the cause was worth the sacrifice. 'In his mind&mdash;and in his heart&mdash;he had decided somewhere between the day he was born at 2130, 5 September 1981&mdash;and 0719, 9 November 2010&mdash;that it was worth it to him to risk everything&mdash;even his own life&mdash;in the service of his country,&rdquo; Kelly would later tell other grieving Gold Star families. 'So, in spite of the terrible emptiness that is in a corner of my heart and I now know will be there until I see him again, and the corners of the hearts of everyone who ever knew him, we are proud. So very proud. Was it worth his life? It's not for me to say. He answered the question for me.&rdquo; Before surrendering the fate of America's sons and daughters in uniform to the whims of an unstable commander-in-chief who simply cannot grasp the meaning of their devotion and sacrifice, I hope voters will listen to the actual patriots who have devoted their lives to our nation's defense. They know from experience that Trump will cozy up to autocratic strongmen and once again denigrate democratic allies, eroding the alliances that undergird America's global strength. They have never forgotten that on January 6, 2021, after inciting a violent mob that ransacked the citadel of our democracy on one of the darkest days in modern U.S. history, the former commander-in-chief was AWOL, watching the desecration on television for hours and breaking the chain of command at the top. They have heard him recently refer to that desecration as a 'day of love.&rdquo; Above all, they know that the hollowness and narcissism at Donald Trump's core masks a darkness that could eclipse what they and so many others have risked everything to defend. 'A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all &lsquo;suckers' because &lsquo;there is nothing in it for them,&rdquo; John Kelly said of his former boss in a blistering statement to CNN last year confirming many of Trump's outrageous comments, first reported and recently confirmed in The Atlantic. 'A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because &lsquo;it doesn't look good for me.' A person who demonstrated open contempt&hellip;for all Gold Star families&hellip;and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America's defense are &lsquo;losers,' and wouldn't visit their graves in France.&rdquo; 'A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about,&rdquo; Kelly continued in what amounted to a scream from the soul of a grieving father, and a dire warning from a renowned military leader afraid for his country. 'A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. 'There is nothing more than can be said,&rdquo; Kelly concluded. 'God help us.&rdquo; Amen.

HONOLULU&mdash;The war in Ukraine shows how the United States must improve its acquisition process if it hopes to maintain military strength, the deputy commander of Pacific Fleet said Tuesday. Ukraine 'provides us a great example of the importance of rapid innovation and lightning-quick transition from the drawing board to the battlefield,&rdquo; Vice Adm. Blake Converse said during the opening keynote speech at AFCEA TechNet Indo-Pacific here. 'Ukrainians have perfected the rapid acquisition of technology for multi-domain combat operations. They have shown us that even without a robust military-industrial complex and infrastructure, we can integrate land, sea, air, space, cyber, and information.&rdquo; Ukraine's success in using unmanned vessels and missiles against the Russian Black Sea fleet is 'not just compelling, it's revolutionary,&rdquo; Converse said. Of course, the U.S. is not Ukraine, and the Pentagon's high-tech weapons 'weren't developed in a makerspace lab in Silicon Valley, they're the products of our acquisition systems,&rdquo; he said. 'Our imperative as a military must be to work with industry, to partner to foster innovation and to integrate emerging capabilities alongside our acquisition processes that exist today, but as fast as humanly possible.&rdquo; That speed is necessary to be prepared for 'a highly contested combat environment in the western Pacific,&rdquo; Converse said, adding that in addition to 'building capabilities, sensors, and weapons,&rdquo; the joint force must also 'massively upgrade our command-and-control systems and processes.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] That potential conflict would also require a highly resilient digital infrastructure in the region that could handle a huge influx in troops and requirements, said Marine Col. Jared Voneida, commander of DISA's Pacific field office. 'This what we're trying to build. We are looking for an infrastructure that's ready to go on day one of the fight, to absorb bandwidth increases from that joint force descending on this theater,&rdquo; Voneida said at the conference. Such a fight would be much different than the previous 20 years, Voneida said. 'Instead of deconflicting between one Marine unit and one Army unit located in the desert of Iraq, we're deconflicting globally across combatant commands. It's a global fight,&rdquo; he said. ' You need a global network. You need to be able to seamlessly move our data across, not just the Indo-Pacific theater, but the globe. Because that's where the fight is going to happen. Asked about the speed at which Ukrainians have rebuilt networks there, Voneida said the reason he believes having a 'robust, reliable, resilient, all the adjectives&rdquo; network ready before a conflict is critical is that expert technicians may not be able to physically access the infrastructure to rebuild over and over again during a war with China. 'If we can, great, I think we'll do exactly what's happening in Ukraine. If not, I think our goal is to have such a resilient network that we can gracefully degrade it as we go through the conflict,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/military-must-improve-acquisition-win-future-wars-admiral-says/400509/	2024-10-23T14:50:44-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/23/Screenshot_2024_10_23_at_11.49.15AM/large.png
Boeing will look to ‘do less and do better’: CEO	Boeing won't be able to fix its ailing defense arm, which lost $2 billion this quarter, anytime soon, but the company's CEO said Wednesday that its defense products are still core to the company. 'It's going to take a lot of work. We're not going to be able to just wave a wand and clean up these troubled contracts. We signed up to some things that are problematic,&rdquo; Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg told investors during the company's third-quarter earnings call&mdash;his first public comments since taking the job in August. Fixed-price development programs have been dragging down the company's defense arm, causing billions of dollars in losses. But Boeing couldn't walk away from these money-losing defense contracts 'even if we wanted to,&rdquo; Ortberg said. Instead, the company may consider cuts to other, non-core defense programs, he said. 'I think that we're better off doing less and doing it better than doing more and not doing it well, so we're in the process of taking an evaluation of the portfolio,&rdquo; Ortberg said. [[Related Posts]] What might Boeing cut? In the defense sector, it will likely keep its aircraft and weapons programs, and try to offload most, if not all, of its space program. But it's unclear if it could find buyers, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director for AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace consulting firm. 'This is a question of buyers, not willingness to sell,&rdquo; Aboulafia said. Sierra Space was at one point reportedly considering buying the joint Boeing-Lockheed rocket launch firm ULA, but the status of any such sale is still up in the air. Ortberg didn't offer a list of what the company might shed, but said, 'our core of commercial airplanes and defense systems are going to stay with the Boeing company for the long run, but there's probably some things on the fringe there that we can be more efficient with, or that just distract us from our main goal here.&rdquo; The company aims to finalize decisions on what stays and what goes by the end of the year, Ortberg said. In order to get the current defense programs on track and prepare for future contracts, the company needs to focus on the things it can control, Ortberg said, such as how they estimate the total cost of a project. 'We know how to run these programs. We just have lost a little bit of discipline. I don't think our people are close enough to the people in the labs, on the factory floor, identifying what's keeping us from being successful, and so, we've made some changes in that regard,&rdquo; Ortberg said. During the call, Boeing executives also confirmed previously disclosed losses on the defense side: $2 billion on the T-7 trainer, KC-46 tanker, Starliner spacecraft, and MQ-25 unmanned refueler. 'The magnitude of these losses expanded as we close the books, primarily reflecting higher estimated production costs on the T-7A program, mainly on contracts in 2026 and beyond, and an updated assessment of impacts on the KC-46A program associated with the IAM work stoppage and the decision to conclude production on the 767 freighter,&rdquo; CFO Brian West told investors. Boeing machinists have been striking for more than a month now in the Pacific Northwest, which is hitting the company's defense programs since those facilities also build the commercial-derived Air Force KC-46 tanker and Navy P-8 maritime aircraft. The workers will vote on a new contract Wednesday, just hours after Boeing released its earnings. During the earnings call, Ortberg said 'first and foremost&rdquo; the company has to end the IAM strike, and they've been 'feverishly working&rdquo; to find a solution. Following the start of the strike, Boeing announced it would cut 10% of its workforce, roughly 17,000 people. This dramatic cut was needed because Boeing is 'inefficient&rdquo; and has too much overhead, Ortberg said. 'I wouldn't think of it like we're going to take people off the production or out of the engineering labs. That's not our intent here. It's about getting ourselves more efficient and having a more lean and mean machine going forward, and I think that's going to be really important as we ramp up the production,&rdquo; he said. As the company attempts to position itself for the future, it's already started making leadership changes. Head of Boeing's defense sector Ted Colbert was pushed out in September, though the company has yet to announce his successor. Asked about the replacement, Ortberg wouldn't say whether they'd fill the spot with someone external or internal to the company, but said he's 'not averse to bringing in some additional resources to help the team, and I don't think the teams are averse to that as well.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/boeing-will-look-do-less-and-do-better-ceo/400500/	2024-10-23T13:03:48-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/23/GettyImages_2170865140/large.jpg
Army wargame to test cargo drones and live logistics data	In a future war, Army tanks growling around the battlefield may be able to send live data back to their headquarters showing every time they fire a round or burn a gallon of fuel. Using that data, logisticians back at the base might then send swarms of drones buzzing back to the tanks with new ammo, or guide fleets of drone boats laden with fuel to a beach somewhere. None of these ideas is ready for prime time yet &mdash; but the Army will test all three at Project Convergence this spring, according to Brig. Gen. Shane Upton, commander of the Contested Logistics Cross-Functional Team. Upton spoke to Defense One on the sidelines of the recent AUSA conference. Some of the work, like the tank-ammo project, consists of updating logistics for the modern era. Historically, Upton said, logisticians typically receive radio reports from units about how many rounds they have left, then add those numbers to an enormous spreadsheet by midnight each day. But that method is not flawless. A typing error could change 20 rounds to 200, he said. With logistics data updated only every 24 hours, meanwhile, a commander may make unrealistic plans based on a faulty understanding of their logistics. If soldiers in the tank can reliably send the data directly back to headquarters, by contrast, logisticians can keep a closer eye on usage rates and prioritize resupply missions. Commanders will also have an up-to-the-minute understanding of their forces' readiness. For the upcoming Project Convergence, the starting objective will be to transfer shell and fuel consumption data while the tank is stopped, with a 'stretch&rdquo; goal of transferring data when it's on the move, Upton said. Other technologies the team is prepping for Project Convergence aren't just updates, but entirely new ways of doing logistics. During the event, the team will test two heavy cargo drones capable of carrying 1,000 pounds or more up to 250 nautical miles. The aim of such drones is to deliver multiple artillery shells or precision munitions to troops, all without risking the lives of pilots who would otherwise be tasked with ferrying in munitions by plane or helicopter. The Marine Corps, which already fields a small resupply drone, is also testing options from Leidos and Kaman for a heavier-lift drone in the ranges Upton outlined. Under an 'aggressive&rdquo; schedule, that type of heavy-lift drone could be fielded to its first unit by 2030, Upton said, though that would require many more Army organizations than Army Futures Command to achieve. A smaller drone capable of lifting 150 pounds might be fielded to some units of the Army's 'transformation-in-contact&rdquo; modernization program by 2026, Upton said. The team will also test autonomous resupply boats that the Navy has already experimented with, Upton said. The Army wants the systems to be relatively cheap so it can send 'hundreds&rdquo; to the field, allowing them to disperse widely, which will make them harder for an enemy to strike. Other tech is also in the works, even if the Army isn't ready to pull the trigger on it yet. The service is watching how Ukraine is using drones for casualty evacuation, he said, and while Army discussions about implementing similar practices are 'pre-decisional,&rdquo; he called Ukraine's efforts 'very ingenious.&rdquo; The Army is also looking into better ways to supply troops with energy, but Upton noted numerous problems with existing tech even as troops rely on more and more powered tools, from drones to directed energy. Solar panels could offer frontline troops easy charging options, for example, but could be just as difficult to move as a towed generator, he said. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells or even small nuclear energy could help power bases, meanwhile, but both come with a host of policy, safety, and other problems. Still, Upton was optimistic. 'I think there's a lot of movement that's got to happen in the [power-generation] space,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/army-wargame-test-cargo-drones-and-live-logistics-data/400499/	2024-10-23T12:53:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/23/8286377/large.jpg
The D Brief: A shipyard death; Another F-35 delay?; US troops wou...	He died building a ship for the U.S. government. His family got nothing. ProPublica reports on the death of a shipbuilder at Thoma-Sea, among Louisiana's largest shipyards. Elmer De Le&oacute;n P&eacute;rez died last January as he welded inside a ballast tank of a new oceanographic-research vessel, but his family received no death benefits because he was an employee not of the shipyard, but of G-4 Services, a local staffing subcontractor. G-4 officials insisted that, one, P&eacute;rez was somehow 'not working&rdquo; as he welded, and, two, he wasn't really their employee. 'P&eacute;rez was a self-employed independent contractor and thus a claim for death benefits is not compensable,&rdquo; a lawyer for G-4 Services wrote in May. There are lessons to be learned from this incident and others like it, and a U.S. Navy and shipbuilding industry that is desperately trying to attract employees had best learn them quickly. Writes ProPublica: 'Today the lack of welders is acute. The U.S. needs at least 300,000 more of them in the next few years. Shipyards have been hit particularly hard by the gap, which has contributed to a shortfall in warship production. As in many other industries, immigrants are filling that gap. P&eacute;rez embodied many aspects of the immigration debate.&rdquo; Read on, here. Speaking of immigrants, they appear much more willing to join the U.S. military than the native-born, according to a new study that may have resonance amid military recruitment struggles and an election charged with rhetoric and misinformation. Some 60 percent of U.S. respondents expressed a willingness to fight for their country, and immigrants were nearly 30 percent more likely to do so than native-born citizens, according to the study, whose results were described in the September issue of Armed Forces & Society. Defense One's Patrick Tucker unpacks it, here. F-35 tech problems, protracted negotiations hit Lockheed finances. The company and Pentagon have yet to reach an accord on the contract for the next two production lots&mdash;18 and 19&mdash;and that kept Lockheed from collecting about $700 million last quarter, company officials said Tuesday. They've had to spend company cash to keep the production line running. Another TR-3 delay? Lockheed executives previously said that the jets' full, combat-ready TR-3 package could be ready late next spring. But the company seems to have backed away from that goal in today's earnings call. Defense One's Audrey Decker reports, here.

On this day in 1942, the Second Battle of El Alamein began in Egypt, eventually resulting in a British-led Allied victory over the Nazis and Italians after almost three weeks of fighting. The victory eased Axis threats to the Suez Canal and prevented a Nazi and Fascist advance into the Middle East. Iraq officials say they've killed a top ISIS official after a U.S.-assisted raid in the northern Hamrin Mountains, according to Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute, reporting Tuesday. It's not yet clear exactly who was killed, however. Two U.S. troops were injured in linked operations, which U.S. defense officials confirmed Wednesday and said consisted of 'strikes and follow-on raids on multiple ISIS locations in central Iraq, targeting several senior ISIS leaders and killing at least seven ISIS operatives.&rdquo; The two Americans 'were wounded while assisting Iraqi forces with site exploitation,&rdquo; but they're now in stable condition, according to Central Command. Moment of impact: A photographer in Beirut captured several milliseconds before and after an Israeli rocket struck a building allegedly used by Hezbollah in broad daylight on Tuesday. Behind the lens: Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein, who stayed around 'roughly 40 minutes after an Israeli military spokesperson posted a warning in Arabic on social media, notifying people in and around a pair of buildings on Beirut's southern outskirts that that [sic] they should evacuate the area,&rdquo; AP writes. Review about a half dozen of those images here. Retaliation watch: Israeli officials are still talking up a future attack on Iran in response to Iran's October 1 barrage featuring an estimated 180 ballistic missiles, dozens of which appear to have struck an Israeli air base hosting F-35 aircraft. 'After we strike in Iran, everyone will understand what you did in the preparation and training process,&rdquo; Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israeli troops Wednesday, according to the Times of Israel. 'Everyone who dreamed a year ago of beating us and attacking us, paid a heavy price and is no longer in that dream,&rdquo; Gallant said. It's been another busy day for Israeli air defense systems, which reportedly shot down drones and rockets allegedly launched from Lebanon, according to the Times of Israel's Mannie Fabian. And lastly: An era of 'total war&rdquo; has returned, argues former Pentagon policy official Mara Karlin, writing this week in Foreign Affairs. 'An era of limited war has ended; an age of comprehensive conflict has begun,&rdquo; she says. How so? 'In both Ukraine and the Middle East, what has become clear is that the relatively narrow scope that defined war during the post-9/11 era has dramatically widened,&rdquo; writes Karlin, who served for more than two years as the Biden administration's assistant defense secretary for strategy, plans, and capabilities. 'Indeed, what the world is witnessing today is akin to what theorists in the past have called &lsquo;total war,' in which combatants draw on vast resources, mobilize their societies, prioritize warfare over all other state activities, attack a broad variety of targets, and reshape their economies and those of other countries.&rdquo; The twist: New technologies and a globalized economy make the new total wars different from earlier eras, so strategists and planners must rethink how they fight and prepare, Karlin argues.

Immigrants show greater willingness to join the military, new stu...	Immigrants to the U.S. are more willing to 'fight for the country&rdquo; than the native-born, according to a multinational study that may have resonance amid military recruitment struggles and an election charged with rhetoric and misinformation. Some 60 percent of U.S. respondents expressed a willingness to fight for their country, and immigrants were nearly 30 percent more likely to do so than native-born citizens, according to the survey, whose results were described in the September issue of Armed Forces & Society. The researchers compared multiple surveys across several years including 2024, specifically looking at Americans and Canadians questions about background, self-identity, religious beliefs, feelings of national pride, and more. It was conducted by Christopher Simon of the University of Utah, Nicholas P. Lovrich of Washington State University, Kenneth G. Verboncoeur, of the U.S. Army, and Michael C. Moltz of Shippensburg University. The authors write that demographics will lead many Western militaries to recruit more immigrants. 'Recruitment shortfalls plaguing prominent Western militaries employing the all-volunteer force model raise concerns about the maintenance of force size and readiness. Faced with aging populations, many developed nations will increasingly rely on immigrant youth to address recruitment shortfalls,&rdquo; the authors write. (So far, in the United States, most services report being on track or above their 2024 goals to date but fell beneath their 2023 goals.) The survey also indicates that immigrants are more civic-minded and oriented toward public service than the native-born populations of the countries in which they reside. That belies many claims by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has made derogation of immigrants a chief theme of his campaign. Immigrants' propensity to 'fight&rdquo; appears to be less about their affinity for the military than for the society they have joined, the authors write. 'The evidence presented here would indicate that immigrant willingness to fight is associated primarily with building civic connectedness in the host nation and is not a function of militarism or nationalism,&rdquo; they wrote. While military service has long been a way for documented immigrants to speed up the naturalization process, much of the current national immigration debate has focused on undocumented immigrants, who are generally not allowed to join the military. Their wait for legal status averages about two years, and grew longer during the Trump administration. On the campaign trail, Trump has vowed mass deportations of even legal immigrants at gunpoint by the National Guard. It's hard to imagine such a policy gaining support among the immigrant community interested in military service.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/immigrants-show-greater-willingness-join-military-new-study-shows/400469/	2024-10-22T15:10:59-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/22/GettyImages_566039953-1/large.jpg
He died building a ship for the US government. His family got not...	On the morning of Jan. 22, 2024, Elmer De Le&oacute;n P&eacute;rez descended deep into the bowels of a ship that he was helping to build in Houma, Louisiana. P&eacute;rez was a welder, working to construct one of the U.S. government's most sophisticated ships, an $89 million vessel for tracking hurricanes and conducting oceanographic research. It was funded by President Joe Biden's signature climate legislation. P&eacute;rez's assignment had him working at the bottom of a nearly 12-foot ballast tank, according to a subsequent police report; the walls were just 4 feet apart. That meant standing inside a metal cylinder, roughly twice the size of a household water heater, using an argon-gas torch whose flame can burn as hot as 20,000 degrees. Something went very wrong that day. In the afternoon, workers noticed that P&eacute;rez, 20, had not come up for lunch. Friends and family began calling, with no answer. His coworkers found him slumped over in the tank. 'I couldn't get to him because the gas was too strong,&rdquo; one of them told ProPublica. 'I started screaming, &lsquo;Help! Help! Help!'&rdquo; When emergency workers found his body, P&eacute;rez was already showing signs of rigor mortis. A coroner's report would note that he was wearing a red hoodie, plaid pajama pants and brown steel-toed boots, and that a 'copious amount of clear fluid was noted to the mouth and nose,&rdquo; as well as on the sleeve of his shirt. The coroner concluded that P&eacute;rez 'died as a result of bilateral severe pulmonary consolidation and edema&rdquo; &mdash; fluid in the lungs &mdash; and 'copper and nickel intoxication.&rdquo; (The ship, like many, used copper-nickel alloys as a coating because they resist corrosion from salt water.) P&eacute;rez had worked for roughly the previous two years at the shipyard, which is owned by Thoma-Sea, a large employer with hundreds of millions of dollars in federal defense contracts. If employees are hurt or killed at work, they and their families are eligible for significant financial help. If one dies in an accident, for example, federal law requires companies such as Thoma-Sea to pay any surviving children. For an employee who perished the way P&eacute;rez did, that would have meant payments until his toddler son was at least 18, which could approach a total of $500,000. But P&eacute;rez wasn't working directly for Thoma-Sea; he was employed by a contractor. So when he died, Thoma-Sea paid nothing. Not to his family, including the partner that survived him. Not to his toddler son. Not even to help send P&eacute;rez's body home to Guatemala. Instead, his family borrowed money and desperately tried to raise the rest online. Family members said they haven't heard anything from Thoma-Sea since P&eacute;rez died. When P&eacute;rez's partner sought death benefits from G-4 Services, the local staffing contractor that had hired him to work for Thoma-Sea, G-4 rebuffed her. 'P&eacute;rez was a self-employed independent contractor and thus a claim for death benefits is not compensable,&rdquo; a lawyer for the company wrote in May. G-4 contends that P&eacute;rez 'wasn't working at the time of his death&rdquo; even though his corpse was found in the ship with his welding equipment. Investigators from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded in a September report that Thoma-Sea committed multiple safety violations. 'An employee was allowed to weld in a confined space that was not monitored for atmospheric changes while hot work was being done,&rdquo; OSHA's report stated. The site supervisor, the findings continued, 'did not verify that the ventilation ductwork &hellip; was set up properly to maintain a safe atmosphere.&rdquo; The agency imposed a fine of $41,480 and then, after Thoma-Sea appealed, reduced it to $31,340. As with potential death benefits, none of that money went to P&eacute;rez's family. For decades, U.S. politicians have blamed immigrants for all manner of national woes, particularly taking American jobs. These days, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump agree on the need for a border clampdown. But the truth about jobs is more complicated. There is a dire shortage of blue-collar workers in the United States. Skilled tradespeople have been aging out of the workforce for years now, with fewer people to replace them, as students have prioritized four-year college degrees. The Biden administration has pumped millions into development programs to lure young people into trades, but it'll take years to see any effects. Today the lack of welders is acute. The U.S. needs at least 300,000 more of them in the next few years. Shipyards have been hit particularly hard by the gap, which has contributed to a shortfall in warship production. As in many other industries, immigrants are filling that gap. P&eacute;rez embodied many aspects of the immigration debate. He had exactly the skills that American companies are desperate for. He was an expert welder, willing to work in the cramped, dangerous spaces inside ships. And P&eacute;rez was able to earn $23 an hour at a shipyard in Houma, many times more than he could in his home country. Slightly built with jet-black hair, P&eacute;rez was funny, diligent and eager to succeed. He had begun building a life in the U.S. But, like millions of others, Perez had not been able to do that legally. This spring, the secretary of Navy, Carlos del Toro, called for creating exactly such a pathway, to help construct the ships the Navy needs. 'What we've got to do is open up the spigot a bit,&rdquo; he said. 'Allow blue-collar workers to come here.&rdquo; Without a work permit, P&eacute;rez was vulnerable. He worked at the shipyard but not for it, a contractor for a subcontractor. P&eacute;rez's story is emblematic of a system that relies ever more on immigrants, even as employers and politicians vilify the very people doing work that generates profits and serves the nation. Employers use subcontractors and independent contractors to pass the risks and costs on to the workers, said Laura Padin, director of work structures at the National Employment Law Project. 'These companies, particularly in occupations and industries with high rates of health and safety violations, use this to shield themselves from responsibility,&rdquo; she said. 'We also see that they do this with workers who are immigrants if they think they're undocumented so that they can avoid responsibility for hiring someone who's undocumented.&rdquo; The point, Padin said, is to 'protect the entity at the top.&rdquo; Houma, about an hour southwest of New Orleans, lies at the heart of bayous and wetlands that draw tourists for swamp tours, crawfish boils and Cajun music festivals. Hollywood film crews occasionally visit for the historic plantation houses that dot the surrounding towns and the wooden structures where enslaved people first lived and labored, and where Black sharecroppers later crowded in. It's a region in decline. Damage from 2021's Hurricane Ida is still visible, and decades of oil and gas extraction, combined with the rapidly worsening effects of climate change, have caused an entire island to disappear into the Gulf of Mexico. Last month, another hurricane, Francine, slammed into the parish, and longtime residents are fleeing soaring insurance costs as much as the next storm. Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes (Houma is located near the line between the two) are sparsely populated and majority white, but with sizable Black and tribal nations communities whose ancestral homelands have been ravaged by climate change. Roughly three-quarters of the region's voters supported Trump in 2020, and there's a strain of anti-immigrant sentiment. In the small town of Golden Meadow, one family still has the sign they erected more than 15 years ago, after their son died in a workplace accident. 'An illegal alien working at Port Fourchon killed Nicholas. 5-11-06.&rdquo; (That sentiment is hardly limited to these two parishes: In June, Louisiana enacted a law that threatens prison terms for any 'alien&rdquo; found to have entered the state unlawfully.) Like much of coastal Louisiana, the region has long drawn migratory labor, such as workers who come for the jobs linked to the giant oil-services installation at Port Fourchon or Filipino visa workers who commonly labor in seafood processing plants. Latino immigration to southern Louisiana began increasing nearly 20 years ago, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. A pattern has developed: After a storm wreaks devastation, Louisianans move north while immigrants come to do disaster cleanup and other jobs deemed too dangerous or difficult even for members of a community built around grueling labor on oil rigs and the like. Hispanic residents barely register on the Census counts outside the New Orleans suburbs. But Latino immigrants are steadily becoming a stronger presence where their labor is needed. About a third of all Latino immigrants in Louisiana arrived within the last several years, according to the Pew Research Center. The Thomassie family, owners of Thoma-Sea, have run businesses in the region's trademark industries, first with family shrimping operations, and then with shipbuilding in 1990. The company initially built tugboats to tow offshore oil rigs and barges through the criss-cross of bayous and canals. Walter Thomassie took over in the early 2000s and expanded the business and its ambitions. 'My father set a good example for us, as owners of the company,&rdquo; Thomassie told The Houma Times in 2014. 'We live comfortably, but not lavishly. We re-invest heavily into the company as it is the mechanism that feeds us and it is our job to do all within our power to maintain its stability.&rdquo; Thomassie lives in Raceland, minutes from a billboard advertising workers' compensation claims for maritime injuries. A half-mile drive leads from the blend of bayou towns and sugarcane fields to his home, partially hidden from view by a garage that blocks the path. Thomassie didn't respond to multiple email and phone requests for an interview for this article, and he declined again when ProPublica approached him outside his home in June. He had emerged with a smile, wiping his hand with a rag, from the shop where he was working. But his face dropped at the mention of ProPublica. Thomassie said he had looked up the website and didn't want to talk about his company or P&eacute;rez's death. 'You really shouldn't come to people's homes,&rdquo; he said. (The company also didn't respond to a detailed list of questions from ProPublica.) The Thomassie family's political involvement has grown steadily in recent years. Walter Thomassie is a significant supporter of congressional Republicans, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who have been harshly critical of immigrants. 'You're seeing countries emptying out prisons to send people here,&rdquo; Scalise claimed this year, citing brutal crimes he said had been committed by 'someone here illegally&rdquo; in his own district, which includes part of Houma. How many immigrants or terrorists, he asked, 'are here in America planning to do us harm because Joe Biden opened the southern border?&rdquo; Thomassie made roughly $35,000 in political contributions over the past year. He and his brother, who is also a member of Thoma-Sea's board, have also donated to local Louisiana Republican candidates. Several Louisiana Republican politicians have made appearances at the shipyards. In October 2022, Thoma-Sea executives gathered with local Republican representatives and federal officials to etch one of the ships the company was building for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Discoverer, with the signature of its ceremonial sponsor, second gentleman Doug Emhoff (who didn't attend). Its sister ship, Oceanographer, where P&eacute;rez worked and eventually died, had received its ceremony and fanfare a few months earlier. Over the past several years, Thoma-Sea has secured hundreds of millions of dollars to construct and repair everything from Coast Guard cutters and Army Corps of Engineers barges to parts for Navy submarines. In 2022, Thomassie said that building the NOAA ship and a second similar one, both designed to collect climate change data that would encourage coastal resilience, would bring more than 600 jobs to the Houma shipyard. By all appearances, Thomassie's company is thriving. Thoma-Sea has another, much larger contract to build two more ships for NOAA. (Asked about P&eacute;rez's death, a NOAA spokesperson expressed 'our condolences to the employee's family and our appreciation for everyone working on these vessels&rdquo; and followed up to note that it was the U.S. Navy that selected Thoma-Sea to build the ship that P&eacute;rez worked on.) Thoma-Sea was awarded millions in new federal contracts in the months after P&eacute;rez died. A rough divide in Thoma-Sea's shipyard is visible, according to workers who spoke to ProPublica. Non-Latino &mdash; mostly white &mdash; employees tend to be on staff, with many in supervisory positions. Some Latino immigrant workers are employed directly for the company and in supervisory positions, but they are more likely to work as independent contractors with no benefits. The phenomenon is not limited to Thoma-Sea. Around Houma, Spanish advertisements for contratistas litter the windows and bulletin boards of Hispanic businesses on the long commercial and industrial strips leading to the shipyards and the Port of Terrebonne, offering positions for pipe fitters, riggers, deckhands, painters and tug welders. Some Houma-based agencies recruit for jobs in other Southern port towns in Mississippi, Alabama or South Carolina. Employers with federal contracts are supposed to ascertain workers' eligibility &mdash; and ensure subcontractors do the same &mdash; using the government's online E-Verify system, which checks identity information like Social Security numbers against federal databases. But experts say E-Verify makes it easy for workers to provide false information, and government agencies rarely monitor compliancewith these rules. Other shipyards working on federal contracts have also hired undocumented workers. At Detyens Shipyards in Charleston, South Carolina, three Mexican immigrants died between 2019 and 2023 in gruesome accidents while repairing the same Navy cargo ship. An investigation by Charleston's Post and Courierdiscovered that two of the men were working under assumed names and both had been recruited by a contractor agency based in Houma. A federal investigation found an abysmal safety record at the shipyard. But the Navy awarded Detyens several more contracts to repair ships soon after those deaths. A company representative declined to comment other than to say that it confirms every employee's eligibility to work. The same day OSHA fined Detyens for its safety record, a House Armed Services Committee hearing discussed the struggle to properly staff shipyards. Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington, gingerly broached the idea of relying more on immigrants. 'This is not a great place to bring up an immigration debate, but you know immigration is potentially one place where we could find some of those workers,&rdquo; Smith said. 'And as we are all painfully aware, there are a lot of people who want to come here. Seems to me that we ought to be able to match up those two problems a little bit better than we are.&rdquo; Smith's suggestion, which was echoed by del Toro, the Navy secretary, never gained momentum. It withered away nearly as soon as it was mentioned. Smith's office did not respond to ProPublica's request for comment. P&eacute;rez and his father, Erick De Le&oacute;n, left their hometown of San Miguel Ixtahuac&aacute;n, Guatemala, at the tail end of 2019, but they crossed into the U.S. separately. According to an account provided by his father, the 15-year-old P&eacute;rez gave himself up to U.S. authorities, leading to a brief detention, while his father crossed the border in the desert. Father and son reunited, then settled with family in Houston, where Per&eacute;z picked up jobs in restaurants and contracting jobs with his father. But by 2021, they had relocated to Houma, where several of P&eacute;rez's aunts lived with their extended families. P&eacute;rez's father eventually returned to Guatemala when his wife got sick. But P&eacute;rez stayed, finding that the welding skills he'd learned on a job in Houston were coveted in Houma. P&eacute;rez's partner, another Guatemalan immigrant, moved with him to Houma. Their son was born on Christmas Day in 2022 at the hospital in Houma, making him a U.S. citizen. They relied on his aunt and uncle, who viewed P&eacute;rez like a son, to get established in Louisiana, and his aunt remembered how his son's birth had shifted his priorities. He focused even more on building a life for his family and spent his limited free time with his son. (ProPublica interviewed several members of P&eacute;rez's family in Houma, but agreed not to name them due to the legal and employment threats that immigrants face right now.) By the time P&eacute;rez signed an independent contractor agreement with G-4 Services to work at Thoma-Sea just a few weeks later, photos of the proud father and son were filling Facebook feeds from Houma to Guatemala. 'Tenerte como hijo siempre ser&aacute; el mejor regalo del mundo,&rdquo; P&eacute;rez wrote beneath a photo with his son on Nov. 19, 2023, just two months before his death. 'To have you as a son will always be the best gift in the world.&rdquo; In the days before P&eacute;rez's death, he was pulled into extra work shifts on Saturday and Sunday. It meant he missed the service at the small Spanish-speaking church near the shipyard, but he arrived home in time to join family dinner with his aunt, uncle and cousins. Eating a huge Sunday meal they had cooked together was one of the most treasured traditions for their busy extended family in Houma, his aunt told ProPublica. P&eacute;rez had requested carne asada, one of his favorites. He wanted to bring the leftovers to work that week. The next day, Monday, marked the beginning of a harrowing ordeal for P&eacute;rez's family. It started around 3 p.m., when relatives who also worked at the shipyard received a worrisome message via Facebook: Something had happened to P&eacute;rez. Family started messaging friends and calling each other frantically, trying to figure out what was going on. When they couldn't get answers, a handful went to the shipyard itself. As they arrived at the Thoma-Sea parking lot and rushed to the security gate, one of P&eacute;rez's aunts remembers seeing a small caravan of emergency vehicles, including a coroner's van, driving in the opposite direction. The company didn't tell them anything at first, leaving them to wait in increasing despair outside the security gate. It wasn't until later, after someone emerged to break the news, that P&eacute;rez's aunt realized that it was his body that had passed them. 'It was like the world came crashing down on me,&rdquo; she told ProPublica. Standing in the shadow of the ship where he had died hours earlier, P&eacute;rez's family clutched each other and cried. Distraught, confused and angry, they returned home to break the news to P&eacute;rez's partner. Word of P&eacute;rez's death spread quickly across Facebook, mostly thanks to the tight-knit evangelical Christian community of his hometown in Guatemala. His U.S. family hosted bake sales and started a GoFundMe page, which raised just $470 toward the $8,689 undertaker's bill and other funeral costs. P&eacute;rez's hometown church in Guatemala, as well as a local evangelical Facebook page, raised much more through posted calls for financial assistance across their network. Neither P&eacute;rez's partner nor the rest of his family in the U.S. could attend the funeral in Guatemala. But they watched a Facebook livestream from the Guatemalan radio station. It showed his coffin arriving in San Miguel Ixtahuac&aacute;n, a caravan of cars following the hearse down the winding mountain road as the sun set. They watched his younger siblings and cousins weep over his open casket, then weep again as his family and neighbors buried him in San Miguel's cemetery. P&eacute;rez's family members in Houma are still reeling from his death. None of his relatives who worked at Thoma-Sea could stomach staying there any longer. They eventually quit and moved to different jobs in the region. His partner still keeps his phone exactly how he left it, the recent call list full of missed calls from family and coworkers who were looking for him that day. His son still wakes up crying for him in the middle of the night. A cousin made a TikTok of P&eacute;rez dancing with his son, the overlaid text promising that they'll find him justice. There's a chance P&eacute;rez's family could obtain financial compensation, but it's a long shot. Federal law does create a path for a workers' compensation lawsuit, even for a shipyard contractor or an undocumented immigrant. Steve Wanko, a Houma workers' compensation lawyer, said he won such a case in 2015. Another lawyer filed a claim on behalf of Per&eacute;z's partner against the contractor, G-4 Services. G-4 is disputing the benefits claim, citing Per&eacute;z's ineligibility as an independent contractor, saying his partner was ineligible because they were not legally married, and claiming the sudden death of a healthy 20-year-old was not caused by his job. His death, a medical review conducted at the request of G-4 argued, 'occurred while he was working but was not caused by workplace related factors or activities.&rdquo; Reached in May outside his home, Ricky Guidroz, one of the owners of G-4 Services, declined to discuss P&eacute;rez's death, citing the advice of his lawyers. Guidroz said he had tried to reach out to P&eacute;rez's family. Guidroz's wife came by the house crying at one point, P&eacute;rez's aunt said, but they didn't really know what to say to her. 'It's so unfortunate,&rdquo; he told ProPublica. 'Just know that my heart hurts, really.&rdquo; (ProPublica also sent a detailed list of questions to G-4 Services, which didn't respond.) This October, ProPublica visited Thoma-Sea again, one month after the OSHA report excoriated the company for not protecting P&eacute;rez. At the end of the day's shift, the workers, mostly Latino, passed an Army Corps of Engineers barge, under repair just behind the shipyard's security guard shack, in groups and pairs to reach cars in the muddy parking lot. The workers filtered out to the handful of Hispanic businesses near the Port of Terrebonne to buy tortillas for the weekend and to wire money home. Some drove upwards of an hour to reach homes scattered from the New Orleans suburbs to small towns hugging Bayou Lafourche and the Atchafalaya River. Most of them would be back the next morning, to resume building America's ships.

F-35 tech problems, protracted negotiations hit Lockheed finances	Longer-than-expected negotiations over the Pentagon's next two batches of F-35s kept Lockheed Martin from collecting about $700 million last quarter, company officials said Tuesday. Lockheed hasn't been able to strike a deal for the next two production lots&mdash;18 and 19&mdash;so they've had to spend company cash to keep the production line running. 'As expected, aeronautics was down primarily due to delayed revenue recognition of approximately $700 million associated with the lapse in F-35 program funding as we continue to work through lot 18 negotiations,&rdquo; company CFO Jay Malave told investors during a third-quarter earnings call. Company executives have previously said that the price per jet will likely need to increase in lots 18 and 19, as inflation, the jet's increasing complexity, and the Pentagon's proposed cut to the planned F-35 buy are all driving costs. Malave said he expects the contract to be awarded this year. But if negotiations extend beyond the year's end, 'we could see about 3 percent, or $2 billion of our sales shift into 2025, along with associated impacts to profit and about $1 billion of free cash flow.&rdquo; The company has to continue building the jets, even in the absence of a formal agreement, because it's 'essential&rdquo; for the health of the lower-tier suppliers, CEO Jim Taiclet said. The jet builder will also have to absorb $600 million this year after the Pentagon paused the acceptance of new jets due to delays with new technology that was supposed to be loaded onto the jet, called Technology Refresh-3. After deliveries resumed, the Pentagon said it would withhold money from the company, $5 million per jet, until the full upgrade was complete. Lockheed will earn back some of that money as it reaches various milestones in TR-3 development, Malave said. 'As you go to 2025, we'll deliver more aircraft, and so we will see the benefit of having delivered more aircraft, and we will also see the benefit of having incremental withholds released, I would quantify that today at around $300 to $400 million, and then that'll then continue to flow in 2026 and beyond,&rdquo; Malave said. The jets now being delivered to the Pentagon are loaded with a 'truncated version&rdquo; of TR-3, which can be used for training but isn't fully combat-ready. U.S. officials decided to start accepting the jets without the full capability, figuring that a partial capability is better than nothing. The company was originally supposed to have TR-3 ready in April 2023. And in addition to delays, the new technology is on track to run $1 billion over budget. Lockheed executives previously said that the combat-ready TR-3 package could be ready late next spring. But the company seems to have backed away from that goal in today's earnings call. While Taiclet said '95 percent&rdquo; of combat capabilities have been validated, the company will need to complete many more tests on the new version throughout 2025 before it's ready for prime time. The interim version currently being delivered doesn't have 'some of those incremental software validations that show that all combat systems and all weapons will be able to be effectively deployed&hellip;there are a lot of test points there, and those test points are going to be developed not just in the fourth quarter, but they're going to be developed over the course of 2025 as well. Because when I say a weapon, is it an AMRAAM? Is it an AIM-9? What weapon are we talking about? There's literally dozens of weapons, and there are multiple test points on things like distributed after system, etc. So this is a complex path to what I call release two. That's the full up combat capability,&rdquo; Taiclet said. The company delivered 48 F-35s in the third quarter, and expects to deliver 90 to 110 in total this year. The company expects to deliver 180 jets per year over the next three years&mdash;a mix of new jets coming off the line and jets that were parked&mdash;so 'cash collections will smooth out over this period of time,&rdquo; Malave said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/f-35-tech-problems-protracted-negotiations-hit-lockheed-finances/400455/	2024-10-22T13:14:45-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/22/f_345_GettyImages_2175836838/large.jpg
Adversaries will aim to ‘stoke societal unrest’ after Election Da...	Foreign adversaries are intensifying efforts to influence the outcome of the Nov. 5 presidential election, and will likely amplify disinformation campaigns about election results that encourage physical violence between next month and Inauguration Day in January, intelligence officials warned Tuesday. Russia, Iran, and China 'will remain committed to trying to undermine U.S. democracy, stoke societal unrest and position their preferred candidates,&rdquo; said one official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity per ground rules of a news conference. Russia and Iran 'are probably willing to at least consider&rdquo; tactics that would incite violence, said the official. Russia prefers former president Donald Trump, while Iran prefers Vice President Kamala Harris, according to previous assessments from ODNI, which oversees U.S. intelligence programs and activities. China, meanwhile, is seeking to influence down-ballot races because neither presidential candidate has a policy agenda that caters more favorably to Beijing, the office has previously said. With just two weeks to go before Americans cast their vote, the influence efforts have accelerated. One instance that has received national attention centered on false allegations about Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, which the ODNI official called 'manipulated&rdquo; media that was generated by Russia. Intelligence analysts used a combination of internal and commercial tools to determine the video purporting to show the abuse victim speaking out was crafted by pro-Kremlin spin doctors, a different ODNI official said. The video had previously been debunked and disputed by social media users and researchers. 'Foreign-driven or -amplified violent protests, violence, or physical threats to election workers or state and local officials could challenge state and local officials' ability to conduct elements of the certification and Electoral College process, particularly if they prevent necessary physical access to facilities or venues,&rdquo; says a party redacted whitepaper released Tuesday that was declassified Oct. 16 by National Intelligence Director Avril Haines. It adds that dynamic could extend to the January 6 election certification process, which would echo the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol that followed baseless claims from then-President Donald Trump and GOP allies about his election loss being rigged. Cyber operations and other espionage techniques may be deployed day-of. Foreign hacking collectives may attempt to alter public-facing election, state government or news websites to 'promote confusion&rdquo; about results, the declassified assessment adds. The first ODNI official on the call noted that adversaries would likely refrain from hacking attempts to disrupt vote counts. Iran and Russia are behind brazen election-related hacking and disinformation attempts, U.S. law-enforcement officials say. Last month, the DOJ filed criminal charges against a trio of operatives tied to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, alleging their involvement in a hack and leak of Trump campaign documents. Russia for months has conducted sustained influence campaigns to tip the American vote in favor of Trump, according to previous assessments and legal accusations. Moscow, Tehran, and China have vehemently denied such claims.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/adversaries-will-aim-stoke-societal-unrest-after-election-day-officials-warn/400470/	2024-10-22T11:36:56-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/22/GettyImages_1195525367-1/large.jpg
What would Harris, Trump do about Russia's invasion of Ukraine?	The U.S. presidential election isn't drawing eyes only at home; Moscow and Kyiv are watching closely, too. Regardless of who wins in November, there will be significant implications for Ukraine as it continues to resist Russia in a war heading toward a fourth year. Washington's continued support is seen by some as no less than an existential issue for Ukraine. Without U.S. arms and aid, it is unlikely that the nation would be able to continue repelling its larger, better-armed neighbor. During the presidential debate on Sept. 10, 2024, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Republican contender Donald Trump had a chance to clarify their positions on Ukraine. Trump evaded ABC moderator David Muir's question regarding the importance of Ukraine's victory over Russia, twice. Instead, he repeated his long-standing line that he would achieve a negotiated peace quickly &ndash; even before taking office as president. At the same debate, Harris dismissed the idea of Trump negotiating with 'a dictator who would eat you for lunch.&rdquo; She instead emphasized the Biden policy to support Ukraine 'as long as it takes&rdquo; in concert with U.S. allies. But detail has been light on what either candidate would actually do to support Ukraine and end the war. So, what do we know about each candidate's approach to Ukraine based on their records? Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Trump has repeatedly stated that ending the war is in the U.S.'s best interests and that he can end the war quickly. In fact, Trump is certain that had he remained president after the 2020 election, Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have invaded &ndash; an unsubstantiated claim he repeated during the Sept. 10 presidential debate. Trump has often reiterated that both Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy respect him, and he would be able to use his 'good relationship&rdquo; with both to bring them to the negotiating table and end the war. Yet, Trump's record on his relationships with Zelenskyy and Putin is rather complicated. Trump's admiration for Putin is well documented and dates back to his first presidential run in 2016, sparking numerous investigations and reports of collusion. Most recently, Bob Woodward reported that Trump secretly sent COVID-19 tests to Putin in the midst of a pandemic shortage, a claim confirmed by the Kremlin. Trump's relationship with Zelenskyy is similarly laden with baggage. A 2019 phone call between the two men, during which Trump pressured Ukraine's president to open a criminal investigation into Joe Biden, led to Trump's impeachment. In exchange, Ukraine would have received continued U.S. support for the country's defense against Russia, which had been waging a proxy war in eastern regions of Ukraine since 2014. During the subsequent hearings in Congress, one of Trump's aides testified that 'Trump did not give a sh*t about Ukraine&rdquo; and was only interested in his own political gains. Standing next to Zelenskyy during a meeting at the Trump Tower on Sept. 27, 2024&mdash;their first meeting since Sept. 25, 2019&mdash;Trump said he was sure that both Zelenskyy and Putin are interested in peace and that a 'very fair&rdquo; and 'rapid&rdquo; deal is possible. When asked what that deal might entail, Trump responded that it's 'too early&rdquo; to discuss details and that both he and Zelenskyy have 'their own ideas.&rdquo; While the Republican candidate has not been explicit on the details of negotiations or possible conditions, some of his proxies have voiced proposals. Trump's vice presidential pick, JD Vance, has laid out a plan that includes potential land concessions on the part of Ukraine and the creation of a demilitarized zone along the battle lines of the Russian-occupied territory of eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, Trump's son Donald Jr. co-authored a piece with former presidential candidate-turned-Trump ally Robert F Kennedy Jr., arguing that a concession to Russian demands for 'Ukrainian neutrality and a halt to NATO's eastward expansion&rdquo; were reasonable to avoid a nuclear game of chicken. Although these have not been echoed in Trump's own statements on Ukraine, both men have the ear of the Republican candidate. These plans have been criticized as closely resembling those of the Kremlin. Before meeting with Trump in New York, Zelenskyy had also criticized Vance's plan and expressed doubts that Trump and his team really know how to end the war. Harris has been harshly critical of Trump's approach to Ukraine. 'They are not proposals for peace,&rdquo; Harris said in response to suggestions that Ukraine cede territory for peace. 'Instead they are proposals for surrender,&rdquo; she added. Such views are in line with Harris' record. As part of the Biden administration, Harris has given vocal support to Ukraine's fight for political sovereignty and territorial integrity. At the onset of the full-scale invasion in early 2022, Harris traveled to Europe to help shore up a coalition of European allies to support Ukraine. As vice president, Harris has repeatedly condemned Russian war crimes in Ukraine. In February 2023, while attending the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, she announced that the U.S. has determined that Russian actions in Ukraine amounted to 'crimes against humanity,&rdquo; affirming U.S. commitment to the international rule of law. Along with continued support, the U.S. has provided substantial aid for Ukraine, totaling US$61.3 billion in military aid since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The Biden administration also has said that rising costs and keeping pressure on Russia through sanctions are important mechanisms to keep Moscow accountable. Harris reiterated this need to maintain sanctions and broad coalition support for Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference in February 2024 and again in June at the peace summit organized by Ukraine in Switzerland. As a presidential candidate, Harris has openly signaled her commitment to supporting Kyiv&mdash;not only for Ukraine's survival but for the collective security of NATO allies and the U.S. itself. Harris emphasized this point in the September debate, suggesting that Ukraine was not Putin's final stop and that he has 'his eyes on the rest of Europe, starting with Poland.&rdquo; Standing next to Zelenskyy in Washington on Sept. 26, 2024, Harris reiterated the point: 'The United States supports Ukraine not out of charity, but because it's in our strategic interest.&rdquo; Yet, White House policy on Ukraine has been criticized for being slow and hesitant in supplying weaponry. The U.S. has imposed rules on the use of heavy weaponry against targets inside Russia. Furthermore, the U.S. has so far been reticent on Ukraine's invitation to join NATO, which is seen as crucial for any lasting peace in Kyiv. How Harris' White House would differ from Biden's on these issues is not clear. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, the U.S. Congress has passed five bills that provide aid to Ukraine, totaling US$175 billion. However, a six-month delay in aid in early 2024 highlighted growing partisan tension in Congress over continued aid to Ukraine. The composition of Congress after the November election is another unknown factor in Washington's support for Ukraine. Zelenskyy met with congressional leaders during his visit to the U.S. in September, but notably absent was Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who in the past has shown reluctance to support continued funding. For the large part, support for Ukraine remains bipartisan in Congress and among American voters. Yet there is a risk the election could further politicize the issue. And the outcome of November's vote could determine whether U.S. efforts focus more on pushing for a negotiated deal or ongoing support for Ukraine.

The D Brief: Kyiv’s big EU loan; F-35 readiness still low; Crash ...	European lawmakers approved a &euro;35 billion loan for Kyiv, with the money set 'to be repaid with future revenues from frozen Russian assets,&rdquo; officials from the Strasbourg, France-based body announced Tuesday. The loan follows through on an agreement forged by G7 members in June. Where the money comes from: 'Approximately &euro;210 billion in assets from the Central Bank of Russia are held in the EU and remain frozen under sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,&rdquo; the European Parliament said. EU members have elected to use that money to support Ukraine's military as well as reconstruction efforts across the invaded country. To be clear, officials are 'not confiscating sovereign Russian assets in Europe, but using the profits and interest accrued from them,&rdquo; the BBC reports. The Brits are contributing nearly $3 billion of those funds for Ukraine's military. Fine print: The $37.8 billion loan 'is conditional upon Ukraine's continued commitment to uphold effective democratic mechanisms, respect human rights, and further policy conditions to be set out in a memorandum of understanding.&rdquo; More from the EU, here.

On this day in 1707, the British Royal Navy suffered one of its worst disasters at sea when four warships ran aground in poor weather off the Isles of Scilly, killing at least 1,400 sailors. Developing: Officials in South Korea are openly considering arming Ukraine with lethal weapons, which Seoul has not done yet, the Guardian reports. 'We would consider supplying weapons for defensive purposes as part of the step-by-step scenarios, and if it seems they are going too far, we might also consider offensive use,&rdquo; the presidential official told reporters Tuesday. South Korea could also send monitors inside Ukraine to more closely track 'the tactics and combat capabilities of North Korean special forces dispatched in support of Russia,&rdquo; Yonhap news agency reported Tuesday, citing an intelligence source. The possible moves come in response to North Korean special forces training inside Russia for possible deployment against Ukraine. South Korea is sending a team of intelligence and military officials to NATO headquarters in Brussels some time over the next few days to detail their findings, according to Yonhap. That's expected to be one of a possible series of 'phased measures&rdquo; Seoul is pondering in response to the North Korean developments. From Seoul's perspective, 'North Korea will expect a generous payoff from Moscow in return for its troop contribution,&rdquo; the country's Ambassador to the UN Joonkook Hwang said Monday. 'It could be either military or financial assistance. It could be nuclear weapons-related technology,&rdquo; he said in New York. Tactical considerations: 'If North Koreans have to call for air support and artillery fire, language and procedural differences will be a challenge,&rdquo; retired Australian Army Maj. Gen. Mick Ryan writes in his blog. 'Will they operate fully integrated within Russian formations and be subject to the full command of Russian commanders? Or will they be under a form of operational command or control with caveats on their employment, such as not being used as meat troops?&rdquo; A bit more, here. Meanwhile on the battlefield, 'Russian forces continue to systematically perpetrate war crimes, including the continued executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war and use of chemical weapons,&rdquo; including chloropicrin, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War writes in its latest Ukraine assessment published Monday. And perhaps unsurprisingly, 'There is no evidence that Russia is holding Russian personnel accountable for the violations of the laws of war that have been reported,&rdquo; ISW reports. Update: Ukraine's population has fallen by 10 million since Russia invaded in February 2022, with 6.7 million refugees living abroad, a United Nations official said Tuesday. Making matters worse, Ukraine now has the lowest birth rate in the world, according to Florence Bauer, the U.N. Population Fund's Eastern European chief. Reuters has a tiny bit more. Overnight Russian drone strikes killed at least three people, including a child in the northeastern city of Sumy, according to President Zelenskyy. ICYMI: Ukrainian officials claim to have assassinated a Russian officer believed to be responsible for a cruise missile attack on a shopping center in the city of Kremenchuk in June 2022. That attack killed 22 people. The officer, Col. Dmitry Golenkov, served in Russia's 52nd heavy bomber regiment. He was reportedly 'found bludgeoned to death with a hammer&hellip;outside the village of Suponevo in the Bryansk region of Russia,&rdquo; according to the Telegraph, reporting Monday.

Researchers sound alarm on dual-use AI for defense	A growing number of Silicon Valley AI companies want to do business with the military, making the case that the time and effort they've put into training large neural networks on vast amounts of data could provide the military new capabilities. But a study out today from a group of prominent AI scholars argues that dual-use AI tools would increase the odds of innocent civilians becoming targets due to bad data&mdash;and that the tools could easily be gamed by adversaries. In the paper, published by the AI Now Institute, authors Heidy Khlaaf, Sarah Myers West, and Meredith Whittaker point out the growing interest in commercial AI models&mdash;sometimes called foundation models&mdash;for military purposes, particularly for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance. They argue that while concerns around AI's potential for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons dominate the conversation, big commercial foundation models already pose underappreciated risks to civilians. Some companies pitching foundation model-based AI to the military are 'proposing commercial models that already have been pre-trained on a set of commercial data. They are not talking about military-exclusive commercial models that have been purely trained on military data,&rdquo; Khlaaf told Defense One. The problem lies in how these foundation models are trained: on large amounts of publicly available data, often including personal data that has made its way to the web via data brokers or regular websites and services. 'Data is the fundamental issue here. It causes a huge amount of concerns and vulnerabilities, and it's not being accounted for when we talk about things like traceability broadly,&rdquo; said Whittaker, who currently serves as president of the Signal Foundation. These neural nets don't use reasoning like a human would. Other research has shown they are essentially doing pattern matching on a huge scale, finding combinations of words to create statistically-sound extrapolations of what words might come next, or taking data points on millions of individuals and drawing correlation connections between them (as opposed to causative connections.) Foundation models perform well in scenarios where the cost of false positives is low, such as trying to come up with interesting points for a research paper or a list of people to market a product to. [[Related Posts]] Applied to military contexts&mdash;specifically the task of surveilling a population for potential targets&mdash;the cost of a false positive could be an innocent life. Some militaries, such as Israel, through its Where's Daddy and Lavender programs, are already employing pattern-extrapolating foundation models to assemble target lists. That's contributing to the normalization of these tools for targeting in warfare, the authors say. A report from Israel-based publication +972 found that the error rate for Lavender alone was near 10 percent. Speaking of Israeli use of AI in its Gaza operations (and beyond) Khlaaf said 'We're seeing... data being pulled from WhatsApp, metadata, right? We're seeing data pulled from Google Photos and other sources, of course, that we're unaware of and haven't really been covered. So the data is inaccurate and [the models] sort of attempt to find patterns that may not exist, like being in a WhatsApp group with a&hellip;Hamas member should not qualify you for [a death] sentence. But in this case, that is what we're observing.&rdquo; Said Whittaker, these Israeli tools function based 'on surveillance of a given population, right? One of the reasons Ukraine can't implement systems with the type of characteristics of Lavender and Where's Daddy is they don't have that very fine-grain population-level surveillance data, of say, all of Russia's population. So you see here the role of personal information in informing systems that then use these data models.&rdquo; This problem is one reason the Defense Department puts such an emphasis on 'traceability of data&rdquo; in its AI ethics principles. As Defense One has reported, the Defense Department's AI principals list is considerably more detailed and specific than similar AI ethics guidelines from Silicon Valley companies. But it's also a voluntary framework, and the Defense Department has given itself work arounds. The authors argue that a self-adopted ethical framework doesn't protect civilians against commercial AI models that are trained on personal data, especially when the government seems willing to make exceptions for commercial AI tools. Said West: 'We've seen this propensity, you know, even like the introduction of fast-tracking Fed RAMP in order to promote rapid adoption of generative AI use cases, the creation of these carve outs, which is why these sort of voluntary frameworks and higher order principles are insufficient, particularly where we're dealing with uses that are very much life-or-death stakes, and where the consequences for civilians are very significant.&rdquo; Even the Navy's chief information officer, Jane Rathbun, has said commercial foundation models are 'not recommended for operational use cases.&rdquo; Adoption of these models by the Defense Department would also introduce vulnerabilities into operations, they argue, since publicly-available data can be gamed or manipulated by adversaries. 'The ubiquitous and unfettered use of web-scale datasets for training commercial foundation models has led to the exploitation and use of several avenues that allow adversarial actors to execute poisoning attacks &lsquo;that guarantee malicious examples will appear in web-scale datasets,'&rdquo; the paper notes. That broadens the ramifications of the paper's findings beyond the question of what tools the Defense Department may or may not adopt. In an era where such tools are increasingly commonplace, the personal data of American civilians becomes a national strategic vulnerability. And the Biden White House's executive orders on bulk meta data collection and safe AI don't go far enough to keep Americans' data out of the hands of adversaries armed with similar models, the authors said. However, Whittaker said, the broadening of U.S. privacy laws to more effectively cover personal data 'could actually be hugely beneficial in reducing adversarial access to the type of personal data that, one, is used to train [large language models] and, two, is extractable via exactly the kinds of attacks Heidi [Khlaaf] has studied, to which there are no current remediations.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/researchers-sound-alarm-dual-use-ai-defense/400432/	2024-10-22T03:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/21/GettyImages_1206412761/large.jpg
How two units are learning from each other as the Army moves to m...	When Col. Josh Glonek has a question about how to use the mountain of new technology the Army is sending his way, he knows just who to ask: Col. James Stultz. That's because Stultz has been there&mdash;since April, his unit has been learning how best to use the dozens of drones, various electronic warfare systems, and new comms gear given to them as part of a major Army modernization effort dubbed 'transformation-in-contact.&rdquo; Now, they can pass on that knowledge to new brigades. 'They should not have to learn any of the lessons that we learned,&rdquo; Stultz said. Announced in February, 'transformation-in-contact&rdquo; consists of the Army giving three brigades an assortment of tech inspired in part by the war in Ukraine&mdash;then letting those units figure out what works and what doesn't.. The three brigades are Stultz's 101st Airborne 2nd Brigade, the 25th Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade, and Glonek's 10th Mountain Division's 3rd Brigade. As the Army presses ahead with its effort, including expanding it to four more brigades, units already in the program are sharing what they've learned. In a joint interview with Glonek and Stultz during the Association of the U.S. Army's annual Washginton conference, the commanders also said they are using their work to identify more modernization needs for the future. The first in line Stultz's 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, is furthest along in the transformation process, having tested out new gear and organizational concepts during an August rotation to one of the Army's most realistic combat training centers. The 2nd Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division recently completed a tour at a similar center in the Pacific, while Glonek's 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division has a tour to a Europe-based center coming up this winter. Stultz said his brigade's rotation through the Joint Readiness Training Center showed some of the equipment is working well. Transporting soldiers with the new Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV), a quiet, nine-seat vehicle based on a pick-up truck design, is 'huge,&rdquo; Stultz said. 'The ISV can get things where other vehicles just can't.&rdquo; That flexibility means his unit can pop up where the enemy least expects it. During the exercise, Stultz's brigade executed what he called a 'bold flanking maneuver&rdquo; right past the noses of the U.S. forces playing their enemy. '[The enemy roleplayers] had no idea where we were&mdash;because we could go a long way, very fast, and move a lot of people,&rdquo; he said. Soldiers from the 2nd Brigade are now using the vehicle to help assist in Hurricane Helene relief efforts. [[Related Posts]] Stultz also praised the unit's communications gear, which allowed him to run satellite comms, radio traffic, and other forms of communication from a cell phone. 'Having the ability to use my cell phone as a [satellite] phone was a game changer,&rdquo; Stultz said. Stultz also noted the success of a program called Shrike AI, formerly known as Sentinel AI. The program automatically detects objects in drone feeds and sends the coordinates to the Army's artillery-coordinating software, the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System. The system also calculates targeting adjustments based on where it sees an artillery round strike. The program 'cuts about a minute,&rdquo; off the time it takes to coordinate an artillery strike, Stultz said. 'It is a game changer.&rdquo; Data exhaust The fielding program is intended to quickly reveal what works and what doesn't so the Army can adjust, and Stultz said it has already raised some new questions for his unit. One challenge, he said, is that having dozens of drones creates a significant amount of data that someone must comb through for relevant information. It's particularly difficult when soldiers are already stressed out, hungry, and tired, and they may fail to spot enemy vehicles hidden in the hours of drone footage. But incorporating object detection into the drones would help observers sort through the visual clutter: 'We have got to put some sort of robot in between the feed and the operator,&rdquo; he said. Stultz's unit currently lacks the ability to easily stream drone footage back to its command posts, as drone operators do in Ukraine. But he said he prefers not to stream video anyway, as it could be a distraction. Instead, he wants tools that would alert soldiers when an enemy vehicle had been detected. 'More people don't need to see the feed&mdash;we just need the data on it,&rdquo; he said. Glonek agreed, pointing out that more automation would mean fewer people in a command post, which could make the command post harder for enemy forces to spot. Stultz also learned another lesson about command posts: During its August training exercise, the brigade operated two. One was smaller and another larger, which combined administrative, logistic, and planning functions. The larger command post just had too much going on, Stultz said. 'Everybody [was] talking right next to each other, and they can't think,&rdquo; he said. Next time, Stultz wants to set up three command posts: 'one can be administration, logistics, one could be plans, and then the other is current operations.&rdquo; The last in the process All those lessons are now filtering to Glonek, who is getting his troops ready for a winter rotation to a similarly realistic combat training center in Europe. The two talk frequently about how best to use their communications network, and the best way to do electromagnetic deception, Glonek said. Glonek has also set up a company in every battalion that pairs a drone platoon with reconnaissance and mortar units, similar to how Stultz arranged his forces. Stultz's drone-enabled company is dubbed the 'Multi-Purpose Company,&rdquo; while Glonek's units are called 'Strike&rdquo; companies. Though the two brigades' capabilities are similar, there are some differences. For example, Glonek's brigade lacks Stultz's Multi-Functional Reconnaissance Company (MFRC), a drone and electronic-warfare heavy company capable of dwelling deep behind enemy lines and identifying targets. 'It'll be a big learning objective for the Army to understand what he was able to achieve, with the MFRC, versus what I'm able to achieve, which will be through the use of technology, not an actual ground formation,&rdquo; Glonek said. And the Army is also considering changes to the MFRC, Stultz said, noting the unit 'comes at a cost.&rdquo; 'We're trying to look at multiple options as an Army, of like, OK, could we do it without it, or do we need it?&rdquo; he said. Glonek's brigade will come to their winter training exercise loaded with even more drones than Stultz did&mdash;including what Glonek called 'massive amounts&rdquo; of small drones. Every platoon will get three short-range drones, for a total of 145 small drones across the brigade, Glonek said. Those drones will be from Skydio, the current drone provider of the Army's Short Range Reconnaissance Program. Inspired by observations from Ukraine, the unit will also equip some of its small drones with bomb release mechanisms. The mechanisms are 3D printed based on a design from a NATO-backed effort, Glonek said. The Army has also given the brigade $5 million to buy medium-range reconnaissance drones to equip the Strike company's drone platoon. These systems will allow the drone platoons to fly longer and farther. In September, the Army chose two systems for tranche one of its medium-range drone program: Anduril's Ghost X and Performance Drone Works' C-100. The brigade will also bring a drone capable of automatically tracking enemy vehicles, Glonek said. Before deploying, the brigade will upload images of the vehicles used by the forces playing their adversary. If the drone finds an 'enemy&rdquo; vehicle along the predetermined route, it will then send a picture, the vehicle's coordinates, and other info back to the command post, Glonek said. Glonek's unit will likely need bigger, more substantial command posts than the 101st, because of Europe's freezing winter temperatures. 'It's hard to get into a super small, austere command post&rdquo; in winter, he said. It will also do deception operations differently. Stultz's troops brought along miniature computers meant to broadcast as if they were devices in a command post, which was sufficient because they knew the forces playing their enemies relied on detecting electronic emissions. Glonek, though, knows the soldiers playing the enemy at the European center are likely to check out suspected 10th Mountain positions by drone. He'll therefore need to also set up fake physical sites, and said, which he will likely do by setting up tents or designating a radar, since it can be wheeled around easily. Still, there are trade-offs, Glonek said: the more realistic the unit makes the fake sites, the more soldiers must do to set them up, which could draw the enemy's attention. Regardless, Glonek knows he can always go to Stultz for what to do&mdash;and what not to do. 'We're on a pyramid of innovation,&rdquo; Stulz said. 'What we did was kind of that base layer.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/how-two-units-are-learning-each-other-army-moves-modernize/400431/	2024-10-21T15:49:04-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/21/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_12.31.35PM/large.png
F-35s still missing readiness goals—despite rising spending	The F-35 program has failed to meet a key readiness metric for six straight years, despite a steady increase in spending to operate and maintain the aircraft, according to a new report from a government watchdog agency. The Pentagon spent more than $12 billion to operate and maintain the F-35 fleet from fiscal 2018 to 2023, according to the GAO. But the three F-35 variants were not alone. Seven of the Pentagon's other tactical aircraft programs also failed to meet mission-capable goals for six years straight, and the other five programs missed the target three to five of the last six years. The mission capable rate is the percentage of time during which the aircraft can fly and perform at least one of its tasked missions. 'None of the 15 tactical aircraft variants met their mission-capable goals in fiscal year 2023. Only two&mdash;the F-15C and the F-16C&mdash;met their annual goals in at least half of the years since fiscal year 2018,&rdquo; the GAO said. The F-35 Joint Program Office launched an effort last year to fix the aircraft's poor mission capable rates, called the 'War on Readiness.&rdquo; The program's goal was to increase the fleetwide F-35 mission capable rate by 10 percent by the end of March 2024. However, officials said readiness only rose 2.6 percent within that year, up to 55.7 percent. 'We're not where we need to be on our mission-capable rates, but we have put the elements, I think, into the system that has shown us a path of how we can get there,&rdquo; Lt. Gen. Michael Schmidt, F-35 program executive officer, told reporters last month. Of the 40 previous 'top degraders&rdquo; of readiness, 21 are no longer at the top, Schmidt said in September. But two main problems are still dragging down F-35 readiness, officials say. JPO won't disclose what those two problems are, but Schmidt told Congress in April that if the program can overcome them, the fleetwide mission capable rate would increase to more than 70 percent. [[Related Posts]] The F-35 has long had a rash of sustainment problems, including delays in depot maintenance, spare parts shortages, heavy reliance on contractors, and lack of access to technical data for repairs. Lockheed Martin currently leads and manages sustainment, but that has left the Pentagon with 'limited decision-making ability and influence over depot maintenance,&rdquo; GAO has said. The company will have to relinquish some control over sustainment in the coming years, after lawmakers in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act formally required the military services to take over management of F-35 sustainment by 2027. The total cost of operating and maintaining the triservice jet is expected to surpass $1.5 trillion, according to GAO. From start to finish, the F-35 program is estimated to reach a total cost of $2 trillion.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/f-35s-still-missing-readiness-goalsdespite-rising-spending/400424/	2024-10-21T13:39:16-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/21/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_10.27.57AM/large.png
The D Brief: Russia increases drone strikes; US troops attacked i...	Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin visited Ukraine to announce a new $400 million U.S. weapons pledge Monday. Austin's trip, his fourth as defense secretary, comes as the rate of daily Russian drone attacks have reportedly risen nearly threefold over the past two months heading into winter. At least 116 Russian drones targeted locations across the invaded country, including 10 sent to the capital city from several directions and in different waves over about five hours, military official Serhiy Popko said on Telegram. Panning out: Russian drone attacks in Ukraine 'have increased from 350 strikes in July, to 750 in August, to 1,500 in September,&rdquo; the New York Times reports, citing two Western officials. Austin met with President Volodymir Zelenskyy to discuss 'Ukraine's air defense capabilities, preparations for the winter period, and the expansion of long-range weapon use against Russian military targets,&rdquo; Zelenskyy wrote on social media, thanking the White House as well as 'both parties in the U.S. Congress, and the American people for all their support.&rdquo; Developing: Estonia is looking to acquire weapons and gear to hit an invading force before it reaches the country's borders, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reported this weekend. Officials in Tallinn are also considering boosting their spending on anti-air defenses, perhaps short-range man-portable missiles or longer-range interceptors, the head of Estonia's defense procurement office said. Details, here. NATO chief Mark Rutte called South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Monday, both officials confirmed afterward. Driving that conversation: Recent allegations North Korea has sent around 1,500 special forces to Russia for use against Ukraine. Rutte: 'North Korea sending troops to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine would mark a significant escalation,&rdquo; the new alliance chief said on social media Monday. Yoon: 'Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the reckless military alignment between Russia and North Korea once again confirm that the security of the Indo-Pacific region and the Atlantic region are inextricably linked,&rdquo; the South Korean leader said in a statement. 'This undermines the rules-based international order, threatening peace on the Korean Peninsula and globally, and the government will never stand by and let this happen,&rdquo; he wrote. Expert reax: 'Manpower is likely the single most important factor in the war,&rdquo; said Rob Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. 'If Ukraine's mobilization numbers continue to decrease and Russia can sustain its monthly recruitment efforts (including possibly with North Korean soldiers), the situation will continue to deteriorate unless Ukraine's foreign partners can provide greater support,&rdquo; he warned on social media Saturday.

If you recall a year ago or so, he spoke about a second Trump term being about retribution. So, yes, I think we should take those words seriously,&rdquo; the former defense secretary told CNN last week. Members of the military should think carefully about how they would react to such orders, observers said. 'If he wins [the] election, the military will be asked to do things that violate their oath of office&mdash;the oath they swear to the Constitution. And what are they going to do?

Trump’s radical view would test the military	How might Donald Trump use the U.S. military if he returned to the Oval Office? Against his political enemies, he says. That's not a warning from his former defense secretary, who has documented the then-president's interest in shooting protestors, nor from the man he appointed chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has since called him 'the most dangerous person to this country.&rdquo; Those are the GOP presidential candidate's own words. Members of the military should think carefully now about how they would react to such orders, observers said. In an extraordinary escalation of rhetoric, Trump suggested the deployment of the National Guard or military against what he terms 'the enemy from within,' which he said included members of his political opposition. The remarks, aired during an Oct. 13 interview on Fox, mark an unprecedented departure from any major-party presidential candidate's publicly evinced view of the role of the military in domestic politics. Trump, asked whether he anticipated Election Day unrest, dismissed concerns about his own supporters and turned his focus to the political opposition, declaring that 'radical left lunatics' posed the true threat. His proposed solution? 'It should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen,&rdquo; he said. The interview Elsewhere in the Oct. 13 interview, Trump also named a former political antagonist as an 'enemy from within.&rdquo; When Fox's Maria Bartiromo asked, 'How are you going to guard against the bureaucrats undermining you?&rdquo;, he responded: 'Well, I always say we have two enemies. We have the outside enemy and then we have the enemy from within, and the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia, and all these countries because if you have a smart president he can handle them pretty easily. I handled&mdash;I got along great with all with&mdash;I handled them. [Much evidence suggests otherwise.] But the thing that's tougher to handle are these lunatics we got inside like Adam Schiff, Adam Shifty Schiff. Thing is this guy's going to be a senator. He's running against a guy who doesn't understand politics at all. Garvey. But he was a good baseball player. But he doesn't understand politics at all. Adam Shifty Schiff, who's a total sleazebag, is gonna become a senator. I call him the enemy from within. You look at the danger he put our country in, potentially, because of Russia with a phony made-up deal that he made up with Hillary and some bad people....&rdquo; Trump was apparently referring to his 2019 impeachment, when he was tried in the Senate for attempting to gin up political dirt by withholding military aid to Ukraine and for allegedly blocking Congressional investigations. Then-Rep. Schiff, D-California, led the House presentation of evidence. He might also have been alluding to the GOP-led Senate investigation that documented 'hundreds of actions by Trump, his campaign, and his associates in the run-up to the 2016 election that involve some degree of participation by Trump or his associates in Russian activity,&rdquo; as Lawfare put it. Trump has long threatened to use state power for personal revenge&mdash;for example, to 'lock up' Hillary Clinton, jail social-media CEOs, and prosecute a wide range of other people, from election workers to the federal and state prosecutors who have charged him with crimes. But by suggesting that domestic political rivals pose an existential threat akin to foreign enemies, he sets up his case for military action. It's a well-worn tactic of authoritarians, whose language Trump apes and whose policies he admires, right down to his stated desire to become a dictator. (Only 'on day one,&rdquo; he said, echoing would-be autocrats' usual promise to resume normal governance at some point.) And Trump has long called for using troops domestically. During his presidency, he repeatedly talked about sending the National Guard to deal with civil unrest, such as the protests following the killing of George Floyd. (Notably, he did not send in the Guard when his supporters stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021.) As a candidate, Trump has vowed to use the military inside America. 'As he has sought a return to power, he has made clear that he intends to use the military for a range of domestic law enforcement purposes, including patrolling the border, suppressing protests that he deems to have turned into riots and even fighting crime in big cities run by Democrats,&rdquo; the New York Times wrote in August. The decline of guardrails Such actions would not necessarily be illegal. Constitutionally, Congress may authorize the deployment of the militia 'to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.&rdquo; With the 1807 Insurrection Act, lawmakers broadly delegated this authorization to the U.S. president, who may call out the troops if 'any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy&rdquo; hinders the execution of state or federal law. (And the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act does not bar the use of troops for law enforcement 'in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.&rdquo;) But the Insurrection Act has been used to deploy troops just twice since the 1960s. 'Why the reticence in using this law?&rdquo; Elizabeth Goitein of Brennan Center wrote in 2020. 'Simply, Americans don't like the idea of armored tanks rolling into their cities. It smacks of authoritarianism; it goes against our values and our national self-concept. And so, even in cases where the Insurrection Act might provide a legal opening&mdash;for instance, in the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina&mdash;the fear of political blowback has been enough to stop presidents from exploiting it.&rdquo; Today, it's not clear that any legal opening is even necessary, thanks to the Supreme Court's recent decision to grant the U.S. president immunity from criminal acts in the conduct of official duties. 'It's almost impossible to conceive of any presidential use of the military as unofficial or private business,&rdquo; National Defense University professor Gregory Foster wrote in a recent op-ed. (One former acting vice chief of the National Guard said it would be easy for a president to turn Guard units into his 'personal police force.&rdquo; Randy Manner, a retired Army two-star, told CNN recently that if Trump found one state governor to go along, he could authorize funds to 'use the National Guard almost in any way that he wants...Most Americans don't know how very easy it would be for an unhinged president to use the military against our own citizens.&rdquo;) Far from worrying about political blowback for sounding authoritarian, Trump is making political hay of it. In 2016, a voter's inclination toward authoritarianism was a better predictor of support for Trump's candidacy than race, gender, or education. Four years later, a quartet of surveys found that some 18 percent of Americans were highly disposed to authoritarianism, and 'a further 23 percent or so are just one step below them on the authoritarian scale,&rdquo; wrote political scientist Matthew MacWilliams. 'When activated by fear, authoritarian-leaning Americans are predisposed to trade civil liberties for strongman solutions to secure law and order; and they are ready to strip civil liberties from those defined as the &lsquo;other.'&rdquo; Who does Trump call the 'other&rdquo;? Immigrants and minority groups, to be sure, but as of this week, also members of the opposition political party. His statements raise the prospect that U.S. troops might be deployed against Americans dubbed 'the enemy&rdquo; for voicing opposition to a president. Mark Esper, who served as defense secretary under Trump, says his former boss intends to do so. 'He's spoken about this before. If you recall a year ago or so, he spoke about a second Trump term being about retribution. So, yes, I think we should take those words seriously,&rdquo; Esper told CNN this week. What happens if he does give the order? The U.S. military, which spends the vast majority of its time contemplating and preparing for contingencies, should prepare for this one as well. Echoing scholars of authoritarianism, NDU's Foster suggests troops and commanders contemplate their moral, ethical, and legal duties now. MacWilliams agrees. 'If he wins [the] election, the military will be asked to do things that violate their oath of office&mdash;the oath they swear to the Constitution. And what are they going to do? They need to think about it ahead of time,&rdquo; he said in a recent interview. 'If Trump wins, the military will decide the future of this country by the actions that it takes.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/trumps-radical-view-would-test-military/400385/	2024-10-18T12:04:20-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/18/trump_GettyImages_2178637365/large.jpg
Estonia considering missiles, drones that can strike inside Russi...	Estonia is looking to acquire weapons and gear to hit an invading force before it reaches the country's borders, the head of its defense procurement office says. 'With our current investments and the additional investments into defense, we actually look to attain the ability to do deep strikes into enemy territory and&hellip; effective shaping operations,&rdquo; Magnus-Valdemar Saar, director of the Centre for Defence Investment, told Defense One in an interview this week. Ukraine, after years of pleading with the White House for long-range ATACMS missiles, received in April is now pleading to be allowed to use them to hit targets deeper inside of Russia. ATACMS have a range of 300 kilometers. 'We have learned from this conflict [in Ukraine] that you need to be able to conduct your shaping operations really effectively, meaning that you need to carry the effects deep to enemies,&rdquo; Saar said. 'If we look at operational level from, you know, brigades, division, you cannot just have a close fight anymore&rdquo; with anti-tank weapons and the like. 'You need to carry the effects deeper. You need to start shaping&rdquo;&mdash;that is, taking out enemy forces before they reach the front line. Saar didn't say just what that could entail, only that 'deep&rdquo; was a matter somewhat of subjective opinion. Estonia has already announced plans to create a loitering munitions unit, which Saar said will reach initial operating capability by the end of the year, flying drones with a range of about 100 kilometers, he said. The country has also announced a contract to purchase Vulcano 155 guided munitions from Diehl and have purchased six High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, launchers along with Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, or GMLRS, rockets. HIMARS can also fire ATACMS rockets. Related to that, said Saar, they are also considering the purchase of new capabilities in Intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance. 'It's just not about the effectors that can fly, maybe, I don't know, 300 kilometers, like the ATACMS missile but also, you know, if you're striking that far, you need to know where the target is. You need to be quite precise.&rdquo; Saar said Estonia must move more quickly than NATO to bolster its own national defense. 'This discussion, the [NATO Defense Planning] process, is rather lengthy, and this discussion&ndash;who will provide what forces for the plans&ndash;is also ongoing, So it will take some time to have clarity on those issues,&rdquo; he said. Saar described NDP discussions as 'well-synched&rdquo; but added that the presence of a defensive alliance doesn't lessen the need for Estonia to move rapidly to acquire new weapons as well. The country may also boost spending on anti-air defenses, perhaps short-range man-portable missiles or longer-range interceptors, he said. 'As part of our next cycle for for defense planning, up to year 2035, we will at least consider&hellip;we will at least go through the exercise, of looking at having something even longer range than the IRIS-T,&rdquo; a German air defense system from Diehl with a range of 40 kilometers, which Estonia already has. Such decisions would depend on affordability, he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/estonia-considering-missiles-drones-can-strike-inside-russia/400383/	2024-10-18T10:46:28-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/18/GettyImages_824113280/large.jpg
How to do autonomous flight right	It seems like military-grade autonomous flight technologies are being announced every other week. But that breakneck pace should actually cause concern. Simply put, too many of these touted solutions prioritize announcing demos in a sandbox over nailing the true fundamentals. If we don't build and scale autonomous flight the correct way, American warfighters and our national security could pay a severe price. To their credit, the Defense Department is putting out crystal-clear demand signals: autonomy is the future of air power. Last year's Exercise Mobility Guardian 23 proved that maximizing endurance and optimizing pilots' time will be essential in Indo-Pacific conflicts. Air Force Special Operations Command is working to use more unmanned aircraft under its Adaptive Airborne Enterprise concept, and not a year after the announcement of the widely discussed collaborative combat aircraft program, major awards are already being awarded. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall has been an ardent advocate for autonomous flight: 'It's a security risk not to have it. At this point, we have to have it.&rdquo; Autonomy has seen a surge of investment in recent years, with hundreds of millions of dollars pouring into the development of new technologies. As a result, a myriad of cutting-edge solutions have flooded the market. But as someone who has spent over six years laser-focused on this challenge&mdash;my company Merlin is working to create a non-human pilot that's able to fly a wide variety of aircraft&mdash;I'm concerned that too many companies are in a cycle of splashy marketing moments rather than electing to adhere to two critical tenets. First, many of the technologies rolling out today are far too narrow for practical use. They ignore the basic aviate, navigate, and communicate functionality needed to safely execute a mission. Take remotely piloted solutions. Their effectiveness still hinges on a human-operator link, which can be severed by electronic warfare, communication malfunctions, or even bad weather. In contested or degraded environments, these limitations present enormous operational risks, and not just to the mission itself. True functional autonomy requires systems that don't need a human in the loop and can seamlessly perform all aviation, navigation, and communication functions independently. But functional autonomy solutions alone are not enough. To create a truly effective autonomous package, they must be coupled with tactical skills: dogfighting, swarming, EW, etc. In an ideal world, the customer would integrate functional and tactical autonomy together, but this is incredibly difficult to do&mdash;maybe impossible. The interdependency of both stacks is simply too great for channeled software, and customers are better served with a full-stack 'pilot&rdquo; that can handle both functional and tactical autonomy. Second, new autonomy capabilities must advance incrementally and collaboratively with the warfighter to build full trust. Autonomy in aviation is still an emerging technology . Solutions cannot be developed in isolation by tech companies and delivered pre-baked to the military. It may not be flashy, but you must crawl before walking, and walk before flying. Companies must spend thousands of hours working directly with operators to understand where their product roadmaps need to lead not just months, but years, into the future. Even reducing crews from two pilots to one requires hundreds of factors to make flight operationally viable and comfortable for that remaining pilot. Companies skipping these stages are wasting resources and endangering lives&mdash;neither of which will ensure ongoing investment. I've seen too many startups show up with the bravado of having 'solved' autonomy, but when you peel back the layers, they've glossed over or completely ignored these basic requirements. It's akin to a self-driving car company claiming their vehicle can perfectly parallel park itself, but can't actually accelerate, brake, or turn properly. While I mentioned the government has put out clear demand signals, they could also be more helpful in reinforcing the need for companies to meet these requirements. With autonomy being such a priority, there's an eagerness to find that 'future-state' solution that can leapfrog today's limitations. But that's dangerous when dealing with the profound complexities of airborne systems and human lives. No competent auto company would let the allure of delivering a flying car distract them to the point of missing today's vehicle- safety standards. Our military needs continued aggressive development of autonomous flight capabilities, and rapid development is largely the domain of the tech industry. Adversaries like China aren't standing still. But that advancement must happen through a tight cycle of government-industry partnership, rigorous testing of proposed solutions against proven systems engineering principles , and demanding that any autonomy upgrades are thoroughly validated at each incremental step by pilots themselves before moving to the next stage. Autonomous flight represents a potential force multiplier that will tilt the balance in future conflicts. But that competitive advantage disappears if we suffer catastrophic incidents due to reckless rushes toward autonomy while disregarding fundamental airmanship and Human Factors. We must stay grounded in reality, focused on the grueling stepping stones, and earn the complete trust of our aircrews. Cutting corners on autonomous flight is truly an unacceptable risk. Matt George is the founder and chief executive officer of Merlin, an aerospace startup that is building a non-human pilot to enable reduced-crew and uncrewed flight.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/10/how-do-autonomous-flight-right/400373/	2024-10-18T09:11:24-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/18/flight_GettyImages_2113005828/large.jpg
The D Brief: Hamas leader, killed; N. Koreans in Ukraine; Army si...	Israeli forces killed Yahya Sinwar, leader of the terrorist group Hamas, after newly-trained soldiers reportedly stumbled upon him and two other militants during a patrol in southern Gaza Thursday. They didn't initially know who they'd encountered&mdash;which means, as former U.S. special forces soldier David Witty put it, 'The events surrounding the death of Hamas leader Sinwar were just an accident. This was not based on intelligence.&rdquo; After an extended exchange of fire, Israeli forces attacked the building the militants hid inside, apparently killing Sinwar amid the rubble, Israeli defense officials told the New York Times. Rumors of his death began circulating online early Thursday, along with graphic photos of his corpse, as Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute noted on social media. Video: He'd been spotted moments earlier when a small Israeli drone entered the second floor of a destroyed apartment building and found a seated man observing the drone cautiously. The Israeli Defense Forces released edited footage of that short encounter after confirming his death Thursday. Israeli reax: 'While this is not the end of the war in Gaza, it's the beginning of the end,&rdquo; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a special English-language video Thursday. If the remaining Hamas militants lay down their arms and return the remaining 101 hostages, the war can be over this weekend, Netanyahu said. Bibi added: 'The axis of terror that was built by Iran is collapsing before our eyes. [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah is gone. His deputy Mohsen is gone. [Hamas political leader Ismail] Haniyeh is gone. [Hamas military leader Mohammed] Deif is gone. Sinwar is gone. The reign of terror that the Iranian regime has imposed on its own people, and on the peoples of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen&mdash;this, too, will come to an end,&rdquo; he vowed. Pentagon reax: Sinwar's death 'is a major achievement in counterterrorism,&rdquo; U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Thursday. 'Our forces in the Middle East stand ready to defend Israel, deter aggression, and reduce the risk of all-out war in the region,&rdquo; he added. White House reax: 'Now is the time to move on &mdash; move on, move towards a ceasefire in Gaza,&rdquo; President Joe Biden said Friday during a visit to Germany to discuss Ukraine and the Middle East. 'It's time for this war to end and bring these hostages home. And so, that's what we're ready to do.&rdquo; He also said he's tasked his top diplomat Antony Blinken with pursuing those goals during a visit to the region next week. 'It is time for the day after to begin without Hamas in power,&rdquo; Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement Thursday. 'Sinwar was the main obstacle to getting a ceasefire done,&rdquo; National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said Friday in a call with reporters from Berlin. 'Each and every time, Sinwar found a way to stop it. Now he's gone, so we'll see&rdquo; if a ceasefire can be reached in the coming days and weeks, said Kirby. In the interim, 'We're going to continue to support Israel with defensive capabilities,&rdquo; Kirby said. 'Those hostages are still being held in Gaza, likely in tunnels,&rdquo; so the U.S. is going to try to push to get those hostages home, he said. Elsewhere in the region, Iran-backed militants in eastern Syria attacked U.S. forces for the 15th time in six weeks, Charles Lister flagged online Thursday. In that latest known attack, militants targeted the remote Conoco Base in Deir ez Zour using a suicide drone; but coalition forces at the base apparently intercepted it with their C-RAM system. According to Lister, 'The US isn't acknowledging these attacks, nor is it admitting to 8+ retaliatory artillery strikes targeting Iran's proxies in eastern Syria since October 8,&rdquo; the Middle East Institute fellow wrote separately on Thursday.

Why Germany? 'They've been a core player in the Allied response to Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine,&rdquo; Sullivan said. 'And the president is looking forward to having the opportunity to talk to the chancellor and other German officials about where we go from here in Ukraine; about developments in the Middle East, in Iran, Lebanon, Gaza, Israel; about how we align our respective approaches on the PRC; about how we align our industrial and innovation strategies; about artificial intelligence and the clean energy transition.&rdquo; During a ceremony in Berlin, Biden said that Kyiv's supporters must 'ensure that Ukraine prevails and Putin fails and NATO remains strong and more united than ever.&rdquo; 'We're headed into a very difficult winter,&rdquo; the outgoing president warned. 'We cannot let up. We cannot,&rdquo; he said. That's a wrap for us this week.

The Army’s dream of vastly simplified networking is starting to c...	Upgrades are making the Army's battle network easier for soldiers to use, but it's still not exactly what they're asking for. 'It's really good, but it is extremely complicated and&hellip;it's better than what we had before,&rdquo; Col. James Stultz, who leads the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, said of the nascent Integrated Tactical Network. 'I'm not complaining, but it's a waypoint, it's not the end state.&rdquo; Today, the Army uses a myriad of means to transmit and receive voice calls and other data in the field: radios, satellite terminals, cell phones, and more. The ITN is an effort to combine the service's existing gear with off-the-shelf products to improve connectivity and mission command. Service leaders have been working to make that web more reliable, secure, and capable. Radio mesh networks, which are foundational to ITN, are good for calls or texts, and sending location data from Android Tactical Assault Kit, or ATAK. Satellite networks can handle large amounts of data, like a drone's video feed, and are often used when a military unit is not in range of a cell tower. But threading it all together is tricky, so the Army selected units to test out network upgrades. The 101st Airborne Division, 82nd Airborne Division, and all of the Army's Security Force Assistance Brigades are testing out the new tactical network to see how it improves command and control, or C2. As part of its unified network plan, the Army has a two-pronged approach to C2: one to improve existing gear that can be used today and another that looks at long-term next-generation solutions. 'There's a lot of people that want it that don't have it&hellip;so we're in a have/have-not world in terms of ITN,&rdquo; Stultz said. 'I'm a big fan, but it's not a field-and-immediately-execute&rdquo; type of capability. [[Related Posts]] To fulfill their missions, units must be able to establish network connectivity in minutes and dismantle it just as fast. That's especially true as front-line units lean more on drones and commercial technologies. While the ITN is quicker to set up and improves communications, it requires commanders to develop technical expertise, Stultz said: 'We have to understand where all the switches go and plug...We gotta get out of that.&rdquo; That learning curve is less than ideal, said Col. Joshua Glonek, who leads 10th Mountain Division's 3rd Brigade Combat Team. 'We're early in the fielding of it; we just got it. It has greatly increased our capability to communicate, but it does come with a significant amount of leader education to understand the integrated portion of the network. There's many different radios and components, and when configured appropriately, it allows you to do things like...dynamically adjust the waveforms you're communicating on,&rdquo; such as switching between satellite communications to radios, Glonek said. 'But you've got to be very smart and proficient on how to do that on the battlefield. I'd love to get to the point where we just pick up one device and we can do all that without having to, as commanders and staff, understand the intricacies of how to adjust the waveforms and the different parts of the network.&rdquo; Glonek and Stultz's brigades are participating in the Army's 'transformation in contact&rdquo; approach to test and field new technologies and used ITN in recent exercises A win is a win For years, the Army has sought to improve its networks so that brigade, corps, and division command posts can outsource heavy computing to somewhere else. Now the 101st's work with ITN is proving out the concept, according to the Army's program executive officer for command, control, communications, and networks. 'We walked into that unit eight months ago, they were purely secret, they were running compute in their brigades&rdquo; with very large, conspicuous command posts, Mark Kitz told reporters on Monday. By replacing 'secret&rdquo;-level networking gear with 'secure-but-unclassified-encrypted,&rdquo; or SBU-E equipment, the 101st shrank its brigade command posts to just three vehicles that can be set up in about 20 minutes, Kitz said. Intelligence and sustainment work gets sent to division-level command posts, or even all the way back home to Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The concepts were tried out in recent exercises at the Joint Readiness Training Center in Louisiana. The Army plans to build on those developments with the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii, looking particularly at 'digital fires,&rdquo; or the software-based systems used for targeting, and improving networking with foreign militaries. Exercises in October should produce about nine things to improve and test in March, said Maj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, who leads the Army's Network Cross Functional Team. 'Where the 101st left it is where the 25th started. So all the lessons we learned out of the Joint Readiness Training Center, they became the baseline,&rdquo; Ellis said. 'I think we're going to learn a lot out of the 25th's rotation in the Pacific Theater: very heavily focused on mission partner environments, how do we incorporate allies and partners. They're making some huge gains in that space.&rdquo; Ellis said the 25th is working through problems, such as transporting secure-but-unclassified-encrypted network traffic, but that solutions were on the horizon. 'There were a couple things there that weren't quite exactly the way we would have wanted them. And now it looks like that's been fixed and prepared. Cross-domain solutions are able to move that up and down so we can run the fires down into the SBUE architecture and run them back up. I think those are just small examples of it's not just the same-old, same-old,&rdquo; he said. Tech dreams v. reality Is it even possible to realize Stultz's dream of having the same simple device connectivity at home on a command post? Yes, it's technologically possible to make 'one magical radio that does it all&hellip;but you don't want to pay the price,&rdquo; said Mike Sheehan, CEO of the defense and security division of Thales, a major supplier of military radios. 'So instead of doing that, we've got a kit. It's a little Pelican box, and it's got in there five, six different types of radio: it's SATCOM, it's got lower frequency&hellip;you name it. And from there, you know, I'm a user, and I just say, &lsquo;Send Message.'&rdquo; It's also possible to bring your own network, said Rob Spalding, Sempre AI's CEO and former special assistant to the U.S. Air Force vice chief of staff. This week, Sempre AI unveiled its SEMPRE T Tactical Edge Node, which combines a data center and 5G network in a wheel-barrowable 300-pound box that can withstand electromagnetic pulse attacks and has a three-mile connection radius. The tech, which has caught the eye of Air Force Global Strike Command, took about six years to develop; shrinking down a 5G network was difficult, Spalding said. 'A lot of people brought smartphones to Afghanistan and Iraq, but they didn't really work because they didn't connect to anything,&rdquo; he said. The box can enable units to run Android Team Awareness Kit, or ATAK, locally without external network connection, like to a satellite, or use facial recognition software, mimicking the tech user experience 'in a developed society&hellip;but bring it on the battlefield or bring it to the disconnected side.&rdquo; But there's concern the Army may not stick to its unified network vision. 'Everything you want to do in the network&hellip;you need a communication fabric. Otherwise it all breaks down. So the Army is about a third of the way through populating that. I hope they continue, because history shows that [the] next new thing comes up, we stop this, and we start looking at this. And that's what's happened for 40 years,&rdquo; said Thales' Sheehan. 'Is there some technology that's going to pop up that might be superior? Yeah, maybe. But then you innovate it in.&rdquo; Help Desk loading One strand of the Army's effort to streamline its communications is reducing the number of physical networks and centralizing their management. Three years ago, the service began working to collapse 42 networks into one by 2027; the service is currently down to about 14. A key part of that is getting everyone on the same 'base services&rdquo; and applications, Lt. Gen. John Morrison, deputy chief of staff for G-6, told reporters at the Association of the U.S. Army's annual conference on Monday. 'One is all of our office collaboration capabilities. We call it Army 365, everybody's going to use that environment. Endpoint security. So the security that you put on your phone or your PC, that's going to be centrally provided, the ability to connect to the network is going to be centrally provided. And by using those pillars, we'll call them, that makes network convergence that much easier, because now you have discrete capabilities that you can now align to,&rdquo; Morrison said. Next year, the Army plans to consolidate all of its IT network management under Army Network Enterprise Technology Command, or NETCOM, making the Fort Huachuca, Arizona-based command a one-stop shop for all of the Army's network needs. Doing that will allow units to go directly to Army Cyber Command and NETCOM when they have bad service while Army headquarters can 'hold those units accountable for divesting of their legacy capabilities,&rdquo; Morrison said. So in the coming year, NETCOM will focus on endpoint device security, identity and access management, and expanding virtual desktop access, said Maj. Gen. Jacqueline McPhail, who leads the command. It will also work to improve its Army Enterprise Service Management Platform, a help desk that allows users to call or chat with a service provider. McPhail said the command is also working with the program executive offices to make sure the technology soldiers use at the edge is compatible with enterprise networks, starting with security. 'What we're doing with the security, incident, and event-management monitoring, we actually picked it up from the edge. We looked at what [program executive office command, control, communications and network] was rolling out, and we adopted their solution, and then worked it back to an enterprise. And that's a big shift culturally, and how we're delivering a capability,&rdquo; she said. At the end of the day, the network has made progress, according to Morrison, the deputy chief of staff, G6. 'When we talked last year this time, there was still that false divide between what we did at the strategic and operational levels and what we did at the tactical level. It was jerry-rigged at very, very, very best, and it was even worse, because inside our divisions, we had fragmented brigade networks,&rdquo; he said. 'What do you have today? You have one full division, now two, that are now capable of being able to put in a divisional architecture that seamlessly connects back to the operational strategic level that allows for the enablement of those cloud capabilities. Picture this on a JRTC rotation with an opposing force that is contesting you and the brigade commander is using the same system he uses in his office, and he was being contested. That never would have happened a year ago.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/armys-dream-vastly-simplified-networking-starting-come-true/400365/	2024-10-17T22:32:13-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/18/Screenshot_2024_10_17_at_7.30.09PM/large.png
Northrop aims to double GMLRS rocket-motor output	Northrop Grumman is preparing to pump out 14,000 rocket motors per year, roughly doubling production as the Pentagon works to replace weapons sent to Ukraine and rebuild stockpiles against future wars. Over the last four years, the defense giant delivered 5,000 to 6,000 solid rocket motors per year to power Lockheed Martin's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. But in the last year or two, demand is pushing Northrop to get to 10,000, potentially 14,000, motors per year, said Gordon LoPresti, senior director of propulsion systems and controls at Northrop. 'There's more work to be done to get to 14,000, but we've had excess capacity versus the 6,000 that we've been delivering, so we're already starting to be able to move up that curve and have a great partnership with both the U.S. government, our partners, and our primes, to be able to allow us to do that,&rdquo; LoPresti said on the sidelines of the AUSA conference. Northrop builds solid rocket motors at facilities in West Virginia and Maryland, which concentrate on medium, tactical-sized solid rocket motors, and in Utah, which focuses on larger motors, like for the future Sentinel ICBM. Over the last six years, Northrop has spent a billion dollars to boost production capability at the three sites. 'With that six-year investment, we've been able to triple the capacity at the combination of the West Virginia and Maryland sites, so primarily for the tactical rocket motors, and we're on track, within the next couple of years, to be doubling the capacity at our Utah sites for the much larger items that we build,&rdquo; LoPresti said. [[Related Posts]] Beyond Northrop's infrastructure, execs say they're investing in the entire supply chain to ensure smaller suppliers can keep up as the company increases its production cadence. Industry executives have previously pointed to gaps in sub-tier suppliers' ability to provide critical components, like cases, nozzles, and igniters. Northrop has made 'strategic agreements&rdquo; with its suppliers so they're ready to supply those components in the volume needed, LoPresti said. 'We have to have a very good understanding and a consistent understanding with the U.S. government and our primes on what that demand is going to be years into the future. We take that a step further, and have spent an enormous amount of time with our suppliers and those strategic agreements to implement some of those demand signals into those agreements so that they feel more comfortable going out and going to their supply chains and executing on activities that are going to prepare them to be able to support us when we need them.&rdquo; Northrop and Aerojet Rocketdyne, which was bought by L3Harris last year, have been operating as the only two suppliers of SRMs in the U.S. But now that the Pentagon has asked for more production capacity&mdash;and main supplier Aerojet has struggled to deliver rocket motors to customers on time&mdash;new companies like Ursa Major, X-Bow Systems, and Anduril are coming onto the scene. 'With some of the challenges that I think the government and the primes are seeing with some of those suppliers, it is completely understandable that there's a desire for diversification of the solid rocket motor suppliers in the market. Couple that with the increasing demand for solid rocket motors, it even puts more urgency on increasing the supply base, or the diversification of the supply base,&rdquo; LoPresti said. Asked whether demand will sustain Northrop, Aerojet, and a slew of new entrants, LoPresti said there needs to be more diversification in the market&mdash;but it's unlikely that all of these new companies will be successful in the future.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/northrop-aims-double-gmlrs-rocket-motor-output/400354/	2024-10-17T12:51:48-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/17/Screenshot_2024_10_17_at_9.48.08AM-1/large.png
The D Brief: B-2s bomb Houthis; A general’s China alarm; Army’s U...	The Pentagon conducted a series of precision airstrikes against Houthi military sites inside Yemen early Thursday, with Air Force B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers and U.S. Navy assets in the region teaming up for the attack. The strikes targeted five 'hardened underground facilities housing missiles, weapons components, and other munitions&rdquo; allegedly used by the Iran-backed terrorists to attack commercial shipping vessels traveling along Yemen's coast over the past 11 months, U.S. defense officials at Central Command announced late Wednesday. Rewind: Satellite imagery analysis from February showed the Houthis had 'undertaken a major expansion of underground military facilities&rdquo; in addition to the 'caves and simple tunnels [the group used] in their earliest days,&rdquo; researcher Fabian Hinz noted for the International Institute of Strategic Studies in the spring. Notable: CENTCOM forces have attacked underground weapons-storage facilities inside Yemen before, including in late March&mdash;but U.S. officials did not use B-2s for that operation. Trivia: B-2s seem to have last been used in combat nearly eight years ago for strikes against ISIS fighters in Libya. SecDef Austin (emphasis added): 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that several observers interpreted as a warning to Iran. 'The employment of U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers demonstrate U.S. global strike capabilities to take action against these targets when necessary, anytime, anywhere,&rdquo; Austin said. Think-tank reax: 'This strike is laudable, belated, and insufficient,&rdquo; said Bradley Bowman of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'The Biden administration deserves credit for using B-2 bombers to target Houthi underground weapon stockpiles, but one wonders what took so long.&rdquo; The Houthi attacks against non-military targets represent 'the most serious assault on freedom of navigation and maritime commerce in decades,&rdquo; Bowman told Defense One. 'Let's see whether this is a one-off or the start of a new and more effective strategy toward the Houthis and more importantly their terror patron in Tehran,&rdquo; he added.

On this day in 1973, OPEC&mdash;led by Saudi Arabia&mdash;announced an oil embargo on the U.S. and other nations that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War, triggering a global energy crisis. 'The price of oil per barrel first doubled, then quadrupled, imposing skyrocketing costs on consumers and structural challenges to the stability of whole national economies,&rdquo; as the State Department recalls. U.S. responses included creating the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, imposing a national 55-mph speed limit on highways(!), and the introduction of fuel economy standards. The Pentagon announced another $425 million in military aid for Ukraine on Wednesday, including air defense and artillery munitions; air-to-ground weapons; armored vehicles; more anti-tank weapons, and more. Panning out: The U.S. has pledged more than $59 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion more than two and a half years ago. Developing: After months of staying quiet about the matter, U.S. Army units stationed in Europe are indeed learning from Ukraine's experience fighting Russia, officials confirmed Wednesday in Washington. A 'small element&rdquo; of soldiers rotates in and out of the war-torn country to collect lessons, said Gen. Darryl Williams, commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa, speaking at a media roundtable at the Association of the United States Army's annual Washington meeting. Those soldiers fall under Lt. Gen. Curtis Buzzard, who in August was appointed head of the allied effort that coordinates aid to Ukraine, Defense One's Sam Skove reports. For the record: The team that rotates through Ukraine is limited to working inside the U.S. embassy and does not provide advice to the Ukrainian government, a U.S. Army Europe spokesperson said. What's more, the U.S. has also adapted its own training facilities at Grafenw&ouml;hr, Germany, to better mimic the tactical environment for the Ukrainian units who come there for training, Williams said. 'It looks like the conditions in Ukraine,&rdquo; he said. Read on, here. Also from AUSA: The top U.S. Army commander in the Pacific region is sounding alarms about China's 'dangerous trajectory&rdquo; and the rising threat of a war in Asia, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reported Wednesday. 'There's a limited regional war going on in Europe. There's a limited regional war going on in the Middle East. We can ill afford another limited regional war in Asia,&rdquo; said Gen. Charles Flynn, the outgoing commander of U.S. Army Pacific. 'Why? Because it will be a global problem for all of us,&rdquo; he said. Flynn also argued that the Army would be critical in a fight with China. It's not the obvious position in a region known less for its land masses than its oceans and vast distances. But he said the Army has undergone a profound transformation to make it not only relevant but essential. 'I often remind people that you're not going to invade Taiwan with the Navy and Air Force,&rdquo; Flynn said. 'You need to generate an invasion force to invade Taiwan. Well, that invasion force exists in the [Chinese] eastern theater command and it is three army groups, and it's north of 55,000 Chinese soldiers in those combat brigades.&rdquo; According to Flynn, China's 'strength is in the air and in the maritime domains,&rdquo; as well as space and cyberspace, Tucker reports. However, that Chinese arsenal was 'not designed to find, fix, and finish land-based forces that are distributed, dispersed, mobile, reloadable network,&rdquo; said Flynn. Amid those dynamics, the U.S. Army has built new capabilities to attack China in new ways, even across long distances, Tucker writes. Continue reading, here.

The company took in more than $111 million more than it was owed under 'two separate schemes&rdquo; in connection with the Patriot missile systems and a radar system, and other defense services, according to a DOJ statement released on Wednesday. RTX also bribed a high-level Qatari military official to win defense contracts, and then concealed those payments by falsifying documents, according to an SEC filing. Raytheon officials said the company is 'taking responsibility for the misconduct&rdquo; which it said occurred 'largely prior to 2020.&rdquo; Rewind: In August, Raytheon was fined $200 million for the unauthorized export of defense technology to China, Russia, Iran, and elsewhere.

Dixon, who lives in the Florida Panhandle, is one of several coordinators helping to direct supplies and volunteers to hard-hit areas. He said dozens of teams self-organized in Helene-devastated places like Asheville, N.C., and prepositioned in Central Florida before Milton. They started by clearing debris but have expanded their efforts, including using small drones to find supply routes through washed-out areas. And in North Carolina, former air controllers helped establish a landing zone for volunteer civilian helicopter crews to deliver supplies and materials, Dixon said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-17-2024/400339/	2024-10-17T08:00:30-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/17/DB_lander/large.png
Regional war in Asia would be a 'global problem' for the US, Paci...	The top U.S. Army commander in the Pacific region is sounding alarms about China's 'dangerous trajectory&rdquo; and the rising threat of a war in Asia. Gen. Charles Flynn, the outgoing commander of U.S. Army Pacific, said increased coordination and technology exchange between autocratic states such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea is a 'very dangerous combination that we all should pay very, very close attention to&rdquo;&mdash;in no small part because that coordination is putting greater pressure on the United States everywhere the military is conducting operations. 'There's a limited regional war going on in Europe. There's a limited regional war going on in the Middle East. We can ill afford another limited regional war in Asia. Why? Because it will be a global problem for all of us,&rdquo; Flynn said at the AUSA conference, one of several D.C.-area venues he addressed this week. In a farewell tour of sorts before he leaves his command in November, Flynn hit the capital city to address the AUSA conference, speak to reporters, and also appear at the Center for a New American Security to address policy wonks. For many outside of Washington, the name Flynn conjures recollections of his brother Mike, Donald Trump's disgraced national security advisor and conspiracy pusher. (It's an open secret that the brothers are not on good terms.) But the military and national security community knows Charles Flynn as a transformative figure in the U.S. Army and consummate champion for the importance of the U.S. Army in the Pacific in a fight against China. 'I would argue that this century is going to be defined by the relationship between the United States and China in Asia,&rdquo; he said this week. [[Related Posts]] Flynn also argued that the Army would be critical in a fight with China. It's not the obvious position in a region known less for its land masses than its oceans and vast distances. But he said the Army has undergone a profound transformation to make it not only relevant but essential. 'I often remind people that you're not going to invade Taiwan with the Navy and Air Force. You need to generate an invasion force to invade Taiwan. Well, that invasion force exists in the [Chinese] eastern theater command and it is three army groups, and it's north of 55,000 Chinese soldiers in those combat brigades,&rdquo; he said. But China, beginning with its 2015 reorganization and modernization push, has become a much more capable military. It's a transformation that Flynn says in many ways mirrors how the United States military develops forces, with a large emphasis on the development of training centers, 'taking pages right out of our book and putting them in place to build a force.&rdquo; Additionally, China has developed a massive rocket force and anti-access area denial capabilities. 'It is historical in the scale of what they have&hellip;They have three things that we lack. They're operating on interior lines that are right there. They have mass, and then they have magazine depth. These three things are what we have to counter,&rdquo; he said. Those elements of Chinese military power, rocket forces and anti-access/area denial capabilities&mdash;known as A2AD&mdash;create huge potential problems for the Navy and Air Force. Ships, which are observable from Chinese satellites, would be vulnerable to missile attack, while the Air Force relies heavily on visible runways that would also be open to attack in the event of a conflict. The U.S. Army can provide 'an asymmetric counterweight that's unmatchable,&rdquo; Flynn says. It's a big part of the reason Flynn has worked to make the U.S. Army in the Pacific relevant in multiple domains, to develop a force that can protect air and maritime assets and work across air, sea, and space. China has 'the primary means of their attack approach, with their A2AD arsenal, against the strength of the United States, that strength is in the air and in the maritime domains,&rdquo; as well as space and cyberspace, Flynn said. However, that Chinese arsenal was 'not designed to find, fix, and finish land-based forces that are distributed, dispersed, mobile, reloadable network.&rdquo; Flynn lacks his brother's appetite for political statements, but he's not afraid to call out the military for what he sees as strategic errors. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he believes those errors stem from a systematic and decades-long underestimation of the importance of the U.S. Army to match China. 'I would argue that for many, many years, we've over invested in the aerial layer and over invested in the space layer. In the Indo-Pacific, we have to have a terrestrial collection layer, and that is a series of sensors that could both collect in all domains, to include open source, and share that with our partners,&rdquo; he said. Changing the game To correct those perceived oversights, the U.S. Army has built new capabilities to attack China in new ways, even across long distances. One significant example: Multi-domain Task Force, or MDTF, teams. 'A few short years ago, this was merely a concept,&rdquo; Flynn explained. 'Now, it's an organization that's got four battalions, got a sustainment battalion, it's got an integrated air-and-missile-defense battalion. It's got a long-range precision-fires battalion, and then it's got a multi-domain effects battalion and a task force headquarters.&rdquo; Those MDTF teams play a critical role in helping the Air Force and Navy be more effective in the Pacific, he said, by gathering information and intelligence the Chinese can't easily counter, and providing options for hitting China from locations that aren't so easy for enemy forces to find and hit. 'To me, that is game changing when it comes to being able to do missile defense and then being able to do counter-strike with long-range fires,&rdquo; he said. 'We have a theater information directorate. We have a theater strike effects group. This is space. This is information. This is lethal and non-lethal targeting all brought together at the operational level, at the theater army, so that the multi-domain task forces can take the long-range precision fires, from hypersonics to mid-range capability to (precision strike missiles), integrated air and missile defense&hellip; etc, to include future vertical lift sustainment capabilities, distributed forces, network forces, meshed forces, cellular forces&mdash;all in support of the joint force.&rdquo; The Army has worked hard to develop air and drone defenses, and is planning a composite air defense battalion to be based of Guam starting in 2027. But the service is putting new air defense capabilities into place now at multiple levels to counter the threat of China's enormous stockpile of rockets, missiles, and drones. 'I think the advance of these advanced composite air defense battalions, where we bring together the integrated fire protection platform, the LTM sensor, IBCS RIG-360 and ALPS towers&hellip;that with what we're doing with THAAD and Patriot and the [integrated air and missile defense] and, the software integration of those&hellip; This ability to be able to have what was originally designed to be a defensive capability, to sense and do an intercept and then to cross cue an offensive platform, to do counter strike,&rdquo; is a huge improvement over a traditional, simple air defense capability. The other key new advantage the Army now offers is the many allies and partners across the region that it has built close relationships with through joint exercises. By contrast, China is 'doing it in a way that is, in many ways, is helping us, because it's turning the allies and partners away from them,&rdquo; he said. INDOPACOM officials routinely point out the importance of more partners in the region&mdash;including governments and militaries that have difficult histories with each other&mdash;now not only participating in exercises together but actually asking to do so. Aside from seeing China as a threat, the other common feature among those militaries is actually the outsized role of their various armies. 'The region is defined by armies&hellip; In the Philippines' army, they have 12 divisions. They have more divisions than we have in the U.S.,&rdquo; Flynn said. The Taiwan question If there is one area where Flynn is a bit more reticent, it's the potential of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Military officials in in 2021 said that invasion could occur by 2027, making that assessment based in no small part on the words of Chinese President Xi Jinping and the rapid modernization of Chinese forces. 'I take him for his word, because if I did otherwise, and I think if any military leader did otherwise, that would be irresponsible,&rdquo; Flynn said. But when Defense One asked him specifically if he believed that moving U.S. forces, such as an MDTF team or Marine Littoral Regiment, to Taiwan might deter such an attack, he answered simply: 'That is absolutely a policy question. I'm not going to render my opinion on it&hellip;We have a long standing relationship with Taiwan.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/regional-war-asia-would-be-global-problem-us-pacific-army-chief-warns/400333/	2024-10-16T17:42:03-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/16/IMG_5673/large.jpg
RTX will pay almost $1B for defrauding DOD, alleged bribes to Qat...	Defense giant Raytheon will pay the U.S government more than $950 million for defrauding the Pentagon and allegedly bribing a Qatari official, the Justice Department announced today. RTX admitted to 'two separate schemes&rdquo; to defraud the Defense Department in connection with the Patriot missile systems and a radar system, and other defense services, according to a DOJ release. 'These schemes to defraud caused the DOD to pay Raytheon over $111 million more than Raytheon should have been paid on the contracts,&rdquo; the release said. RTX will pay the government more than $124 million for bribing a high-level Qatari military official to win defense contracts, and then concealed those payments by falsifying documents, according to an SEC filing. 'Raytheon engaged in criminal schemes to defraud the U.S. government in connection with contracts for critical military systems and to win business through bribery in Qatar,&rdquo; said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kevin Driscoll of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. 'Such corrupt and fraudulent conduct, especially by a publicly traded U.S. defense contractor, erodes public trust and harms the DOD, businesses that play by the rules, and American taxpayers. Today's resolutions, with criminal and civil recoveries totaling nearly $1 billion, reflect the Criminal Division's ability to tackle the most significant and complex white-collar cases across multiple subject matters.&rdquo; In a statement, RTX said the misconduct occurred 'largely prior to 2020&rdquo; and the financial impact of these matters is consistent with the reserve announced in the company's July 2024 quarterly earnings report. 'RTX is taking responsibility for the misconduct that occurred. We have worked diligently during the investigations to remediate that misconduct and continue to do so. We are committed to working closely with the incoming independent monitor to improve and further enhance our ethics and compliance program,&rdquo; the company said. The defense contractor also recently was fined $200 million for the unauthorized export of defense technology to China, Russia, Iran, and elsewhere. In July, the company told investors during an earnings call that it set aside more than $1 billion to settle a number of government investigations.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/rtx-will-pay-almost-1b-defrauding-dod-bribing-qatari-officials/400332/	2024-10-16T15:31:52-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/16/rtx/large.jpg
Bell presses on with FLRAA as Army cools on large programs	Just months after the Army canceled one planned helicopter, and just a day after its top officer hinted at other large-program cuts, Bell Textron execs said they're simply focusing on starting deliveries of their V-280 tiltrotor by decade's end. 'There are things we can't control. The things we can control: execution, schedule, staying within the cost objectives of the Army,&rdquo; said Frank Lazzara, who leads the company's sales and strategy efforts for the service's Future Long Range Assault Aircraft, or FLRAA, program. At the Army's mainstay conference, Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George said the service won't hesitate to cut programs that don't support its modernization goals&mdash;and will no longer buy programs 'for ten years at a time.&rdquo; The service has canceled programs it invested billions in, like the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program, or FARA&mdash;an effort once hailed as the service's No. 1 aviation priority. And FARA's end might not be the final dramatic program move the Army makes, service officials have warned. 'Even if it was a requirement in the past. Even if it was a program of record, we may have to stop buying it,' George said on Tuesday at the AUSA conference. Asked about George's speech, Lazarra said that in the government, someone's always coming after someone else's money, and the Army has a lot of programs it needs to pay for. 'But if we stay on track with what their objectives are, those are the things we can control, and I think those are the things that keep a program viable and safe and protect the budget for the program,&rdquo; he said. [[Related Posts]] The FLRAA program, which will partially replace the Army's UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, could be worth up to $70 billion for Bell&mdash;depending on how many aircraft the company sells to the Army and foreign militaries. The total FLRAA buy hinges on budgetary constraints, and what the Army learns once it gets the aircraft to its test unit, said Maj. Gen. Clair Gill, commanding general of the Army's Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Novosel. But Gill emphasized that the Army is 'all in&rdquo; on FLRAA, and called it one of the service's major modernization programs. 'I'm not worried, but if it doesn't perform, then it becomes a risky program, and then potentially does get cut. I think, between us setting requirements, the research and development, the science and technology, all those things coming together, and then the manufacturer delivering on that&mdash;if it's on schedule, if it performs the way that I feel like [it will], then it's a safe program. I mean, we need the capability. It is a next-generation transformational capability. If those things don't happen, then I don't disagree with the chief. Then you have to look at it and say, &lsquo;Is this what the Army needs to pay for? And I think the chief and secretary do that with every single program',&rdquo; Gill told reporters Wednesday. Part of the Army's plan to keep costs low on FLRAA is to build the aircraft with a modular, open-systems architecture, so upgrades are easy and cheaper, and the service isn't locked into one subcontractor's component for the aircraft's entire lifespan. 'What the Army wants is to be able to control their own destiny. So the open systems approach will create more competition. It'll probably help with some level of cost control. They're not beholden to a sub[contractor] or a contract or anything,&rdquo; Lazarra said. And this new approach to acquisition will be a 'litmus test&rdquo; for industry to see if they can adapt and do business another way, he said. Fuselage twist Company execs at AUSA also confirmed a major switch-up to FLRAA production plans: Bell will now build the tiltrotor's fuselage in-house, pulling the work away from Spirit AeroSystems in the wake of Boeing's proposal to reacquire the company. The move was first reported in July by Aviation Week. 'We want to control the quality and the timeline and the schedule and the things we can control, and we don't want anything else to put that in jeopardy,&rdquo; Lazzara said. The company is 'fully prepared&rdquo; to start building the fuselages in-house, he said, and has been building the team for a while since this is 'something we've seen coming.&rdquo; Lazzara said he doesn't anticipate the move affecting the program's schedule. 'Any time we can take in the work for a part of the aircraft, and we can control just quality, timeline, cost, all those other things, we're excited to do it and anytime we can bring more work into Bell that helps across the board with other things that have cost involved,&rdquo; he said. Army's already practicing As the Army awaits the arrival of its high-speed, high-capacity tiltrotors in 2030, it is already practicing the new operating concept that they will enable. The idea behind 'large-scale, long-range air assault,&rdquo; or L2A2, is to 'deliver one brigade combat team in one period of darkness, over 500 miles, arriving behind enemy lines, and able to conduct sustained combat operations,&rdquo; said Maj. Gen. Brett Sylvia, who leads the 101st Airborne Division. And the service can't do this with the platforms it has today, he said. Sylvia's team has started working on the new tactics, techniques, and procedures and has practiced the concept four times in live demos over the last year, and multiple times in simulation. In the simulation, replacing UH-60s with FLRAA gave the combat aviation brigade 'four times the amount of heavy-lift aircraft than what I have today,&rdquo; Sylvia said. In the most recent test, the unit used its existing helicopters to move a brigade combat team about 570 miles, from Fort Campbell on the Kentucky-Tennessee border to Fort Johnson in Louisiana. The movement required three nights, two mission support sites, and six forward arming-and-refueling points. But in a simulation that used FLRAAs, the same mission required half the sustainment and security footprint--and just one night, Sylvia said. 'We are building, over the course of the next few years, this air assault combat aviation brigade. We are doing the things in order to be able to build the foundation so that all we have to do is just receive the aircraft and we'll be ready to execute,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/bell-presses-flraa-army-cools-large-programs/400328/	2024-10-16T14:56:04-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/16/Screenshot_2024_10_16_at_11.54.35AM/large.png
Europe-based units are learning from Ukraine, officers say	Army units stationed in Europe, from platoons to headquarters, are learning from Ukraine's battlefield as the service embarks on the second phase of an equipping effort, officials said Wednesday. A 'small element&rdquo; of soldiers rotates in and out of the war-torn country to collect lessons, said Gen. Darryl Williams, commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa, speaking at a media roundtable at the Association of the United States Army's annual Washington meeting. Those soldiers fall under Lt. Gen. Curtis Buzzard, who in August was appointed head of the allied effort that coordinates aid to Ukraine. He previously served as the commander of a major U.S. Army doctrine center, the Maneuver Center of Excellence. 'He's able to get insights on the environment in terms of the number of drones that they're flying,&rdquo; Williams said. 'Learning is taking place as we speak, at the tactical level, the operational level, to inform the strategic level.&rdquo; The team that rotates through Ukraine is limited to working inside the U.S. embassy and does not provide advice to the Ukrainian government, a U.S. Army Europe spokesperson said. [[Related Posts]] The U.S. has also adapted its own training facilities at Grafenw&ouml;hr, Germany, to better mimic the tactical environment for the Ukrainian units who come there for training, Williams said. 'It looks like the conditions in Ukraine,&rdquo; he said. The lessons brought back by that team are shaping how the Army approaches its 'Transformation-in-Contact&rdquo; equipping strategy. Under the 8-month-old effort, the Army is flooding certain units with new drones, counter-drone tech, and communications gear that is not necessarily part of any program of record&mdash;the service's typical method of buying new equipment. One light infantry unit that's part of the initial Transformation in Contact cohort, the 10th Mountain Division's 3rd Brigade, is drawing directly from Ukraine for its new 'Strike&rdquo; Company, said Lt. Gen. Charles Costanza, commander of Army V Corps. That unit, which links drone operators to mortars, artillery, and loitering munitions, is 'coming straight out of watching what's going on in Ukraine,&rdquo; he said. Williams said the Europe-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and U.S.-based 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division are among the four brigades slated for 'Transformation-in-Contact 2.0,&rdquo; an expansion announced by George on Tuesday. Command Sgt. Maj. Dennis Doyle of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment said that unit is already adopting lessons from Ukraine. 'Over the last few years, based off of the fight that's in the Ukraine, and just with us being right there with the enemy at the doorstep&hellip;we've been able to extract a lot of lessons learned that's kind of drove us to kind of think about how we do agile and adaptive command and control,&rdquo; Doyle said. Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian troops have underscored the need to make command posts harder for enemy forces to find. Even before being designated for the TiC effort, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was working to slim down its command posts, as well as experimenting with translation software for communicating with allies. The unit started receiving some equipment under the TiC 2.0 fielding strategy this month, Doyle said. Not all lessons are about new tech, though, said Maj. Gen. Ron Ragin, commander of the unit responsible for helping manage aid transfers to Ukraine, the 21st Theater Sustainment Command. Ragin said he recently asked several senior Ukrainian officers what they would have done differently before the war. He said the Ukrainians recommended investing in ammunition production and stockpiles and in creating multiple locations for maintaining equipment. They also recommended creating hardened storage and command-and-control infrastructure. 'I'm using those lessons from our Ukrainian partners that are currently under strain and in contact to inform how I approach the priorities that Gen. Williams has given us,&rdquo; Ragin said. 'So I'm working with not only the acquisition community but also with the joint material enterprise to make sure that we're taking the lessons learned from Ukraine and applying it to how we move forward in the future,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/europe-based-units-are-learning-ukraine-officers-say/400327/	2024-10-16T14:28:32-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/16/Screenshot_2024_10_16_at_11.26.48AM/large.png
How the Pentagon’s financial audit will help win wars	In about four weeks, despite all the progress being made, we will likely hear that the Pentagon has again failed its financial audit this year. But the headlines will also likely miss the most important point: the warfighting benefits that are accumulating now as a result of the audit. Far from a mere compliance exercise, the cultural and technological changes required to pass an audit are the same ones necessary to keep U.S. forces dominant. For the Defense Department to pass its audit, it must account for more than dollars. It must track the vast array of things the military uses: munitions, spare parts, fuel, real estate. Moreover, it must track the condition of these things: In the shop? Ready for use? In the field? And it must do so accurately and in real time. All this requires comprehensive changes. Cyber security must be improved, systems integrated, processes and automation deployed to ensure the accuracy of data, and more. Undaunted, DOD has attacked these problems with resolve and money. Over the past five years, the department has spent more than $4 billion to improve visibility and transparency. Efforts to pass the audit have helped integrate data from finance, logistics, and readiness systems, breaking down longstanding silos and making it possible to see across the entire defense enterprise. What was once a cumbersome and time-consuming process&mdash;yielding outputs that were neither timely nor reliable&mdash;has become more streamlined. These changes are already yielding benefits. By improving visibility into resources, the DoD has made strides in ensuring that the right resources are available at the right time and that limited dollars are not put toward duplicative capabilities. But the benefits go far beyond the record-keeping necessary for a clean financial bill of health. By improving the flow of data, the audit effort is helping to ensure U.S. military dominance into the future. [[Related Posts]] Tomorrow's victories will increasingly depend on decision advantage: the ability to make faster and better decisions than adversaries by harnessing accurate, reliable, and timely data. This is why the Pentagon is working to link all warfare domains through its CJADC2 efforts, enabling data to flow seamlessly between platforms. Imagine a scenario in the Indo-Pacific where tensions between the U.S. and a near-peer adversary, such as China, have escalated, making the ability to close the kill chain quickly and effectively paramount. U.S. forces use intelligence assets&mdash;ranging from satellites and UAVs to cyber intelligence&mdash;to rapidly identify and track enemy movements. This sensor data is then transmitted to a CJADC2 command center, where it is fused into a single operational picture. Commanders then use this data for targeting, which also shows what strike assets&mdash;fighter jets, ships, or missile systems&mdash;are ready for deployment. As U.S. forces use precision-guided munitions to strike the enemy fleet, cyber capabilities are also deployed to protect U.S. systems and disable enemy communications. Finally, UAVs conduct a battle damage assessment, providing commanders with immediate feedback on the success of the mission. The data integration promoted by the audit promises to enable commanders&mdash;from small units up to unified commands&mdash;to access information about the availability and the condition of munitions, vehicles, equipment, parts, and supplies. As the above example illustrates, this visibility is essential for warfighting, as it allows commanders to allocate resources effectively. A unified, enterprise-wide view will enable them to move with speed and surety, whether responding to emerging threats or executing long-term strategic operations. Accurate, real-time data on asset quantities, condition, and location will enable the use of automation, data analytics, and AI in decision-making and execution. There remains much work to be done before this vision comes to pass. The improvements to date will only yield full operational benefits if they are integrated into real-time decision-making processes that can adjust to the demands of fast-moving, contested environments. This requires cultural change. The entire defense enterprise must shift from a compliance-driven, labor-intensive audit remediation mindset to one focused on mission outcomes. But this is already taking place. Historically, data transparency and integration across the defense enterprise were counter-cultural. The audit has pushed the DoD toward greater transparency, data integration, and enterprise-wide standards. One key to finishing the transformation is making sure the audit is viewed not as simply a financial matter but as commanders' business. By emphasizing the warfighting value, the DoD can ensure that audit remediations contribute not only to closing financial documentation gaps but also to closing kill chains with the speed and exactness required in today's complex battlespace. We've spent great treasure to gain extensive knowledge about our adversaries&mdash;even though they are never 100 percent knowable&mdash;but we have much to gain by improving knowledge about ourselves in a way that provides operational relevance, an effort that is completely within our control. In many ways, no matter if DoD ever 'passes&rdquo; a full financial statement audit, if remediation is done right, it is a step toward remedying this imbalance, creating the visibility we need to know ourselves better and improving our ability to fight and win.

The D Brief: Army’s new acquisition approach; US warns Israel on ...	All things Army: The U.S. Army will expand its new-tech effort, cut some arms programs, and overhaul its acquisition approach, Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George said Tuesday at the AUSA convention in Washington, D.C. Known as 'Transformation in Contact 2.0,&rdquo; the effort will send new tech to two armored brigade combat teams, two Stryker brigade combat teams, and other units in the Guard and Reserves, plus some 'protection and sustainment&rdquo; units by the end of fiscal year 2025. That expands the TiC effort from the three brigades that since February have been experimenting with drones, electronic warfare equipment, communications tech, and other items, many influenced by lessons from the war on Ukraine. Going stealthy: The TiC effort is running in tandem with Army efforts to hide in plain sight on the battlefield, which George said has resulted in the brigades reducing their electromagnetic and physical presence by nearly 90 percent. New acquisition approach: 'We cannot buy programs for ten years at a time anymore, technology changes too fast,&rdquo; George said. Instead, he wants to buy more things in tranches that permit more frequent changes. He also said some programs will be cut: 'old, stand-alone tech that doesn't connect to our network, equipment that can't operate in our [transforming-in-contact] formations.&rdquo; Defense One's Sam Skove has more, here.

New: U.S. weapons shipments to Israel could be in jeopardy if humanitarian conditions for besieged residents of Gaza don't improve in 30 days, Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin and State Secretary Antony Blinken warned Israeli military and diplomatic officials in a letter dated Sunday. Israeli News 12 first reported the letter's existence, copies of which were later obtained by stateside outlets like Axios and CNN. For the record: 'Israel has received more U.S. military aid than any other country since World War II,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Monday in a U.S. arms export explainer. Israel may be making things worse in Gaza, Austin and Blinken worry. 'We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government &mdash; including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90 percent of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September, continuing burdensome and excessive dual-use restrictions, and instituting new vetting and onerous liability and customs requirements for humanitarian staff and shipments &mdash; together with increased lawlessness and looting &mdash; are contributing to an accelerated deterioration in the conditions in Gaza,&rdquo; the two U.S. secretaries wrote. U.S. requirements include 'allowing at least 350 trucks a day to enter Gaza through the territory's four major crossings ahead of winter,&rdquo; and the creation of a 'new communication channel to discuss incidents surrounding civilians that would begin to be used by the end of this month,&rdquo; Politico reports. Official Pentagon reax: 'This was personal private correspondence, so I'm not going to get into more specifics of it other than, you know, it was expressing concern about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza,&rdquo; Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Tuesday. According to CNN, 'Israel appears to already be responding to the letter, at least indirectly. Just one day after the letter was sent, COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages policy for the Palestinian territories and the flow of aid into the strip, tweeted photos of aid going into Gaza.&rdquo; That tweet 'ended a two-week period during which the UN said no food aid was delivered to the north, and supplies essential for survival were running out for the 400,000 Palestinians there,&rdquo; according to the BBC. Official White House reax: The message 'was not meant as a threat,&rdquo; but 'It appears to us that [the Israelis] are taking this seriously,&rdquo; White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Tuesday.

Russia launched one of its largest drone attacks on Ukraine in months on Wednesday, sending at least 136 drones at the capital city and several other locations across the country, Kyiv's General Staff announced on social media. Ukraine says it shot down 68 of the drones; though some appear to have triggered a fire at an industrial facility in the western region of Ternopil, Reuters reports. Update: Zelenskyy outlines his new 'Victory Plan.&rdquo; Ukraine's president explained his plans to turn the tide in the nearly three-year Russian invasion in remarks before parliament Wednesday in Kyiv. The plan has five 'main points,&rdquo; and three 'secret annexes,&rdquo; President Zelenskyy said. He kicked things off with an abundance of ambition, announcing, 'The first point is an invitation to NATO. Right now,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said. Few, if any, NATO allies are pressing for such a rapid accession process; so this, perhaps more than any other aspect of his plan, falls almost entirely in the 'wishful thinking&rdquo; category. His next three points have a military focus, including more air defense systems from allies, expanding missile and drone production, and lifting restrictions on striking military targets inside Russia, among others. Read a summary, via Zelenskyy's office, here. By the way: SecDef Austin is traveling to Belgium today for a meeting of NATO defense chiefs, followed by a separate meeting of the U.S.-led counter-ISIS coalition. He then plans to fly to Italy for the first-ever G7 defense ministers meeting in Naples. 'The discussions at the G7 will center on ensuring continued security assistance for Ukraine, addressing the need to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East, exchanging views on the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific, discussing support for partners in Africa, and fostering additional cooperation on the defense industrial base and issues among world's leading democratic economies,&rdquo; Sabrina Singh said Tuesday in a short preview.

More than 11,000 soldiers and airmen have helped with hurricane recovery efforts across the American south after Milton and Helene tore across Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia, National Guard officials said this week. Update: That overall number has dropped somewhat in the last few days, with 4,500 National Guard soldiers from seven states still working the Hurricane Milton response after that storm made landfall on October 9. An estimated 4,500 others, including 3,000 Guardsmen from 13 states along with 1,500 active duty soldiers, are still helping with Helene recovery, the Pentagon said Tuesday. Among their tasks: 'Rescu[ing] hundreds of people threatened by flooding, clear[ing] roads, distribut[ing] food, water and other vital supplies, provid[ing] security, direct[ing] traffic &mdash; even provid[ing] much-needed hugs to residents reeling from the damage caused by the storms,&rdquo; the Army said Sunday. Said one Florida Guard director, Col. Blake Heidelberg: 'We're tired. I'm not going to lie.&rdquo; Follow-up: The U.S. military just revised the discharge status for hundreds of service members who had been administratively separated under the policy known as Don't Ask, Don't Tell, which prohibited gay and lesbian people from serving openly from 1993 until 2010. 'What this means is that of the nearly 13,500 individuals who were administratively separated under Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, and served long enough to receive a merit-based characterization of service, 96% now have an honorable discharge,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday, more than a year after the review was announced. 'We will continue to honor the service and the sacrifice of all our troops&mdash;including the brave Americans who raised their hands to serve but were turned away because of whom they love,&rdquo; Austin said, and vowed the military will 'strive to do right by every American patriot who has honorably served their country.&rdquo; Lastly today: Milley needs blastproof curtains. America's last Joint Chiefs Chairman Army Gen. Mark Milley told author Bob Woodward for this latest book 'that [Milley] feared being recalled to uniform to be court-martialed &lsquo;for disloyalty' should Mr. Trump win re-election,&rdquo; the New York Times reported in an election analysis published Wednesday. But that's not all. 'After criticizing Mr. Trump in a pointed retirement speech, General Milley told Mr. Woodward that he installed bulletproof glass and blastproof curtains at his home.&rdquo; Why bring it up? The U.S. election is just three weeks away. But in just the last few days, Trump has described his political opponents as 'evil&rdquo; and an 'enemy from within&rdquo; that could cause chaos and disruptions on Election Day&mdash;carrying forward his 2016 conception of the United States as a place of 'carnage,&rdquo; as he proclaimed in his inauguration speech, with Trump as the only solution. Such a chaotic Election Day scenario, he said in an interview with Fox on Sunday, 'should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen.&rdquo; 'They are so bad and frankly, they're evil,&rdquo; Trump said at a rally on Monday. 'They're evil. What they've done, they've weaponized, they've weaponized our elections. They've done things that nobody thought was even possible.&rdquo; Worth noting: 'Never before has a presidential nominee &mdash; let alone a former president &mdash; openly suggested turning the military on American citizens simply because they oppose his candidacy,&rdquo; the Times reported Wednesday. In so doing, 'Trump is offering voters the choice of a very different, and far less democratic, form of American government.&rdquo; Related reading: 'The Trump Voters Who Don't Believe Trump,&rdquo; the Times reported separately on Monday, noting 'many of his supporters assume it's just an act&rdquo;; 'Trump Plans to Amp Up His Violent, Bigoted Rhetoric in Closing Pitch to Voters,&rdquo; via Rolling Stone, reporting Saturday; find similar reporting from late September, here; 'Republicans face backlash for lawsuits targeting overseas and military voting,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Monday; And 'Trump [is] likely to challenge any election loss.

Army to expand tech equipping effort	The Army will expand a new equipment-fielding initiative focused on drones, electronic warfare, and other modern tech to several more units, service leader Gen. Randy George said Tuesday. Two armored brigade combat teams, two Stryker brigade combat teams, and other units in the Guard and Reserves will all get new tech under the program, which George dubbed 'Transformation in Contact 2.0.&rdquo; The Army's transformation-in-contact, or TiC, approach launched in February with the service flooding three brigades with drones, electronic warfare equipment, communications tech, and other technologies. The three brigades are the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division; 2nd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division; and 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. The effort draws in part on lessons learned from Ukraine, where significant drone use has defined the battlefield and underscored the need for smaller command posts as well as counter-drone operations. The three original brigades now boast more than 140 drones, George said. The effort is running in tandem with Army efforts to hide in plain sight on the battlefield, which George said has resulted in the brigades reducing their electromagnetic and physical presence by nearly 90 percent. [[Related Posts]] Transformation in Contact 2.0 will also equip 'protection and sustainment&rdquo; units by the end of fiscal year 2025, George said. Additionally, George said, the Army will focus on three other priorities: improving counter-drone systems, increasing the range and accuracy of Army long-range missiles and other forms of indirect fire, and modernizing Army munitions manufacturing. 'We have to give every formation the right systems to sense, seek, and defeat enemy [drones] to enhance their protection and security,&rdquo; George said. George also repeatedly emphasized that the Army could no longer afford to take a decade or more to field systems. 'We cannot buy programs for ten years at a time anymore, technology changes too fast.&rdquo; Going forward, the service will cut programs that don't support transformation-in-contact efforts, George said. 'There are also some things that we are going to stop buying: old, stand-alone tech that doesn't connect to our network, equipment that can't operate in our [transforming-in-contact] formations, all of the outdated stuff that isn't survivable on the modern battlefield,&rdquo; George said. That could include the cancellation of programs of record, he added. In place of the old acquisition progress, George wants to buy more equipment in tranches, so the Army can purchase different systems from year to year to fulfill a defined need, such as drones. The method would allow the Army to buy whatever technology is newest, rather than committing to a single platform that may be outdated by the time it's rolled out to the last brigade. 'It should be clear to all of us that the days where we indiscriminately could buy an entire Army's worth of inventory in a single program of record are gone,&rdquo; said George. 'We can't afford to invest in obsolescence.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/army-expand-tech-equipping-effort/400296/	2024-10-15T14:33:49-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/15/Screenshot_2024_10_15_at_11.31.38AM-1/large.png
US Army rushes to boost defenses as Russia ups strike-drone auton...	Russia is giving its armed drones more autonomy as Ukraine's defenses tighten, a dynamic that has the U.S. Army working harder to bulk up its own anti-drone and -missile systems, service and industry officials said. Defense One caught up with Sgt. Maj. Kellen Rowley, the top enlisted leader of the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, at the AUSA conference in Washington, D.C. We asked him whether Russia is increasingly relying on autonomy software for drone attacks in order to thwart defensive measures that target the connection between the weapons and their operators. 'They are,&rdquo; Rowley said. 'They are becoming more adaptive. We saw them struggle quite a bit with dynamic targeting. As time has gone on, they've adapted.&rdquo; He declined to comment further. An official from Epirus, which makes advanced counter-drone defenses, said greater autonomy was a growing trend in Russian drone attacks on Ukraine. 'There is clear evidence that full drone autonomy and swarming technology will become more pervasive in this new era of asymmetric warfare. One significant advancement in drone tech we've been closely tracking is the use of fiber-optic-guided and AI-enabled UAS that are immune to jamming and other EW countermeasures. Without a connection to jam or spoof, AI-enabled drones have seen success in Ukraine,&rdquo; the official told Defense One. [[Related Posts]] Epirus makes the Leonidas high-powered microwave system, which is designed to overloads an incoming drone's circuits with energy. That's just one example of the various solutions that the Army is rushing to put in place to deal with drone threats that are growing more diverse and difficult to stop. Russia, Iran, China and North Korea are deepening their collaboration in multiple theaters, resulting in ever-more-capable drones emerging from adversaries that weren't considered terribly high-tech. Maj. Gen. David F. Stewart, a leader of the Army's efforts on fires and anti-drone systems, told the crowd at AUSA that better drones and new tactics are enabling even low-tech adversaries to punch up their attacks, such as a Hezbollah drone strike that killed four Israeli soldiers on Sunday. 'We're seeing a lot of changes in tactics to take these procedures from the adversary. Their flight profiles now are becoming more challenging for radar systems to detect,&rdquo; said Stewart, the director of the Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office and director of fires at the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff. 'I think the better capability to detect the Group 1, 2, and 3 would be very helpful.&rdquo; Brig. Gen. Patrick Costello, who leads the 94th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, said that some new adversary drone weapons were emulating U.S. technology advancements, a trend further enabled by collaboration with Russia and China. 'North Korea recently unveiled a reconnaissance and multi-role UAV that employs a reverse engineered copy of a Hellfire missile similar to an RQ-4 and MQ-9. And so as we watch the relationships that are building,&rdquo; Costello said. He said the Army had just finished an engineering test with the Northrop Grumman XM1211 High Explosive Proximity round, an air-defense munition that is designed to explode near drones that may be attempting counter maneuvers. 'We want to extend it further,&rdquo; he said, with work on an anti-drone proximity round that can be fired from an Mk19 40mm belt-fed automatic grenade launcher. But the need for better drone defenses in more places is adding pressure on the Army to more quickly adapt as it meets the needs of partners. An example is last October's decision to send two Iron Dome systems back to Israel. U.S. Army Multi-Domain Task Force teams in the Indo-Pacific region are working to develop an entirely new capability to replace those Iron Domes: the Indirect Fire Protection Capability &ndash; High-Power Microwave, or IFPC-HPM, also from Epirus. 'We have soldiers out there testing the system. We will be employing it in the next couple of years. As the formation grows, we'll transition from structure of two Iron Dome batteries to a structure of three IFPC batteries, giving us nine platoons worth the capability,&rdquo; he said. 'Absolutely [we are] watching what's going on in CENTCOM, absolutely watching what's going on in UConn, taking every one of those lessons that we could, that we could apply to our theater.&rdquo; But counter-drone defenses are more complicated than roboticized attack drones for reasons beyond autonomy and technology, such as the increasing bureaucratic burdens of trying to work with more partners. Said Rowley of the 10th AMDC, 'I think probably our single biggest challenge is operating inside of NATO. There are 32 member nations in NATO, and our adversaries are exporting gaps to NATO policy. Group one, group one, UAS are able to operate below the threshold, and it's a challenging bit for us, under peacetime conditions and authorities for soldiers to recognize when they should or can engage.. All of that points to a need for more collaboration across the services, the U.S. government and with researchers, industry, and partners, said Stewart, the counter-drone office chief. 'I'm pushing for a whole-of-nation approach, not just a whole government. When we're talking about other interagency partners, it really is going to have to be academia. You're going to have to have the government involved, and then on down the line with the industry as well.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/us-army-rushes-boost-defenses-russia-ups-strike-drone-autonomy/400291/	2024-10-15T13:53:51-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/15/Screenshot_2024_10_15_at_10.45.24AM/large.png
Protest puts Army’s HADES spy plane on hold	Work is paused on the U.S. Army's effort to equip high-flying jets with spy gear as L3Harris protests the service's decision to give the contract to the Sierra Nevada Corporation. In August, SNC won a 12-year contract worth up to almost $1 billion to load Bombardier's Global 6500 jet with spy systems, beating out a team of three companies: L3Harris, Leidos, and MAG Aerospace. L3Harris filed a formal protest on Sept. 16 asking the Government Accountability Office to review the decision, according to a company spokesperson. 'We carefully reviewed the information during the Army's debrief process, which led us to challenge the HADES decision and request further analysis to ensure the proposal received an equitable evaluation,&rdquo; they said. This protest is only a 'temporary setback,&rdquo; said Tim Harper, SNC's vice president of business development. Harper said he's confident in the process and awaits the GAO's decision. 'We stand by our proposed solution and the experienced team of professionals who have diligently worked to create an aerial ISR solution that will give the Army the advantage required for the near-peer fight. Regarding the protest, we remain fully committed and are confident in the superiority of our solution and the Army's selection of SNC for the HADES contract,&rdquo; Harper said. Army officials have previously called 'deep sensing&rdquo;&mdash;that is, efforts to track enemies at a distance&mdash;the service's No. 1 operational imperative for the Army of 2030. The office will make a decision on the protest by Dec. 26. Aviation Week was first to report the protest. As work on HADES is stalled, SNC is continuing to work on the Army's Theater-Level High-Altitude Expeditionary Next Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platform&mdash;called ATHENA, which is gearing up for flight tests this month. The Army is using ATHENA and other prototype programs to figure out requirements ahead of HADES production.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/protest-puts-armys-hades-spy-plane-hold/400277/	2024-10-15T10:06:06-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/15/snc_army_hades_intel_bizjet_contract_copy/large.jpg
In Pacific, Army brigade tweaks its modernization program for jun...	The lone Pacific brigade chosen for the Army's new equipment strategy is finding that the new tech has unique advantages for its terrain &mdash; as well as challenges, the unit's commanding general said Friday. The unit, the 2nd Brigade of the Hawaii-based 25th Infantry Division, is one of just three brigades selected for the Army's 'transforming-in-contact&rdquo; strategy. The two others are the 101st Airborne Division's 2nd Brigade and the 10th Mountain Division's 3rd Brigade. Under the strategy, units are given a range of new tech and told to figure out how to best use it at their home bases and in challenging field exercises. The Army has so focused on drone, counter-drone, and electronic warfare for the strategy, drawing in part on lessons from Ukraine. In an exercise running Oct. 7 to 16 at the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center, the unit brought as many as 150 small drones, said 25th Infantry Division commander Maj. Gen. Marcus Evans. Those drones include around 130 Skydio drones fielded under the Army's Short Range Reconnaissance program, plus Parrot and Teal drones, a 25th Infantry Division public affairs officer said. The Army also leased several Kraus K1000 drones, the spokesperson added. That's a lot more small drones than Army units have generally carried. The service only recently began acquiring such systems and so far has bought them in quantities of a few hundred a year&mdash;generally under the Short Range Reconnaissance Program. Evans said the unit's drones and electronic warfare units are seeing successes in the exercise. After spotting a 'enemy&rdquo; unit through electronic means, they tracked it with drones, and then called in a simulated loitering-munition strike. The unit uses the Switchblade 600 loitering munition, which the Army acquires under the Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance, or LASSO, program. Based on advice from the 101st's 2nd Brigade and their own experience, the 25th's 2nd Brigade has also increased the number of Starlink satellite terminals it uses, Evans said. The 19-by-12-inch dishes provide far faster transmission speeds than traditional Army satellite systems, while being much more portable and easier to hide. The brigade is experimenting with three to four terminals that the commander can re-distribute as necessary, as well as two terminals per battalion. Sustainment assets also get Starlink terminals, Evans said. The terminals are particularly useful for allowing sustainment efforts to disperse, thereby becoming harder to hit. 'They can't all stay together, because they will be targetable,&rdquo; he said. Starlink devices are particularly important in the vast distances of the Pacific. One battalion, for example, is deployed 200 miles away from its brigade command, on a different island, Evans said. The Starlinks allow the brigade to 'overcome the tyranny of distance,&rdquo; he said. At the same time, some Pacific-related factors&mdash;like heat&mdash;play havoc with the very systems at the center of the 'transforming-in-contact&rdquo; experiment. During a previous rotation to the Philippines, drones had 'much less endurance&rdquo; because heat drained their batteries, Evans said. To get more power, the 25th Infantry is testing out a solar-powered generator that allows small light infantry units to recharge batteries used for drones and other systems, he said. The Pacific rains also made problems for drones and mission command systems. Fortunately, the 2nd Brigade has partners &mdash; the two other brigades that are also going through transformation-in-contact. Evans said the 2nd Brigade works closely with the 101st's 2nd Brigade, and has duplicated many elements of how that unit has set itself up. 'Our collaboration with them has been nearly seamless from how we structure our network to how to employ deception measures,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/pacific-army-brigade-tweaks-its-modernization-program-jungle-warfare/400275/	2024-10-15T09:29:51-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/15/2nd_brigade_462793396_957422419759085_8170544672272077243_n/large.jpg
The D Brief: Chinese blockade drill encircles Taiwan; Army progra...	New: China's military carried out snap drills Monday encircling the democratic island of Taiwan, and it did so with no 24-hour notification, no specific locations announced, and no end date for what it referred to as its Joint Sword 2024B exercises&mdash;the -A portion having occurred this past May. Beijing's stated objectives included a 'blockade of key ports and areas,&rdquo; and practicing an 'assault on maritime and ground targets.&rdquo; China's Coast Guard also patrolled the waters surrounding Taiwan over the course of the 12-hour exercise. And Beijing set a new record for aerial pestering around Taiwan, using 153 aircraft&mdash;111 of which entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone, according to Taipei Defense Ministry. 'This is the highest single-day total ever recorded,&rdquo; said Taiwan-watcher Ian Ellis. Taiwan's defense ministry condemned China's actions as 'irrational and provocative&rdquo; and vowed to 'deploy appropriate forces to respond and defend our national sovereignty.&rdquo; It also distributed a map purporting to show China's operating areas around the island. Worth noting: The drills occurred four days after Taiwan President William Lai delivered a 'National Day&rdquo; speech in which he said officials in Beijing have 'no right to represent Taiwan&rdquo; and that the democratic island is 'not subordinate&rdquo; to Beijing, the Taipei Times reports. Official Chinese military reax: The exercises are 'a stern warning to the separatist acts of &lsquo;Taiwan independence' forces,&rdquo; and 'a legitimate and necessary operation for safeguarding national sovereignty and national unity,&rdquo; Eastern Theater Command spokesman Senior Captain Li Xi said in a statement. Official Pentagon reax: 'This military pressure operation is irresponsible, disproportionate, and destabilizing,&rdquo; Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement Monday. 'It is a long-standing tradition for Taiwan's president to deliver remarks on [October 10],&rdquo; he said. 'It is a routine, domestic-focused address that has historically prompted little response from the [People's Republic of China]. Still, the PRC has chosen this opportunity to take provocative, military action.&rdquo; Expert reax: 'It was pretty clear from the outset that no matter what President Lai said, Beijing would use his address to &lsquo;justify' the exercises,&rdquo; said consultant J. Michael Cole. Was China looking to impress Russia? Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov visited Beijing on the very day the snap drills took place, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted Monday evening. 'Russian forces have experience repelling Ukrainian autonomous naval drone strikes against Russian naval and port infrastructure, and the [Chinese military] may hope to absorb some of these lessons in planning for the PRC's potential future actions against Taiwan,&rdquo; ISW wrote atop their daily assessment. New: Taiwan's army just signed contracts to buy nearly 1,000 U.S.-made attack drones, including 685 Switchblade 300 loitering munitions and 291 Altius 600M-V anti-armor attack drones, the South China Morning Post reported Tuesday. Altogether, the contracts are just under $164 million. But don't expect these anytime soon: 'The Switchblade drones are expected to be delivered by the end of November 2029 while the Altius drones are expected to be delivered by the end of 2027,&rdquo; SCMP writes.

Ingram was on the deck of his submarine, Cassin (DD-43), when a German torpedo approached; he rushed to throw depth charges overboard to prevent their detonation and died in the torpedo's explosion. He received the Medal of Honor and became the namesake of a U.S. Navy warship, the first U.S. enlisted sailor so honored. Developing: The Pentagon is sending a THAAD air defense battery to Israel in anticipation of additional attacks from Iran. After all, according to manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the system is a 'combat-proven defense capability against short, medium and intermediate-range ballistic missile threats.&rdquo; And Iran has an enormous stockpile of ballistic missiles, as think tanks like the Center for Strategic and International Studies note. Latest: 'An advance team of U.S. military personnel and initial components&rdquo; arrived Monday, with the rest expected 'in the coming days,&rdquo; the Pentagon's Maj. Gen. Ryder said in a statement Tuesday morning. Sending the battery to Israel 'underscores the United States' commitment to the defense of Israel and to defend Americans in Israel from any ballistic missile attacks by Iran,&rdquo; Ryder said, declining to elaborate on precise timelines 'for operations security reasons.&rdquo; By the way: Israel 'faces a looming shortage of interceptor missiles as it prepares itself for attacks from Iran and its proxies,&rdquo; the Financial Times reported Tuesday, citing industry executives, former military officials and analysts. Developing: Israel is also planning to attack Iranian military targets instead of its energy sector, the Washington Post reported Monday afternoon. Israeli officials have promised a response following Iran's attack on October 1 featuring around 200 ballistic missiles, many of which appear to have struck an air force base hosting F-35 jets in southern Israel, according to satellite imagery. Oil prices dropped 4% on the news, Reuters reported Tuesday morning. ICYMI: A Hezbollah drone attack Sunday killed four Israeli soldiers and wounded 61 others in the town of Binyamina. The Iran-backed militants used at least three different kinds of projectiles&mdash;drones, rockets, and three precision missiles&mdash;simultaneously to attack Israel, which likely contributed to the attack's unusually high casualty count, according to a preliminary investigation by the Israeli air force. 'The [Israeli] Navy and Iron Dome [air defense system] intercepted two of the drones near Nahariya and Acre but detection systems lost track of a third drone, a Shahed 107&mdash;which ultimately impacted in Binyamina,&rdquo; the Washington-based ISW relayed Monday afternoon. Notable: Hezbollah reportedly attempted a similar tactic on Monday, but did not have similar results.

New: The U.S. Army wants to recruit 61,000 new soldiers this fiscal year, which is a sharp increase over last year, Defense One's Sam Skove reported Monday from the annual Association of the U.S. Army convention in Washington. The 61,000 number is similar to the Army's 2022 recruiting goal of 60,000 and its 2023 target of 65,000 new soldiers. Both years the Army missed its target by about 15,000 soldiers, Skove writes. But the service exceeded its fiscal year 2024 recruiting target of 55,000 new soldiers&mdash;though by just half a percent. Notable: Secretary Christine Wormuth signaled that the Army is open to cutting more programs. That warning comes nine months after the service canceled a major helicopter program because it said unmanned, current, and space-based assets could do the job. (The service had already spent nearly $2 billion on the program, known as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft.) 'As we continue modernizing our weapons systems, we are also asking ourselves every step of the way, 'Does this capability make our troops more lethal?&rdquo; Wormuth said. 'If the answer to any of those questions is 'no' or even 'maybe,' we are willing to make hard choices and adjust course.&rdquo; More, here. Also in Defense One: 'The X-Men and Avengers have lessons for international defense cooperation,&rdquo; writes retired Air Force Lt. Col. Dan Ward, who is now Senior Principal Systems Engineer at the MITRE Corporation; And global 'Sales of anti-armor missiles [are] projected to slow,&rdquo; according to a report from our sister site, Forecast International. And lastly: Former President Trump suggested using the National Guard and military against his political enemies. In an echo of 1950s-era Sen. Joe McCarthy, the GOP presidential candidate said on a Sunday interview show that the United States is threatened by an 'enemy from within.&rdquo; And should a violence break out on Election Day, 'I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen,&rdquo; he told a Fox interviewer, adding that 'the bigger problem is the enemy from within, not even the people that have come in and destroyed our country.&rdquo; Who is the enemy? He named Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who presented evidence against him during his first impeachment trial.

Sales of anti-armor missiles projected to slow	The long-predicted demise of the tank has not arrived yet, despite the continuing sales of anti-tank munitions. Armed forces will likely spend $20 billion on short-range anti-armor weapons in the next decade, according to a new report out from Forecast International. Annual sales are expected to dip in the short term, but will likely rise again after that, with total production expected to average around 26,000, the report says. The U.S. and Europe are working on new missiles to meet the needs of different military services. The U.S. Joint Air-to-Ground Missile program has seen several delays to its planned in-service date, but appears to be avoiding the fate of its predecessor: the cancelled Joint Common Missile program. U.S. firms, such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are the leading players in this market, accounting for a combined 28 percent value share with the Javelin joint venture and other programs. Europe's position has declined to around a 19 percent value share but is expected to improve with the development of new systems. Europe is moving to develop new anti-armor missiles and hold on to its share of this market. The MMP (Akeron MP) and MLP programs aim to replace the MILAN and HOT, respectively. MBDA is working to interest more European companies in participating in these programs. A trend to watch out for: anti-ship missiles have begun to become multi-purpose weapons that can engage a wider variety of targets. Could anti-armor missiles be next?	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/militaries-are-snapping-anti-armor-missiles/400267/	2024-10-14T16:15:10-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/14/A_Ukrainian_Army_sol_2500/large.jpg
Army ups recruiting target for FY25 after hitting goal	The Army wants to recruit 61,000 new soldiers this fiscal year, a sharp increase over last year and a return to the higher goals of the previous two years. The target is 'ambitious, but achievable,&rdquo; Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said as the annual meeting of the Association of the U.S. Army, or AUSA, opened on Monday in downtown Washington, D.C. The Army has already begun working on its fiscal 2025 goal: recruiters have enlisted some 11,000 soldiers who will begin serving next year under the delayed entry program. The Army exceeded its fiscal year 2024 recruiting target of 55,000 new soldiers by half a percent. Its success was due in part to its implementation of a program designed to get applicants' physical fitness and test scores up to scratch. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, this Future Soldier Preparatory Course graduated 13,206 students into basic training in 2024. The 61,000 number is similar to the Army's 2022 recruiting goal of 60,000 and its 2023 target of 65,000 new soldiers. Both years the Army missed its goal by about 15,000 soldiers. The service has attributed its recruiting struggles to low unemployment numbers, the prevalence of obesity, and the COVID-19 pandemic preventing recruiters from visiting high schools. At the same time, the Army is working to retain the talent it already has, especially in technically complex fields like electronic warfare and drone operation, which are at the center of an Army modernization pushed dubbed 'transforming in contact.&rdquo; Speaking at a media roundtable after Wormuth's speech, Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Randy George said retention numbers are higher than normal in the three brigades selected for the modernization program. Wormuth also signaled that the Army is open to cutting more programs, nine months after canceling a major helicopter program because it concluded unmanned, current, and space-based assets could do the job. The Army had already spent nearly $2 billion on the program, the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft. 'As we continue modernizing our weapons systems, we are also asking ourselves every step of the way, 'Does this capability make our troops more lethal?&rdquo; Wormuth said. 'If the answer to any of those questions is 'no&rdquo; or even 'maybe,&rdquo; we are willing to make hard choices and adjust course.&rdquo; The Army is also collaborating with Congress to develop what Wormuth called 'more agile funding&rdquo; mechanisms to acquire drones and counter-drone and electronic warfare technology. The service recently worked with Congress to reprogram money to start fielding company-level drones in 2025 instead of 2024, and to field 3D printers to units for creating their own drones, Army acquisition secretary chief Doug Bush said at an event held by think tank CSIS.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/army-ups-recruiting-target-fy25-after-hitting-goal/400265/	2024-10-14T15:43:56-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/14/Army_Secretary_Chris_2500/large.jpg
