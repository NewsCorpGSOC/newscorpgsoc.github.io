The D Brief: Russia increases drone strikes; US troops attacked i...	Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin visited Ukraine to announce a new $400 million U.S. weapons pledge Monday. Austin's trip, his fourth as defense secretary, comes as the rate of daily Russian drone attacks have reportedly risen nearly threefold over the past two months heading into winter. At least 116 Russian drones targeted locations across the invaded country, including 10 sent to the capital city from several directions and in different waves over about five hours, military official Serhiy Popko said on Telegram. Panning out: Russian drone attacks in Ukraine 'have increased from 350 strikes in July, to 750 in August, to 1,500 in September,&rdquo; the New York Times reports, citing two Western officials. Austin met with President Volodymir Zelenskyy to discuss 'Ukraine's air defense capabilities, preparations for the winter period, and the expansion of long-range weapon use against Russian military targets,&rdquo; Zelenskyy wrote on social media, thanking the White House as well as 'both parties in the U.S. Congress, and the American people for all their support.&rdquo; Developing: Estonia is looking to acquire weapons and gear to hit an invading force before it reaches the country's borders, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reported this weekend. Officials in Tallinn are also considering boosting their spending on anti-air defenses, perhaps short-range man-portable missiles or longer-range interceptors, the head of Estonia's defense procurement office said. Details, here. NATO chief Mark Rutte called South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Monday, both officials confirmed afterward. Driving that conversation: Recent allegations North Korea has sent around 1,500 special forces to Russia for use against Ukraine. Rutte: 'North Korea sending troops to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine would mark a significant escalation,&rdquo; the new alliance chief said on social media Monday. Yoon: 'Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the reckless military alignment between Russia and North Korea once again confirm that the security of the Indo-Pacific region and the Atlantic region are inextricably linked,&rdquo; the South Korean leader said in a statement. 'This undermines the rules-based international order, threatening peace on the Korean Peninsula and globally, and the government will never stand by and let this happen,&rdquo; he wrote. Expert reax: 'Manpower is likely the single most important factor in the war,&rdquo; said Rob Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. 'If Ukraine's mobilization numbers continue to decrease and Russia can sustain its monthly recruitment efforts (including possibly with North Korean soldiers), the situation will continue to deteriorate unless Ukraine's foreign partners can provide greater support,&rdquo; he warned on social media Saturday.

On this day in 1944, Japanese pilots carried out what some historians believe to be the first-ever deliberate kamikaze attack when an Aichi D3A struck Aussie cruiser HMAS Australia's foremast in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, killing 30 people, including the ship's captain, and wounding 64 others. Update: Navy pronounces missing EA-18G Growler aviators dead. The electronic warfare jet crashed east of Mount Rainier on Tuesday. Their names are being withheld pending notification of next of kin, AP reports. GAO: The U.S. Army has a fleet of 70 boats, but less than 40% are ready to go. That's a steep drop from 75% just four years ago for a fleet spread across Virginia, Hawaii, and Japan, according to a congressionally-mandated watchdog report published last week. Why bring it up? 'Demand for Army watercraft is increasing, especially in the Indo-Pacific,&rdquo; the Government Accountability Office writes in its report. Some of those boats were also called upon to help in the construction a pier for humanitarian aid to Gaza this past spring; in the process, four were beached after becoming unmoored, scattering the pier during bad weather in late May. A Navajo Code Talker from World War II has died at 107. John Kinsel Sr., was among the hundreds of Navajos recruited by the Marines to serve as Code Talkers during the war, 'transmitting messages based on their then-unwritten native language,&rdquo; AP reports. 'They confounded Japanese military cryptologists during World War II and participated in all assaults the Marines led in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945, including at Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Peleliu and Iwo Jima.&rdquo; Just two Code Talkers remain alive: Thomas H. Begay and Peter MacDonald, a former Navajo Chairman. U.S. and U.S.-backed Syrian forces at the Conoco Base in Deir ez Zour were attacked Saturday by rockets that reportedly triggered counter-battery fire.

How might Donald Trump use the U.S. military if he returned to the Oval Office? Against his political enemies, as the GOP president said recently in a Fox interview. Former members of Trump's own national-security team have issued their own warnings about their former boss, documenting his interest in shooting protestors and calling him 'the most dangerous person to this country.&rdquo; Mark Esper: 'He's spoken about this before. If you recall a year ago or so, he spoke about a second Trump term being about retribution. So, yes, I think we should take those words seriously,&rdquo; the former defense secretary told CNN last week. Members of the military should think carefully about how they would react to such orders, observers said. 'If he wins [the] election, the military will be asked to do things that violate their oath of office&mdash;the oath they swear to the Constitution. And what are they going to do? They need to think about it ahead of time,&rdquo; said political scientist Matthew MacWilliams. Rewind: Echoing other scholars of authoritarianism, National Defense University Gregory Foster has suggested troops and commanders contemplate their moral, ethical, and legal duties now.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-21-2024/400404/	2024-10-21T08:15:14-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/21/DB_lander/large.png
Trump’s radical view would test the military	How might Donald Trump use the U.S. military if he returned to the Oval Office? Against his political enemies, he says. That's not a warning from his former defense secretary, who has documented the then-president's interest in shooting protestors, nor from the man he appointed chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has since called him 'the most dangerous person to this country.&rdquo; Those are the GOP presidential candidate's own words. Members of the military should think carefully now about how they would react to such orders, observers said. In an extraordinary escalation of rhetoric, Trump suggested the deployment of the National Guard or military against what he terms 'the enemy from within,' which he said included members of his political opposition. The remarks, aired during an Oct. 13 interview on Fox, mark an unprecedented departure from any major-party presidential candidate's publicly evinced view of the role of the military in domestic politics. Trump, asked whether he anticipated Election Day unrest, dismissed concerns about his own supporters and turned his focus to the political opposition, declaring that 'radical left lunatics' posed the true threat. His proposed solution? 'It should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen,&rdquo; he said. The interview Elsewhere in the Oct. 13 interview, Trump also named a former political antagonist as an 'enemy from within.&rdquo; When Fox's Maria Bartiromo asked, 'How are you going to guard against the bureaucrats undermining you?&rdquo;, he responded: 'Well, I always say we have two enemies. We have the outside enemy and then we have the enemy from within, and the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia, and all these countries because if you have a smart president he can handle them pretty easily. I handled&mdash;I got along great with all with&mdash;I handled them. [Much evidence suggests otherwise.] But the thing that's tougher to handle are these lunatics we got inside like Adam Schiff, Adam Shifty Schiff. Thing is this guy's going to be a senator. He's running against a guy who doesn't understand politics at all. Garvey. But he was a good baseball player. But he doesn't understand politics at all. Adam Shifty Schiff, who's a total sleazebag, is gonna become a senator. I call him the enemy from within. You look at the danger he put our country in, potentially, because of Russia with a phony made-up deal that he made up with Hillary and some bad people....&rdquo; Trump was apparently referring to his 2019 impeachment, when he was tried in the Senate for attempting to gin up political dirt by withholding military aid to Ukraine and for allegedly blocking Congressional investigations. Then-Rep. Schiff, D-California, led the House presentation of evidence. He might also have been alluding to the GOP-led Senate investigation that documented 'hundreds of actions by Trump, his campaign, and his associates in the run-up to the 2016 election that involve some degree of participation by Trump or his associates in Russian activity,&rdquo; as Lawfare put it. Trump has long threatened to use state power for personal revenge&mdash;for example, to 'lock up' Hillary Clinton, jail social-media CEOs, and prosecute a wide range of other people, from election workers to the federal and state prosecutors who have charged him with crimes. But by suggesting that domestic political rivals pose an existential threat akin to foreign enemies, he sets up his case for military action. It's a well-worn tactic of authoritarians, whose language Trump apes and whose policies he admires, right down to his stated desire to become a dictator. (Only 'on day one,&rdquo; he said, echoing would-be autocrats' usual promise to resume normal governance at some point.) And Trump has long called for using troops domestically. During his presidency, he repeatedly talked about sending the National Guard to deal with civil unrest, such as the protests following the killing of George Floyd. (Notably, he did not send in the Guard when his supporters stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021.) As a candidate, Trump has vowed to use the military inside America. 'As he has sought a return to power, he has made clear that he intends to use the military for a range of domestic law enforcement purposes, including patrolling the border, suppressing protests that he deems to have turned into riots and even fighting crime in big cities run by Democrats,&rdquo; the New York Times wrote in August. The decline of guardrails Such actions would not necessarily be illegal. Constitutionally, Congress may authorize the deployment of the militia 'to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.&rdquo; With the 1807 Insurrection Act, lawmakers broadly delegated this authorization to the U.S. president, who may call out the troops if 'any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy&rdquo; hinders the execution of state or federal law. (And the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act does not bar the use of troops for law enforcement 'in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.&rdquo;) But the Insurrection Act has been used to deploy troops just twice since the 1960s. 'Why the reticence in using this law?&rdquo; Elizabeth Goitein of Brennan Center wrote in 2020. 'Simply, Americans don't like the idea of armored tanks rolling into their cities. It smacks of authoritarianism; it goes against our values and our national self-concept. And so, even in cases where the Insurrection Act might provide a legal opening&mdash;for instance, in the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina&mdash;the fear of political blowback has been enough to stop presidents from exploiting it.&rdquo; Today, it's not clear that any legal opening is even necessary, thanks to the Supreme Court's recent decision to grant the U.S. president immunity from criminal acts in the conduct of official duties. 'It's almost impossible to conceive of any presidential use of the military as unofficial or private business,&rdquo; National Defense University professor Gregory Foster wrote in a recent op-ed. (One former acting vice chief of the National Guard said it would be easy for a president to turn Guard units into his 'personal police force.&rdquo; Randy Manner, a retired Army two-star, told CNN recently that if Trump found one state governor to go along, he could authorize funds to 'use the National Guard almost in any way that he wants...Most Americans don't know how very easy it would be for an unhinged president to use the military against our own citizens.&rdquo;) Far from worrying about political blowback for sounding authoritarian, Trump is making political hay of it. In 2016, a voter's inclination toward authoritarianism was a better predictor of support for Trump's candidacy than race, gender, or education. Four years later, a quartet of surveys found that some 18 percent of Americans were highly disposed to authoritarianism, and 'a further 23 percent or so are just one step below them on the authoritarian scale,&rdquo; wrote political scientist Matthew MacWilliams. 'When activated by fear, authoritarian-leaning Americans are predisposed to trade civil liberties for strongman solutions to secure law and order; and they are ready to strip civil liberties from those defined as the &lsquo;other.'&rdquo; Who does Trump call the 'other&rdquo;? Immigrants and minority groups, to be sure, but as of this week, also members of the opposition political party. His statements raise the prospect that U.S. troops might be deployed against Americans dubbed 'the enemy&rdquo; for voicing opposition to a president. Mark Esper, who served as defense secretary under Trump, says his former boss intends to do so. 'He's spoken about this before. If you recall a year ago or so, he spoke about a second Trump term being about retribution. So, yes, I think we should take those words seriously,&rdquo; Esper told CNN this week. What happens if he does give the order? The U.S. military, which spends the vast majority of its time contemplating and preparing for contingencies, should prepare for this one as well. Echoing scholars of authoritarianism, NDU's Foster suggests troops and commanders contemplate their moral, ethical, and legal duties now. MacWilliams agrees. 'If he wins [the] election, the military will be asked to do things that violate their oath of office&mdash;the oath they swear to the Constitution. And what are they going to do? They need to think about it ahead of time,&rdquo; he said in a recent interview. 'If Trump wins, the military will decide the future of this country by the actions that it takes.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/trumps-radical-view-would-test-military/400385/	2024-10-18T12:04:20-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/18/trump_GettyImages_2178637365/large.jpg
Estonia considering missiles, drones that can strike inside Russi...	Estonia is looking to acquire weapons and gear to hit an invading force before it reaches the country's borders, the head of its defense procurement office says. 'With our current investments and the additional investments into defense, we actually look to attain the ability to do deep strikes into enemy territory and&hellip; effective shaping operations,&rdquo; Magnus-Valdemar Saar, director of the Centre for Defence Investment, told Defense One in an interview this week. Ukraine, after years of pleading with the White House for long-range ATACMS missiles, received in April is now pleading to be allowed to use them to hit targets deeper inside of Russia. ATACMS have a range of 300 kilometers. 'We have learned from this conflict [in Ukraine] that you need to be able to conduct your shaping operations really effectively, meaning that you need to carry the effects deep to enemies,&rdquo; Saar said. 'If we look at operational level from, you know, brigades, division, you cannot just have a close fight anymore&rdquo; with anti-tank weapons and the like. 'You need to carry the effects deeper. You need to start shaping&rdquo;&mdash;that is, taking out enemy forces before they reach the front line. Saar didn't say just what that could entail, only that 'deep&rdquo; was a matter somewhat of subjective opinion. Estonia has already announced plans to create a loitering munitions unit, which Saar said will reach initial operating capability by the end of the year, flying drones with a range of about 100 kilometers, he said. The country has also announced a contract to purchase Vulcano 155 guided munitions from Diehl and have purchased six High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, launchers along with Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, or GMLRS, rockets. HIMARS can also fire ATACMS rockets. Related to that, said Saar, they are also considering the purchase of new capabilities in Intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance. 'It's just not about the effectors that can fly, maybe, I don't know, 300 kilometers, like the ATACMS missile but also, you know, if you're striking that far, you need to know where the target is. You need to be quite precise.&rdquo; Saar said Estonia must move more quickly than NATO to bolster its own national defense. 'This discussion, the [NATO Defense Planning] process, is rather lengthy, and this discussion&ndash;who will provide what forces for the plans&ndash;is also ongoing, So it will take some time to have clarity on those issues,&rdquo; he said. Saar described NDP discussions as 'well-synched&rdquo; but added that the presence of a defensive alliance doesn't lessen the need for Estonia to move rapidly to acquire new weapons as well. The country may also boost spending on anti-air defenses, perhaps short-range man-portable missiles or longer-range interceptors, he said. 'As part of our next cycle for for defense planning, up to year 2035, we will at least consider&hellip;we will at least go through the exercise, of looking at having something even longer range than the IRIS-T,&rdquo; a German air defense system from Diehl with a range of 40 kilometers, which Estonia already has. Such decisions would depend on affordability, he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/estonia-considering-missiles-drones-can-strike-inside-russia/400383/	2024-10-18T10:46:28-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/18/GettyImages_824113280/large.jpg
How to do autonomous flight right	It seems like military-grade autonomous flight technologies are being announced every other week. But that breakneck pace should actually cause concern. Simply put, too many of these touted solutions prioritize announcing demos in a sandbox over nailing the true fundamentals. If we don't build and scale autonomous flight the correct way, American warfighters and our national security could pay a severe price. To their credit, the Defense Department is putting out crystal-clear demand signals: autonomy is the future of air power. Last year's Exercise Mobility Guardian 23 proved that maximizing endurance and optimizing pilots' time will be essential in Indo-Pacific conflicts. Air Force Special Operations Command is working to use more unmanned aircraft under its Adaptive Airborne Enterprise concept, and not a year after the announcement of the widely discussed collaborative combat aircraft program, major awards are already being awarded. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall has been an ardent advocate for autonomous flight: 'It's a security risk not to have it. At this point, we have to have it.&rdquo; Autonomy has seen a surge of investment in recent years, with hundreds of millions of dollars pouring into the development of new technologies. As a result, a myriad of cutting-edge solutions have flooded the market. But as someone who has spent over six years laser-focused on this challenge&mdash;my company Merlin is working to create a non-human pilot that's able to fly a wide variety of aircraft&mdash;I'm concerned that too many companies are in a cycle of splashy marketing moments rather than electing to adhere to two critical tenets. First, many of the technologies rolling out today are far too narrow for practical use. They ignore the basic aviate, navigate, and communicate functionality needed to safely execute a mission. Take remotely piloted solutions. Their effectiveness still hinges on a human-operator link, which can be severed by electronic warfare, communication malfunctions, or even bad weather. In contested or degraded environments, these limitations present enormous operational risks, and not just to the mission itself. True functional autonomy requires systems that don't need a human in the loop and can seamlessly perform all aviation, navigation, and communication functions independently. But functional autonomy solutions alone are not enough. To create a truly effective autonomous package, they must be coupled with tactical skills: dogfighting, swarming, EW, etc. In an ideal world, the customer would integrate functional and tactical autonomy together, but this is incredibly difficult to do&mdash;maybe impossible. The interdependency of both stacks is simply too great for channeled software, and customers are better served with a full-stack 'pilot&rdquo; that can handle both functional and tactical autonomy. Second, new autonomy capabilities must advance incrementally and collaboratively with the warfighter to build full trust. Autonomy in aviation is still an emerging technology . Solutions cannot be developed in isolation by tech companies and delivered pre-baked to the military. It may not be flashy, but you must crawl before walking, and walk before flying. Companies must spend thousands of hours working directly with operators to understand where their product roadmaps need to lead not just months, but years, into the future. Even reducing crews from two pilots to one requires hundreds of factors to make flight operationally viable and comfortable for that remaining pilot. Companies skipping these stages are wasting resources and endangering lives&mdash;neither of which will ensure ongoing investment. I've seen too many startups show up with the bravado of having 'solved' autonomy, but when you peel back the layers, they've glossed over or completely ignored these basic requirements. It's akin to a self-driving car company claiming their vehicle can perfectly parallel park itself, but can't actually accelerate, brake, or turn properly. While I mentioned the government has put out clear demand signals, they could also be more helpful in reinforcing the need for companies to meet these requirements. With autonomy being such a priority, there's an eagerness to find that 'future-state' solution that can leapfrog today's limitations. But that's dangerous when dealing with the profound complexities of airborne systems and human lives. No competent auto company would let the allure of delivering a flying car distract them to the point of missing today's vehicle- safety standards. Our military needs continued aggressive development of autonomous flight capabilities, and rapid development is largely the domain of the tech industry. Adversaries like China aren't standing still. But that advancement must happen through a tight cycle of government-industry partnership, rigorous testing of proposed solutions against proven systems engineering principles , and demanding that any autonomy upgrades are thoroughly validated at each incremental step by pilots themselves before moving to the next stage. Autonomous flight represents a potential force multiplier that will tilt the balance in future conflicts. But that competitive advantage disappears if we suffer catastrophic incidents due to reckless rushes toward autonomy while disregarding fundamental airmanship and Human Factors. We must stay grounded in reality, focused on the grueling stepping stones, and earn the complete trust of our aircrews. Cutting corners on autonomous flight is truly an unacceptable risk. Matt George is the founder and chief executive officer of Merlin, an aerospace startup that is building a non-human pilot to enable reduced-crew and uncrewed flight.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/10/how-do-autonomous-flight-right/400373/	2024-10-18T09:11:24-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/18/flight_GettyImages_2113005828/large.jpg
The D Brief: Hamas leader, killed; N. Koreans in Ukraine; Army si...	Israeli forces killed Yahya Sinwar, leader of the terrorist group Hamas, after newly-trained soldiers reportedly stumbled upon him and two other militants during a patrol in southern Gaza Thursday. They didn't initially know who they'd encountered&mdash;which means, as former U.S. special forces soldier David Witty put it, 'The events surrounding the death of Hamas leader Sinwar were just an accident. This was not based on intelligence.&rdquo; After an extended exchange of fire, Israeli forces attacked the building the militants hid inside, apparently killing Sinwar amid the rubble, Israeli defense officials told the New York Times. Rumors of his death began circulating online early Thursday, along with graphic photos of his corpse, as Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute noted on social media. Video: He'd been spotted moments earlier when a small Israeli drone entered the second floor of a destroyed apartment building and found a seated man observing the drone cautiously. The Israeli Defense Forces released edited footage of that short encounter after confirming his death Thursday. Israeli reax: 'While this is not the end of the war in Gaza, it's the beginning of the end,&rdquo; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a special English-language video Thursday. If the remaining Hamas militants lay down their arms and return the remaining 101 hostages, the war can be over this weekend, Netanyahu said. Bibi added: 'The axis of terror that was built by Iran is collapsing before our eyes. [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah is gone. His deputy Mohsen is gone. [Hamas political leader Ismail] Haniyeh is gone. [Hamas military leader Mohammed] Deif is gone. Sinwar is gone. The reign of terror that the Iranian regime has imposed on its own people, and on the peoples of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen&mdash;this, too, will come to an end,&rdquo; he vowed. Pentagon reax: Sinwar's death 'is a major achievement in counterterrorism,&rdquo; U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Thursday. 'Our forces in the Middle East stand ready to defend Israel, deter aggression, and reduce the risk of all-out war in the region,&rdquo; he added. White House reax: 'Now is the time to move on &mdash; move on, move towards a ceasefire in Gaza,&rdquo; President Joe Biden said Friday during a visit to Germany to discuss Ukraine and the Middle East. 'It's time for this war to end and bring these hostages home. And so, that's what we're ready to do.&rdquo; He also said he's tasked his top diplomat Antony Blinken with pursuing those goals during a visit to the region next week. 'It is time for the day after to begin without Hamas in power,&rdquo; Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement Thursday. 'Sinwar was the main obstacle to getting a ceasefire done,&rdquo; National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said Friday in a call with reporters from Berlin. 'Each and every time, Sinwar found a way to stop it. Now he's gone, so we'll see&rdquo; if a ceasefire can be reached in the coming days and weeks, said Kirby. In the interim, 'We're going to continue to support Israel with defensive capabilities,&rdquo; Kirby said. 'Those hostages are still being held in Gaza, likely in tunnels,&rdquo; so the U.S. is going to try to push to get those hostages home, he said. Elsewhere in the region, Iran-backed militants in eastern Syria attacked U.S. forces for the 15th time in six weeks, Charles Lister flagged online Thursday. In that latest known attack, militants targeted the remote Conoco Base in Deir ez Zour using a suicide drone; but coalition forces at the base apparently intercepted it with their C-RAM system. According to Lister, 'The US isn't acknowledging these attacks, nor is it admitting to 8+ retaliatory artillery strikes targeting Iran's proxies in eastern Syria since October 8,&rdquo; the Middle East Institute fellow wrote separately on Thursday.

The Army’s dream of vastly simplified networking is starting to c...	Upgrades are making the Army's battle network easier for soldiers to use, but it's still not exactly what they're asking for. 'It's really good, but it is extremely complicated and&hellip;it's better than what we had before,&rdquo; Col. James Stultz, who leads the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, said of the nascent Integrated Tactical Network. 'I'm not complaining, but it's a waypoint, it's not the end state.&rdquo; Today, the Army uses a myriad of means to transmit and receive voice calls and other data in the field: radios, satellite terminals, cell phones, and more. The ITN is an effort to combine the service's existing gear with off-the-shelf products to improve connectivity and mission command. Service leaders have been working to make that web more reliable, secure, and capable. Radio mesh networks, which are foundational to ITN, are good for calls or texts, and sending location data from Android Tactical Assault Kit, or ATAK. Satellite networks can handle large amounts of data, like a drone's video feed, and are often used when a military unit is not in range of a cell tower. But threading it all together is tricky, so the Army selected units to test out network upgrades. The 101st Airborne Division, 82nd Airborne Division, and all of the Army's Security Force Assistance Brigades are testing out the new tactical network to see how it improves command and control, or C2. As part of its unified network plan, the Army has a two-pronged approach to C2: one to improve existing gear that can be used today and another that looks at long-term next-generation solutions. 'There's a lot of people that want it that don't have it&hellip;so we're in a have/have-not world in terms of ITN,&rdquo; Stultz said. 'I'm a big fan, but it's not a field-and-immediately-execute&rdquo; type of capability. [[Related Posts]] To fulfill their missions, units must be able to establish network connectivity in minutes and dismantle it just as fast. That's especially true as front-line units lean more on drones and commercial technologies. While the ITN is quicker to set up and improves communications, it requires commanders to develop technical expertise, Stultz said: 'We have to understand where all the switches go and plug...We gotta get out of that.&rdquo; That learning curve is less than ideal, said Col. Joshua Glonek, who leads 10th Mountain Division's 3rd Brigade Combat Team. 'We're early in the fielding of it; we just got it. It has greatly increased our capability to communicate, but it does come with a significant amount of leader education to understand the integrated portion of the network. There's many different radios and components, and when configured appropriately, it allows you to do things like...dynamically adjust the waveforms you're communicating on,&rdquo; such as switching between satellite communications to radios, Glonek said. 'But you've got to be very smart and proficient on how to do that on the battlefield. I'd love to get to the point where we just pick up one device and we can do all that without having to, as commanders and staff, understand the intricacies of how to adjust the waveforms and the different parts of the network.&rdquo; Glonek and Stultz's brigades are participating in the Army's 'transformation in contact&rdquo; approach to test and field new technologies and used ITN in recent exercises A win is a win For years, the Army has sought to improve its networks so that brigade, corps, and division command posts can outsource heavy computing to somewhere else. Now the 101st's work with ITN is proving out the concept, according to the Army's program executive officer for command, control, communications, and networks. 'We walked into that unit eight months ago, they were purely secret, they were running compute in their brigades&rdquo; with very large, conspicuous command posts, Mark Kitz told reporters on Monday. By replacing 'secret&rdquo;-level networking gear with 'secure-but-unclassified-encrypted,&rdquo; or SBU-E equipment, the 101st shrank its brigade command posts to just three vehicles that can be set up in about 20 minutes, Kitz said. Intelligence and sustainment work gets sent to division-level command posts, or even all the way back home to Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The concepts were tried out in recent exercises at the Joint Readiness Training Center in Louisiana. The Army plans to build on those developments with the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii, looking particularly at 'digital fires,&rdquo; or the software-based systems used for targeting, and improving networking with foreign militaries. Exercises in October should produce about nine things to improve and test in March, said Maj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, who leads the Army's Network Cross Functional Team. 'Where the 101st left it is where the 25th started. So all the lessons we learned out of the Joint Readiness Training Center, they became the baseline,&rdquo; Ellis said. 'I think we're going to learn a lot out of the 25th's rotation in the Pacific Theater: very heavily focused on mission partner environments, how do we incorporate allies and partners. They're making some huge gains in that space.&rdquo; Ellis said the 25th is working through problems, such as transporting secure-but-unclassified-encrypted network traffic, but that solutions were on the horizon. 'There were a couple things there that weren't quite exactly the way we would have wanted them. And now it looks like that's been fixed and prepared. Cross-domain solutions are able to move that up and down so we can run the fires down into the SBUE architecture and run them back up. I think those are just small examples of it's not just the same-old, same-old,&rdquo; he said. Tech dreams v. reality Is it even possible to realize Stultz's dream of having the same simple device connectivity at home on a command post? Yes, it's technologically possible to make 'one magical radio that does it all&hellip;but you don't want to pay the price,&rdquo; said Mike Sheehan, CEO of the defense and security division of Thales, a major supplier of military radios. 'So instead of doing that, we've got a kit. It's a little Pelican box, and it's got in there five, six different types of radio: it's SATCOM, it's got lower frequency&hellip;you name it. And from there, you know, I'm a user, and I just say, &lsquo;Send Message.'&rdquo; It's also possible to bring your own network, said Rob Spalding, Sempre AI's CEO and former special assistant to the U.S. Air Force vice chief of staff. This week, Sempre AI unveiled its SEMPRE T Tactical Edge Node, which combines a data center and 5G network in a wheel-barrowable 300-pound box that can withstand electromagnetic pulse attacks and has a three-mile connection radius. The tech, which has caught the eye of Air Force Global Strike Command, took about six years to develop; shrinking down a 5G network was difficult, Spalding said. 'A lot of people brought smartphones to Afghanistan and Iraq, but they didn't really work because they didn't connect to anything,&rdquo; he said. The box can enable units to run Android Team Awareness Kit, or ATAK, locally without external network connection, like to a satellite, or use facial recognition software, mimicking the tech user experience 'in a developed society&hellip;but bring it on the battlefield or bring it to the disconnected side.&rdquo; But there's concern the Army may not stick to its unified network vision. 'Everything you want to do in the network&hellip;you need a communication fabric. Otherwise it all breaks down. So the Army is about a third of the way through populating that. I hope they continue, because history shows that [the] next new thing comes up, we stop this, and we start looking at this. And that's what's happened for 40 years,&rdquo; said Thales' Sheehan. 'Is there some technology that's going to pop up that might be superior? Yeah, maybe. But then you innovate it in.&rdquo; Help Desk loading One strand of the Army's effort to streamline its communications is reducing the number of physical networks and centralizing their management. Three years ago, the service began working to collapse 42 networks into one by 2027; the service is currently down to about 14. A key part of that is getting everyone on the same 'base services&rdquo; and applications, Lt. Gen. John Morrison, deputy chief of staff for G-6, told reporters at the Association of the U.S. Army's annual conference on Monday. 'One is all of our office collaboration capabilities. We call it Army 365, everybody's going to use that environment. Endpoint security. So the security that you put on your phone or your PC, that's going to be centrally provided, the ability to connect to the network is going to be centrally provided. And by using those pillars, we'll call them, that makes network convergence that much easier, because now you have discrete capabilities that you can now align to,&rdquo; Morrison said. Next year, the Army plans to consolidate all of its IT network management under Army Network Enterprise Technology Command, or NETCOM, making the Fort Huachuca, Arizona-based command a one-stop shop for all of the Army's network needs. Doing that will allow units to go directly to Army Cyber Command and NETCOM when they have bad service while Army headquarters can 'hold those units accountable for divesting of their legacy capabilities,&rdquo; Morrison said. So in the coming year, NETCOM will focus on endpoint device security, identity and access management, and expanding virtual desktop access, said Maj. Gen. Jacqueline McPhail, who leads the command. It will also work to improve its Army Enterprise Service Management Platform, a help desk that allows users to call or chat with a service provider. McPhail said the command is also working with the program executive offices to make sure the technology soldiers use at the edge is compatible with enterprise networks, starting with security. 'What we're doing with the security, incident, and event-management monitoring, we actually picked it up from the edge. We looked at what [program executive office command, control, communications and network] was rolling out, and we adopted their solution, and then worked it back to an enterprise. And that's a big shift culturally, and how we're delivering a capability,&rdquo; she said. At the end of the day, the network has made progress, according to Morrison, the deputy chief of staff, G6. 'When we talked last year this time, there was still that false divide between what we did at the strategic and operational levels and what we did at the tactical level. It was jerry-rigged at very, very, very best, and it was even worse, because inside our divisions, we had fragmented brigade networks,&rdquo; he said. 'What do you have today? You have one full division, now two, that are now capable of being able to put in a divisional architecture that seamlessly connects back to the operational strategic level that allows for the enablement of those cloud capabilities. Picture this on a JRTC rotation with an opposing force that is contesting you and the brigade commander is using the same system he uses in his office, and he was being contested. That never would have happened a year ago.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/armys-dream-vastly-simplified-networking-starting-come-true/400365/	2024-10-17T22:32:13-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/18/Screenshot_2024_10_17_at_7.30.09PM/large.png
Northrop aims to double GMLRS rocket-motor output	Northrop Grumman is preparing to pump out 14,000 rocket motors per year, roughly doubling production as the Pentagon works to replace weapons sent to Ukraine and rebuild stockpiles against future wars. Over the last four years, the defense giant delivered 5,000 to 6,000 solid rocket motors per year to power Lockheed Martin's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. But in the last year or two, demand is pushing Northrop to get to 10,000, potentially 14,000, motors per year, said Gordon LoPresti, senior director of propulsion systems and controls at Northrop. 'There's more work to be done to get to 14,000, but we've had excess capacity versus the 6,000 that we've been delivering, so we're already starting to be able to move up that curve and have a great partnership with both the U.S. government, our partners, and our primes, to be able to allow us to do that,&rdquo; LoPresti said on the sidelines of the AUSA conference. Northrop builds solid rocket motors at facilities in West Virginia and Maryland, which concentrate on medium, tactical-sized solid rocket motors, and in Utah, which focuses on larger motors, like for the future Sentinel ICBM. Over the last six years, Northrop has spent a billion dollars to boost production capability at the three sites. 'With that six-year investment, we've been able to triple the capacity at the combination of the West Virginia and Maryland sites, so primarily for the tactical rocket motors, and we're on track, within the next couple of years, to be doubling the capacity at our Utah sites for the much larger items that we build,&rdquo; LoPresti said. [[Related Posts]] Beyond Northrop's infrastructure, execs say they're investing in the entire supply chain to ensure smaller suppliers can keep up as the company increases its production cadence. Industry executives have previously pointed to gaps in sub-tier suppliers' ability to provide critical components, like cases, nozzles, and igniters. Northrop has made 'strategic agreements&rdquo; with its suppliers so they're ready to supply those components in the volume needed, LoPresti said. 'We have to have a very good understanding and a consistent understanding with the U.S. government and our primes on what that demand is going to be years into the future. We take that a step further, and have spent an enormous amount of time with our suppliers and those strategic agreements to implement some of those demand signals into those agreements so that they feel more comfortable going out and going to their supply chains and executing on activities that are going to prepare them to be able to support us when we need them.&rdquo; Northrop and Aerojet Rocketdyne, which was bought by L3Harris last year, have been operating as the only two suppliers of SRMs in the U.S. But now that the Pentagon has asked for more production capacity&mdash;and main supplier Aerojet has struggled to deliver rocket motors to customers on time&mdash;new companies like Ursa Major, X-Bow Systems, and Anduril are coming onto the scene. 'With some of the challenges that I think the government and the primes are seeing with some of those suppliers, it is completely understandable that there's a desire for diversification of the solid rocket motor suppliers in the market. Couple that with the increasing demand for solid rocket motors, it even puts more urgency on increasing the supply base, or the diversification of the supply base,&rdquo; LoPresti said. Asked whether demand will sustain Northrop, Aerojet, and a slew of new entrants, LoPresti said there needs to be more diversification in the market&mdash;but it's unlikely that all of these new companies will be successful in the future.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/northrop-aims-double-gmlrs-rocket-motor-output/400354/	2024-10-17T12:51:48-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/17/Screenshot_2024_10_17_at_9.48.08AM-1/large.png
The D Brief: B-2s bomb Houthis; A general’s China alarm; Army’s U...	The Pentagon conducted a series of precision airstrikes against Houthi military sites inside Yemen early Thursday, with Air Force B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers and U.S. Navy assets in the region teaming up for the attack. The strikes targeted five 'hardened underground facilities housing missiles, weapons components, and other munitions&rdquo; allegedly used by the Iran-backed terrorists to attack commercial shipping vessels traveling along Yemen's coast over the past 11 months, U.S. defense officials at Central Command announced late Wednesday. Rewind: Satellite imagery analysis from February showed the Houthis had 'undertaken a major expansion of underground military facilities&rdquo; in addition to the 'caves and simple tunnels [the group used] in their earliest days,&rdquo; researcher Fabian Hinz noted for the International Institute of Strategic Studies in the spring. Notable: CENTCOM forces have attacked underground weapons-storage facilities inside Yemen before, including in late March&mdash;but U.S. officials did not use B-2s for that operation. Trivia: B-2s seem to have last been used in combat nearly eight years ago for strikes against ISIS fighters in Libya. SecDef Austin (emphasis added): 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that several observers interpreted as a warning to Iran. 'The employment of U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers demonstrate U.S. global strike capabilities to take action against these targets when necessary, anytime, anywhere,&rdquo; Austin said. Think-tank reax: 'This strike is laudable, belated, and insufficient,&rdquo; said Bradley Bowman of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'The Biden administration deserves credit for using B-2 bombers to target Houthi underground weapon stockpiles, but one wonders what took so long.&rdquo; The Houthi attacks against non-military targets represent 'the most serious assault on freedom of navigation and maritime commerce in decades,&rdquo; Bowman told Defense One. 'Let's see whether this is a one-off or the start of a new and more effective strategy toward the Houthis and more importantly their terror patron in Tehran,&rdquo; he added.

On this day in 1973, OPEC&mdash;led by Saudi Arabia&mdash;announced an oil embargo on the U.S. and other nations that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War, triggering a global energy crisis. 'The price of oil per barrel first doubled, then quadrupled, imposing skyrocketing costs on consumers and structural challenges to the stability of whole national economies,&rdquo; as the State Department recalls. U.S. responses included creating the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, imposing a national 55-mph speed limit on highways(!), and the introduction of fuel economy standards. The Pentagon announced another $425 million in military aid for Ukraine on Wednesday, including air defense and artillery munitions; air-to-ground weapons; armored vehicles; more anti-tank weapons, and more. Panning out: The U.S. has pledged more than $59 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion more than two and a half years ago. Developing: After months of staying quiet about the matter, U.S. Army units stationed in Europe are indeed learning from Ukraine's experience fighting Russia, officials confirmed Wednesday in Washington. A 'small element&rdquo; of soldiers rotates in and out of the war-torn country to collect lessons, said Gen. Darryl Williams, commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa, speaking at a media roundtable at the Association of the United States Army's annual Washington meeting. Those soldiers fall under Lt. Gen. Curtis Buzzard, who in August was appointed head of the allied effort that coordinates aid to Ukraine, Defense One's Sam Skove reports. For the record: The team that rotates through Ukraine is limited to working inside the U.S. embassy and does not provide advice to the Ukrainian government, a U.S. Army Europe spokesperson said. What's more, the U.S. has also adapted its own training facilities at Grafenw&ouml;hr, Germany, to better mimic the tactical environment for the Ukrainian units who come there for training, Williams said. 'It looks like the conditions in Ukraine,&rdquo; he said. Read on, here. Also from AUSA: The top U.S. Army commander in the Pacific region is sounding alarms about China's 'dangerous trajectory&rdquo; and the rising threat of a war in Asia, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reported Wednesday. 'There's a limited regional war going on in Europe. There's a limited regional war going on in the Middle East. We can ill afford another limited regional war in Asia,&rdquo; said Gen. Charles Flynn, the outgoing commander of U.S. Army Pacific. 'Why? Because it will be a global problem for all of us,&rdquo; he said. Flynn also argued that the Army would be critical in a fight with China. It's not the obvious position in a region known less for its land masses than its oceans and vast distances. But he said the Army has undergone a profound transformation to make it not only relevant but essential. 'I often remind people that you're not going to invade Taiwan with the Navy and Air Force,&rdquo; Flynn said. 'You need to generate an invasion force to invade Taiwan. Well, that invasion force exists in the [Chinese] eastern theater command and it is three army groups, and it's north of 55,000 Chinese soldiers in those combat brigades.&rdquo; According to Flynn, China's 'strength is in the air and in the maritime domains,&rdquo; as well as space and cyberspace, Tucker reports. However, that Chinese arsenal was 'not designed to find, fix, and finish land-based forces that are distributed, dispersed, mobile, reloadable network,&rdquo; said Flynn. Amid those dynamics, the U.S. Army has built new capabilities to attack China in new ways, even across long distances, Tucker writes. Continue reading, here. Raytheon to pay nearly $1 billion for defrauding DOD, allegedly bribing Qatari official. The company took in more than $111 million more than it was owed under 'two separate schemes&rdquo; in connection with the Patriot missile systems and a radar system, and other defense services, according to a DOJ statement released on Wednesday. RTX also bribed a high-level Qatari military official to win defense contracts, and then concealed those payments by falsifying documents, according to an SEC filing. Raytheon officials said the company is 'taking responsibility for the misconduct&rdquo; which it said occurred 'largely prior to 2020.&rdquo; Rewind: In August, Raytheon was fined $200 million for the unauthorized export of defense technology to China, Russia, Iran, and elsewhere.

Dixon, who lives in the Florida Panhandle, is one of several coordinators helping to direct supplies and volunteers to hard-hit areas. He said dozens of teams self-organized in Helene-devastated places like Asheville, N.C., and prepositioned in Central Florida before Milton. They started by clearing debris but have expanded their efforts, including using small drones to find supply routes through washed-out areas. And in North Carolina, former air controllers helped establish a landing zone for volunteer civilian helicopter crews to deliver supplies and materials, Dixon said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-17-2024/400339/	2024-10-17T08:00:30-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/17/DB_lander/large.png
Regional war in Asia would be a 'global problem' for the US, Paci...	The top U.S. Army commander in the Pacific region is sounding alarms about China's 'dangerous trajectory&rdquo; and the rising threat of a war in Asia. Gen. Charles Flynn, the outgoing commander of U.S. Army Pacific, said increased coordination and technology exchange between autocratic states such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea is a 'very dangerous combination that we all should pay very, very close attention to&rdquo;&mdash;in no small part because that coordination is putting greater pressure on the United States everywhere the military is conducting operations. 'There's a limited regional war going on in Europe. There's a limited regional war going on in the Middle East. We can ill afford another limited regional war in Asia. Why? Because it will be a global problem for all of us,&rdquo; Flynn said at the AUSA conference, one of several D.C.-area venues he addressed this week. In a farewell tour of sorts before he leaves his command in November, Flynn hit the capital city to address the AUSA conference, speak to reporters, and also appear at the Center for a New American Security to address policy wonks. For many outside of Washington, the name Flynn conjures recollections of his brother Mike, Donald Trump's disgraced national security advisor and conspiracy pusher. (It's an open secret that the brothers are not on good terms.) But the military and national security community knows Charles Flynn as a transformative figure in the U.S. Army and consummate champion for the importance of the U.S. Army in the Pacific in a fight against China. 'I would argue that this century is going to be defined by the relationship between the United States and China in Asia,&rdquo; he said this week. [[Related Posts]] Flynn also argued that the Army would be critical in a fight with China. It's not the obvious position in a region known less for its land masses than its oceans and vast distances. But he said the Army has undergone a profound transformation to make it not only relevant but essential. 'I often remind people that you're not going to invade Taiwan with the Navy and Air Force. You need to generate an invasion force to invade Taiwan. Well, that invasion force exists in the [Chinese] eastern theater command and it is three army groups, and it's north of 55,000 Chinese soldiers in those combat brigades,&rdquo; he said. But China, beginning with its 2015 reorganization and modernization push, has become a much more capable military. It's a transformation that Flynn says in many ways mirrors how the United States military develops forces, with a large emphasis on the development of training centers, 'taking pages right out of our book and putting them in place to build a force.&rdquo; Additionally, China has developed a massive rocket force and anti-access area denial capabilities. 'It is historical in the scale of what they have&hellip;They have three things that we lack. They're operating on interior lines that are right there. They have mass, and then they have magazine depth. These three things are what we have to counter,&rdquo; he said. Those elements of Chinese military power, rocket forces and anti-access/area denial capabilities&mdash;known as A2AD&mdash;create huge potential problems for the Navy and Air Force. Ships, which are observable from Chinese satellites, would be vulnerable to missile attack, while the Air Force relies heavily on visible runways that would also be open to attack in the event of a conflict. The U.S. Army can provide 'an asymmetric counterweight that's unmatchable,&rdquo; Flynn says. It's a big part of the reason Flynn has worked to make the U.S. Army in the Pacific relevant in multiple domains, to develop a force that can protect air and maritime assets and work across air, sea, and space. China has 'the primary means of their attack approach, with their A2AD arsenal, against the strength of the United States, that strength is in the air and in the maritime domains,&rdquo; as well as space and cyberspace, Flynn said. However, that Chinese arsenal was 'not designed to find, fix, and finish land-based forces that are distributed, dispersed, mobile, reloadable network.&rdquo; Flynn lacks his brother's appetite for political statements, but he's not afraid to call out the military for what he sees as strategic errors. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he believes those errors stem from a systematic and decades-long underestimation of the importance of the U.S. Army to match China. 'I would argue that for many, many years, we've over invested in the aerial layer and over invested in the space layer. In the Indo-Pacific, we have to have a terrestrial collection layer, and that is a series of sensors that could both collect in all domains, to include open source, and share that with our partners,&rdquo; he said. Changing the game To correct those perceived oversights, the U.S. Army has built new capabilities to attack China in new ways, even across long distances. One significant example: Multi-domain Task Force, or MDTF, teams. 'A few short years ago, this was merely a concept,&rdquo; Flynn explained. 'Now, it's an organization that's got four battalions, got a sustainment battalion, it's got an integrated air-and-missile-defense battalion. It's got a long-range precision-fires battalion, and then it's got a multi-domain effects battalion and a task force headquarters.&rdquo; Those MDTF teams play a critical role in helping the Air Force and Navy be more effective in the Pacific, he said, by gathering information and intelligence the Chinese can't easily counter, and providing options for hitting China from locations that aren't so easy for enemy forces to find and hit. 'To me, that is game changing when it comes to being able to do missile defense and then being able to do counter-strike with long-range fires,&rdquo; he said. 'We have a theater information directorate. We have a theater strike effects group. This is space. This is information. This is lethal and non-lethal targeting all brought together at the operational level, at the theater army, so that the multi-domain task forces can take the long-range precision fires, from hypersonics to mid-range capability to (precision strike missiles), integrated air and missile defense&hellip; etc, to include future vertical lift sustainment capabilities, distributed forces, network forces, meshed forces, cellular forces&mdash;all in support of the joint force.&rdquo; The Army has worked hard to develop air and drone defenses, and is planning a composite air defense battalion to be based of Guam starting in 2027. But the service is putting new air defense capabilities into place now at multiple levels to counter the threat of China's enormous stockpile of rockets, missiles, and drones. 'I think the advance of these advanced composite air defense battalions, where we bring together the integrated fire protection platform, the LTM sensor, IBCS RIG-360 and ALPS towers&hellip;that with what we're doing with THAAD and Patriot and the [integrated air and missile defense] and, the software integration of those&hellip; This ability to be able to have what was originally designed to be a defensive capability, to sense and do an intercept and then to cross cue an offensive platform, to do counter strike,&rdquo; is a huge improvement over a traditional, simple air defense capability. The other key new advantage the Army now offers is the many allies and partners across the region that it has built close relationships with through joint exercises. By contrast, China is 'doing it in a way that is, in many ways, is helping us, because it's turning the allies and partners away from them,&rdquo; he said. INDOPACOM officials routinely point out the importance of more partners in the region&mdash;including governments and militaries that have difficult histories with each other&mdash;now not only participating in exercises together but actually asking to do so. Aside from seeing China as a threat, the other common feature among those militaries is actually the outsized role of their various armies. 'The region is defined by armies&hellip; In the Philippines' army, they have 12 divisions. They have more divisions than we have in the U.S.,&rdquo; Flynn said. The Taiwan question If there is one area where Flynn is a bit more reticent, it's the potential of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Military officials in in 2021 said that invasion could occur by 2027, making that assessment based in no small part on the words of Chinese President Xi Jinping and the rapid modernization of Chinese forces.

RTX will pay almost $1B for defrauding DOD, alleged bribes to Qat...	Defense giant Raytheon will pay the U.S government more than $950 million for defrauding the Pentagon and allegedly bribing a Qatari official, the Justice Department announced today. RTX admitted to 'two separate schemes&rdquo; to defraud the Defense Department in connection with the Patriot missile systems and a radar system, and other defense services, according to a DOJ release. 'These schemes to defraud caused the DOD to pay Raytheon over $111 million more than Raytheon should have been paid on the contracts,&rdquo; the release said. RTX will pay the government more than $124 million for bribing a high-level Qatari military official to win defense contracts, and then concealed those payments by falsifying documents, according to an SEC filing. 'Raytheon engaged in criminal schemes to defraud the U.S. government in connection with contracts for critical military systems and to win business through bribery in Qatar,&rdquo; said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kevin Driscoll of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. 'Such corrupt and fraudulent conduct, especially by a publicly traded U.S. defense contractor, erodes public trust and harms the DOD, businesses that play by the rules, and American taxpayers. Today's resolutions, with criminal and civil recoveries totaling nearly $1 billion, reflect the Criminal Division's ability to tackle the most significant and complex white-collar cases across multiple subject matters.&rdquo; In a statement, RTX said the misconduct occurred 'largely prior to 2020&rdquo; and the financial impact of these matters is consistent with the reserve announced in the company's July 2024 quarterly earnings report. 'RTX is taking responsibility for the misconduct that occurred. We have worked diligently during the investigations to remediate that misconduct and continue to do so. We are committed to working closely with the incoming independent monitor to improve and further enhance our ethics and compliance program,&rdquo; the company said. The defense contractor also recently was fined $200 million for the unauthorized export of defense technology to China, Russia, Iran, and elsewhere. In July, the company told investors during an earnings call that it set aside more than $1 billion to settle a number of government investigations.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/rtx-will-pay-almost-1b-defrauding-dod-bribing-qatari-officials/400332/	2024-10-16T15:31:52-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/16/rtx/large.jpg
Bell presses on with FLRAA as Army cools on large programs	Just months after the Army canceled one planned helicopter, and just a day after its top officer hinted at other large-program cuts, Bell Textron execs said they're simply focusing on starting deliveries of their V-280 tiltrotor by decade's end. 'There are things we can't control. The things we can control: execution, schedule, staying within the cost objectives of the Army,&rdquo; said Frank Lazzara, who leads the company's sales and strategy efforts for the service's Future Long Range Assault Aircraft, or FLRAA, program. At the Army's mainstay conference, Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George said the service won't hesitate to cut programs that don't support its modernization goals&mdash;and will no longer buy programs 'for ten years at a time.&rdquo; The service has canceled programs it invested billions in, like the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program, or FARA&mdash;an effort once hailed as the service's No. 1 aviation priority. And FARA's end might not be the final dramatic program move the Army makes, service officials have warned. 'Even if it was a requirement in the past. Even if it was a program of record, we may have to stop buying it,' George said on Tuesday at the AUSA conference. Asked about George's speech, Lazarra said that in the government, someone's always coming after someone else's money, and the Army has a lot of programs it needs to pay for. 'But if we stay on track with what their objectives are, those are the things we can control, and I think those are the things that keep a program viable and safe and protect the budget for the program,&rdquo; he said. [[Related Posts]] The FLRAA program, which will partially replace the Army's UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, could be worth up to $70 billion for Bell&mdash;depending on how many aircraft the company sells to the Army and foreign militaries. The total FLRAA buy hinges on budgetary constraints, and what the Army learns once it gets the aircraft to its test unit, said Maj. Gen. Clair Gill, commanding general of the Army's Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Novosel. But Gill emphasized that the Army is 'all in&rdquo; on FLRAA, and called it one of the service's major modernization programs. 'I'm not worried, but if it doesn't perform, then it becomes a risky program, and then potentially does get cut. I think, between us setting requirements, the research and development, the science and technology, all those things coming together, and then the manufacturer delivering on that&mdash;if it's on schedule, if it performs the way that I feel like [it will], then it's a safe program. I mean, we need the capability. It is a next-generation transformational capability. If those things don't happen, then I don't disagree with the chief. Then you have to look at it and say, &lsquo;Is this what the Army needs to pay for? And I think the chief and secretary do that with every single program',&rdquo; Gill told reporters Wednesday. Part of the Army's plan to keep costs low on FLRAA is to build the aircraft with a modular, open-systems architecture, so upgrades are easy and cheaper, and the service isn't locked into one subcontractor's component for the aircraft's entire lifespan. 'What the Army wants is to be able to control their own destiny. So the open systems approach will create more competition. It'll probably help with some level of cost control. They're not beholden to a sub[contractor] or a contract or anything,&rdquo; Lazarra said. And this new approach to acquisition will be a 'litmus test&rdquo; for industry to see if they can adapt and do business another way, he said. Fuselage twist Company execs at AUSA also confirmed a major switch-up to FLRAA production plans: Bell will now build the tiltrotor's fuselage in-house, pulling the work away from Spirit AeroSystems in the wake of Boeing's proposal to reacquire the company. The move was first reported in July by Aviation Week. 'We want to control the quality and the timeline and the schedule and the things we can control, and we don't want anything else to put that in jeopardy,&rdquo; Lazzara said. The company is 'fully prepared&rdquo; to start building the fuselages in-house, he said, and has been building the team for a while since this is 'something we've seen coming.&rdquo; Lazzara said he doesn't anticipate the move affecting the program's schedule. 'Any time we can take in the work for a part of the aircraft, and we can control just quality, timeline, cost, all those other things, we're excited to do it and anytime we can bring more work into Bell that helps across the board with other things that have cost involved,&rdquo; he said. Army's already practicing As the Army awaits the arrival of its high-speed, high-capacity tiltrotors in 2030, it is already practicing the new operating concept that they will enable. The idea behind 'large-scale, long-range air assault,&rdquo; or L2A2, is to 'deliver one brigade combat team in one period of darkness, over 500 miles, arriving behind enemy lines, and able to conduct sustained combat operations,&rdquo; said Maj. Gen. Brett Sylvia, who leads the 101st Airborne Division. And the service can't do this with the platforms it has today, he said. Sylvia's team has started working on the new tactics, techniques, and procedures and has practiced the concept four times in live demos over the last year, and multiple times in simulation. In the simulation, replacing UH-60s with FLRAA gave the combat aviation brigade 'four times the amount of heavy-lift aircraft than what I have today,&rdquo; Sylvia said. In the most recent test, the unit used its existing helicopters to move a brigade combat team about 570 miles, from Fort Campbell on the Kentucky-Tennessee border to Fort Johnson in Louisiana. The movement required three nights, two mission support sites, and six forward arming-and-refueling points. But in a simulation that used FLRAAs, the same mission required half the sustainment and security footprint--and just one night, Sylvia said. 'We are building, over the course of the next few years, this air assault combat aviation brigade. We are doing the things in order to be able to build the foundation so that all we have to do is just receive the aircraft and we'll be ready to execute,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/bell-presses-flraa-army-cools-large-programs/400328/	2024-10-16T14:56:04-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/16/Screenshot_2024_10_16_at_11.54.35AM/large.png
Europe-based units are learning from Ukraine, officers say	Army units stationed in Europe, from platoons to headquarters, are learning from Ukraine's battlefield as the service embarks on the second phase of an equipping effort, officials said Wednesday. A 'small element&rdquo; of soldiers rotates in and out of the war-torn country to collect lessons, said Gen. Darryl Williams, commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa, speaking at a media roundtable at the Association of the United States Army's annual Washington meeting. Those soldiers fall under Lt. Gen. Curtis Buzzard, who in August was appointed head of the allied effort that coordinates aid to Ukraine. He previously served as the commander of a major U.S. Army doctrine center, the Maneuver Center of Excellence. 'He's able to get insights on the environment in terms of the number of drones that they're flying,&rdquo; Williams said. 'Learning is taking place as we speak, at the tactical level, the operational level, to inform the strategic level.&rdquo; The team that rotates through Ukraine is limited to working inside the U.S. embassy and does not provide advice to the Ukrainian government, a U.S. Army Europe spokesperson said. [[Related Posts]] The U.S. has also adapted its own training facilities at Grafenw&ouml;hr, Germany, to better mimic the tactical environment for the Ukrainian units who come there for training, Williams said. 'It looks like the conditions in Ukraine,&rdquo; he said. The lessons brought back by that team are shaping how the Army approaches its 'Transformation-in-Contact&rdquo; equipping strategy. Under the 8-month-old effort, the Army is flooding certain units with new drones, counter-drone tech, and communications gear that is not necessarily part of any program of record&mdash;the service's typical method of buying new equipment. One light infantry unit that's part of the initial Transformation in Contact cohort, the 10th Mountain Division's 3rd Brigade, is drawing directly from Ukraine for its new 'Strike&rdquo; Company, said Lt. Gen. Charles Costanza, commander of Army V Corps. That unit, which links drone operators to mortars, artillery, and loitering munitions, is 'coming straight out of watching what's going on in Ukraine,&rdquo; he said. Williams said the Europe-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and U.S.-based 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division are among the four brigades slated for 'Transformation-in-Contact 2.0,&rdquo; an expansion announced by George on Tuesday. Command Sgt. Maj. Dennis Doyle of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment said that unit is already adopting lessons from Ukraine. 'Over the last few years, based off of the fight that's in the Ukraine, and just with us being right there with the enemy at the doorstep&hellip;we've been able to extract a lot of lessons learned that's kind of drove us to kind of think about how we do agile and adaptive command and control,&rdquo; Doyle said. Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian troops have underscored the need to make command posts harder for enemy forces to find. Even before being designated for the TiC effort, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was working to slim down its command posts, as well as experimenting with translation software for communicating with allies. The unit started receiving some equipment under the TiC 2.0 fielding strategy this month, Doyle said. Not all lessons are about new tech, though, said Maj. Gen. Ron Ragin, commander of the unit responsible for helping manage aid transfers to Ukraine, the 21st Theater Sustainment Command. Ragin said he recently asked several senior Ukrainian officers what they would have done differently before the war. He said the Ukrainians recommended investing in ammunition production and stockpiles and in creating multiple locations for maintaining equipment. They also recommended creating hardened storage and command-and-control infrastructure. 'I'm using those lessons from our Ukrainian partners that are currently under strain and in contact to inform how I approach the priorities that Gen. Williams has given us,&rdquo; Ragin said. 'So I'm working with not only the acquisition community but also with the joint material enterprise to make sure that we're taking the lessons learned from Ukraine and applying it to how we move forward in the future,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/europe-based-units-are-learning-ukraine-officers-say/400327/	2024-10-16T14:28:32-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/16/Screenshot_2024_10_16_at_11.26.48AM/large.png
How the Pentagon’s financial audit will help win wars	In about four weeks, despite all the progress being made, we will likely hear that the Pentagon has again failed its financial audit this year. But the headlines will also likely miss the most important point: the warfighting benefits that are accumulating now as a result of the audit. Far from a mere compliance exercise, the cultural and technological changes required to pass an audit are the same ones necessary to keep U.S. forces dominant. For the Defense Department to pass its audit, it must account for more than dollars. It must track the vast array of things the military uses: munitions, spare parts, fuel, real estate. Moreover, it must track the condition of these things: In the shop? Ready for use? In the field? And it must do so accurately and in real time. All this requires comprehensive changes. Cyber security must be improved, systems integrated, processes and automation deployed to ensure the accuracy of data, and more. Undaunted, DOD has attacked these problems with resolve and money. Over the past five years, the department has spent more than $4 billion to improve visibility and transparency. Efforts to pass the audit have helped integrate data from finance, logistics, and readiness systems, breaking down longstanding silos and making it possible to see across the entire defense enterprise. What was once a cumbersome and time-consuming process&mdash;yielding outputs that were neither timely nor reliable&mdash;has become more streamlined. These changes are already yielding benefits. By improving visibility into resources, the DoD has made strides in ensuring that the right resources are available at the right time and that limited dollars are not put toward duplicative capabilities. But the benefits go far beyond the record-keeping necessary for a clean financial bill of health. By improving the flow of data, the audit effort is helping to ensure U.S. military dominance into the future. [[Related Posts]] Tomorrow's victories will increasingly depend on decision advantage: the ability to make faster and better decisions than adversaries by harnessing accurate, reliable, and timely data. This is why the Pentagon is working to link all warfare domains through its CJADC2 efforts, enabling data to flow seamlessly between platforms. Imagine a scenario in the Indo-Pacific where tensions between the U.S. and a near-peer adversary, such as China, have escalated, making the ability to close the kill chain quickly and effectively paramount. U.S. forces use intelligence assets&mdash;ranging from satellites and UAVs to cyber intelligence&mdash;to rapidly identify and track enemy movements. This sensor data is then transmitted to a CJADC2 command center, where it is fused into a single operational picture. Commanders then use this data for targeting, which also shows what strike assets&mdash;fighter jets, ships, or missile systems&mdash;are ready for deployment. As U.S. forces use precision-guided munitions to strike the enemy fleet, cyber capabilities are also deployed to protect U.S. systems and disable enemy communications. Finally, UAVs conduct a battle damage assessment, providing commanders with immediate feedback on the success of the mission. The data integration promoted by the audit promises to enable commanders&mdash;from small units up to unified commands&mdash;to access information about the availability and the condition of munitions, vehicles, equipment, parts, and supplies. As the above example illustrates, this visibility is essential for warfighting, as it allows commanders to allocate resources effectively. A unified, enterprise-wide view will enable them to move with speed and surety, whether responding to emerging threats or executing long-term strategic operations. Accurate, real-time data on asset quantities, condition, and location will enable the use of automation, data analytics, and AI in decision-making and execution. There remains much work to be done before this vision comes to pass. The improvements to date will only yield full operational benefits if they are integrated into real-time decision-making processes that can adjust to the demands of fast-moving, contested environments. This requires cultural change. The entire defense enterprise must shift from a compliance-driven, labor-intensive audit remediation mindset to one focused on mission outcomes. But this is already taking place. Historically, data transparency and integration across the defense enterprise were counter-cultural. The audit has pushed the DoD toward greater transparency, data integration, and enterprise-wide standards. One key to finishing the transformation is making sure the audit is viewed not as simply a financial matter but as commanders' business. By emphasizing the warfighting value, the DoD can ensure that audit remediations contribute not only to closing financial documentation gaps but also to closing kill chains with the speed and exactness required in today's complex battlespace. We've spent great treasure to gain extensive knowledge about our adversaries&mdash;even though they are never 100 percent knowable&mdash;but we have much to gain by improving knowledge about ourselves in a way that provides operational relevance, an effort that is completely within our control. In many ways, no matter if DoD ever 'passes&rdquo; a full financial statement audit, if remediation is done right, it is a step toward remedying this imbalance, creating the visibility we need to know ourselves better and improving our ability to fight and win.

The D Brief: Army’s new acquisition approach; US warns Israel on ...	All things Army: The U.S. Army will expand its new-tech effort, cut some arms programs, and overhaul its acquisition approach, Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George said Tuesday at the AUSA convention in Washington, D.C. Known as 'Transformation in Contact 2.0,&rdquo; the effort will send new tech to two armored brigade combat teams, two Stryker brigade combat teams, and other units in the Guard and Reserves, plus some 'protection and sustainment&rdquo; units by the end of fiscal year 2025. That expands the TiC effort from the three brigades that since February have been experimenting with drones, electronic warfare equipment, communications tech, and other items, many influenced by lessons from the war on Ukraine. Going stealthy: The TiC effort is running in tandem with Army efforts to hide in plain sight on the battlefield, which George said has resulted in the brigades reducing their electromagnetic and physical presence by nearly 90 percent. New acquisition approach: 'We cannot buy programs for ten years at a time anymore, technology changes too fast,&rdquo; George said. Instead, he wants to buy more things in tranches that permit more frequent changes. He also said some programs will be cut: 'old, stand-alone tech that doesn't connect to our network, equipment that can't operate in our [transforming-in-contact] formations.&rdquo; Defense One's Sam Skove has more, here.

New: U.S. weapons shipments to Israel could be in jeopardy if humanitarian conditions for besieged residents of Gaza don't improve in 30 days, Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin and State Secretary Antony Blinken warned Israeli military and diplomatic officials in a letter dated Sunday. Israeli News 12 first reported the letter's existence, copies of which were later obtained by stateside outlets like Axios and CNN. For the record: 'Israel has received more U.S. military aid than any other country since World War II,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Monday in a U.S. arms export explainer. Israel may be making things worse in Gaza, Austin and Blinken worry. 'We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government &mdash; including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90 percent of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September, continuing burdensome and excessive dual-use restrictions, and instituting new vetting and onerous liability and customs requirements for humanitarian staff and shipments &mdash; together with increased lawlessness and looting &mdash; are contributing to an accelerated deterioration in the conditions in Gaza,&rdquo; the two U.S. secretaries wrote. U.S. requirements include 'allowing at least 350 trucks a day to enter Gaza through the territory's four major crossings ahead of winter,&rdquo; and the creation of a 'new communication channel to discuss incidents surrounding civilians that would begin to be used by the end of this month,&rdquo; Politico reports. Official Pentagon reax: 'This was personal private correspondence, so I'm not going to get into more specifics of it other than, you know, it was expressing concern about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza,&rdquo; Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Tuesday. According to CNN, 'Israel appears to already be responding to the letter, at least indirectly. Just one day after the letter was sent, COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages policy for the Palestinian territories and the flow of aid into the strip, tweeted photos of aid going into Gaza.&rdquo; That tweet 'ended a two-week period during which the UN said no food aid was delivered to the north, and supplies essential for survival were running out for the 400,000 Palestinians there,&rdquo; according to the BBC. Official White House reax: The message 'was not meant as a threat,&rdquo; but 'It appears to us that [the Israelis] are taking this seriously,&rdquo; White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Tuesday.

Russia launched one of its largest drone attacks on Ukraine in months on Wednesday, sending at least 136 drones at the capital city and several other locations across the country, Kyiv's General Staff announced on social media. Ukraine says it shot down 68 of the drones; though some appear to have triggered a fire at an industrial facility in the western region of Ternopil, Reuters reports. Update: Zelenskyy outlines his new 'Victory Plan.&rdquo; Ukraine's president explained his plans to turn the tide in the nearly three-year Russian invasion in remarks before parliament Wednesday in Kyiv. The plan has five 'main points,&rdquo; and three 'secret annexes,&rdquo; President Zelenskyy said. He kicked things off with an abundance of ambition, announcing, 'The first point is an invitation to NATO. Right now,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said. Few, if any, NATO allies are pressing for such a rapid accession process; so this, perhaps more than any other aspect of his plan, falls almost entirely in the 'wishful thinking&rdquo; category. His next three points have a military focus, including more air defense systems from allies, expanding missile and drone production, and lifting restrictions on striking military targets inside Russia, among others. Read a summary, via Zelenskyy's office, here. By the way: SecDef Austin is traveling to Belgium today for a meeting of NATO defense chiefs, followed by a separate meeting of the U.S.-led counter-ISIS coalition. He then plans to fly to Italy for the first-ever G7 defense ministers meeting in Naples. 'The discussions at the G7 will center on ensuring continued security assistance for Ukraine, addressing the need to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East, exchanging views on the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific, discussing support for partners in Africa, and fostering additional cooperation on the defense industrial base and issues among world's leading democratic economies,&rdquo; Sabrina Singh said Tuesday in a short preview.

More than 11,000 soldiers and airmen have helped with hurricane recovery efforts across the American south after Milton and Helene tore across Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia, National Guard officials said this week. Update: That overall number has dropped somewhat in the last few days, with 4,500 National Guard soldiers from seven states still working the Hurricane Milton response after that storm made landfall on October 9. An estimated 4,500 others, including 3,000 Guardsmen from 13 states along with 1,500 active duty soldiers, are still helping with Helene recovery, the Pentagon said Tuesday. Among their tasks: 'Rescu[ing] hundreds of people threatened by flooding, clear[ing] roads, distribut[ing] food, water and other vital supplies, provid[ing] security, direct[ing] traffic &mdash; even provid[ing] much-needed hugs to residents reeling from the damage caused by the storms,&rdquo; the Army said Sunday. Said one Florida Guard director, Col. Blake Heidelberg: 'We're tired. I'm not going to lie.&rdquo; Follow-up: The U.S. military just revised the discharge status for hundreds of service members who had been administratively separated under the policy known as Don't Ask, Don't Tell, which prohibited gay and lesbian people from serving openly from 1993 until 2010. 'What this means is that of the nearly 13,500 individuals who were administratively separated under Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, and served long enough to receive a merit-based characterization of service, 96% now have an honorable discharge,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday, more than a year after the review was announced. 'We will continue to honor the service and the sacrifice of all our troops&mdash;including the brave Americans who raised their hands to serve but were turned away because of whom they love,&rdquo; Austin said, and vowed the military will 'strive to do right by every American patriot who has honorably served their country.&rdquo; Lastly today: Milley needs blastproof curtains. America's last Joint Chiefs Chairman Army Gen. Mark Milley told author Bob Woodward for this latest book 'that [Milley] feared being recalled to uniform to be court-martialed &lsquo;for disloyalty' should Mr. Trump win re-election,&rdquo; the New York Times reported in an election analysis published Wednesday. But that's not all. 'After criticizing Mr. Trump in a pointed retirement speech, General Milley told Mr. Woodward that he installed bulletproof glass and blastproof curtains at his home.&rdquo; Why bring it up? The U.S. election is just three weeks away. But in just the last few days, Trump has described his political opponents as 'evil&rdquo; and an 'enemy from within&rdquo; that could cause chaos and disruptions on Election Day&mdash;carrying forward his 2016 conception of the United States as a place of 'carnage,&rdquo; as he proclaimed in his inauguration speech, with Trump as the only solution. Such a chaotic Election Day scenario, he said in an interview with Fox on Sunday, 'should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen.&rdquo; 'They are so bad and frankly, they're evil,&rdquo; Trump said at a rally on Monday. 'They're evil. What they've done, they've weaponized, they've weaponized our elections. They've done things that nobody thought was even possible.&rdquo; Worth noting: 'Never before has a presidential nominee &mdash; let alone a former president &mdash; openly suggested turning the military on American citizens simply because they oppose his candidacy,&rdquo; the Times reported Wednesday. In so doing, 'Trump is offering voters the choice of a very different, and far less democratic, form of American government.&rdquo; Related reading: 'The Trump Voters Who Don't Believe Trump,&rdquo; the Times reported separately on Monday, noting 'many of his supporters assume it's just an act&rdquo;; 'Trump Plans to Amp Up His Violent, Bigoted Rhetoric in Closing Pitch to Voters,&rdquo; via Rolling Stone, reporting Saturday; find similar reporting from late September, here; 'Republicans face backlash for lawsuits targeting overseas and military voting,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Monday; And 'Trump [is] likely to challenge any election loss.

Army to expand tech equipping effort	The Army will expand a new equipment-fielding initiative focused on drones, electronic warfare, and other modern tech to several more units, service leader Gen. Randy George said Tuesday. Two armored brigade combat teams, two Stryker brigade combat teams, and other units in the Guard and Reserves will all get new tech under the program, which George dubbed 'Transformation in Contact 2.0.&rdquo; The Army's transformation-in-contact, or TiC, approach launched in February with the service flooding three brigades with drones, electronic warfare equipment, communications tech, and other technologies. The three brigades are the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division; 2nd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division; and 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. The effort draws in part on lessons learned from Ukraine, where significant drone use has defined the battlefield and underscored the need for smaller command posts as well as counter-drone operations. The three original brigades now boast more than 140 drones, George said. The effort is running in tandem with Army efforts to hide in plain sight on the battlefield, which George said has resulted in the brigades reducing their electromagnetic and physical presence by nearly 90 percent. [[Related Posts]] Transformation in Contact 2.0 will also equip 'protection and sustainment&rdquo; units by the end of fiscal year 2025, George said. Additionally, George said, the Army will focus on three other priorities: improving counter-drone systems, increasing the range and accuracy of Army long-range missiles and other forms of indirect fire, and modernizing Army munitions manufacturing. 'We have to give every formation the right systems to sense, seek, and defeat enemy [drones] to enhance their protection and security,&rdquo; George said. George also repeatedly emphasized that the Army could no longer afford to take a decade or more to field systems. 'We cannot buy programs for ten years at a time anymore, technology changes too fast.&rdquo; Going forward, the service will cut programs that don't support transformation-in-contact efforts, George said. 'There are also some things that we are going to stop buying: old, stand-alone tech that doesn't connect to our network, equipment that can't operate in our [transforming-in-contact] formations, all of the outdated stuff that isn't survivable on the modern battlefield,&rdquo; George said. That could include the cancellation of programs of record, he added. In place of the old acquisition progress, George wants to buy more equipment in tranches, so the Army can purchase different systems from year to year to fulfill a defined need, such as drones. The method would allow the Army to buy whatever technology is newest, rather than committing to a single platform that may be outdated by the time it's rolled out to the last brigade. 'It should be clear to all of us that the days where we indiscriminately could buy an entire Army's worth of inventory in a single program of record are gone,&rdquo; said George. 'We can't afford to invest in obsolescence.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/army-expand-tech-equipping-effort/400296/	2024-10-15T14:33:49-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/15/Screenshot_2024_10_15_at_11.31.38AM-1/large.png
US Army rushes to boost defenses as Russia ups strike-drone auton...	Russia is giving its armed drones more autonomy as Ukraine's defenses tighten, a dynamic that has the U.S. Army working harder to bulk up its own anti-drone and -missile systems, service and industry officials said. Defense One caught up with Sgt. Maj. Kellen Rowley, the top enlisted leader of the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, at the AUSA conference in Washington, D.C. We asked him whether Russia is increasingly relying on autonomy software for drone attacks in order to thwart defensive measures that target the connection between the weapons and their operators. 'They are,&rdquo; Rowley said. 'They are becoming more adaptive. We saw them struggle quite a bit with dynamic targeting. As time has gone on, they've adapted.&rdquo; He declined to comment further. An official from Epirus, which makes advanced counter-drone defenses, said greater autonomy was a growing trend in Russian drone attacks on Ukraine. 'There is clear evidence that full drone autonomy and swarming technology will become more pervasive in this new era of asymmetric warfare. One significant advancement in drone tech we've been closely tracking is the use of fiber-optic-guided and AI-enabled UAS that are immune to jamming and other EW countermeasures. Without a connection to jam or spoof, AI-enabled drones have seen success in Ukraine,&rdquo; the official told Defense One. [[Related Posts]] Epirus makes the Leonidas high-powered microwave system, which is designed to overloads an incoming drone's circuits with energy. That's just one example of the various solutions that the Army is rushing to put in place to deal with drone threats that are growing more diverse and difficult to stop. Russia, Iran, China and North Korea are deepening their collaboration in multiple theaters, resulting in ever-more-capable drones emerging from adversaries that weren't considered terribly high-tech. Maj. Gen. David F. Stewart, a leader of the Army's efforts on fires and anti-drone systems, told the crowd at AUSA that better drones and new tactics are enabling even low-tech adversaries to punch up their attacks, such as a Hezbollah drone strike that killed four Israeli soldiers on Sunday. 'We're seeing a lot of changes in tactics to take these procedures from the adversary. Their flight profiles now are becoming more challenging for radar systems to detect,&rdquo; said Stewart, the director of the Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office and director of fires at the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff. 'I think the better capability to detect the Group 1, 2, and 3 would be very helpful.&rdquo; Brig. Gen. Patrick Costello, who leads the 94th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, said that some new adversary drone weapons were emulating U.S. technology advancements, a trend further enabled by collaboration with Russia and China. 'North Korea recently unveiled a reconnaissance and multi-role UAV that employs a reverse engineered copy of a Hellfire missile similar to an RQ-4 and MQ-9. And so as we watch the relationships that are building,&rdquo; Costello said. He said the Army had just finished an engineering test with the Northrop Grumman XM1211 High Explosive Proximity round, an air-defense munition that is designed to explode near drones that may be attempting counter maneuvers. 'We want to extend it further,&rdquo; he said, with work on an anti-drone proximity round that can be fired from an Mk19 40mm belt-fed automatic grenade launcher. But the need for better drone defenses in more places is adding pressure on the Army to more quickly adapt as it meets the needs of partners. An example is last October's decision to send two Iron Dome systems back to Israel. U.S. Army Multi-Domain Task Force teams in the Indo-Pacific region are working to develop an entirely new capability to replace those Iron Domes: the Indirect Fire Protection Capability &ndash; High-Power Microwave, or IFPC-HPM, also from Epirus. 'We have soldiers out there testing the system. We will be employing it in the next couple of years. As the formation grows, we'll transition from structure of two Iron Dome batteries to a structure of three IFPC batteries, giving us nine platoons worth the capability,&rdquo; he said. 'Absolutely [we are] watching what's going on in CENTCOM, absolutely watching what's going on in UConn, taking every one of those lessons that we could, that we could apply to our theater.&rdquo; But counter-drone defenses are more complicated than roboticized attack drones for reasons beyond autonomy and technology, such as the increasing bureaucratic burdens of trying to work with more partners. Said Rowley of the 10th AMDC, 'I think probably our single biggest challenge is operating inside of NATO. There are 32 member nations in NATO, and our adversaries are exporting gaps to NATO policy. Group one, group one, UAS are able to operate below the threshold, and it's a challenging bit for us, under peacetime conditions and authorities for soldiers to recognize when they should or can engage.. All of that points to a need for more collaboration across the services, the U.S. government and with researchers, industry, and partners, said Stewart, the counter-drone office chief. 'I'm pushing for a whole-of-nation approach, not just a whole government. When we're talking about other interagency partners, it really is going to have to be academia. You're going to have to have the government involved, and then on down the line with the industry as well.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/us-army-rushes-boost-defenses-russia-ups-strike-drone-autonomy/400291/	2024-10-15T13:53:51-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/15/Screenshot_2024_10_15_at_10.45.24AM/large.png
Protest puts Army’s HADES spy plane on hold	Work is paused on the U.S. Army's effort to equip high-flying jets with spy gear as L3Harris protests the service's decision to give the contract to the Sierra Nevada Corporation. In August, SNC won a 12-year contract worth up to almost $1 billion to load Bombardier's Global 6500 jet with spy systems, beating out a team of three companies: L3Harris, Leidos, and MAG Aerospace. L3Harris filed a formal protest on Sept. 16 asking the Government Accountability Office to review the decision, according to a company spokesperson. 'We carefully reviewed the information during the Army's debrief process, which led us to challenge the HADES decision and request further analysis to ensure the proposal received an equitable evaluation,&rdquo; they said. This protest is only a 'temporary setback,&rdquo; said Tim Harper, SNC's vice president of business development. Harper said he's confident in the process and awaits the GAO's decision. 'We stand by our proposed solution and the experienced team of professionals who have diligently worked to create an aerial ISR solution that will give the Army the advantage required for the near-peer fight. Regarding the protest, we remain fully committed and are confident in the superiority of our solution and the Army's selection of SNC for the HADES contract,&rdquo; Harper said. Army officials have previously called 'deep sensing&rdquo;&mdash;that is, efforts to track enemies at a distance&mdash;the service's No. 1 operational imperative for the Army of 2030. The office will make a decision on the protest by Dec. 26. Aviation Week was first to report the protest. As work on HADES is stalled, SNC is continuing to work on the Army's Theater-Level High-Altitude Expeditionary Next Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platform&mdash;called ATHENA, which is gearing up for flight tests this month. The Army is using ATHENA and other prototype programs to figure out requirements ahead of HADES production.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/protest-puts-armys-hades-spy-plane-hold/400277/	2024-10-15T10:06:06-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/15/snc_army_hades_intel_bizjet_contract_copy/large.jpg
In Pacific, Army brigade tweaks its modernization program for jun...	The lone Pacific brigade chosen for the Army's new equipment strategy is finding that the new tech has unique advantages for its terrain &mdash; as well as challenges, the unit's commanding general said Friday. The unit, the 2nd Brigade of the Hawaii-based 25th Infantry Division, is one of just three brigades selected for the Army's 'transforming-in-contact&rdquo; strategy. The two others are the 101st Airborne Division's 2nd Brigade and the 10th Mountain Division's 3rd Brigade. Under the strategy, units are given a range of new tech and told to figure out how to best use it at their home bases and in challenging field exercises. The Army has so focused on drone, counter-drone, and electronic warfare for the strategy, drawing in part on lessons from Ukraine. In an exercise running Oct. 7 to 16 at the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center, the unit brought as many as 150 small drones, said 25th Infantry Division commander Maj. Gen. Marcus Evans. Those drones include around 130 Skydio drones fielded under the Army's Short Range Reconnaissance program, plus Parrot and Teal drones, a 25th Infantry Division public affairs officer said. The Army also leased several Kraus K1000 drones, the spokesperson added. That's a lot more small drones than Army units have generally carried. The service only recently began acquiring such systems and so far has bought them in quantities of a few hundred a year&mdash;generally under the Short Range Reconnaissance Program. Evans said the unit's drones and electronic warfare units are seeing successes in the exercise. After spotting a 'enemy&rdquo; unit through electronic means, they tracked it with drones, and then called in a simulated loitering-munition strike. The unit uses the Switchblade 600 loitering munition, which the Army acquires under the Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance, or LASSO, program. Based on advice from the 101st's 2nd Brigade and their own experience, the 25th's 2nd Brigade has also increased the number of Starlink satellite terminals it uses, Evans said. The 19-by-12-inch dishes provide far faster transmission speeds than traditional Army satellite systems, while being much more portable and easier to hide. The brigade is experimenting with three to four terminals that the commander can re-distribute as necessary, as well as two terminals per battalion. Sustainment assets also get Starlink terminals, Evans said. The terminals are particularly useful for allowing sustainment efforts to disperse, thereby becoming harder to hit. 'They can't all stay together, because they will be targetable,&rdquo; he said. Starlink devices are particularly important in the vast distances of the Pacific. One battalion, for example, is deployed 200 miles away from its brigade command, on a different island, Evans said. The Starlinks allow the brigade to 'overcome the tyranny of distance,&rdquo; he said. At the same time, some Pacific-related factors&mdash;like heat&mdash;play havoc with the very systems at the center of the 'transforming-in-contact&rdquo; experiment. During a previous rotation to the Philippines, drones had 'much less endurance&rdquo; because heat drained their batteries, Evans said. To get more power, the 25th Infantry is testing out a solar-powered generator that allows small light infantry units to recharge batteries used for drones and other systems, he said. The Pacific rains also made problems for drones and mission command systems. Fortunately, the 2nd Brigade has partners &mdash; the two other brigades that are also going through transformation-in-contact. Evans said the 2nd Brigade works closely with the 101st's 2nd Brigade, and has duplicated many elements of how that unit has set itself up. 'Our collaboration with them has been nearly seamless from how we structure our network to how to employ deception measures,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/pacific-army-brigade-tweaks-its-modernization-program-jungle-warfare/400275/	2024-10-15T09:29:51-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/15/2nd_brigade_462793396_957422419759085_8170544672272077243_n/large.jpg
The D Brief: Chinese blockade drill encircles Taiwan; Army progra...	New: China's military carried out snap drills Monday encircling the democratic island of Taiwan, and it did so with no 24-hour notification, no specific locations announced, and no end date for what it referred to as its Joint Sword 2024B exercises&mdash;the -A portion having occurred this past May. Beijing's stated objectives included a 'blockade of key ports and areas,&rdquo; and practicing an 'assault on maritime and ground targets.&rdquo; China's Coast Guard also patrolled the waters surrounding Taiwan over the course of the 12-hour exercise. And Beijing set a new record for aerial pestering around Taiwan, using 153 aircraft&mdash;111 of which entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone, according to Taipei Defense Ministry. 'This is the highest single-day total ever recorded,&rdquo; said Taiwan-watcher Ian Ellis. Taiwan's defense ministry condemned China's actions as 'irrational and provocative&rdquo; and vowed to 'deploy appropriate forces to respond and defend our national sovereignty.&rdquo; It also distributed a map purporting to show China's operating areas around the island. Worth noting: The drills occurred four days after Taiwan President William Lai delivered a 'National Day&rdquo; speech in which he said officials in Beijing have 'no right to represent Taiwan&rdquo; and that the democratic island is 'not subordinate&rdquo; to Beijing, the Taipei Times reports. Official Chinese military reax: The exercises are 'a stern warning to the separatist acts of &lsquo;Taiwan independence' forces,&rdquo; and 'a legitimate and necessary operation for safeguarding national sovereignty and national unity,&rdquo; Eastern Theater Command spokesman Senior Captain Li Xi said in a statement. Official Pentagon reax: 'This military pressure operation is irresponsible, disproportionate, and destabilizing,&rdquo; Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement Monday. 'It is a long-standing tradition for Taiwan's president to deliver remarks on [October 10],&rdquo; he said. 'It is a routine, domestic-focused address that has historically prompted little response from the [People's Republic of China]. Still, the PRC has chosen this opportunity to take provocative, military action.&rdquo; Expert reax: 'It was pretty clear from the outset that no matter what President Lai said, Beijing would use his address to &lsquo;justify' the exercises,&rdquo; said consultant J. Michael Cole. Was China looking to impress Russia? Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov visited Beijing on the very day the snap drills took place, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted Monday evening. 'Russian forces have experience repelling Ukrainian autonomous naval drone strikes against Russian naval and port infrastructure, and the [Chinese military] may hope to absorb some of these lessons in planning for the PRC's potential future actions against Taiwan,&rdquo; ISW wrote atop their daily assessment. New: Taiwan's army just signed contracts to buy nearly 1,000 U.S.-made attack drones, including 685 Switchblade 300 loitering munitions and 291 Altius 600M-V anti-armor attack drones, the South China Morning Post reported Tuesday. Altogether, the contracts are just under $164 million. But don't expect these anytime soon: 'The Switchblade drones are expected to be delivered by the end of November 2029 while the Altius drones are expected to be delivered by the end of 2027,&rdquo; SCMP writes.

Ingram was on the deck of his submarine, Cassin (DD-43), when a German torpedo approached; he rushed to throw depth charges overboard to prevent their detonation and died in the torpedo's explosion. He received the Medal of Honor and became the namesake of a U.S. Navy warship, the first U.S. enlisted sailor so honored. Developing: The Pentagon is sending a THAAD air defense battery to Israel in anticipation of additional attacks from Iran. After all, according to manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the system is a 'combat-proven defense capability against short, medium and intermediate-range ballistic missile threats.&rdquo; And Iran has an enormous stockpile of ballistic missiles, as think tanks like the Center for Strategic and International Studies note. Latest: 'An advance team of U.S. military personnel and initial components&rdquo; arrived Monday, with the rest expected 'in the coming days,&rdquo; the Pentagon's Maj. Gen. Ryder said in a statement Tuesday morning. Sending the battery to Israel 'underscores the United States' commitment to the defense of Israel and to defend Americans in Israel from any ballistic missile attacks by Iran,&rdquo; Ryder said, declining to elaborate on precise timelines 'for operations security reasons.&rdquo; By the way: Israel 'faces a looming shortage of interceptor missiles as it prepares itself for attacks from Iran and its proxies,&rdquo; the Financial Times reported Tuesday, citing industry executives, former military officials and analysts. Developing: Israel is also planning to attack Iranian military targets instead of its energy sector, the Washington Post reported Monday afternoon. Israeli officials have promised a response following Iran's attack on October 1 featuring around 200 ballistic missiles, many of which appear to have struck an air force base hosting F-35 jets in southern Israel, according to satellite imagery. Oil prices dropped 4% on the news, Reuters reported Tuesday morning. ICYMI: A Hezbollah drone attack Sunday killed four Israeli soldiers and wounded 61 others in the town of Binyamina. The Iran-backed militants used at least three different kinds of projectiles&mdash;drones, rockets, and three precision missiles&mdash;simultaneously to attack Israel, which likely contributed to the attack's unusually high casualty count, according to a preliminary investigation by the Israeli air force. 'The [Israeli] Navy and Iron Dome [air defense system] intercepted two of the drones near Nahariya and Acre but detection systems lost track of a third drone, a Shahed 107&mdash;which ultimately impacted in Binyamina,&rdquo; the Washington-based ISW relayed Monday afternoon. Notable: Hezbollah reportedly attempted a similar tactic on Monday, but did not have similar results.

New: The U.S. Army wants to recruit 61,000 new soldiers this fiscal year, which is a sharp increase over last year, Defense One's Sam Skove reported Monday from the annual Association of the U.S. Army convention in Washington. The 61,000 number is similar to the Army's 2022 recruiting goal of 60,000 and its 2023 target of 65,000 new soldiers. Both years the Army missed its target by about 15,000 soldiers, Skove writes. But the service exceeded its fiscal year 2024 recruiting target of 55,000 new soldiers&mdash;though by just half a percent. Notable: Secretary Christine Wormuth signaled that the Army is open to cutting more programs. That warning comes nine months after the service canceled a major helicopter program because it said unmanned, current, and space-based assets could do the job. (The service had already spent nearly $2 billion on the program, known as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft.) 'As we continue modernizing our weapons systems, we are also asking ourselves every step of the way, 'Does this capability make our troops more lethal?&rdquo; Wormuth said. 'If the answer to any of those questions is 'no' or even 'maybe,' we are willing to make hard choices and adjust course.&rdquo; More, here. Also in Defense One: 'The X-Men and Avengers have lessons for international defense cooperation,&rdquo; writes retired Air Force Lt. Col. Dan Ward, who is now Senior Principal Systems Engineer at the MITRE Corporation; And global 'Sales of anti-armor missiles [are] projected to slow,&rdquo; according to a report from our sister site, Forecast International. And lastly: Former President Trump suggested using the National Guard and military against his political enemies. In an echo of 1950s-era Sen. Joe McCarthy, the GOP presidential candidate said on a Sunday interview show that the United States is threatened by an 'enemy from within.&rdquo; And should a violence break out on Election Day, 'I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen,&rdquo; he told a Fox interviewer, adding that 'the bigger problem is the enemy from within, not even the people that have come in and destroyed our country.&rdquo; Who is the enemy? He named Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who presented evidence against him during his first impeachment trial.

Sales of anti-armor missiles projected to slow	The long-predicted demise of the tank has not arrived yet, despite the continuing sales of anti-tank munitions. Armed forces will likely spend $20 billion on short-range anti-armor weapons in the next decade, according to a new report out from Forecast International. Annual sales are expected to dip in the short term, but will likely rise again after that, with total production expected to average around 26,000, the report says. The U.S. and Europe are working on new missiles to meet the needs of different military services. The U.S. Joint Air-to-Ground Missile program has seen several delays to its planned in-service date, but appears to be avoiding the fate of its predecessor: the cancelled Joint Common Missile program. U.S. firms, such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are the leading players in this market, accounting for a combined 28 percent value share with the Javelin joint venture and other programs. Europe's position has declined to around a 19 percent value share but is expected to improve with the development of new systems. Europe is moving to develop new anti-armor missiles and hold on to its share of this market. The MMP (Akeron MP) and MLP programs aim to replace the MILAN and HOT, respectively. MBDA is working to interest more European companies in participating in these programs. A trend to watch out for: anti-ship missiles have begun to become multi-purpose weapons that can engage a wider variety of targets. Could anti-armor missiles be next?	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/militaries-are-snapping-anti-armor-missiles/400267/	2024-10-14T16:15:10-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/14/A_Ukrainian_Army_sol_2500/large.jpg
Army ups recruiting target for FY25 after hitting goal	The Army wants to recruit 61,000 new soldiers this fiscal year, a sharp increase over last year and a return to the higher goals of the previous two years. The target is 'ambitious, but achievable,&rdquo; Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said as the annual meeting of the Association of the U.S. Army, or AUSA, opened on Monday in downtown Washington, D.C. The Army has already begun working on its fiscal 2025 goal: recruiters have enlisted some 11,000 soldiers who will begin serving next year under the delayed entry program. The Army exceeded its fiscal year 2024 recruiting target of 55,000 new soldiers by half a percent. Its success was due in part to its implementation of a program designed to get applicants' physical fitness and test scores up to scratch. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, this Future Soldier Preparatory Course graduated 13,206 students into basic training in 2024. The 61,000 number is similar to the Army's 2022 recruiting goal of 60,000 and its 2023 target of 65,000 new soldiers. Both years the Army missed its goal by about 15,000 soldiers. The service has attributed its recruiting struggles to low unemployment numbers, the prevalence of obesity, and the COVID-19 pandemic preventing recruiters from visiting high schools. At the same time, the Army is working to retain the talent it already has, especially in technically complex fields like electronic warfare and drone operation, which are at the center of an Army modernization pushed dubbed 'transforming in contact.&rdquo; Speaking at a media roundtable after Wormuth's speech, Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Randy George said retention numbers are higher than normal in the three brigades selected for the modernization program. Wormuth also signaled that the Army is open to cutting more programs, nine months after canceling a major helicopter program because it concluded unmanned, current, and space-based assets could do the job. The Army had already spent nearly $2 billion on the program, the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft. 'As we continue modernizing our weapons systems, we are also asking ourselves every step of the way, 'Does this capability make our troops more lethal?&rdquo; Wormuth said. 'If the answer to any of those questions is 'no&rdquo; or even 'maybe,&rdquo; we are willing to make hard choices and adjust course.&rdquo; The Army is also collaborating with Congress to develop what Wormuth called 'more agile funding&rdquo; mechanisms to acquire drones and counter-drone and electronic warfare technology. The service recently worked with Congress to reprogram money to start fielding company-level drones in 2025 instead of 2024, and to field 3D printers to units for creating their own drones, Army acquisition secretary chief Doug Bush said at an event held by think tank CSIS.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/army-ups-recruiting-target-fy25-after-hitting-goal/400265/	2024-10-14T15:43:56-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/14/Army_Secretary_Chris_2500/large.jpg
The X-Men and Avengers have lessons for international defense coo...	As tensions rise with Russia and China, America's greatest strategic advantage lies not in any single weapons system, but in our unparalleled network of global alliances. While our rivals struggle to maintain even a handful of true partners, the United States stands at the center of a coalition that is greater than anything Nick Fury and Charles Xavier combined could ever imagine. But are we fully leveraging this strength when it comes to developing and acquiring new military capabilities? The truth is, we're not&mdash;at least not yet. Despite fighting alongside coalition partners in virtually every modern conflict, from Afghanistan to the Pacific, America's defense acquisition workforce tends to operate in relative isolation. Our program offices develop new systems with little input from the very allies who will fight beside us. We train as we fight, but we don't buy as we fight. It's as if we're trying to save the world with Iron Man suits while ignoring the rest of the Avengers. Yes, Tony Stark's tech is amazing, but he's far less effective when he goes solo. The real-world disconnect between our operational reality and our acquisition practices introduces unnecessary risks into our national defense posture. Systems developed without allied input may lack crucial interoperability features or fail to account for coalition priorities. We may reinvent wheels that our partners have already perfected or miss opportunities to pool resources and talent. It's like one hero trying to close that scary portal over New York City without coordinating with the rest of the team; it's inefficient and potentially disastrous. Talking with our allies is essential The solution is surprisingly simple, although not necessarily easy: Our acquisition professionals must talk to their international counterparts. Their conversations need not be restricted to formal, highly structured environments&mdash;which certainly have their value&mdash;but should also include informal personal connections that foster collaboration and mutual understanding. It's less about building 'International Joint Coalition Allied System Program Offices&rdquo; (which, let's be honest, would be a nightmare to develop) and more about quietly eating shawarma together after the battle. Those are the connections that make the more rigorous conversations easier. Imagine if every American program manager, engineer, and contracting officer had ongoing relationships with peers in allied nations. It would be like creating our own global defense version of S.H.I.E.L.D. Acquisition professionals from around the world could share ideas, discuss common challenges, and identify opportunities for joint development or shared investment. They could build an organic understanding of each other's needs, priorities, capabilities, and limitations. This web of connections would not only improve our technical capabilities but also evolve in unpredictable ways and strengthen the human bonds that form the true foundation of our alliances. After all, even Iron Man and Wolverine eventually learned to trust and work with others. Creating these connections doesn't require massive policy overhauls or new international agreements. As I stated in a recent whitepaper, some policy updates would help, but ultimately it starts with simple steps like creating forums for international exchange, establishing fellowship programs, or even just encouraging acquisition professionals to reach out to their foreign counterparts. We may not have Professor X's Cerebro system, but we do have smartphones. Let's use them. And to be clear, this is not just about increasing the Defense Department's foreign military sales efforts. Instead, it's about widening the ecosystem and designing our systems with allies in mind, which means actually talking with them and building partnerships that flow in both directions. We might even discover that some of Wakanda's tech outperforms Stark Industries. One promising sign is the new International Joint Requirements Oversight Council, or I-JROC, initiative, which brings together the vice chiefs of defense of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia to 'identify and validate joint and combined warfighter proposals.&rdquo; As Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Christopher Grady explained in a recent article, 'Interoperability and interchangeability are easier to achieve when pursued from the beginning&hellip;&rdquo; and that he would like to 'add more allies and partnerships to the conversation to address our future challenges and opportunities&mdash;together.&rdquo; With an I-JROC validating warfighter proposals, we also need program managers who have an informed international perspective as they turn these proposals into capabilities. On a similar note, last month President Biden hosted the 'Quad&rdquo; Leaders&mdash;prime ministers from Australia, India, and Japan&mdash;to discuss military defense in the Indo-Pacific, among other topics. Their conversation is an outstanding example for the wider acquisition community to follow. I'm sure you can draw your own superhero-themed metaphor at this point. Benefits outweigh technical challenges The benefits of this approach extend far beyond improved interoperability. By tapping into the collective expertise of our allies, we gain access to a broader pool of innovation and talent. We can aggregate demand to drive down costs and accelerate delivery timelines. It's the difference between facing Thanos alone or with the combined might of Earth's mightiest heroes. And just as importantly, it would send a powerful message of deterrence, based on the strength and unity of our alliances&mdash;a message that stands in stark contrast to the isolation of our rivals. Critics may point to potential security risks or the technical challenges of 'design by committee.&rdquo; These are valid concerns, but they are far outweighed by the risks of continuing to develop capabilities in isolation. With thoughtful guidelines and a clear shared vision, international collaboration can actually improve security by creating legitimate pathways for technology sharing that reduce incentives for espionage. Creating something like Five Eyes for the Industrial Base would be an intriguing piece of this puzzle. As we face a future of intensifying great power competition, America's alliances remain our ace in the hole. Russia and China, for all their bluster, can count their true partners on one hand&mdash;or one finger. They're more Hydra than Avengers. In contrast, the United States has dozens of genuine partners, representing a staggering share of global military and economic power. By fostering personal connections between our acquisition professionals and their allied counterparts, we can turn this latent strength into a true force multiplier. It's time to buy the way we fight: together, with our allies. Dan Ward is a military technologist and innovation catalyst at MITRE.

Boeing defense will take $2B in 3Q losses; company to cut 10% of ...	Boeing's defense business continued bleeding in the third quarter of 2024 as troubled programs, fixed-price contracts, and an inability to reach a deal with thousands of striking machinists dragged down the company. On Friday, the aerospace giant announced that it will cut 10% of its entire workforce, roughly 17,000 people, in order to 'position&rdquo; itself for the future. The dramatic move comes after 30,000 company workers rejected a new labor contract and stopped working last month&mdash;a strike with no end in sight. In a letter to employees, CEO Kelly Ortberg noted 'substantial new losses&rdquo; for Boeing's defense business, driven by work stoppage on military aircraft built at its factories, including the commercial-derived Air Force KC-46 tanker and Navy P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, continued program challenges, and the decision to end production of its 767 freighter, the basis of the KC-46, in 2027. 'Defense, Space & Security expects to recognize pre-tax earnings charges of $2 billion on the T-7A, KC-46A, commercial crew, and MQ-25 programs. The T-7A program pre-tax charge of $0.9 billion was driven by higher estimated costs on production contracts in 2026 and beyond. The KC-46A program pre-tax charge of $0.7 billion reflects the decision to conclude production on the 767 freighter and impacts of the IAM [International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers] work stoppage. Results also include unfavorable performance on other programs,&rdquo; according to the company's preliminary third-quarter results. The head of Boeing's defense sector, Ted Colbert, was pushed out of the job just a few weeks ago, and the company has yet to announce his successor. The company will hold its third-quarter call on October 23.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/boeing-defense-will-take-2b-3q-losses-company-cut-10-entire-workforce/400258/	2024-10-11T15:16:11-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/11/A_strike_sign_is_pic_2500/large.jpg
How many drones does the Army need? More.	The Army is buying hundreds of small drones as it starts to equip its infantry with warfare's latest must-have weapon, but that's not nearly enough. The experience of current units suggests the service will need to buy thousands per year just to meet training objectives, let alone go to war. In February, Army Chief of Staff Randy George announced the 'transforming-in-contact&rdquo; effort, in which would send new kit to three infantry brigades that would evaluate it. The strategy focuses on technologies the Army sees as important for the future of warfare, including improved communications, electronic warfare capabilities, and small drones. The three units are the 101st Airborne's 2nd Brigade, the 25th Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade, and 10th Mountain 3rd Brigade. The Army may yet add more; the 3rd Infantry Division, for example, is hastening to apply lessons from these brigades' experience. Alongside the new tech have come new formations designed to use the drones for maximum effectiveness. In the 101st Airborne, drone-focused units include the Multifunctional Reconnaissance Company, or MFRC, a formation designed to dwell deep behind an enemy's lines and observe their movement. The company consists of three reconnaissance platoons, as well as an electronic warfare platoon and a robotics and autonomous systems, or RAS, platoon. Each reconnaissance unit comes with up to six short-range drones, while the robotics and autonomous systems platoon fly heavier, longer-range drones like Performance Drone Works C100. The drones are used for reconnaissance, artillery fire correction, and light bombing. In addition to the MFRC, the 101st's three battalions also have one new drone platoon apiece.. The platoons are staffed by seven operators for their 12 short-range drones, or a little under two drones per operator. In total, that's as many as 54 short-range drones, plus the heavier systems used by the RAS platoon. That's much more than units previously fielded, but even more may be needed to make up for losses in training. During intensive training, like that seen during rotation in a combat training center, one drone platoon commander said he expected that at least one drone every other day would fall victim to operator or mechanical error. While sturdy, drones are prone to any number of accidents: an operator may accidentally clip a tree branch, the drone could lose signal, or the battery could drain before the drone gets back to base. Other brigades are fielding similarly large numbers of drones, and are also grappling with malfunctions. In 2022, the Army's 25th Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade began experimenting with drone training and acquisition even before it was selected as a 'transforming-in-contact&rdquo; brigade this year. After months of effort, the unit's rifle platoons are now 'fully fielded&rdquo; with between five and seven small drones per platoon, said brigade commander Col. Graham White by email in August. That's a total of 189 small drones. White said that it was a 'safe assumption&rdquo; that around 25 percent of drones would irretrievably break or or be lost during intensive training missions, like those in a combat training center. White is now chief of staff of the 25th Infantry Division. Overall, he said he expected that all of a platoon's drones would 'break, crash or require minor repair&rdquo; over an expected five year life cycle. White added that 3D printing and in-house repair systems and technicians were therefore key for keeping drone units operational. He said they were 'gaining ground in both areas.&rdquo; At an September event held by think tank CSIS, Army acquisition head Doug Bush said that the service had recently gotten approval from Congress to reprogram money to give units 3D printers to print drone parts. The numbers deployed by the 101st Airborne Division and 25th Infantry Division, in turn, suggests the Army will need to start buying drones by the thousands. If all 59 of the Army's active and National Guard brigades follow the lead of the 101st Airborne, for example, over 3,000 short-range drones would be required to equip their platoons. To make up for training losses, the Army will also need to regularly buy replacements. Assuming a rate of 25 percent lost per year during intensive training, the Army might need to purchase another 1,000 drones or so per year. This number may vary by brigade type, which could increase or decrease drone needs. An armored brigade, for example, can more easily take advantage of tethered drones, which can be connected to a vehicle and therefore less easily lost. That number does not include a number of other drones the Army is buying or considering. In September, the Army chose Anduril's Ghost X and Performance Drone Works' C-100 to field as their company-level drone. The Army is also working on plans to acquire long-range drones, first-person-view loitering munitions, and tethered drones. It also does not include the number of drones needed in an actual war. Russia and Ukraine both lose thousands of drones per month to electronic warfare, bullets, and missiles. Industry observers could see some concrete steps in the coming months. In December and January, Teal and Skydio, respectively, announced they were competing for the second tranche of the Army's Short Range Reconnaissance program. The Army is moving relatively swiftly to buy drones. The requirement for the company-level drone, for example, was approved in June 2023, with an award for tranche one in September 2024. And the Army has signaled it wants to buy in quantity. Speaking at a Defense News event in September, Bush said that the Army was seeking to buy drones in the same quantity it buys ammunition. 'We need them potentially at a very large scale and very quickly,&rdquo; Bush said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/how-many-drones-does-army-need-more/400251/	2024-10-11T13:57:41-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/11/8273054/large.jpg
How Russia, China envision nuking US satellites: from above and b...	Nearly six decades after the Outer Space Treaty banned military activities in space, its norms appear to be losing their power. In May, U.S. officials from the Defense and State Departments disclosed the possibility of Russia deploying a nuclear-detonation device into space, and that a suspected testbed satellite had already been in orbit for two years. China, meanwhile, has embarked on a campaign to expand its strategic nuclear forces beyond the numbers required for 'minimum deterrence&rdquo; and develop new delivery platforms, including a fractional orbital bombardment system. Chinese and Russian interest in space nukes derives from their expressed anxiety over the U.S. strategy of deploying large and widely dispersed satellite constellations, such as the Space Development Agency's 'Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture,&rdquo; as well as commercial networks such as SpaceX's Starlink communications satellites. SDA Director Derek Tournear has described his agency's 'proliferation&rdquo; as a game-changing strategy of resilience, using numbers and architecture to keep U.S. space networks working despite single-point attacks via kinetic, directed-energy, or electromagnetic means. However, this has threatened the sense of 'space deterrence&rdquo; gained by China and Russia through their own investments in anti-satellite weapons. Using nuclear effects to hold entire orbital regimes at risk offers an alternative way to counter such proliferated constellations. Yet not all nuclear detonations in space are equal. Understanding the different Russian and Chinese concepts for nuclear ASAT weapons, so far as they are understood in the public realm, will be crucial to any multilateral efforts to secure the space domain. Russia aims high... In early May, Assistant Secretary of State Mallory Stewart said Russia had not yet deployed an operational nuclear device in space, and, even if they had, it would not directly threaten human life. She did disclose, however, that Russia had launched a test satellite. 'Russia has publicly claimed that their satellite is for scientific purposes,&rdquo; Stewart said. 'However, the orbit is in a region not used by any other spacecraft&mdash;that in itself was somewhat unusual &ndash; and the orbit is a region of higher radiation than normal lower-Earth orbits.&rdquo; Amateur observers quickly identified the satellite as Cosmos-2553 and its unusual orbit to be 2,000 km up, at the upper edge of low-Earth orbit, or LEO. Ostensibly carrying a synthetic aperture radar payload, Cosmos-2553 may have secondary payloads or otherwise be used to help understand the radiation and electromagnetic environment relevant to a nuclear ASAT program. In Congressional testimony, then-Assistant Defense Secretary John Plumb revealed a rationale for why that might be important. 'Some [satellites] would be caught in an immediate [nuclear] blast, which they would not be able to survive the flux of that. And then others could be damaged over time&hellip;if [the] Van Allen belts are pumped,&rdquo; Plumb told lawmakers. Plumb was referring to the Van Allen radiation belts that surround Earth. Cosmos-2553 orbits within the inner Van Allen belt&mdash;much higher, incidentally, than the infamous 1962 Starfish Prime nuclear detonation by the United States that damaged or disabled one-third of the satellites in orbit at the time. U.S. analysts appear to believe that the Russian nuclear ASAT intent is to rapidly 'pump&rdquo; the inner Van Allen radiation belt and transform areas of low-Earth orbit and some higher altitudes into high-exposure zones. Most satellites in LEO are designed to operate in a relatively benign radiation environment, given the natural protection of Earth's magnetic field. Satellites in higher orbits are generally built to withstand higher radiation exposure, so they would be less susceptible than their more numerous compatriots closer to Earth. A nuclear blast 2,000 km up would likely not cause much immediate damage, but repeated passes through artificially augmented radiation belts could quickly degrade satellite electronics. Sun-synchronous satellites and any others with inclinations taking them through energized field lines would be the first to fail. This effect would also linger. Plumb indicated that the effects of a Russian attack might last a year. High-energy particles released by Starfish Prime stayed in orbit for at least five. ...while China goes low Beijing appears to have different ideas about nuclear detonation in space. China's leading military technologists and strategic thinkers have identified space as the linchpin for U.S. military operations, with a remarkably close reading of U.S. military concepts and verbiage. For example, Wu Mingxi, chief scientist at one of China's largest military conglomerates and author of an influential book on the future of warfare, writes, 'In space-based information network construction and space-based information applications, the United States is the leader.&hellip;Through the practice of war, they have accelerated space-based information applications and increased the pace of progress&hellip;greatly decreasing the time of their &lsquo;Observe, Orient, Decide, Attack' (OODA) loop.&rdquo; Col. John Boyd defined the final segment of his OODA loop as 'act,&rdquo; but here Wu rendered it as '攻击&rdquo; or 'attack.&rdquo; The central thesis of Wu's vision is not to overmatch the United States in a correlation-of-forces contest, but to change the terms of conflict by unleashing a networked system-of-systems powered by AI to react exponentially faster than an opponent. Using nuclear detonation to strike a critical blow to U.S. space assets would severely hamper the operational tempo of U.S. forces, despite the SDA's proliferated networks. A review of literature of PRC papers on nuclear detonation in space has shown a steady progression from relatively crude simulations of burst-shell dynamics to fine-tuning the parameters of a detonation to achieve different shapes and effects. Advancements in AI and supercomputing also allow research and planning that was not possible back in the Cold War. China has the capacity to model these nuclear detonations precisely without the need for real-world testing, which is prohibited by international treaties. In contrast to the apparent Russian model of pumping the Van Allen belts from above, PRC research has focused on using atmospheric effects from below LEO, generating ionizing radiation and high-energy particles closer to Earth. Such effects could be more finely modulated with yields as low as one kiloton. One potential delivery means might be the FOBS-Hypersonic Glide Vehicle hybrid platform that China demonstrated in 2021. It could carry a warhead to any point around the Earth, but in a different path than traditional ballistic missile delivery, making it less likely to be perceived as a strategic nuclear attack. A detonation from below LEO would produce immediate radiation effects on any satellites within line-of-sight. A localized augmented artificial radiation belt and a plume of radioactive debris might persist for weeks or longer. Such a weapon would still be indiscriminate and affect any satellite passing through the region. Closer to Earth, such a device would also generate an electromagnetic pulse propagating downward through the atmosphere to affect any unshielded terrestrial electronics, particularly long-distance wires such as power lines or telecom cables. Still, a single shot would be less global in scale and shorter in duration than the above apparent Russian nuclear ASAT. Intentions matter How likely are China and Russia to implement such an extreme and treaty-breaking plan for weaponizing space? After China's 20th Party Congress in 2022, party leaders directed its military to 'construct a strong strategic deterrence force structure,&rdquo; and face down the 'myriad cross-domain challenges of a networked space force.&rdquo; To create this new deterrence force structure, the People's Liberation Army was directed to go beyond traditional thinking and use both nuclear and conventional forces in new ways. In Russia, Vladimir Putin revealed novel nuclear doomsday devices in 2018 and has since repeatedly rattled his nuclear sabers during his invasion of Ukraine. Prominent Russia analyst Masha Gessen concluded that Putin is determined to foist new nuclear doctrine on the world. One aspect that is still unclear about either mode of nuclear ASAT is whether the warhead would be a thermonuclear or fission bomb. Fusion detonations are more efficient at producing prompt radiation effects, while a fission bomb might be more effective at contaminating the space environment with persistent radioactive flux. After Starfish Prime detonated a thermonuclear warhead 400 km up, Apollo program engineers were particularly concerned about an explosion doped with uranium-238, which would generate a higher concentration of beta particles and other fission debris, pumping the Van Allen radiation belts 'a hundredfold.&rdquo; A specially designed warhead could optimize the destructive advantages of both. In April 2024, the international community called upon Russia and China to recommit to their obligations as signatories to the Outer Space Treaty and its prohibition against deploying nuclear weapons in space. Tellingly, Russia vetoed the UN Security Council resolution and China abstained. For the sake of the global commons, the urgency to forestall and reverse the weaponization of space has rarely been higher. David D. Chen is a Senior Analyst for BluePath Labs.

CMMC's final rule has now landed	The Defense Department on Friday released the final rule for its Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification program, but this is just one of several final steps until CMMC goes into force. DOD will publish the rule officially on Monday and that is when the clock starts ticking for Congressional Review Act period. Congress does not have to approve the rule, but it does have 60 days to block the rule. Most observers have told us that is unlikely. CMMC is DOD's effort to get contractors to protect controlled but unclassified information they hold in their systems. Contractors need that information to do their work for defense and intelligence agency customers. This data is generally called CUI. CMMC creates a third-party certification process contractors must go through to show they comply with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's cybersecurity standard 800-171. Until this point, contractors have self-certified their compliance. At a Professional Services Council-hosted event on Tuesday, a pair of DOD leaders hinted at CMMC's imminent release and offered advice to industry on how to comply once the rule is final. The clock begins ticking on Monday (Oct. 14), so the 60-day window ends on Dec. 13. The final rule released n the Federal Register pre-publication site is known as a part 32 rule, which has been described to us as the internal mechanisms DOD must have in place and hold contractors responsible for. Comments are due Tuesday for the part 48 CMMC rule, which is the 'external.&rdquo; This rule dictates the changes in Federal Acquisition Regulations that implement the part 32 rule. The part 48 rule is widely expected to become final by the end of this year, or into early 2025. It also must go through the 60-day Congressional Review Act process. Only when both part 32 and 48 are final will the full roll-out of CMMC begin. But DOD can begin to act on the rule while it is going through the Congressional Review Act process. The final rule released Monday likely does not contain wholesale changes from the draft final rule released in December 2023. But any changes could be seen as significant. There were open questions with the draft, particularly around how managed service providers would be handled. The rule is 470 pages long, so there is a lot of reading for all of us to do. Download the final rule here.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/cmmcs-final-rule-has-now-landed/400224/	2024-10-11T10:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/11/CMMCruleWT20241011-1/large.jpg
The D Brief: Israeli strikes in Lebanon, Syria; More Red Sea atta...	Israeli forces grind on in Lebanon: Nearly two dozen people were killed and at least 130 others wounded in an overnight attack by Israeli forces in Beirut. According to Reuters, 'Security sources said the target was senior Hezbollah official Wafiq Safa, and that he had survived.&rdquo; New: The United Nations says two of its peacekeepers were injured Friday 'after two explosions occurred close to an observation tower&rdquo; in southern Lebanon, where Israeli forces are trying to force residents to flee while they hunt suspected Hezbollah militants. UN spox, speaking to the BBC: 'It looks more of a deliberate attack against our troops, who have been in the south to try to bring back stability at the moment, and it's very, very challenging,&rdquo; Andrea Tenenti said Friday. 'How can this be a mistake from an army that is pretty well prepared, and they know what they're doing?&rdquo; he asked. Also new: Israeli tanks also broke into a UN position elsewhere in Labbouneh on Friday. 'This is a serious development, and [UN forces in Lebanon, aka UNIFIL] reiterates that the safety and security of UN personnel and property must be guaranteed and that the inviolability of UN premises must be respected at all times,&rdquo; the UN said Friday. 'Any deliberate attack on peacekeepers is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and Security Council resolution 1701 (2006),&rdquo; UN officials said. Israeli military reax: 'Hezbollah operates from within and near civilian areas in southern Lebanon, including areas near @UNIFIL posts,&rdquo; the Israeli Defense Forces said Thursday on social media, without offering supporting evidence in this instance. After confirming its troops were indeed near that position in Labbouneh, the IDF said it had 'instructed the UN forces in the area to remain in protected spaces, after which the forces opened fire in the area.&rdquo; Read more on why Israel is undeterred by the allegations, according to Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, here. A separate UN report Thursday accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza 'with relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities,&rdquo; officials announced from Geneva. 'Children in particular have borne the brunt of these attacks, suffering both directly and indirectly from the collapse of the health system,&rdquo; the UN said. UN: 'Israeli security forces have deliberately killed, detained and tortured medical personnel and targeted medical vehicles while tightening their siege on Gaza and restricting permits to leave the territory for medical treatment. These actions constitute the war crimes of wilful killing and mistreatment and of the destruction of protected civilian property and the crime against humanity of extermination.&rdquo; Separately, 'Male detainees were subjected to rape, as well as attacks on their sexual and reproductive organs and forced to perform humiliating and strenuous acts while naked or stripped as a form of punishment or intimidation to extract information,&rdquo; the UN said. 'The lack of accountability for actions ordered by senior Israeli authorities and carried out by individual members of Israeli security forces and the increasing acceptance of violence against Palestinians have allowed such conduct to continue uninterrupted, becoming systematic and institutionalized,&rdquo; said Navi Pillay, who chaired the commission that investigated the alleged war crimes. Israeli reax: 'This U.N. report is detached from reality and includes baseless claims about Israel,&rdquo; said Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon. Stateside observation: 'So far the penalties or accountability measures the IDF and Netanyahu government experience for failure to meet [the State Department's] basic expectations regarding civilian safety are invisible, if they exist at all,&rdquo; Defense One's Patrick Tucker wrote this week on social media. And in case you missed it, 'Israel's air campaign across Syria last week was the most aggressive seen in the 13yr crisis&mdash;with 17 rounds of strikes in 7 [out of] 14 of Syria's provinces,&rdquo; Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute noted Thursday on social media.

On this night in 1942, the Battle of Cape Esperance took place at the Solomon Islands amid what we now refer to as the Guadalcanal campaign. U.S. forces at Central Command have been awfully quiet lately despite recent Houthi calls to continue attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea and along Yemen's coast. The European Union's regional naval mission EUNAVFOR ASPIDES has been similarly quiet about action off the Yemeni coast over the past several days. New: British maritime authorities say another ship was hit with unspecified projectiles (reportedly drones) off Yemen's coast Thursday, near the Bab el Mandeb strait. The vessel 'sustained damage,&rdquo; but no fires broke out and no one was harmed. About the targeting location: The Bab el Mandeb 'is a place where one can bottleneck and quite precisely predict a tankers movement based on bearing and speed,&rdquo; regional analyst Mike Knights writes. 'An anti-ship ballistic missile needs under 120 secs to reach the target loc from launch sites north of Taizz,&rdquo; he adds. Targeted: The chemical tanker Olympic Spirit as it traveled from Egypt's Port Said to Muscat, Oman, according to regional security analyst Basha. The Houthis claim to have used 11 ballistic missiles and two drones in their attacks on Olympic Spirit. The Houthis also say they struck a different container ship (St. John) using a 'winged missile&rdquo; on Thursday. Context, via Reuters: 'Houthi fighters in Yemen have carried out nearly 100 attacks on ships crossing the Red Sea since November and say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's year-long war in Gaza. They have sunk two vessels, seized another and killed at least four seafarers.&rdquo; NATO's commercial-space strategy will resemble the Pentagon's six-month-old strategy, said Maj. Gen. Devin Pepper, deputy chief of staff for strategic plans and policy at NATO's Allied Command Transformation. Set for release next year, the alliance strategy will reflect a growing commercial market, and the need for a 'new relationship&rdquo; between the military and industry, NATO officials said in an Oct. 2 release. The U.S. strategy aimed to define what needs industry could fill, and opened the door for military protection of industry assets, but was criticized for breaking little ground, and lacking a specific roadmap. DIA's AI-powered intel repository heads to the cloud. 'We expect&rdquo; the Machine-assisted Analytic Rapid-repository System to be approved to run on the SIPRNet 'within the next few weeks, actually,&rdquo; said Doug Cossa, chief information officer of the Defense Intelligence Agency, speaking at an Intelligence and National Security Alliance virtual event on Tuesday. MARS will replace the MIDB&mdash;the late-1990s Modernized Integrated Database&mdash;as the Pentagon's main repository for 'foundational military intelligence,&rdquo; the info collected on other countries' militaries and infrastructure. A year behind? Last November, the DIA's then-chief said MARS would hit full operational capability in 2025. This week, DIA officials said in separate statements that 'the scheduled FOC is 2026&rdquo; and then that it would be reached 'as early as 2025, but no later than 2026.&rdquo; Secret space plane tests new orbit-switching maneuver. One of the Space Force's X-37Bs will try aerobraking&mdash;using the Earth's gravity and atmosphere to change orbits&mdash;in a maneuver that promises to use less fuel that the usual firing of rockets.

(Fans of 1980s sci-fi may recall the aerobraking scene in '2010: The Year We Make Contact.&rdquo;) Update: Drownings of 2 Navy SEALs were preventable, military investigation finds. AP obtained a redacted version of the investigators' report into the Jan. 11 drowning of two members of SEAL Team 3 on a mission to intercept arms being smuggled to Houthi fighters in Yemen. Investigators concluded that the drownings of Chief Special Warfare Operator Christopher J. Chambers and Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Nathan Gage Ingram were due to 'glaring training failures and a lack of understanding about what to do after falling into deep, turbulent waters.&rdquo; Read on, here. Several online trends are making Americans more susceptible to rumors and lies, and that's not good news for democracy or the U.S. military. That's the common thread through three recent studies of online behavior, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reports. One recent study found that people's views of reality are increasingly shaped by the online groups they identify with. A second found that views of society are shaped by the extreme voices that dominate social media. And a third found that groups that use encrypted messaging apps are becoming more insular. Their findings hold clues to the future of authoritarian currents and extremist political violence in the United States. Read more, here. (Extended) Weekend reading: We have two new reports regarding Russia's ongoing Ukraine invasion, thanks to think tankers on both sides of the Atlantic. Exhibit 1 is entitled, 'Ore to Ordnance: Disrupting Russia's Artillery Supply Chains,&rdquo; and it comes from the London-based Royal United Services Institute in conjunction with the Open Source Centre. Three key conclusions, according to the authors: 'More than 70% of Russia's computer numerical control machines come from China, 55% of its chromium is imported, and its imports of nitrocellulose have increased by 70% since 2022, for example.&rdquo; Those are the chief vulnerabilities identified by RUSI and OSC. 'There is redundancy within the supply chain, and even a complete disruption of the Plastmass ammunition plant &ndash; a major producer &ndash; would not lead to a collapse in Russia's ammunition supply.&rdquo; 'Russia's defence industry is expanding, with major works identified at the Perm and Kazan Gunpowder plants, Izhevsk Unmanned Systems Research and Production Association, several armoured-machine repair plants and Kurganpribor. However, the industry faces challenges such as a lack of personnel and a crumbling rail infrastructure&hellip;as well as the need for imported machinery to meet its aggressive expansion goals.&rdquo; Exhibit 2 is called 'The Central Brain of the Russian Armed Forces:The Modern Russian General Staff in Institutional Context,&rdquo; and it comes from two researchers at the Virginia-based Center for Naval Analyses.

How the internet is making America more susceptible to rumors and...	New trends in online interaction are making Americans more susceptible to the rumors and lies that undermine democracies and their militaries. That's the common thread through three recent studies of online behavior. One found that people's views of reality are increasingly shaped by the online groups they identify with. A second found that views of society are shaped by the extreme voices that dominate social media. And a third found that groups that use encrypted messaging apps are becoming more insular. Their findings hold clues to the future of authoritarian currents and extremist political violence in the United States. The first study, by Matthew Facciani of the University of Notre Dame and Cecilie Steenbuch-Traberg of the University of Cambridge, found that people with politically homogeneous personal networks&mdash;that is, they largely interact with people they believe to be like them&mdash;are more likely to believe and share politically fake news and rumors that reflect well on their group or poorly on the opposite group. The study analyzed data from 214 participants, evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. It looked at two factors: network homogeneity and what's sometimes called 'cognitive reflection&rdquo;: basically, how quickly and emotionally people form perceptions from stimuli. It measured those factors against the likelihood of the participants spreading two types of misinformation: political rumors and fake news headlines. Results showed that network homogeneity significantly increased belief in and sharing of fake news that matched the participants' group identity. 'Both Democrats and Republicans with a politically homogeneous network will be more likely to rate politically congruent rumors as true,&rdquo; the authors wrote, though Republicans were more likely to believe politically congruent fake headlines. Another study, appearing in the December issue of Current Opinion in Psychology, indicates that the polarization of the American public is only going to deepen. The authors found that social media distorts perceptions of social norms in what they dub 'a funhouse mirror effect.&rdquo; Political discourse online is largely dominated by extreme ideological voices, creating a false perception, even among normal, level-headed people, that these views are more widely held than is the case. Thanks to social-media platforms and their engagement-seeking algorithms, a small portion of users are able to have outsized effects. For example, only 3% of active accounts on Twitter are responsible for producing one-third of the content, and 0.1% of users share 80% of fake news. 'Not only does this extreme minority stir discontent, spread misinformation, and spark outrage online, they also bias the meta-perceptions of most users who passively &lsquo;lurk' online,&rdquo; write authors Claire Robertson, Kareena del Rosario, and Jay Van Bavel. Why does that happen? The problem is that people naturally take mental shortcuts to make judgements, a phenomenon called ensemble coding. It's sort of like prejudice but a bit more nuanced. When you are thinking about what a particular group believes, you are going to rely on the voices of the most prominent members of that group and extrapolate that those voices are a good representation of the whole crowd. 'Ensemble coding is cognitively efficient, allowing people to encode a single representation of a set of stimuli, rather than encoding and memorizing every item,&rdquo; they write. 'Socially, ensemble coding allows people to form a single estimation of group emotion or opinion, rather than individually encoding each person's reaction.&rdquo; That natural neurological tendency to assume that the loudest members speak for a group can work fine when those voices are actually representative. It's why advocacy groups and political parties have leaders to push their causes to the broader population. But online, the study shows, the most prominent voices representing various groups are not representative. They're just the loudest and most angry. 'The most widely shared content on Twitter/X and Facebook is moralized content, such as expressions of outrage and hostility towards political outgroups,&rdquo; the authors observe. That means that the more time people spend online, the more they're performing the normal mental task of ensemble coding based on coked-up data. 'This may be especially problematic for topics like politics, where opinions are invisible and people are generally hesitant to share their opinions with others in everyday life,&rdquo; the authors write. That's a big issue for the future of democracy in general. Other research finds that as more and more people feel worse about other groups in their country, and become convinced that those groups are very extreme in their views, it can lead to 'support for authoritarian regimes.&rdquo; Why does that matter to the military and to national security? Consider those findings in the context of the revelations of a third study that shows small, insular groups increasingly congregate on encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram, Whatsapp, and Viber. Published on Thursday, the study shows that such group chats are exposing more people to propaganda and even recruitment into violent organizations, and doing so in ways that are increasingly invisible to the outside world. Scholars at the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights and the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas in Austin looked at 4,500 encrypted messaging app users in nine countries. Those users included 'propagandists,&rdquo; which the researchers defined as 'individuals or groups working to leverage media and communication in purposeful efforts to manipulate public opinion, particularly during elections and other events of civic significance.&rdquo; Apps like Telegram are increasingly playing a role in conflict. Violent extremists have used it to plot attacks against Western targets. Members of the Russian military use it to communicate in the absence of more secure tools. Such apps have important value for privacy, freedom of expression and communication with the free press. And the scholars are adamant that policy restrictions on such apps should not aim to break encryption. But the way some individuals can use the 'broadcast&rdquo; feature to convene and then directly message self-selected groups is ripe for abuse. 'Our survey of messaging app users confirms that propagandists are able to reach non-consenting recipients despite existing safeguards. Among users who reported receiving political content via messaging apps in the last year, 55% said some of that content came from people or accounts they did not recognize,&rdquo; they write. Content moderation on encrypted platforms is almost non-existent, even compared to the decreasing content moderation on other social media platforms. 'The average removal rate of terrorist content is lower on messaging apps than on almost all other platform types, including social media, video-sharing sites, and file-sharing platforms,&rdquo; they find, citing other published research on the topic. These trends still may not seem directly relevant to military leaders&mdash;especially since, by law and job function, there is little officials can do to alter them. But when Col. Michael Kelley of the U.S. Army Reserve looked at Russian disinformation around the war in Ukraine, he concluded that U.S. defense leaders have 'failed to assess [the] impact or sufficiently negate&rdquo; foreign disinformation efforts. In a May article published by the Army War College, Kelley suggests that greater media literacy and much more timely and accurate releases of information could be one important tool for countering those trends, at least for the military. 'This proposal may raise the ire of those who believe the US military's only purpose is to fight and win kinetic wars,&rdquo; he writes. 'The Joint Force is involved in many other activities to advance America's strategic interests. An information literacy campaign can be seen as battlefield preparation. Correctly done, this campaign will better prepare allies, partners, and others to accept truthful Western narratives and reject disinformation disseminated by adversaries.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/how-internet-making-america-more-susceptible-rumors-and-lies/400212/	2024-10-10T14:35:02-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/10/GettyImages_2169780434/large.jpg

NATO aims to publish its own commercial space strategy next year	NATO is devising a commercial space strategy as allied militaries realize just how much they might need industry's satellites in wartime. It will resemble the Pentagon's six-month-old commercial space strategy, said Maj. Gen. Devin Pepper, deputy chief of staff for strategic plans and policy at NATO's Allied Command Transformation. The U.S. strategy aimed to define what needs industry could fill, and opened the door for military protection of industry assets, but was criticized for breaking little ground, and lacking a specific roadmap. NATO officials said in an Oct. 2 release that their nascent strategy will reflect a growing commercial market, and the need for a 'new relationship&rdquo; between the military and industry. 'As we see from Maxar supporting the Ukraine, or Starlink, there's a lot of commercial capability out there that we can leverage to increase our own resiliency at NATO. So we want to be able to capture that, and because right now we have contracts with several commercial companies today [but] we want to be able to expand that and make sure that we can rely on that in a conflict if we need it,&rdquo; Pepper said Thursday at an event hosted by the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. The planned NATO strategy, which was first publicly mentioned at the alliance's summit in July, may differ from the U.S. document in its requirements for commercial space systems, Pepper said, but will likely aim to fill similar needs: communications, space domain awareness, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. 'We need to be able to have that data and that information available in a fight, whether it comes from the military or not. But if that gets shut down, we have got to be able to ensure that we can still prosecute a fight, leveraging commercial capability,&rdquo; he said. Officials have started polling NATO nations to figure out what space systems they have and what commercial companies in their country might be of use, Pepper said, since not every allied country is a 'space-faring nation.&rdquo; Currently, the U.S. supplies most of NATO's space capabilities. The alliance established space as the fifth operational domain in 2019, and officials have been talking more frequently about the importance of space in military operations. But it's unlikely that other NATO countries will set up their own 'space force&rdquo; anytime soon. The U.S. Space Force could be a model for other countries to adapt, but most nations can't, given the small size of their militaries, Pepper said. 'A lot of nations can't do that, but certainly, what I appreciate about NATO is the level of importance that NATO has placed on the space domain by declaring it an operational domain in 2019, certainly taking steps to integrate space capabilities into our operations, making sure that we have resiliency in our systems, making sure that we can partner with each other to develop capability,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/nato-aims-publish-its-own-commercial-space-strategy-next-year/400204/	2024-10-10T13:22:22-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/10/pepper_424708695_813566714144778_1396358678288170023_n/large.jpg
Secret space plane tests new orbit-switching maneuver	A U.S. X-37B space plane is slated to test a new way of rapidly changing its orbit, part of the Space Force's quest for fuel-sipping maneuverability. The spacecraft will experiment with aerobraking, which uses Earth's atmosphere to slow down and switch orbits. 'The use of the aerobraking maneuver&mdash;a series of passes using the drag of Earth's atmosphere&mdash;enables the spacecraft to change orbits while expending minimal fuel,&rdquo; the service said in a release today. NASA has used the maneuver, but it is 'novel&rdquo; to the X-37B, the release said. One of the Space Force's two X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles&mdash;OTV-7&mdash;was launched into space in December, the program's seventh known mission. The U.S. military has disclosed few details about its mission or purpose in low Earth orbit, other than noting that X-37 tests include operating in new orbital regimes and experiments with space domain awareness technologies. 'Once the aerobrake maneuver is complete, the X-37B will resume its test and experimentation objectives until they are accomplished, at which time the vehicle will de-orbit and execute a safe return as it has during its six previous missions,&rdquo; the Space Force said. The announcement of this new maneuver raises further questions about the plane's purpose in space, and how the military could use this capability to avoid threats or weapons in space. 'This first of a kind maneuver from the X-37B is an incredibly important milestone for the United States Space Force as we seek to expand our aptitude and ability to perform in this challenging domain. The success is a testament to the dedication and perseverance of the team,' Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman said in a statement.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/secret-space-plane-tests-new-orbit-switching-maneuver/400193/	2024-10-10T11:05:09-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/10/Artist_rendering_of_2500/large.jpg
DIA's AI-powered intel repository will be fully operational about...	An AI-powered replacement for the repository of intelligence on foreign militaries is headed for the Pentagon's classified network, where it will help pioneer new security techniques and become fully operational about a year later than planned, officials said. 'We expect&rdquo; the Machine-assisted Analytic Rapid-repository System to be approved to run on the SIPRNet 'within the next few weeks, actually,&rdquo; said Doug Cossa, chief information officer of the Defense Intelligence Agency, speaking at an Intelligence and National Security Alliance virtual event on Tuesday. MARS is to replace the Modernized Integrated Database, or MIDB, the Pentagon's main repository for 'foundational military intelligence&rdquo;: the information collected by the intelligence community on other countries' militaries and infrastructure. The DIA began working on MARS in 2018, adding new tools and AI-powered capabilities along the way, but it has only been accessible in certain locations. An agency spokesperson declined to say where. The move to SIPRNet will make MARS far more widely available. Full operation is expected in 2026, the spokesman confirmed, about a year later than originally planned. The intelligence community has been working to improve their ability to sense, aggregate, display, and share data. But with each agency and military branch working on their own efforts, integrating them to form a common operating picture is an ongoing challenge. 'The challenge we have ahead of us is: how do we actually integrate that data into one common operating picture? And this is a priority of not just the [director of national intelligence], but the [under secretary of defense for intelligence and security] of collaborating across the intelligence and defense enterprise to create that common operating picture to where we are all leveraging each other's data in an authoritative way, but the same sheet of music in a synchronized fashion,&rdquo; Cossa said. The Pentagon asked for $890 million in 2024 and $977 million in 2025 to upgrade its networks to zero trust architecture. Those funds will be used to spur several pilots over the next year despite limited cyber personnel for vulnerability testing, said Randy Resnick, who leads the Pentagon's zero trust office. 'We're pretty complete with all the foundational documentation and how it glides or fits into the authorization to operate process, and now we're doing pilots,&rdquo; Resnick said Wednesday during a panel discussion at NVIDIA's AI Summit in Washington, D.C. 'I'm expecting some successes, many successes, which will show that we can hit what we're calling &lsquo;target' or &lsquo;advanced level' zero trust. And that whole strategy is meant to stop the adversary.&rdquo; To meet the Pentagon's 2027 deadline for implementing zero trust&mdash;the principle that focuses on securing data and that no device or user should be automatically trusted, Cossa said the agency put much of its zero trust 'investments&rdquo; for 2024 and 2024 in MARS. Moreover, he said MARS will be the first DIA system to offer 'fine-grained entitlements,&rdquo; a way to customize and manage access down to individuals and devices. These and other security measures could help the intelligence community and Defense Department inch towards a common operating picture when it comes to military intelligence. The goal is to ensure that data pulled from a myriad sources across the IC and DOD is secure and can integrate with MARS. Moreover, employing zero trust as a baseline for defense and intelligence systems could be the key to frictionless information sharing with allies and partners. 'It means that we don't need these disparate networks anymore. We can actually host data in one place and regulate and control and secure access through those fine-grained entitlements for both users and devices. That's the future of where we're going,&rdquo; Cossa said. 'When we say we're going to put MARS on SIPR, yeah, we're going to. But what we want to see in the future&mdash;and really the objective&mdash;is we don't have to deploy it in different networks. We deploy in one area, and we manage the accesses through entitlements.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/new-ai-powered-intel-repository-will-be-fully-operational-about-year-late/400188/	2024-10-10T09:00:14-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/10/Selfsacrificers_of_the_Sanctuary_of_Velayat_XI_023-1/large.jpg
The D Brief: Kyiv hikes taxes; DOD’s space turf war; Smart new dr...	It's been 962 days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv's lawmakers just passed the largest tax hike of the war so far, increasing the rate on personal income from 1.5 to 5%, according to the New York Times. Kyiv is looking to spend $12 billion more on its military over the coming year. After all, 'it must cover the salaries of its service members and domestic arms production from its own revenues. That military spending accounts for more than half of the state's $100 billion annual budget,&rdquo; the Times reports. 'We will be hated, but we don't have any other option,&rdquo; one lawmaker said. President Volodymir Zelenskyy is in London for talks with British and NATO officials, he announced on social media Thursday. Those talks include possible long-range missile use for targets inside Russia, new alliance chief Mark Rutte told reporters afterward. 'We discussed it today, but in the end it is up to the individual allies,&rdquo; Rutte said, according to Reuters. Zelenskyy later flew to Paris for talks with officials there. Then he's off to Rome and Berlin on Friday. Update: More than 600,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday. Also notable: 'Russian forces sustained their highest month-on-month losses of the war in September,&rdquo; a senior military official said, citing a Russian push toward Pokrovsk as a leading factor there, Defense One's Sam Skove reports. Why bring it up? Moscow's losses could eventually influence Putin's calculus on continuing the war as he seeks to balance his foreign and domestic goals, a senior government official said. This doesn't yet seem to be the case, however; though it is worth noting Putin has not announced a 'mass mobilization because of the effect that would have on Russia's domestic population,&rdquo; the official said. But he has announced two partial mobilizations, in September and October 2022. More, here. Russian war fatigue rising? According to polling from September, there is a rise in those who are willing to say they believe war in Ukraine is bad for Russia&mdash;47% in the latest Lavada Center survey compared to 41% in results published this past May. And those who feel 'war is good&rdquo; for Russia has dropped to 28% compared to 38% four months prior. Still, some 60% say they feel the war is going well for Russia. For comparison, 70% said they felt that way in February. And notably, '72% of respondents said they would support Vladimir Putin's decision to end the military conflict,&rdquo; according to Levada. But that number drops to just 31% if it means giving Ukraine back the territory Putin has annexed so far. Coverage continues after the jump...

On this day in 1985, the airliner carrying the Palestinian hijackers of the Achille Lauro cruise ship was intercepted by U.S. Navy F-14s and forced to land in Sicily. Attention, Europe: There are serious limits to how much the U.S. can help, should Russia trigger a major war with NATO, analyst Franz Stefan-Gady, formerly of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, warned last week in a generous analysis published in the German language periodical Der Pragmaticus. Who is this guy? Stefan-Gady (aka @HoansSolo) is a highly regarded researcher who has spent the last few years traveling in and out of Ukraine to better understand contemporary warfare against Russia and Vladimir Putin's war machine. His analysis reflects a particular kind of realism and urgency for the continent. Consider the following: 'Of the approximately 450,000 active soldiers in the U.S. Army, only around 122,000 could be sent to Europe,&rdquo; he predicts. And 'Of the more than 2,600 battle tanks, the Americans could bring around 700 to Europe, and of their 40 submarines, only four would probably be used. Conclusion: Europe must&mdash;regardless of Donald Trump&mdash;be able to wage war and deter its enemies without major U.S. support.&rdquo; However, according to Stefan-Gady's reading of NATO capabilities, 'No European country is currently in a position to lead a large unit such as a corps (up to 50,000 men), let alone an army, without American support.&rdquo; And that is a big problem. Sobering reminder: Lithuania's capital city of Vilnius 'is only 30 kilometers from the Belarusian border and thus within range of Russian heavy artillery,&rdquo; Stefan-Gady writes. According to NATO planners, 'The strategic goal for Russia in this scenario is to take the city of Vilnius hostage in order to force NATO to stop fighting under the threat of using nuclear weapons.&rdquo; The wider goal for Russia 'would be to destroy NATO and cause the USA to lose credibility.&rdquo; Informed prediction: Trench warfare would very likely return to Europe, only this time 'across the Baltics or from Kaliningrad across the Suwalki Gap to Belarus.&rdquo; According to the associated logic, 'Russia could dig in, as in Ukraine, and build dense defensive positions secured by wide mine belts.&rdquo; After all, Stefan-Gady cautions, 'No NATO force has practical experience of how to overcome such defensive systems,&rdquo; and 'Any attempt would therefore claim countless victims.&rdquo; When it comes to air and missile defense, 'the European members of NATO could together provide only five percent of the equipment needed to protect troops in the Baltics, major cities and other important critical infrastructure,&rdquo; he writes. Those NATO members have just 36 such systems; '70 to 90 long-range air defense systems would be needed in the two Baltic scenarios just to protect NATO units on the ground,&rdquo; he estimates. At least an additional '50 additional long-range air defense systems would be needed in Eastern Europe to protect cities and critical infrastructure,&rdquo; Stefan-Gady warns. And that's not something that can be remedied by a huge pile of cash, since 'more than four years can pass between the signing of the contract, production and delivery of a single system such as an M902 Patriot,&rdquo; he reminds readers. One notable X factor: The U.S. could theoretically turn its ship around in terms of its inefficient defense procurement processes, thereby 'creat[ing] the capacities necessary for such a [two-front] war in the national arms industries.&rdquo; Should that herculean turnabout occur, 'the Russian and Chinese calculations [in a two-front war against the U.S. and NATO] may not work out,&rdquo; Stefan-Gady says. But this seems highly improbable at present, he concedes. And even if such industry changes do come about, 'it remains unclear whether the West has the will to endure a long war of attrition,&rdquo; especially given its strong historical inclinations toward isolationism. Continental reax: 'We need to realise in Europe that we will need to do more for our own security independently of whether Trump gets elected!&rdquo; said Ulrike Franke of the European Council on Foreign Relations (emphasis hers). 'The US won't be willing and able to do as much anymore while at the same time the threats get bigger,&rdquo; she added. Want more? Check out Stefan-Gady's article, in the original German, here.

A Pentagon turf war has &lsquo;hamstrung' the commercial space industry, execs say. Here's how it breaks down: the NRO is in charge of buying commercial ISR imagery for the Pentagon, while the NGA handles analytic products&mdash;and the five-year-old Space Force is pushing to break their monopolies, arguing that it can move the data and intelligence more quickly to combatant commands. Industry execs like the way the Space Force is trying to do things, reports Defense One's Audrey Decker, here.

Hurricane Milton eased to a category three storm as it made landfall overnight along the Florida coast, spawning 36 tornados and causing sporadic flooding as it advanced eastward from Siesta Key, south of Tampa, toward Daytona Beach. Residential roofs were shredded and many boats transplanted along roads and beside homes, according to aerial photography from ABC News. Portions of the stadium roof at Tropicana Field, which hosts the Tampa Bay Rays, were ripped off by winds that reached 97 mph. Tampa recorded one foot of rain, while eight inches fell around Daytona Beach, causing flash floods at Cape Canaveral. By the time Milton passed over the state, it had been downgraded to a Category One hurricane. So far, four people are believed to have died from the storm, according to Tampa's NBC affiliate WFLA News Channel 8. But that number could rise as first responders get to work and more debris is cleared. In the meantime, 'Officials in the hard-hit counties of Hillsborough, Pinellas, Sarasota and Lee urged people to stay home, warning of downed power lines, trees in roads, blocked bridges and flooding,&rdquo; WFLA reports.

New AI-powered strike drone shows how quickly battlefield autonom...	Small drones have been changing modern warfare at least since 2015, when Russia and Ukraine began to use them to great effect for rapid targeting. The latest addition is a strike-and-intelligence quadcopter that its builder hopes will do more things with a lot less operator attention. The point of the Bolt-M, revealed by Anduril today, is to make fewer demands on the operator and offer more information than, easy-to-produce first-person-view strike drones, the type that Ukraine is producing by the hundreds of thousands. The U.S. Army, too, is looking at FPV drones for infantry platoons. But they require special training to use and come with a lot of operational limits. The Bolt-M, according to an Anduril statement, works 'without requiring specialized operators.&rdquo; The company has a contract from the U.S. Marine Corps' Organic Precision Fires &ndash; Light, or OPF-L, program to develop a strike variant. Bolt-M's key selling feature is its autonomy-and-AI software powered by Anduril's Lattice platform. The operator can draw a bounding box on a battlefield display, set a few specifications, and send the drone on its way. 'Once a target is identified in Lattice, an operator can specify a standoff position for Bolt-M to maintain, tasking the system to stalk the target from beyond visual or acoustic detection range even as the target moves and is occluded,&rdquo; the company statement said. 'When it's time to strike, an operator can define the engagement angle to ensure the most effective strike, while onboard vision and guidance algorithms maintain terminal guidance even if connectivity is lost with the operator.&rdquo; But the system is also intended to handle some reconnaissance tasks that humans do but other small cheap strike drones don't. In conversation with reporters on Wednesday, Anduril chief strategy officer Chris Brose said that the Bolt-M is intended to help its operator 'to understand what's happening on the battlefield, whether it's kind of known targets or targets that are recognizable to the systems on board, or whether it's unknown things that that operator can then select through its interaction with the autonomous system, tell it to track, tell it to follow, eventually, if so desired, based on the human saying &lsquo;Go,' to actually fly in and engage that target.&rdquo; Brose said the Bolt-M might even be able to spot new variants of older weapons. 'If the Russians in this instance start modifying them and building these kinds of turtle tanks, maybe the computer vision hasn't seen that already&hellip;it can still surface that insight back to an operator.&rdquo; Over the next six months, the Marine Corps will put the Bolt-M's munition variant through 'a pretty rigorous test and evaluation campaign,&rdquo; he said. The Bolt-M pushes right up to the limits of the Pentagon principle that robotic weapons should always have a person involved in lethal decisions. Brose said that their efforts are guided by the company's experiences in Ukraine, particularly feedback from Ukranians who are face-to-face with Russia's electronic warfare. The drone can fly to GPS waypoints. But in places where GPS is under attack, operators can manually control it&mdash;and it can maintain custody of the target and execute previous operator-delivered commands even when links are broken. In many ways, the Bolt-M derives its real value, and its intelligence, from the Lattice platform, which can integrate data from varioussensors and sources. Anduril is working to make sure that Lattice works with a variety of drones, even from other manufacturers, said Brose. That could give the company a key, central role as different forces buy different drones or make their own in the field. 'What we are doing with Lattice is to deliver as much autonomy across that entire kill chain to put that human being on-the-loop so that they can make better decisions faster. They can make more decisions. They can take more actions because they have an intelligent system that's incorporating&hellip;sensor data, platforms, vehicles,&rdquo; he said. But what decisions? The Defense Department maintains a list of AI ethical principles that say that human beings must be able to 'exercise appropriate levels of judgment and remain responsible for the development, deployment, use,&rdquo; over AI-enabled weapons. Last year, the Pentagon sought to clarify what is and is not allowable&mdash;while leaving room to adjust the rules if things change. One of the key lessons from Ukraine's battlefield is that battlefield conditions can move very rapidly. Different nations, allied and adversary, will have different policies around lethal autonomy. Those other policies will change rapidly, too, depending on what's happening on the front lines. As attacks against the connections binding humans to drones become more effective, the need for more capable autonomy will increase. Brose said Anduril anticipates that U.S. policy will change, and they want to be ready to serve the Pentagon's new needs when it happens. 'We're not going to go out and solve for every sort of hypothetical edge case,&rdquo; he said. 'Our focus is on making the system as capable as possible based on how we believe users want to and need to use it now and in the near future. Then, to the extent that that gets limited or governed or restrained by policy or rules of engagement, that is entirely the decision of the government. We want them to have that choice, rather than realize that they would like to have a more capable system, but, but, you know, we're not capable of providing it to them.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/new-ai-powered-strike-drone-shows-how-quickly-battlefield-autonomy-evolving/400179/	2024-10-09T21:01:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/09/2024_Bolt_Hero_1/large.jpg
Russian casualties have topped 600,000 in Ukraine war, US says	More than 600,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday. Ukrainian drone strikes have taken out large amounts of Russian supplies as well, the official added, speaking on background. Hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition have been destroyed in Russian and North Korean weapons stockpiles in Russia. The attacks have made a 'serious dent&rdquo; in Russian supply lines, the official said, adding that Russia would likely need to move munitions dumps farther from the front lines, thereby slowing deliveries to the front. Russia has also lost more than two-thirds of its tanks, and has begun drawing on Soviet-era stocks that date back to World War II, the official said. Russian forces sustained their highest month-on-month losses of the war in September, said a senior military official, who cited a Russian push toward Pokrovsk as a leading factor in the high casualty rate. Russia has been making gains near Pokrovsk thanks to a grinding offensive that has seen its forces inch forward as Ukrainian troops are constrained by ammunition shortages, deal with flagging morale, and struggled to recruit soldiers. Moscow's losses could eventually influence Putin's calculus on continuing the war as he seeks to balance his foreign and domestic goals, said the senior government official. 'Putin is trying to avoid a mass mobilization because of the effect that would have on Russia's domestic population,&rdquo; the official said. 'At this point, he has been able to significantly increase the pay of these voluntary soldiers, and he has been able to continue to field those forces without doing a major mobilization. And I think we're just watching very closely how long that stance can actually be one that he can maintain.&rdquo; It's a proposition that bears similarity to a victory plan proposed by Estonia in December 2023, which sought to increase weapons transfers to Ukraine and training for its troops in order to exhaust Russian forces and force Putin to either make unpopular mobilization choices or make peace. Russia performed partial mobilization in September and October 2022. At the time, tens of thousands of Russian men left for neighboring countries to avoid the draft. Moscow is now meeting its need for soldiers by offering lucrative contracts that push soldiers' pay far past the average for Russian citizens. Russia has also decreased its standards for soldiers in order to avoid mobilization, leading to greater reported crimes and discipline problems within its army. Putin's decision to only partly mobilize troops so far is evidence that he sees political risks in expanding recruiting, said John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center. 'This is a potential point of vulnerability for the regime,&rdquo; Herbst said. 'The Russian people are not in this war. They're not marching towards the sound of the drums.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/russian-casualties-have-topped-600k-us-says/400181/	2024-10-09T20:35:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/09/Russias_Southern_Mi_2500/large.jpg
Lockheed taps deputy F-35 chief to take over program	Lockheed Martin is switching the leader of its behemoth F-35 fighter jet program, announcing today that the program's deputy, Chauncey McIntosh, will take the helm. On Dec. 1, McIntosh will succeed Bridget Lauderdale, a long-time Lockheed executive who led the company's F-35 efforts for three years. Lauderdale will retire at the end of the year, according to a company statement. McIntosh will take over after a rocky year for the program: the company is dealing with major delays while developing new technology for the jet, which resulted in the Pentagon halting deliveries last year. Company officials have yet to finish negotiations over the price tag of jets in the next production lot. F-35 sustainment costs remain high, and the company has failed to convince Pentagon officials to move to a long-desired, performance-based logistics sustainment deal. 'As the vice president and general manager for the F-35 program, McIntosh will be responsible for further strengthening positive customer experiences by reinforcing and continually growing the capability and reliability of the F-35; showcasing significant program progress; and ensuring the F-35 program meets the speed, agility, quality and affordability requirements deserved and expected by U.S. and international customers,&rdquo; the company said. Before joining the F-35 program as deputy, McIntosh led Lockheed Martin's integrated warfare systems & sensors business, which develops software for Aegis air-defense systems. Before that, he was the vice president and general manager for Lockheed's training and logistics business, leading mission readiness and sustainment programs for the F-35 and other products. He has also worked on aspects of the F-22, C-5, P-3, and S3 programs.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/lockheed-taps-deputy-f-35-chief-take-over-program/400163/	2024-10-09T11:15:24-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/09/7791195/large.jpg
Industry ‘hamstrung’ by Space Force-intel community’s turf war	The space industry is waiting for the Space Force and intelligence community to come to an agreement over buying commercial satellite imagery and related analysis&mdash;a fight, some say, that is preventing troops from making the fullest use of orbital capabilities. Currently, the National Reconnaissance Office is in charge of buying intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance imagery from commercial space providers, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in charge of purchasing analytic products. But in the five years since the Space Force was created, the young service has increasingly pushed for funds and leeway to work directly with commercial firms, arguing that it can more quickly get important information to combatant commands. Earlier this year, Space Force launched a $40 million pilot program to show just how fast it could move information and insights from orbiting sensors to troops on ground. It began soliciting bids for 'tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking,&rdquo; or TacSRT, through a 'marketplace,&rdquo; Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman told reporters last month. 'What TacSRT is doing with this pilot in particular is: we simply ask a question into the marketplace: &lsquo;Hey, what generally does it look like around Air Base 201? Are there any items of interest, trucks, that are massing? Is there a huge parking lot? Do we see people milling around?' We simply ask the question. And commercial industry provides us products that try to help us answer the question,&rdquo; he said. Saltzman has emphasized that the pilot program buys analysis based on imagery but not images themselves, carefully skirting NRO's territory. Executives with commercial space companies that have participated in the pilot's marketplace call it revolutionary. Some jobs have moved from a work statement announcement to the start of a mission in as little as 24 to 72 hours. But these executives say that unless TacSRT gets more funding, and the intel community gives more leeway to the Space Force, commercial companies and combatant commands could suffer. Under the current NGA-centric process, it can take weeks for military analysts in a relatively quiet command&mdash;i.e., anywhere that's not China, Ukraine, or the Middle East&mdash;to hear back on a request for satellite imagery, said Joe Morrison, the vice president of remote sensing at Umbra, which operates a synthetic aperture radar constellation and provides data to analytics firms in the TacSRT program. Morrison said the current system was designed to manage requests for a scarce number of very-high-quality, very-much-in-demand 'national assets&rdquo;&mdash;not to draw efficiently on commercial offerings to make sure all needs are met in timely fashion. He said this has discouraged analysts from even putting in a request for imagery or insights, which has artificially depressed apparent demand for them and has 'hamstrung&rdquo; Umbra's ability to demonstrate its utility. 'If there's one way in which the inability for us as a nation to come to terms on Title 10 versus Title 50 has probably hurt Umbra&mdash;and really the commercial remote sensing industry in the United States more generally&mdash;is that we haven't been able to show how effective we can be as quickly as we were able technically because of the vestigial bureaucratic processes that are set up in order to avoid government waste, which is a good reason to set them up, but the reality on the ground is changing faster than those policies can change,&rdquo; Morrison said. NGA officials have recently pushed back on allegations that the agency moves too slowly: 'My inbox would be full of emails if we were failing in this regard&mdash;and it is not. I do not get negative reports from the COCOMs on our timelines,&rdquo; NGA director Vice Adm. Frank Whitworth told reporters in August. Decision time While officials in the intelligence community and Space Force generally agree that they will need to use commercial capability, especially in wartime, the entities still have to draw lines over who has tasking authority for specific situations and who is in charge of the COCOMs' needs. And it's not easy to change the culture of the intel community, which for decades has only been trusting systems made in-house. 'It's only natural for an entity in the IC that's used to building really badass systems and is anointed on behalf of the entire government to do it, to bristle at the fact that someone else is going to come in and say they have a new way of doing things. For sure, there will be resistance when Space Force tries to scale it, if for nothing else other than it's going to require moving someone's cheese,&rdquo; said Eric Jensen, CEO of ICEYE U.S., a subsidy of a Finnish SAR imagery provider that participates in the Space Force's TacSRT program. Despite this reticence, Jensen said, there has to be policy change so the Space Force can provide surge capacity to the COCOMs when they need it&mdash;and to support commercial-space companies like his. 'The question is: is the government going to continue to support the crossing of the chasm where these companies are able to truly operationalize their capabilities in a way that is well defined? I think that that's been painful for companies that, like us, can move very quickly, but are somewhat beholden to the government's bureaucratic timelines,&rdquo; Jensen said. Programs like TacSRT are key to incubating space startups that can work quickly, said Derek Tishler, founder of analytics provider BoxMica, a five-person company whose 2024 revenue has largely come from TacSRT jobs. 'With a few million dollars, a half dozen or more companies like ours would flourish and imagine if it's a little bigger budget when it comes to things like TacSRT,&rdquo; Tishler said. 'The NRO might not be working at such a small contract level, or a lot of those organizations, so I really hope there's a place for both, and then they can meet in the middle ground where everyone gets a little bit more money and a little bit more opportunities.&rdquo; He said he hopes the Space Force gets 'a lot more leeway&rdquo; to work directly with commercial firms. A potential compromise would see the NRO keep the high-resolution, exquisite capability and hand the tactical ISR mission to the Space Force, said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. But that would likely require intervention by higher levels of government. 'I would think that is something the next administration should tackle and the National Space Council, but I'm not optimistic that they're going to reach any kind of a consensus on how to do this going forward in the near future, so I think we're going to be stuck in this bureaucratic paralysis where what's suffering is the Space Force's ability to do its job and the warfighters ability to leverage commercial space to the fullest extent,&rdquo; Harrison said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/industry-hamstrung-space-force-intel-communitys-turf-war/400156/	2024-10-09T10:16:50-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/09/02_nelsonmandelabridgeandbraamfonteinrailyard_johannesburgsouthafrica_24july2024_wvl/large.jpg
The D Brief: Baltics raise defenses; Israel orders hospital evacu...	Lithuania's military says it's ready to blow up its bridges to Russia's Kaliningrad exclave, which is located on the Baltic coast between Poland and Lithuania. The Lithuanians have placed vehicle obstacles known as 'dragon's teeth&rdquo; on a bridge over the Nemunas River, which leads to Kaliningrad. Those obstacles 'will eventually be supplemented with iron beams, which will be sunk in and anchored,&rdquo; Defense Minister Laurynas Kasčiūnas said Wednesday on Facebook with an illustrating photo. 'The Lithuanian army is now testing them, evaluating how they hold back the advancing heavy equipment.&rdquo; 'Fortifications will be supported by firepower, in case it's needed, to stop and destroy the enemy&hellip;with some bridges set to be demolished,&rdquo; the Lithuanian Defense Ministry said Wednesday on social media. Context: 'Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania agreed to build a Baltic defense line in the coming years to strengthen the eastern border with Belarus and Russia, the Estonian Defense Ministry said on Jan. 19,&rdquo; the Kyiv Independent reports. 'Russia's war in Ukraine has shown that, in addition to equipment, ammunition and manpower, we also need physical defense facilities on the border to protect Estonia from the first meter,&rdquo; Estonia's defense minister said at the time. Rewind: You may recall that when Defense One traveled to Denmark in 2019 to observe Danish military training, troops spent part of their time rehearsing river crossings in anticipation of a possible invasion by the Russian military. 'Our major problem fighting in an environment like the Baltics would be bridging capacity,&rdquo; one officer explained. 'There are so many rivers, and they are so wide, and we only have bridges that can stretch 20 meters. And we don't have very many bridges. And that's as I see it our major challenge to fighting in the Baltics.&rdquo; For what it's worth: Most of Kaliningrad's border with Lithuania follows either the Nemunas or &Scaron;e&scaron;upė rivers. Additional reading: 'Most of Europe is fine without Russian gas,&rdquo; Politico reported Wednesday; 'Russia bans Discord chat program, to the chagrin of its military users,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Friday; And 'Ukraine's Allies See Kyiv Getting More Flexible Over War Endgame,&rdquo; Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

Fine print: 'US officials have previously expressed concerns about sensitive US technology falling into Russian hands, which one source said is likely the holdup with the Link 16 system.&rdquo; And the missiles, 'which are fired from fighter jets, might not be useful to the Ukrainians unless they achieve some level of air superiority.&rdquo; Continue reading (new paywall alert) at CNN, here.

Ukraine says it has blown up another Russian weapons depot, this time with North Korean weapons destroyed as well, the General Staff announced on Facebook. Alleged location: The Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation in the Bryansk region, Ukrainian officials said. The strike occurred late Tuesday and featured troops with Ukraine's drone forces. 'The arsenal stored ammunition for missile and artillery systems, including those delivered from North Korea, as well as glide bombs,&rdquo; the General Staff said, adding, 'Much of the ammunition was stored in the open.&rdquo; Relatedly, Russian authorities declared a 'state of emergency&rdquo; in the region Ukraine says it attacked overnight, according to Reuters. 'The Bryansk emergencies ministry said the situation was under control, and made no mention of a weapons arsenal,&rdquo; the wire service reports. How to build a multi-sensor anti-drone dashboard in just two weeks. Today's air-defense troops must bounce between multiple systems, wasting precious seconds as they scramble to identify incoming drones. But it doesn't have to be that way, according to a recent experiment. In just two weeks, private companies led by U.S. Central Command managed to integrate multiple sensors onto a single display that Army troops tested in upstate New York. While the tech won't be sent to the Middle East just yet, officials hope it will serve as a building block for future efforts. Defense One's Sam Skove reports. Taking a public pulse, Taiwanese version: Most Taiwanese believe China is unlikely to invade in the next five years, according to a survey conducted last month by the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, which Reuters calls Taiwan's top military think tank. Key results: 61% of respondents believe an attack is 'unlikely or very unlikely.' More than 67% said they would fight back if China did invade, but were about evenly split over whether Taiwan's military could actually turn back an invasion. Some 74% believed the U.S. government was likely to 'indirectly' help Taiwan by providing food, medical supplies, and weapons, but just 52% thought the U.S. would send military forces to fight. Read more from Reuters, here. U.S. version: If China invades Taiwan, Americans would support airlifting supplies (74%) and sending weapons to Taipei (59%) but not putting US forces into a position that could lead to war with China (58% oppose)&mdash;all that according to respondents to a recent survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Other findings: 51% said the U.S. should encourage Taiwan to maintain the status quo rather than move toward independence (36%) or unification (4%). Just 42% want to commit to defend Taiwan from China, but more support Taiwan's inclusion in international organizations (59%) and want a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement (62%).

Trump’s refusal, so far, to accept transition assistance creates ...	Donald Trump's presidential campaign has missed deadlines to accept assistance from the federal government to prepare for a transition should he win the election, potentially making a change in administration even more stressful for federal employees. Presidential campaigns are supposed to conclude two memorandums of understanding about transition assistance: the first by Sept. 1 with the General Services Administration, concerning office space and information technology; and the second by Oct. 1 with the White House, to cover transition staffers' access to federal agency facilities, documents, and employees. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign reached its agreement with GSA on Sept. 19, almost three weeks late, and a Biden administration official told Government Executive in a statement that it has entered an MOU with Harris, although such a document has not yet been made public. Her campaign has posted its accompanying ethics plan for transition-team members. (Sample: 'Transition Team members will avoid both actual and apparent conflicts of interest.') The official said that the federal transition coordinator is 'actively working with the Trump transition team to complete an MOU.&rdquo; The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment but has previously told Government Executive that it is continuing 'to evaluate and communicate with GSA about the options related to the support offered by GSA.&rdquo; A GSA spokesperson said that the agency 'is prepared to begin providing services to the Trump transition team once an MOU is executed.&rdquo; It would be challenging for the White House to establish the second agreement with Trump without the first, because GSA provides the secure networks and .gov email addresses that enable federal employees to safely exchange information with verified individuals. Agencies 'need to plan. There's a lot of investment that goes in, so the uncertainty of not having those MOUs in place presents a real challenge to them,&rdquo; said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, at a press briefing on Monday. 'There's going to be a ton of work that has to be done&hellip;the early investment is critical to get it done and not to put even more burden on the career civil servants.&rdquo; PPS, a nonpartisan good-government group, hosts a Center for Presidential Transition that provides assistance to campaigns and agencies with respect to changes in administration. Valerie Smith Boyd, who leads the PPS Center for Presidential Transition, said the agreement with the White House is necessary for the incoming administration to access the agencies it is about to manage. 'We have one president at a time. The federal agencies are part of the current administration. And for federal agencies to share information and to meet with a president-elect, it's important to define the terms of where that takes place [and] what type of information may be shared at a high level,&rdquo; she said. While the MOUs are optional, Stier argued they're 'optional at a real risk.&rdquo; 'On this proposition [of] &lsquo;we don't trust the government,' that's a problem, because at the end of the day, if you're running it, you're going to have to be trusting it,&rdquo; he said. 'There may be elements of things that you're concerned about, but you're going to need to engage, and if you don't engage, that really will put our country in jeopardy.&rdquo; Boyd said other aspects of transition planning are moving along. The White House has set up a Transition Coordinating Council composed of senior Biden administration officials. Both campaigns have named leaders for their transition teams.

How to build a multi-sensor air-defense dashboard in just two wee...	It takes just a moment to add a new app to your phone, but adding a sensor to a military radar display takes years. That's why air-defense troops must bounce between multiple systems, wasting precious seconds as they scramble to identify incoming drones. But it doesn't have to be that way, according to a recent experiment led by U.S. Central Command. In just two weeks, private companies managed to integrate multiple sensors onto a single display that Army troops tested in upstate New York&mdash;thanks in part to CENTCOM officers who paved the way by negotiating past bureaucratic blocks and assuaging company execs worried about intellectual property rights. While the tech won't be sent to the Middle East just yet, officials hope it will serve as a building block for future efforts. The event began with a week in which companies worked out how their devices would share data to a display. Then, from Sept. 30 to Oct. 4, soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division tested the rig at Fort Drum against 'adversary&rdquo; drones. The unit was selected to test the kit because it currently provides counter-drone support in the Middle East. Army air-defense leaders have said that it takes multiple sensors to identify enemy drones, which can approach friendly forces in a variety of directions, speeds, and courses. Putting all those sensors onto one platform is typically an arduous process, said Master Sgt. Clark Davis, senior non-commissioned officer for CENTCOM's chief technology office. 'If you look at program-of record systems through the acquisition and software development timeframes, most systems take 18 to 24 months to integrate anything&mdash;and that's fast&rdquo; for the Defense Department, Davis said. One previous attempt to integrate a company's sensor into an existing Terminal High Altitude Area Defense radar took 24 months, added Maj. Bryan Cercy, who works with Davis. In principle, integrating multiple displays onto a single screen should be simple, said Schuyler Moore, CENTCOM's chief technology officer. Private companies do such things all the time, such as when mobile developers share their applications on a phone's operating system. But the Defense Department isn't used to it, Moore said. 'The department hasn't necessarily always had to flex that muscle of doing it really quickly in the way that the tech sector has,&rdquo;she said. One obstacle may be technical talent. Age is another problem, with some sensors having been built decades ago before it became standard to make it easy to share data, said Col. Nate Huston, CENTCOM's director of innovation. Getting them to interact with a brand-new display is like 'trying to use your first-gen iPhone in today's world,&rdquo; he said. To change that, the Defense Department needs to get better at encouraging companies to develop products that can be swapped out, Huston said. 'We just have to think more and more creatively about how we incentivize interoperability.&rdquo; Bureaucratic hurdles were another factor, as were companies hesitant to share data lest they lose intellectual property. 'We were working through a lot of concerns,&rdquo; Cercy said. He credited Army senior leaders' focus on the problem for helping to get companies on board. The resulting system will not deploy to the Middle East just yet, said Moore. However, it sets the stage for a second effort that will focus on helping soldiers identify threats faster amid the many signals pinging on their screens. It's the sort of effort that could help prevent deadly attacks like the January one that killed three U.S. soldiers and wounded dozens more in Jordan. The Wall Street Journal reported that air-defense troops misidentified the enemy drone as a friendly one. 'The second piece will be to take all of the data that we have pulled from this week and start working on that quicker tag of hostile or non-hostile,&rdquo; she said. While the sensor systems that CENTCOM tried in the recent experiment are built for the larger drones that soldiers face in the Middle East, the platform for sharing sensors could also eventually integrate sensors for the smaller first-person-view drones common in Ukraine, Moore added. 'We've discovered in conversations with a lot of the vendors that they have the ability to drop down to smaller sizes if we were to give them the chance,&rdquo; she said. Moore said her team is also closely focused on what Ukraine is doing against drones, and has talked multiple times with Security Group Assistance Ukraine, the U.S.-led body that coordinates aid for Ukraine. 'We have, in many ways, been watching Ukraine for the last three years as it goes through Christmas future of what we would experience in our theater,&rdquo; she said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/how-build-multi-sensor-air-defense-dashboard-just-two-weeks/400135/	2024-10-08T12:03:04-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/08/desert_guardian_Screenshot_2024_10_08_at_2.15.23PM_2/large.jpg
Foreign adversaries will aim to discredit US election results, in...	Certain foreign countries will attempt to cast doubt on the results of the upcoming U.S. election by amplifying false claims and disinformation, intelligence officials warn. The intelligence community 'expects foreign influence actors to continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the election's results after the polls close,&rdquo; an official in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told reporters on a Monday call. 'Thus, in such a contested post-election atmosphere, foreign actors probably will use tactics similar to those that they are using today to undermine trust in the integrity of the election and election processes, as well as to further exacerbate divisions among Americans,&rdquo; said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity per ground rules of the call. The assessment, delivered just under a month before Election Day, adds that foreign adversaries are expecting the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump to be a close call. Foreign nations &mdash; namely China, Iran, and Russia &mdash; have already made attempts throughout the past year to meddle in election outcomes and political discourse. The U.S. last month charged Iranian operatives with carrying out hacking activities to disrupt the election, including a breach into the email inboxes of Trump campaign staff. Officials also said that China, Cuba, and Russia are aiming to influence the vote in select congressional races to promote candidates that are more in favor of the nations' geopolitical or economic stances. Moscow, for instance, backs candidates opposed to sending more aid to Ukraine, while Beijing is pushing for those that support core interests around its claims to Taiwan. Cuba is focused on top-of-mind political issues, including trade embargoes and travel restrictions. 'Havana considers election influence activities as part of its standing requirements to influence those policies, and Florida is a prime target of their activities,&rdquo; said the ODNI official, who added that Cuban operatives have focused heavily on the Latino population and Spanish-speaking voters. A different ODNI official said that campaigns have received 'defensive briefings&rdquo; about the malign influence efforts but declined to name specifics. The official added that the office has delivered more than 'three times the number of briefings that we have delivered in prior election cycles.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/foreign-adversaries-will-aim-discredit-results-after-election-day-intel-officials-warn/400129/	2024-10-08T08:45:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/08/100824electionNG-1/large.jpg
The D Brief: MacDill AFB evacuates; Ukraine hits oil terminal; Ru...	Milton intensifies: Florida residents in the vicinity of Tampa Bay are under new evacuation alerts after Hurricane Milton quickly strengthened Monday into a category five storm headed for the Florida coast. In the hours since, however, it has reduced somewhat into a category four storm expected to make landfall in Florida on Thursday. Latest: 'Milton has the potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida,&rdquo; the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday. On Monday, it reached a maximum intensity of 180 mph, 'making it one of the most intense Atlantic Basin hurricanes on record,&rdquo; according to the Weather Channel. New: Personnel on MacDill Air Force Base are under a limited evacuation order, with basewide closure expected later today. MacDill, which is home to U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command, is situated on a peninsula between St. Petersburg and Tampa&mdash;almost directly in the path of Milton as it's projected to sweep northeast toward Orlando and Daytona Beach. Evacuations began Monday, base officials said in a video on Facebook. The airfield itself is already closed. The base commissary and Post Exchange are closing today at 12 p.m. ET. Portions of seven surrounding counties are also under that limited evacuation order. For more details, you can read over the order (PDF) here. Meanwhile in North Carolina, portions of the 101st Airborne Division are going house to house to find out what storm-hit families need, Liz Friden of Fox reported from Garren Creek, near Asheville. 'Once checked, the soldiers tied a pink ribbon on the houses to mark they had what they needed and told residents they would come back in a few days,&rdquo; said Friden's colleague, Jenn Griffin.

Ukraine is keeping up its campaign of attacking Russia's oil infrastructure, including an early morning strike Monday at a large terminal in occupied Crimea. Troops with Kyiv's missile forces carried out the attack, Ukraine's General Staff said on Facebook. 'The Feodosia terminal is the largest in Crimea in terms of transshipment of oil products, which were used, in particular, to meet the needs of the occupation army of the Russian Federation,&rdquo; the military said in a statement Monday. A bit more, here. Invasion latest: 'Russian troops have now entered Toretsk, a strategic hilltop city, and are pressing with assaults elsewhere in the Donetsk region,&rdquo; the New York Times reported Tuesday from Kyiv. 'To seize the remaining third [of Donetsk], it would need to break through several Ukrainian defensive lines of trenches and anti-tank ditches, and battle its way through densely populated urban centers &mdash; a grueling fight that U.S. officials believe the Russian army cannot successfully wage in the short term.&rdquo; ICYMI: Russia downed one of its prototype UCAVs over Ukraine. Why? In what The War Zone described as 'a bizarre situation,&rdquo; a Russian fighter jet fired a missile at a S-70 Okhotnik-B flying-wing unmanned combat air vehicle on Saturday, downing it miles behind the Ukrainian front line. The UCAV was carrying at least one precision glide bomb, leading to speculation that it was on some sort of operational trials. Purported photos of the downed S-70 are here, and you can read more, here. Iran apparently has China's Silent Hunter anti-drone laser system. The system, which can dazzle or possibly even damage incoming UAVs, made a cameo appearance as part of security measures around a rare public sermon by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Is &lsquo;Big AI' beating 'small AI'&mdash;and what does that mean for the military? The prevailing 'bigger-is-better' approach to artificial intelligence&mdash;ingest more training data, produce larger models, build bigger data centers&mdash;might be undermining the kind of research and development the U.S. military actually needs now and in the future. That's the argument in 'Hype, Sustainability, and the Price of the Bigger-is-Better Paradigm in AI,' a new paper that scrutinizes common assumptions driving AI research. Defense One's Patrick Tucker unpacks that, here. Diego Garcia negotiations update: No 'foreign armed forces.&rdquo; One week after the British announced plans to relinquish sovereignty over a small chain of islands in the Indian Ocean&mdash;except for one with a 99-year lease&mdash;the UK's top diplomat said Mauritius has agreed to new terms that include 'preventing foreign armed forces from accessing or establishing themselves on the outer islands&rdquo; known collectively as Chagos, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced Monday. Chagos includes the island of Diego Garcia, which hosts an obscure yet key outpost for the British and U.S. militaries, as many folks with a naval background are apt to tell you. (That's the island with the nearly century-long exemption from Mauritian sovereignty.) Self-declared 'right of center&rdquo; U.S. naval blogger Cdr. Salamander was particularly aggrieved over the surprise developments when Lammy first announced them last week. An 'epic own-goal&rdquo; is how Salamander described the new direction from the Brits, alleging they seem to get a 'masochist's thrill from damaging themselves and their nation.&rdquo; Some history: The Brits occupied Diego Garcia during the Cold War in a process that ran afoul of the United Nations, forcibly displacing at least 2,000 locals to make room for a naval base. Its location was especially useful later during the U.S.-led Global War on Terror, and British and U.S. officials are keen to not lose that perk&mdash;even though it comes with the baggage of that bygone era of colonialism. Contemporary British officials are trying to thread the needle of shedding some of that baggage while also retaining the strategic benefits of the naval base's geography. That's why the Brits announced last week the islands were indeed Mauritius's sovereign territory, but that the Brits don't plan to depart the base at Diego Garcia until at least another 99 years. The other big fear? Chinese developers would very likely step in where the Brits and U.S. depart. That helps account for the language from Lammy about 'foreign armed forces&rdquo; on Monday. 'From countering malign Iranian activity in the Middle East to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, [Diego Garcia] is critical for our national security,&rdquo; Lammy reminded British lawmakers Monday. 'Without surety of tenure, no base can operate effectively&mdash;nor truly deter our enemies.&rdquo; Perhaps more importantly, at least in the short term, continuing to occupy Diego Garcia without agreeable terms from Mauritius, 'undermined our international standing,&rdquo; Lammy said Monday. With the updated terms, 'We are showing that what we mean is what we say on international law and desire for partnerships with the Global South,&rdquo; which 'strengthens our arguments when it comes to issues like Ukraine or the South China Sea,&rdquo; he said. Next steps: 'After Mauritian elections, the government will move towards treaty signature&rdquo; to formalize the new terms, the foreign secretary said. Afterward, 'it is then our intention to pursue ratification in 2025, by submitting the Treaty and a Bill to [the House of Parliament] for scrutiny,&rdquo; he said In the meantime (emphasis added), 'Mauritius is now free to implement a resettlement programme to islands other than Diego Garcia,&rdquo; which 'has an uncontested long-term future&hellip;under full UK control well into the next century,&rdquo; said Lammy.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-08-2024/400125/	2024-10-08T08:26:40-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/08/DB_lander-1/large.png
Is ‘Big AI’ beating 'small AI'—and what does it mean for the mili...	The prevailing 'bigger-is-better' approach to artificial intelligence&mdash;ingest more training data, produce larger models, build bigger data centers&mdash;might be undermining the kind of research and development the U.S. military actually needs now and in the future. That's the argument in 'Hype, Sustainability, and the Price of the Bigger-is-Better Paradigm in AI,' a new paper that scrutinizes common assumptions driving AI research. Its authors demonstrate that the performance of larger models doesn't necessarily justify the vastly increased resources needed to build and power them. They also argue that concentrating AI efforts in a relative handful of big tech companies adds geopolitical risks. Broadly speaking, the Defense Department is pursuing AI along two tracks: large models that require enormous computational resources, and smaller, on-platform AI that can function disconnected from the internet. In some ways, the study validates the second approach. But, the authors note, future research in 'small AI&rdquo; could be limited due to growing influence of large AI providers. Where does the idea that bigger is better, at least in AI, come from? In their paper, Ga&euml;l Varoquaux of Universit&eacute; Paris-Saclay, Alexandra Sasha Luccioni of the Quebec AI Institute, and Meredith Whittaker of the Signal Foundation trace it to a 2012 paper by University of Toronto professor Alex Krizhevsk, who argued big data and large-scale neural networks offered much better results for image classification than smaller ones. This idea was borne out by other researchers, and has since become a staple of the way large companies are approaching AI. 'The consequence of this is both an explosion in investment in large-scale AI models and a concomitant spike in the size of the notable (highly cited) models. Generative AI, whether for images or text, has taken this assumption to a new level, both within the AI research discipline and as a component of the popular &lsquo;bigger-is-better' narrative surrounding AI,&rdquo; they write. The authors gather evidence to show that benefits of scaling up AI models diminish rapidly compared to the increased computational demands. For instance, the environmental cost&mdash;measured in energy consumption&mdash;rises significantly faster than the improvement in model performance, making large-scale AI not especially efficient. That's lost on a lot of big AI's richest and most well-known boosters like former Google chairman Eric Schmidt, who argued last week that businesses and governments should continue to pursue energy-intensive large AI models regardless of the energy cost because 'we're not going to hit the climate goals anyway.&rdquo; The military can't take such a cavalier approach to the massive energy costs of AI. The Defense Department views climate change as a national security concern but, more immediately, also views energy efficiency as a key military objective for future operations. What's worse, the bigger-is-better conventional wisdom AI research is narrowing and losing diversity, they write.''The bigger-is-better norm is also self-reinforcing, shaping the AI research field by informing what kinds of research is incentivized.&rdquo; That means that researchers will increasingly ignore areas where smaller models could make a big difference, in fields like healthcare and education. Although the authors don't address it in their paper, that narrowing effect has ramifications for the military's own development of AI. Smaller models could also make a big difference in places where computer resources are scarce and connectivity is intermittent, sparse, or even non-existent. That could apply to everything from autonomous drones operating in environments saturated with adversary electromagnetic warfare effects to small bases in forward locations where energy is scarce and connectivity is weak. The rapid evolution of weapons and tactics means that more and more operators close to the edge of combat will have to invent or modify their own gear and weapons. Operators at forward bases might face a lot of situations where they may have good use for an AI model that runs on a relatively small corpus of data and doesn't require a massive server farm or lots of GPUs to work. These might include applications that analyze drone- or satellite-image data for specific types of vehicles , parsing the specific electromagnetic weapons signatures they are encountering, or even just understanding local economic, weather, population or consumer data to plan more effective and safe operations in dense urban settings. But if the AI research field prioritizes expertise in big AI over small, that could mean less scholarship and fewer experts to train operators in how to make their own small AI models well. The growing trend toward big AI has another geopolitical implication, a concentration of power. Only a few companies possess the resources to build and deploy massive models. 'The concentrated private industry power over AI creates a small, and financially incentivized segment of AI decision makers. We should consider how such concentrated power with agency over centralized AI could shape society under more authoritarian conditions,&rdquo; they write. One obvious example of the threat that poses is Elon Musk, one of the world's richest defense contractors and, through SpaceX, a key supplier of space access and satellite communications to the Pentagon. Musk also has close financial ties to Saudi Arabia and has used his large and expensive social media presence to boost posts and content linked to Russian disinformation operations. Musk is also emerging as one of the key financial players in the development of future AI. Whittaker and her fellow authors are among a small but growing number of AI-focused researchers who point out the risks posed by the prevalence of the bigger-is-better school of AI. A separate paper, published in September by a group of researchers at Berkeley also notes 'It is exceedingly common for smaller, more task-focused models to perform better than large, broad-purpose models on specific downstream tasks.&rdquo; A new class of innovative AI practitioners are also highlighting the degree to which the conversation around big AI is drowning out approaches that could be more useful for specific groups. Pete Warden, CEO of AI startup Useful Sensors, is one of them. Warden's work focuses on embedding intelligence into devices or computers. He says that the industry and academic obsession with larger AI is missing what most people actually want from the AI they interact with. 'Academic benchmarks have diverged from real-world requirements,&rdquo; Warden said. 'For example a lot of customers just want to be able to retrieve results from existing information (like user manuals) rather than generating new text in response to questions, but that isn't seen as interesting by researchers.&rdquo; Retrieval-Augmented Generation, he said, is an academic hobby horse. But customer applications don't need that level of complexity,&rdquo; he told Defense One. 'For a lot of realistic problems, like drone tracking for example, the underlying models are now good enough and the real challenge is integrating them into larger systems. We don't need any more computer vision breakthroughs or new model architectures. We just need better data that reflects the actual problems in deployment and a way to fit the models onto hardware.&rdquo; Drew Breunig ran data science and strategic client projects at PlaceIQ, which is now part of Precisely. In September he wrote a post on how many peoples' high expectations of generative AI, the quintessential example of large AI models, are unlikely to be met. When those realizations settle in, that could lead to a broader discussion about different potential paths for AI development. Breunig told Defense One: 'The capability of our existing models greatly outpace the [user interface] and frameworks we've built to deliver their intelligence for nearly all the real world problems they solve.&rdquo; He breaks AI into three groups. 'Gods,&rdquo; which he defines as 'Superintelligence AGI stuff. Replacement for humans doing lots of different things, unsupervised.&rdquo; Beneath them are 'interns&rdquo; which he describes as 'Copilots. Domain-specific applications that help experts with busy and tedious work, doing things an intern might. Interns are supervised by experts, so your tolerance for hallucinations is high. The programmer, writer, or whomever spots the mistakes when they occur and moves on.&rdquo; Finally, the most local form of AI is 'Cogs,&rdquo; defined as 'Models that have been tuned to do one job, with very low tolerance for errors, working unsupervised within applications or pipelines. This is by far the dominant use case I am seeing in the enterprise. All the big platforms (AWS, Azure, Databricks, etc) have pivoted to helping companies load their proprietary data to tune open models to do one little thing well.&rdquo; Even though generative AI pilots get a lot more attention the military is exploring all three of them through programs that provide decision assistance for target identification, i.e. Project Maven, and other decision assistance efforts,&rdquo; and 'cog&rdquo; efforts such as visual recognition of instrument indicators in helicopter cockpits. Because such needs will only grow, it's important for the military that the future of AI research be broad enough to continue to support all three areas. 'Pete and I see eye to eye on this,&rdquo; said Breunig. 'When Pete says the academics' research cases are out of step with the practical reality of actually building with AI, it's because a lot of their focus is on attaining gods not the boring job of building cogs.The cool thing about focusing on cogs is you can do so much with little models! A tiny model tuned for one thing can outperform a giant general model at the same task. And it's faster, cheaper, etc.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/big-ai-prevailing-over-small-ai-and-what-does-mean-military/400111/	2024-10-07T18:26:16-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/07/GettyImages_2087343447/large.jpg
Navy places two new submarine contract modifications	Oct. 4 brought a pair of nine-figure modifications to Naval Sea Systems Command contracts with General Dynamics Electric Boat. The first was a $377 million cost-plus-fixed-fee modification to a previously awarded contract for lead yard support and development studies and design efforts related to Virginia-class submarines. Work is expected to be completed by October 2025. The second was a not-to-exceed $244 million cost-plus-fixed-fee undefinitized order against a previously issued basic ordering agreement to provide unique parts and specialized material, including initial spares, for Virginia-class submarines. Work is expected to be completed by September 2028. [[Related Posts]] A Navy study of the country's submarine-construction infrastructure concluded that tentative plans to produce two Virginia-class SSNs and one Columbia-class SSBN per year for 12 years are viable, given sufficient funding. By the end of that run, the newest of the Improved Los Angeles-class SSN 688s will be 40 years old and overdue for replacement, adding pressure to meet at least the two-SSN's-per-year goal. The Virginia-class Block V construction has seen delays, which the Government Accountability Office has ascribed to supply-chain problems, workforce shortages, and limited shipyard capacity that have made it difficult for the Navy to produce two submarines a year. Throw into the mix the AUKUS plan for the U.S. to sell three Virginia-class submarines for operational deployment in the early 2030s, which comes with an option to buy two more, for a total of five. The U.S. will be hard-pressed to meet its own force requirements. While such a sale will have to have the approval of the U.S. Congress, Australia's fielding of Virginia-class submarines as soon as possible would provide a stopgap until Australia begins fielding its own SSN-AUKUS submarines, which are planned to be operational in the early 2040s. The latest plan floating around is for the U.S. to transfer two of its current Virginia-class submarines (probably Block III or IV) to Australia, with the third to come off the current production line. Although not set in stone, this is likely the best solution to fill the gap between the retirement of Australia's Collins-class diesel-electric submarines and the planned SSN-AUKUS submarines. Some have suggested that the Navy will begin to order three SSNs per year after the final Columbia is delivered.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/10/navy-places-two-new-submarine-contract-modifications/400113/	2024-10-07T18:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/07/FacebookXCopy_LinkEm_2500/large.jpg
The Middle East is in a new era of mass displacement	A year of conflict has ushered in a new era of mass displacement in the Middle East. Since Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the subsequent sustained Israeli bombardment of Gaza, Israel has expanded its operations on multiple fronts to include the West Bank, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon. With fighting continuing unabated and the prospects for a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel rising, the region is now in a new period of internal and cross-border displacement that has already uprooted millions. As scholars of migration, we fear that the results of such displacement will affect the region for years to come &ndash; and is likely to further hamper the ability of the region's people to live safe and secure lives. Israel's ongoing attacks have forced nearly 2 million Palestinians to flee their homes in Gaza over the past year, amounting to 9 in 10 inhabitants of the densely populated strip. What is unique about the scale of the displacement in Gaza is that nearly all internally displaced persons remain trapped, unable to leave the territory amid Israel's ongoing border closure and bombardment. This has intensified cascading humanitarian crises, including famine and the spread of disease, along with countless other hardships that make normal life nearly impossible. For many Palestinians in Gaza, the yearlong bombardment has meant repeated displacement as Israeli attacks shift from area to area, amid shrinking humanitarian spaces. And although there are complex historical and geopolitical reasons regarding the border closures, international law experts argue that Egypt and Israel have violated international refugee law by refusing to allow Palestinians in Gaza to cross the Rafah border to seek asylum. The situation in Gaza is structurally different from previous displacement crises in the region &ndash; even in civil war-torn Syria, where cross-border aid operations have constantly been on the brink of collapse. That's because Israel continues to limit and block aid into the territory, and humanitarian workers struggle to provide the bare minimum of food, shelter and medical care during bombing campaigns that have rarely stopped. To make matters worse, the experience of the past year has shown that refugee camps, civilian apartment buildings, U.N. schools, and hospitals serving civilians and refugees are not safe spaces. Israel frequently justifies its attacks on such locations by saying they are used by Hamas or Hezbollah, despite formal U.N. disputes of many of these accusations. At least 220 U.N. workers have also been killed in these targeted Israeli attacks in the past year &ndash; more than any other crisis ever recorded. This contributes to humanitarian workers struggling to access populations in need, especially displaced individuals. For its part, the United States continues to be the top donor to the the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) and the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), as well as the top supplier of weapons to Israel. In Lebanon, massive displacement has also resulted from Israel's developing war with Hezbollah. Even before the September escalation of conflict across the Lebanon-Israel border, nearly 100,000 Lebanese had been displaced from their homes in the country's south due to Israeli shelling. Meanwhile, approximately 63,000 Israelis were internally displaced from the country's north due to Hezbollah's rocket attacks. But starting in late September 2024, Israeli strikes on Hezbollah and Palestinian targets in Beirut and across Lebanon killed hundreds of civilians and exponentially increased internal and cross-border displacement. More than 1 million Lebanese have now fled their homes in a matter of days amid Israel's invasion and bombardment. In addition, Syrian refugees and the large migrant worker population in Lebanon were also displaced, with many sleeping on the streets or in makeshift tents, unable to access buildings that were converted into shelters for Lebanese. In a separate stark example of reverse migration, about 230,000 people &ndash; both Lebanese and Syrians &ndash; have fled across the border into Syria. Bringing the recent regional conflicts full circle with post-2011 Arab uprising displacement and crisis, returning home is an unsafe option for many Syrians who still fear repression under the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Israel's ongoing invasion of Lebanon is likely to only amplify these trends, as the country ordered numerous villages and towns in the country's south &ndash; miles above the U.N.-recognized buffer zone &ndash; to evacuate. Over several decades, the Middle East has experienced many large-scale, cross-border displacements for myriad reasons. The original forced displacement of Palestinians surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948 and subsequent conflicts created the world's longest-standing refugee situation, with approximately 6 million Palestinians living across the Levant. The first Gulf War, sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s and the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq produced millions of refugees, with long-standing political repercussions for the region. More recently, the 2011 Arab uprisings and the wars that followed in Syria, Yemen and Libya created millions of refugees, as well as internally displaced peoples, with nearly 6 million Syrians still living in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan and another 6 million displaced inside Syria. Because Syrians have largely not returned home, international organizations have become a semipermanent safety net to provide basic services to refugees and host communities. New layers of displacement in Lebanon &ndash; nationals, refugees and migrant workers &ndash; as well as cross-border movement into Syria will put further strain on the underfunded system of humanitarian assistance. Further, the current Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon is not the first time conflict between the state and its neighbor to the north has preceded large-scale displacement. In an attempt to eliminate the Palestinian Liberation Organization, Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and again in 1982. Israel's 1982 invasion led to the Sabra and Shatila massacres of between 1,500-3,000 Palestinian civilians &ndash; carried out by Israel's Lebanese Christian allies &ndash; showing that military operations that do not distinguish between militants and civilians can lead to devastating impacts for displaced populations. Between 600,000 and 900,000 Lebanese fled abroad during the entire course of the country's civil war from 1975 to 1990. Two decades later, Israel again invaded Lebanon in 2006 in an attempt to stamp out Hezbollah, leading approximately 900,000 Lebanese to flee the south &ndash; both internally and across the border into Syria. While the speed and volume of Lebanese displacement in 2006 was unprecedented at the time, the number of people forced to flee in late September and early October 2024 has quickly surpassed that record. So, the region is well versed with the consequences of mass displacement. But what is clear a year into the current conflict is that the Middle East is now in a new era of displacement &ndash; in terms of scale and kind. And the number of families' lives disrupted by this new era of displacement looks set only to increase. Tensions in the region have escalated further with fresh missile attacks against Israel from Iran and threats of retaliation by Israel. The experience of decades of conflict in the region is that civilians are most likely to bear the brunt of fighting &ndash; whether through forced displacement, an inability to access food or medical care, or death. Only by way of a cessation of current hostilities and a lasting cease-fire across the region can the conditions be set for at-risk populations to begin to return and rebuild. This is particularly true for those displaced in Gaza who have been repeatedly forced from their homes, but have no borders over which they can cross to safety, and for whom a political solution remains elusive.
