The D Brief: Russia’s foreign-made drones; Ukraine’s EW-hardened ...	Ukrainian UAV wars: Russia launched 2,023 attacks against Ukraine using Iranian-designed drones last month, Ukrainian officials announced Friday. Those drones would have required an estimated 170,000 'foreign components,&rdquo; including microchips, microcontrollers, processors, voltage regulators, and transceivers. 'Without them, the Shaheds wouldn't fly,&rdquo; one official wrote on social media. The makers of those components include U.S.-based Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, CTS Electronic Components, and Maxim Integrated. Other components came from Switzerland's STMicroelectronics and U-Blox; China's Bixinda, and Ireland's Taoglas&mdash;all of which suggests the current sanctions regime isn't quite working as intended, the official said. Ukraine is now using U.S.-made, special-purpose drones built to withstand electronic interference, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reported Thursday after speaking with Brandon Tseng, president and co-founder of Shield AI, based in San Diego. How they worked: 'They launched from about 40 kilometers from the front, flew 100 kilometers past the front line of troops and then found these SA-11 surface-to-air missiles [on] 11 Buks, targeted them, called in HIMARS airburst rounds,&rdquo; Tseng explained. Why it matters: The ability to pass data quickly back to an artillery platform like a howitzer or Lockheed Martin HIMARS, is essential to taking out Russian positions, said Tseng. 'We flew within 1,000 meters of these jammers. No impact to our aircraft. It was wildly successful,&rdquo; he said. Next steps: Ukraine wants a lot more of these drones. Continue reading, here. A Ukrainian firm just built a new FPV drone designed specifically for intercepting Russian reconnaissance drones which spy target locations for Russian artillery, Kyiv-based United24 Media reported Friday. The new drone is called the Flamingo VB140; it has about a 30-mile range, and can fly in the dark as well as in the daytime. This week in drone adaptations, researcher Sam Bendett on Thursday flagged a 'Mad Max&rdquo;-looking Russian tank with multiple layers of protection against small Ukrainian FPV drones. 'The first layer is a net that initiates the drone's warhead or makes it get entangled. The second layer is the frame itself made of additional armor that reduces the impact, and the third layer is the main tank armor with dynamic protection, with &lsquo;everything else piled on top,'&rdquo; he writes. North Korean deployment update: About 3,000 North Korean military personnel are in Russia's Kursk Oblast and an unspecified number of North Korean engineers have allegedly deployed to Ukraine's occupied Donetsk Oblast, Ukrainian officials said Thursday. Stateside reax: The use of North Korean troops inside Ukraine may be 'more of a strategic messaging thing&rdquo; than a practical added benefit, said Mark Montgomery, retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. He recently returned from a trip to Ukraine and spoke to Defense One about his observations. On the one hand, the message from Russia 'could kind of accidentally be, you know, we're starting to reach our own limitations&rdquo; in terms of manpower and casualties on the battlefield, Montgomery said. However, North Korean artillery shells are a much more effective weapon in this conflict, he argued. 'The provision of the&mdash;it's hard to say how many, but&mdash;five to six million rounds of varying sizes up to 162, millimeter artillery? That's, I think, much more impactful on the battlefield&rdquo; than North Korean special forces. 'That's decades worth of U.S. production provided by North Korea to the Russians.&rdquo; 'I understand there might be some issues with some of the ammunition,&rdquo; he continued, 'but you know, quantity does have a quality all its own there. And if you're allowed to feed the Russians such artillery such that they can maintain a seven to eight to one outgoing to incoming ratio? That's a significant tactical operational impact. So to me, the ammunition has the biggest impact. [Whereas] Operationally, tactically&mdash;I think the troops are more of a strategic messaging thing.&rdquo; 'I would put the North Korean artillery in front of the [Iran-designed] Shahed [drones], and the Shaheds in front of the North Korean infantry in terms of tactical or operational relevance,&rdquo; he said. 'But again, this is about strategic messaging.&rdquo; Montgomery's advice for the U.S. in terms of improving support to Ukraine: Send AMRAAM and Patriot air defense interceptor rounds as promptly as possible. The U.S. also needs to provide Ukraine targeting data (satellite imagery, e.g.) much faster than it has been, he said. That means as fresh as 'eight or 12 minutes, or, you know, at least in the under a half hour kind of range&rdquo; instead of eight or 12 hours, as is often the case. 'I would not use that in combat,&rdquo; he said. The White House should also extend the range at which Ukraine can target Russian positions 'within a reasonable distance of Ukraine's traditional borders.&rdquo; When asked what range he would recommend, he replied, 'Three to 400 kilometers. And if they want to strike something beyond that,&rdquo; they can use one of their domestically-manufactured long-range drones, which have targeted Russian oil facilities, for example.

US-made jam-resistant drones helped Ukrainians cut through Russia...	When Russian jamming neutered the recon drones flown by a group of Ukrainian special operators near Dnipro in August, they turned to a new solution: V-BAT drones built to withstand the massive electronic interference used by both sides in the war in Ukraine. 'They launched from about 40 kilometers from the front, flew 100 kilometers past the front line of troops and then found these SA-11 surface-to-air missiles [on] 11 Buks, targeted them, called in HIMARS airburst rounds,&rdquo; said Brandon Tseng, president and co-founder of Shield AI, the San Diego-based maker of the V-BATs. That destroyed the SAMs&mdash;and, Tseng said, marked a big operational test for the V-BATs: flying, collecting targeting data, and relaying it to artillery units, all in the face of the most sophisticated electronic warfare tactics on earth. Ukraine has some drones that can perform well against EW, but they work through autonomy and on-platform computing, good for one-way attack missions with whatever munitions can be squeezed onboard. But the ability to pass data quickly back to a fires solution with real power, like a howitzer or Lockheed Martin HIMARS, is essential to taking out Russian positions. This is what the V-BAT supplied to the Ukrainians, according to Tseng, who witnessed the operation first-hand. The 300-mile range of the V-BAT, even in the face of anti-aircraft defenses, gave the Ukrainians a new view of the battlefield. 'They were able to collect intelligence that they had never collected before was because they had a long-endurance aircraft that was able to watch things for long periods of time,&rdquo; Tseng said in a Thursday interview. 'That absolutely blew their minds, because, while they had some aircraft, some weapon systems that could go 60 kilometers, maybe 100 kilometers, the on-station time was like, for those aircraft for like, 10,15, minutes. So when you're comparing it against us who's loitering around for eight, 9,10, 11 hours, you know, after we get on-station&hellip;you just actually have the time space to actually find lots and lots of targets.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] Tseng and his team at Shield AI originally brought the drones to Ukraine to test against electromagnetic warfare effects in June. The drones proved able to work in jam-heavy environments in ways that others could not, according to a June report from the Ukrainian military obtained by Defense One. 'We flew within 1,000 meters of these jammers. No impact to our aircraft. It was wildly successful,&rdquo; Tseng said. But those June results didn't have the persuasive effect that Tseng was hoping for. 'There were skeptics on the NATO side, on the American side, that were like, &lsquo;You know, no one's passed this testing. All drones fail here; you guys are going to be like everybody else.'&rdquo; They insisted on an actual battlefield experiment against the enemy. Tseng's account was backed up by a Ukrainian operator who spoke to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. In August, Tseng also testified before Congress on the battlefield deployment success. There is no silver bullet that can bring Ukraine victory, Defense Department officials routinely remind the public, often when discussing why they refuse to provide certain weapons, (or withhold permissions to use them in the way the Ukrainians would like). Despite that, some common themes are emerging after years of war. Ukraine's success against the larger Russian military is based in large part on their ability to move faster, firing off rounds and maneuvering quickly to duck Russian counterfire. But the Russians are fast learners. The Russians are far better supplied with ammunition, a problem exacerbated by continued debates among Western allies about whether to provide Ukraine with what observers say it needs. The V-BAT works to lessen both problems. First, its size&mdash;small enough to fit in an SUV&mdash;and vertical takeoff help the Ukrainians scoot and shoot. 'Airstrips, air fields are targeted. They're observed. They're watched, and so they're just highly vulnerable points. So if your aircraft requires a runway, it's really not a good, great place to be,&rdquo; Tseng said. And because the V-BAT can pass not just targeting data but also battle damage assessment, it helps Ukrainian forces make the most of their limited ammo. Without EW-hardened drones, Tseng said, 'they don't know if they're hitting things most of the time.&rdquo; Tseng said the next step is to integrate missiles onto the drone itself. 'We have launched, organically off the V-BAT, a Northrop Grumman munition called the Hatchet, which is a laser-guided munition that was a prototype capability [for] board kinetic effects, is being released late next year.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/us-made-jam-resistant-drones-are-helping-ukrainians-cut-through-russia-ew/400735/	2024-10-31T18:02:50-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/31/Screenshot_2024_10_31_at_2.54.22PM/large.png
Pilot error blamed for crash of F-35 that flew for 11 minutes aft...	The crash of an F-35 stealth fighter jet that went missing for more than 24 hours after the pilot ejected was caused by pilot error, a Marine Corps investigation found&mdash;but multiple system failures and bad weather contributed to the incident. An F-35B jet was flying in heavy rain near Joint Base Charleston on Sept. 17, 2023, when the pilot ejected, landing in a North Charleston neighborhood. But the F-35 stayed in the air for about 11 minutes after the ejection because of the jet's autonomy flight-control systems, according to a Marine Corps investigation released today. Partly due to the plane's stealth coating, it took about 30 hours for authorities to find the jet&mdash;during which social media users raised a number of strange theories and jokes about what could have happened. It was eventually found 64 nautical miles northeast of Joint Base Charleston. The investigators pinned the blame for the crash on the pilot, but said an 'electrical event&rdquo; caused multiple system failures&mdash;including both radios, the transponder, the tactical air navigation system, and the instrument landing system. The helmet-mounted display&mdash;the pilot's primary display system&mdash;and the panoramic cockpit display were not operational at least three times, the investigation said, which caused the pilot to become disoriented during the heavy rainstorm. 'The pilot incorrectly diagnosed an out-of-controlled flight emergency and ejected from a flyable aircraft, albeit during a heavy rainstorm compounded with aircraft electrical and display malfunctions,&rdquo; the investigation says. [[Related Posts]] The report said the pilot had extensive experience in the AV-8B Harrier jet, but a was a 'relative novice&rdquo; in the F-35B. Following the crash, authorities couldn't find the fifth-generation fighter jet because the plane's transponder failed due to the electrical malfunction, according to the investigation, and the aircraft's stealth coating made it much harder to locate than a traditional aircraft. 'The loss of positive radar contact with the mishap aircraft resulted from a failed transponder caused by the electrical malfunction and the aircraft's eventual descent below the air-traffic control radar horizon. The loss of positive contact could also be partially attributed to the F-35B's low-observable technology,&rdquo; the investigation said. After the mishap and two deadly Marine Corps aviation crashes, the service mandated a two-day aviation stand down.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/pilot-error-blamed-f-35-flew-11-minutes-after-ejection-investigation-finds/400731/	2024-10-31T14:49:11-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/31/Screenshot_2024_10_31_at_11.47.29AM/large.png
The D Brief: N. Korea tests big ICBM; Aussies’ arms ambitions; Pe...	North Korea tested what appears to be its farthest-flying missile yet early Thursday. Pyongyang's state-run media and White House officials both confirmed it was an intercontinental ballistic missile launched at about 7 a.m. local time from a site near the North's capital city. Typically, North Korean media has waited at least a day before confirming such tests, the last of which occurred this past December. Japanese military officials reported the missile flew for 86 minutes on a 7,000-km apogee, which Tokyo's Defense Ministry said is 'the highest ever.&rdquo; It eventually landed in the Sea of Japan, about 1,000 kilometers from its launch point near Pyongyang. Officials in Seoul reported identical estimates, and said the 86-minute flight was also a new record. South Korea's military said it's possible 'a new type of solid-fuel long-range ballistic missile&rdquo; was used in Thursday's launch, and that it appears to have been fired from a 'new 12-axle transporter erector launcher,&rdquo; Yonhap news agency reports. After the launch, Seoul's military announced it practiced attacking a 'mock mobile missile launcher&rdquo; Wednesday as part of a joint training exercise with the U.S., Yonhap reported separately Thursday. Those drills, known as Freedom Flag, are scheduled to conclude Friday. U.S., South Korean, and Japanese officials all condemned the ICBM test as a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. 'This launch needlessly raises tensions&rdquo; around the Pacific and 'demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people,&rdquo; Sean Savett of the White House National Security Council said in a statement. 'While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation,&rdquo; military officials at Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement. 'The U.S. commitments to the defense of the ROK and Japan remain ironclad.&rdquo; S. Korea: The North is now an 'existential threat.&rdquo; 'The nuclear and missile threat from North Korea is now an existential threat, not only to the ROK, but also to the Indo-Pacific region,&rdquo; Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun told reporters during his visit to the Pentagon on Wednesday. One big worry: Moscow might send Pyongyang dangerous missile technology that Kim said could make North Koreans a far more threatening force. North Korea's quid-pro-quo requests would likely be in the areas of tactical nuclear weapons, ICBMs, reconnaissance satellites, and missile submarines, he told reporters. Russia could also help North Korea fill some critical technological gaps, particularly in terms of targeting with satellite data, which means its missiles could become much better far sooner than was thought possible just a few years ago, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reports.

Developing: Australian officials announced plans with Lockheed Martin to manufacture 'advanced guided missile systems in the country for the first time,&rdquo; although that operation isn't expected before 2029, the Financial Times reported Wednesday from Sydney. The facility will produce Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System rounds, which are used in the HIMARS systems that made headlines for use in Ukraine's defense against Russia's full-scale invasion. 'The complex, which will be the first outside the US to produce the missile systems, will be located in either Victoria or New South Wales at an initial cost of A$316mn and will be capable of producing 4,000 such missiles a year, which Conroy said equated to a quarter of current global production,&rdquo; FT reports. Australia also announced a deal with French firm Thales to produce 155mm M795 artillery in the southeastern city of Benalla, just north of Melbourne. That's expected to be the first such dedicated forge based outside of the U.S., with a goal of cranking out '15,000 rounds each year by 2028, with capacity to produce up to 100,000 for global consumption.&rdquo; Both plans extend from Australia's 2024 National Defence Strategy, which 'affirmed the need to invest in munitions to build stocks, strengthen supply chains and support a domestic manufacturing capability,&rdquo; Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said in a statement.

Military services upping recruiting goals after rebound in 2024	After years of shortfalls, nearly all of the U.S. military's active-duty components met their recruiting goals this year&mdash;and plan to increase those goals in 2025. The military services recruited 225,000 people in fiscal year 2024&mdash;25,000 more recruits than last year, Katie Helland, the Pentagon's director of military accession policy, told reporters Wednesday. Service officials have previously cited a lower desire to serve, limited familiarity with the military in the general population, a competitive labor market, and declining eligibility among young people as the biggest hurdles to military recruiting, and officials Wednesday said those challenges persist. Only about 23 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 24 are eligible to serve without some type of waiver, Helland said. But as recruiters regain a foothold in communities post-COVID, the services are seeing more willingness to serve, and that 'growing propensity&rdquo; helped them achieve their recruiting goals this year, Helland said. 'When our recruiters get out there and make contact with the individual, they can grow propensity one person at a time. That's where I believe we are seeing successes, is the operations and [when] we've been able to get back into communities. When you think about what happened during COVID, we had to pull out of communities for almost two years. It takes time to get back in and develop those relationships again,&rdquo; Helland said. [[Related Posts]] Looking to 2025, the military services plan to build on this year's momentum and bump yearly recruiting goals. The Army will increase its recruiting goal to 61,000 people in 2025, after beating its recruiting goal of 55,000 this year, and aim for 10,000 in the service's Delayed Entry Program, said Maj. Gen. Johnny Davis, commander of Army Recruiting Command. The Air Force just barely met its recruiting goal of 27,100 troops in 2024, but plans to increase that goal to 32,500 in 2025, said Brig. Gen. Christopher Amrhein, commander of Air Force Recruiting Services. The 20 percent increase for the Air Force is ambitious, but Amrhein said it's achievable. Separately, the Space Force will increase its recruiting goal by 30 percent in 2025. The Navy will keep its recruiting goal for 2025 at 40,600 recruits&mdash;after it just squeaked by its 2024 goal, said Rear Adm. James Waters III, commander of the Navy Recruiting Command. The Marine Corps will increase its goal to 29,300 recruits next year after hitting this year's goal of 27,500 Marines, said Maj. Gen. William Bowers, the leader of Marine Corps Recruiting Command.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/military-services-upping-recruiting-goals-after-rebound-2024/400698/	2024-10-30T17:12:32-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/30/Screenshot_2024_10_30_at_2.10.42PM/large.png
Maxar’s working on a 3D-mapping tool to replace GPS	If GPS goes down, could aircraft navigate by comparing what they sense around them to detailed three-dimensional maps? A major satellite imagery company believes so. Maxar's nascent Pinpoint tool will use a drone's video feed to infer its surroundings in 3D, then match that to maps built with the company's P3DR, for Precision 3D Registration, said chief product officer Peter Wilczynski. While most mapping technology is 'focused on flat representations of the world,&rdquo; Wilczynski said, Pinpoint will answer 'how do you use that three-dimensional representation to help drones navigate, to help planes navigate, to help understand when you get a video feed from a drone or from an aircraft, what position is it actually looking at in the world.&rdquo; He said it could be an alternative to GPS, which can be vulnerable to enemy interference. That's important in part because of 'all of the jamming issues we've seen in Ukraine,&rdquo; he said. 'I think what we're going to see in the next few years is sort of a shift back from this absolute navigation system of GPS towards a much more referential navigation system, more like what happened when you were in a ship and you were looking at the stars.&rdquo; The fast-growing Maxar began developing Pinpoint after Wilczynski arrived from Palantir this summer. The company also recently hired Matt Santangelo as chief financial officer and Matt Jenkins to be its chief space systems officer. The plan for Pinpoint is to finish several pilot programs with domestic and foreign drone makers by next summer, and then make the tech broadly available. 'We're working with some different companies across the value chain. Some companies that manufacture the gimbals, some who manufacture the full [unmanned aerial vehicle]. There's a bunch of different types: attritable, more expendable, some of the more enduring UAV. So we're trying to experiment with this market,&rdquo; Wilczynski said. 'This market is really developing quickly now, as people sort of realize across the defense community that GPS, which we've relied on for so long, may not be available in the next conflict.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/maxars-working-3d-mapping-tool-replace-gps/400678/	2024-10-30T13:47:06-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/30/Screenshot_2024_10_30_at_4.32.20PM_2/large.png
Russia could transfer missile tech to North Korea, ‘escalating’ t...	As North Korean troops train in Russia for likely deployment against Ukrainians, South Korea's defense minister said Wednesday that Moscow might send Pyongyang dangerous missile technology that he said would 'escalate tensions&rdquo; across the Korean peninsula and make North Koreans a far more threatening force. 'There is a high possibility that North Korea, in exchange for their troops' deployment, would ask for cutting-edge technology,&rdquo; Kim Yong-hyun said at a Pentagon press conference with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Kim said the requests would likely be in the areas of tactical nuclear weapons, ICBMs, reconnaissance satellites, and missile submarines. Austin said some 10,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia, where 'they're drawing equipment and conducting some training.&rdquo; Austin said Russia might send the North Koreans to its Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting since they invaded in August. He called that possibility 'disturbing,&rdquo; but wouldn't comment on the timing of that or that it was a certainty that would occur. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday that the soldiers are likely special operations forces. [[Related Posts]] Background North Korea has been steadily increasing the destructive power of its nuclear weapons for years and in November 2017 unveiled a new design for an intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-15, which could reach the continental United States and closer targets in the Pacific. But North Korea's missile program lacks the sophistication of China's and Russia's, due in large part to crushing international sanctions (and possibly, clandestine U.S. sabotage.) Result: despite a large and expensive increase in testing over the last ten years, North Korea's missiles are unreliable, especially the long-range variants. They have failed launch tests, exploded in the air near North Korean population centers, and, especially the intercontinental missiles, have not shown they can actually hit any target other than the ocean. Russia could help North Korea fill some of those technological gaps, particularly in terms of targeting with satellite data, which means its missiles could become much better far sooner than was thought possible just a few years ago. Why far sooner? In part because giving technology to North Korea was something Vladimir Putin promised not to do. 'Let me remind you that Russia signed onto the UN Security Council resolution agreeing not to provide military assistance to North Korea,&rdquo; Austin said. 'Of course, we know that Putin has gone tin-cupping to get weapons from the DPRK and Iran. Turning to a pariah state like North Korea for troops just underscores how much trouble he is in.&rdquo; Joint response In response to the deepening coordination between Russia, China, and North Korea, the United States and South Korea on Wednesday advanced a new series of cooperation agreements to enable technology transfer and joint development between the two countries. According to a Pentagon fact sheet, the initiatives include: More cooperation on nuclear deterrence to build out better joint responses to nuclear and conventional threats on the Korean Peninsula via the Nuclear Consultative Group. Enhancements to crisis management through joint field exercises like Freedom Shield and Ulchi Freedom Shield. Upgrading the Shared Early Warning Systems to more quickly share radar and other data in response to North Korean or other missile threats. Establish a new Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee to help both militaries integrate AI, autonomous systems, and quantum tech into defense applications. Accelerate industrial cooperation through the Partnership for Indo-Pacific Industrial Resilience and mutual maintenance and repair, or MRO, to improve interoperability between the two militaries' equipment. The two militaries also announced today a new regional cooperation framework&rdquo; to increase collaboration on Indo-Pacific security, with an emphasis on maritime security, defense-industry cooperation, and multilateral exercises. Those efforts build on a trilateral security agreement that Japan, South Korea, and the United States launched this July in Tokyo. That agreement advanced its own framework to institutionalize missile-data sharing, high-level dialogues, and joint military exercises. 'The nuclear and missile threat from North Korea is now an existential threat, not only to the ROK but also to the Indo-Pacific region. We had a shared understanding that the ROK US, Japan, trilateral security cooperation framework signed in this July represents a historic milestone in trilateral security cooperation,&rdquo; Austin said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/russia-could-transfer-missile-tech-north-korea-escalating-threats-south-korea-warns/400688/	2024-10-30T13:15:01-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/30/Russias_President_V_2500/large.jpg
Who tells satellites where to take pictures? Increasingly, it’ll ...	Maxar's chief product officer Peter Wilczynski, who joined the company over the summer, is spearheading an effort to build navigation systems that use 3D maps instead of GPS. But the Palantir alum is also working to develop systems to better manage the ever-growing queues for his company's orbital-imagery services. He also foresees automated tools that track changes captured by the company's relatively low-resolution imagery to cue passes by its higher-resolution satellites. This interview has been edited for length. D1: What are some areas you want to explore, especially as the Defense Department looks to bring more commercial space companies into the fold? Wilczynski: Our historical strength is really in foundational mapping. When we think about more operational missions, I think a lot about how we can&hellip;cut down the latency of our space-to-ground and ground-to-space communication. And as one of the only owner-operator-builder [satellite] companies in the world [that] actually designs, launches, and then owns and operates the satellite constellation, we have a lot of potential for integrating across the space and ground segments to really cut down the latency. And so that's a big focus for us. So, for example, if you're monitoring ships in the South China Sea, you're trying to reduce the time needed to process and analyze that data? I think that's exactly right. And, you know, I also think a lot about not just looking at the proximate analytic targets, so like a vessel that's moving, but actually, can you look backwards in the chain of events that would cause the vessel to move? So modeling site networks and understanding sort of how activity at one site could correlate with future activity at another site. We're doing some work right now on monitoring mines. Those mines are going to affect the downstream supply chain. So, more activity there in a couple weeks means more activity here. And so, as you think about managing a [satellite] constellation to do these tasks, as you get more supply on orbit, which I think we all know has happened in the last few years, you also get a lot more demand for that supply. The thing I'm excited about, from the Maxar perspective, is &hellip;experimenting with that supply-demand mapping for [with how] you take the different analytic admission requirements and then map them to the assets as they're continuously orbiting in space. What are the biggest hurdles? A lot of it actually is on the policy side. The core challenge of deconfliction and harmonization of requests. As you expand the number of entities and people who can make requests of a given constellation, you have to have some system of prioritizing those requests. And right now, a lot of that goes through a clearinghouse on the U.S. government side [that] has a pretty standardized prioritization scheme for deciding which requests turn into collections and taskings. If you push for more real-time collection management, you have to have different, more sophisticated ways of intercepting and interrupting that existing priority queue to get something to the top. And so I think that constellation scheduling system&mdash;taking a request right now and actually putting it at the top of the queue, as opposed to putting it at the bottom of the queue because it came in later&mdash;that's really where the magic is going to happen. We actually own our own constellation scheduler, we own the constellation, and we own a lot of the demand signals into that scheduler. And so I think there's a way where, without changing anything about what's on orbit today or the demand that's happening, we can actually experiment and play around with different ways of scheduling. And so that's a place where we're doing a lot of sort of active development and, honestly, quite a bit of simulation. What are the different courses of action you could take? How do you actually simulate the orbitology, and then tie that to a schedule? So it's a place where I think there's actually a lot of potential to experiment in silico before shifting the whole collection-management system in practice to what's done in physical reality. What does that experimentation look like? Within the international business, we have a pretty well-established ladder system for prioritizing what we call satellite access windows. These are different windows of access to the satellites where customers are able to use the satellites and take pictures with them. So one of the experiments we're working on: is there an ability for a customer to basically jump ahead in line? And how would we actually balance that across all of our different customers? I think what we're going to see in the U.S. government is something similar, where maybe different [combatant commands] actually start needing that same kind of adjudication process. I hope to see this as a shift in the U.S. government, in general, towards more buying centers&hellip;more ability for different buyers to be creative about their requirements. And then, our ability to arbitrate between those buyers ultimately helps figure out the right mission solution for any given workflow. What are you bringing to this job from your 12 years at Palantir? They always talk about decisions, not data. And I think that is something that I'm bringing into the Maxar environment. Maxar is a company that makes a thousand decisions a day about where to take pictures. And I think what I saw is that when you apply better data and better algorithms to those core decisions that you're making as a business, you can actually improve the decision making pretty rapidly. When I think about the products that we offer, whether it's tasking products, data products, analytics products, all of them fundamentally point back to 'Where are we pointing the satellites every minute of every day?&rdquo; And so I think that focus on decision-making, and really decision-making loops, is something that I definitely carry forward. A lot of the geospatial industry, I think, has been really focused on [tasking] a satellite, [getting] an image, [and doing] analytics on that image. That's been the flow of what people think about as what we're trying to provide as an industry, whether in the commercial or government sector. I'm really focused on once you have the analytic and you have the insights out of that [machine learning] algorithm, how do you actually tie that back to tasking? Where do you task next? And applying that whole idea of loops to the actual work products we're producing, so that you can move towards a world of more autonomous tasking, where humans and analysts don't necessarily need to be manually looking at an image. But the images themselves can be driving more tasking, and can be sort of intelligently collecting data without a really manual collection management process happening. How does that work? We have some work going on right now that's doing this, at maybe a lower frequency. There's Sentinel data, which is 10-meter data that's collected pretty regularly of the whole globe. You can run a machine-learning algorithm on that data that tells you where might have buildings and roads be being constructed. It's not going to give you the level of detail you need to turn that into a map, but what it can do is it can say, 'Hey, at low resolution, we see change here. Why don't we take an image of that change so that we can digitize it at high resolution?&rdquo; So you're [getting] output of a machine-learning algorithm applied to really low-resolution imagery, putting that as an input to your tasking, and then tasking high-resolution imagery to collect that region and validate whether or not the machine-learning algorithm was correct or wrong about the building that's been constructed. So grainy photos taken every day with automatic detection of changes that triggers a satellite to take a better picture of that change. Exactly. So like, you could imagine taking a daily picture at low resolution and sort of saying, 'OK, you know, the change started; the change ended.' And that's probably going to be durable for another few years, right? They're not going to knock the building down immediately, but if you try to take that high-resolution picture every day, that asset can be a lot more expensive than the low-resolution asset for that particular mission. I would imagine it's better than an analyst having an alert to remind them to check an area to see if something has changed. I think about it a lot. If you walked into Wall Street in the 1980s, you would have a bunch of people yelling about which stocks to buy and which bonds to buy and which options to buy. You walk in now and you hear a bunch of humming computers. There's still people programming those algorithms figuring out what trades to make. They're just not manually making the trades. The trades are being made automatically with a machine-to-machine system that is able to, in a much more sophisticated way, set the right price for whatever instrument people are trying to buy. And so I think we've seen this transition in a lot of other industries, whether it's online advertisement, or taxi dispatching, or trading, and I think it's something that I'm excited about. We're finally at the point where we have enough supply, we have enough demand that really the market making is where a lot of value needs to be developed in the next few years. What products and services will come in 2025 or early 2026? There's really two major pushes that I'm focused on right now. One is sort of this broader evolution within cartography, and especially digital cartography, from sort-of 2D representations of the world to 3D representations of the world and then to vector representations of the world. When you think about your experience using Google Maps or Apple Maps as a consumer, if you're anything like me, you often use the vector-based navigation system. You don't look at the satellite imagery. You look at the buildings and the roads and the schools and the Starbucks that exist on the map that have been extracted from that satellite imagery. And so one of the big threads is pushing from that raw data into the derived data. That takes a lot of work, a lot of machine learning, a lot of training to get to, but ultimately is a much more semantically meaningful representation of the world that really helps users understand, not just navigating between two points, but between two places. The other push is really sort of moving up the stack and up the value chain. From tasking to data into actual end-to-end integrated solutions. We have the world's biggest 3D representation of the globe at Maxar. We put that together by sort of processing the raw 2D imagery into sort of a 3D globe. And we're thinking a lot and working a lot with our customers on how [to] help them use that.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/who-tells-satellites-where-take-pictures-increasingly-itll-be-robots-maxar-says/400679/	2024-10-30T10:54:38-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/30/naples_1x1_2000x800/large.jpg
The D Brief: Russia pushes deeper into Ukraine; N. Korea prepping...	An estimated 3,000 North Korean soldiers have moved to western Russia, South Korean officials said Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. Seoul's Yonhap news agency did not confirm that number, but did report Wednesday 'at least 11,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia, with some sent to Russia's western region near the border with Ukraine.&rdquo; U.S. officials haven't yet confirmed the North Koreans are already fighting inside Ukraine, though CNN notes, 'US officials did not confirm publicly that the troops were in Russia until weeks after South Korea first alleged it.&rdquo; Battlefield latest: Russia's newest offensive, across a 40-mile front in the east, 'has breached Ukrainian defenses in just a few days in many areas,&rdquo; conflict analyst Emil Kastehelmi writes. 'At the moment the Russians are struggling to expand their breach into a breakthrough. Even though the Ukrainians are losing many square kilometers, the defence hasn't crumbled into chaos, and nothing extremely crucial has been lost,&rdquo; he adds. Bigger picture: 'The rate of Russian advances in Ukraine has increased in recent weeks but remains slow and consistent with positional warfare rather than with rapid mechanized maneuver,&rdquo; the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War wrote Tuesday. 'Russian forces have been making gains in eastern Ukraine recently, but comparing those gains to the initial deep Russian penetration into Ukraine at the start of the war misleadingly frames these most recent advances,&rdquo; ISW cautions. Manpower update: Russia's military 'is recruiting around 30,000 men per month,&rdquo; which isn't quite 'enough to meet internal targets,&rdquo; but it's believed to be enough 'to cover even the gargantuan losses of recent months,&rdquo; NATO officials told the Economist this week.

And if you're not already subscribed, you can do that here. On this day in 2014, Sweden became the first EU member to officially recognize the State of Palestine. Boom times Russia's military says it 'practiced launching a massive nuclear strike in response to a nuclear strike by a simulated enemy&rdquo; on Tuesday. As part of the drills, the Russians launched a Yars intercontinental ballistic missile from a base near Alaska, submarine-launched ballistic missiles northeast of Norway and north of Japan, and dispatched Tu-95 strategic bombers firing air-launched cruise missiles. The nuclear tests are 'a reliable guarantor of the sovereignty and security of our country&rdquo; and 'solve the problems of strategic deterrence, as well as maintain nuclear parity and the balance of power in the world as objective factors of global stability,&rdquo; Russian leader Vladimir Putin said in a statement. Context: Russia's 'focus on weapons of mass destruction is aimed at offering reassurances to a domestic audience amid the uneven performance of Russian troops in Ukraine, and at deterring Western nations from providing more advanced weapons to Ukraine,&rdquo; the New York Times writes. South Korea's military says the North is on the brink of conducting its seventh nuclear weapons test, though it's unclear if it will occur before or after Election Day in the U.S. on November 5, the Associated Press reports from Seoul. 'It appears that preparations are nearly complete for an ICBM-class long-range missile, including a space launch vehicle,&rdquo; South Korea's Defense Intelligence Agency said Wednesday, according to Yonhap. 'Preparations for a transporter erector launcher are complete, and it has been deployed to a certain area,&rdquo; but no missile has been loaded yet, two lawmakers said. Rewind: This would not be the first time Russia and North Korea have carried out nuclear exercises close to U.S. presidential elections. Eight years ago, North Korea detonated a hydrogen bomb less than two months before the election, and Russia announced 'nuclear-bomb survival drills&rdquo; the following month. By the way: South Korea's military chief Kim Yong Hyun is visiting the Pentagon today for talks with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his team. Similar talks&mdash;under the banner of a U.S.-ROK Security Consultative Meeting&mdash;occur nearly every year, including last November with Seoul's previous defense minister. Industrial strategy The implementation plan for the Pentagon's defense-industrial strategy was rolled out on Tuesday, and includes six 'initiatives&rdquo; for fiscal 2025, starting with improvements to the missile and submarine industries. The unclassified, nearly-100-page document precedes a classified 'annex&rdquo; to come, Laura Taylor-Kale, who leads Pentagon industrial base policy, told reporters Tuesday. The strategy, which was itself rolled out in January, broadly aims to bolster supply chains to make weapons securely, faster, and en masse. The Pentagon spent about $39.4 billion on the strategy in fiscal 2024 and asked for $37.7 billion in 2025. More than three-quarters of the funds&mdash;about $60 billion total&mdash;will go toward missiles and munitions, followed by $3.3 billion for the submarine industrial base and $500 million for the Defense Department's Replicator initiative. What could go wrong? Well, Congress could fail to pass the 2025 budget bills before the continuing resolution runs out in December, Taylor-Kale said. 'It creates a lot of challenges in procurement, in general, and also in planning for us, when we have these continuing resolutions.&rdquo; Defense One's Lauren C. Williams has more, here. The best way to make sure the Pentagon gets the quantum sensors it needs is to increase R&D spending across the federal government, a new industry-backed report argues. Currently, the U.S. government spends about $900 million on quantum sensing each year, most going to the Defense Department. An increase is needed, according to the report, which was produced by the industry-driven Quantum Economic Development Consortium with funding from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. By boosting the nascent quantum-sensing industry and its efforts to serve domestic markets from aeronautics to energy, the report argues, these increases will help answer defense leaders' years-old calls for new instruments&mdash;quantum magnetometers, gravimeters, and clocks&mdash;that don't rely on vulnerable signals from space to provide navigation and timing data. Defense One's Patrick Tucker reports, here. Europe Developing: A fire at Britain's nuclear shipyard put two workers in the hospital. The blaze broke out early Wednesday morning in BAE Systems' six-acre assembly hall at Barrow-in-Furness, where the UK's four Dreadnought-class missile boats and an Astute attack sub are being built. The Lancaster Guardian and BBC have a bit more. And lastly: Spain has deployed 1,000 soldiers to help evacuate people from flash floods that have killed at least 64 people so far. The military's emergency unit posted videos of some rescues by airlift.

Broader federal investment in quantum sensing needed to outpace C...	The tech industry needs more funding from the U.S. government&mdash;not just the Pentagon&mdash;if it is to outpace China in the quest for quantum sensors, whose national-security implications include ground-based replacements for aging and vulnerable GPS satellites, an industry group argues in a new report. Currently, the U.S. government spends about $900 million on quantum sensing each year, most going to the Defense Department.. An increase is needed, according to the report, which was produced by the industry-driven Quantum Economic Development Consortium with funding from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. By boosting the nascent quantum-sensing industry and its efforts to serve domestic markets from aeronautics to energy, the report argues, these increases will help answer defense leaders' years-old calls for new instruments&mdash;quantum magnetometers, gravimeters, and clocks&mdash;that don't rely on vulnerable signals from space to provide navigation and timing data. A recent Quantum Economic Development Consortium, QED-C, workshop brought together over 100 experts to outline how quantum sensing technology can enhance position, navigation, and timing, or PNT, capabilities. Perhaps the biggest insight to come out of the meeting: federal spending to help the quantum sensing industry has to grow beyond the Defense Department. 'Federal investment would support the technology's initial development and ultimately its broader adoption and scaling. Additionally, collaboration among federal agencies could lead to increased standardization of quantum sensors,&rdquo; the report notes. [[Related Posts]] Celia Merzbacher, QED-C's executive director, told Defense One in an email: 'The state of quantum sensing is still at a relatively early stage. Government funding will accelerate the pace and ensure that the stringent requirements for government use cases such as military and space applications, e.g. to operate in extreme environments, will be met. Government funding will accelerate progress.&rdquo; One of the chief challenges is that quantum sensing tech makers right now are focused on very, very specific customers, like labs and academic research centers. Those labs need sensors for special experiments so the quantum sensing industry, to the extent that it exists, is all over the place in terms of parts or even the function of the technology they are putting out. That makes it hard for the government to come up with standards that new players can use to guide their choices on what to make and where to find parts and components. A lack of standard testing also makes the business case for quantum sensors harder&mdash;at least for anyone not in the Defense Department. 'Standardized performance metrics, which are essential to enable the sensors to demonstrate their advantages over classical sensors and drive their adoption. Comprehensive testing is needed to accurately assess the current state of the technology. But a lack of testbeds for quantum sensors makes it nearly impossible to collect the performance data necessary for setting standards or showcasing capabilities,&rdquo; the report says. 'Federal funding of testbeds could dramatically accelerate both quantum sensor development and technology adoption.&rdquo; The workshop's participants also said that federal funding should go to photonic integrated circuits to 'address the size, weight, power, and cost&hellip; issues.&rdquo; They said the federal government should work harder to be an 'early adopter&rdquo; not just the Pentagon, but especially the Department of Energy Department and NASA. 'Early adoption would not only advance the technology's reliability but also position the government as a primary driver in creating cost-effective, scalable quantum solutions for national security needs,&rdquo; they wrote. Of course, that's easier said than done, at least politically. While both parties agree on robust funding for the Defense Department, continued funding for other agencies like Energy is more controversial and could be cut next year depending on the outcome of the presidential election. China, conversely, has been investing heavily in quantum sensing. It has even overtaken the United States&mdash;at least in the number of published research papers on the topic, according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute's tracker of critical technologies.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/broader-federal-investment-quantum-sensing-needed-outpace-china-industry-report-says/400661/	2024-10-29T17:11:49-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/29/GettyImages_2161413352/large.jpg
Six charged with conspiring to defraud agencies with IT-contracti...	The Justice Department charged six people for working to defraud a number of government agencies, including those in the defense and intelligence community, through a series of bidding, kickback and bribery schemes, the agency said Tuesday. The move is among 'the first charges in the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into IT manufacturers, distributors and resellers who sell products and services to government purchasers including the intelligence community,&rdquo; Justice said in a statement. Victor Marquez, who owns two IT companies with sizable government contracts, faces a four-count indictment on charges of wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, and major fraud against the U.S. for rigging bids and inflating contract payments. Two others that worked alongside him, Antwann C.K. Rawls &mdash; an employee at one of his companies &mdash; and Scott Reefe &mdash; an IT sales executive &mdash; were also charged. Court documents filed in Maryland alleged the trio exchanged bid information prior to submitting offers, with one emailing that he would file a 'high price third bid.&rdquo; Marquez and his accomplices submitted these coordinated bids in full knowledge that the government sought independent, competitive submissions for the contracts, and in spite of Marquez's certification of independent bidding, Justice claims. The government often awards the contract to the lowest reasonable bidder or the one offering the best value, depending on circumstances. In cases of bid rigging or fraud, firms conspire to manipulate the bidding process by coordinating bids to undermine competition and illegally increase their returns. Marquez did not respond to a request for comment. Separately, Breal Madison Jr. was indicted on 13 counts, including conspiracy, bribery of a public official, mail fraud and money laundering for orchestrating a multi-year scheme that defrauded his employer out of over $7 million in relation to the sale of IT products to various government agencies. IT contractor Brandon Scott Glisson, who provided services to the U.S. government, along with his supervisor, Lawrence Eady, a former senior government official, have been charged for their respective parts in the scheme with Madison. Madison and his co-conspirators plotted to steal funds from his employer at the time, Rubrik, and government agencies. He funneled more than $9 million in stolen proceeds to his shell company, Trident Technology Solutions, as well as another shell entity, according to the allegations. The DOJ served Rubrik, a cloud cybersecurity firm, with a grand jury subpoena last October regarding a former employee who had worked in its sales division, citing potential violations of federal law in connection with government contracts. 'We are deeply disturbed by the alleged conduct by a former employee related to a scheme to defraud Rubrik and the government. The alleged behavior is inconsistent with our values and business ethos and is in violation of our code of conduct and other company policies. As previously disclosed in public filings, we have been cooperating with authorities and will continue to do so,&rdquo; a Rubrik spokesperson told Nextgov/FCW. Madison didn't return a request for comment. 'Antitrust crimes can undermine competition for products and services that are vital to our national security,&rdquo; said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division in a press release. 'When fraudsters siphon taxpayer funds, the Antitrust Division and its Procurement Collusion Strike Force (PCSF) partners across the government will hold accountable those who collude to subvert competition, line their pockets with federal procurement dollars and compromise the integrity of our intelligence community programs.&rdquo; Officials from the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, FBI, National Security Agency Office of Inspector General and CIA Office of Inspector General also issued statements affirming their offices' commitments to stopping such fraud schemes.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/us-charges-6-conspiring-defraud-agencies-through-it-contracting-schemes/400660/	2024-10-29T16:38:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/29/GettyImages_2172231947-1/large.jpg
Budget woes may slow Pentagon efforts to strengthen industry	Lawmakers' continued failure to pass a 2025 budget could hinder Pentagon efforts to beef up supply chains and bolster defense, defense officials warned Tuesday. They spoke at the release of the Defense Department's nearly 100-page implementation plan for its inaugural defense industry strategy. The plan is broadly intended to bolster supply chains to make weapons securely, faster, and en masse. It outlines six initiatives for fiscal 2025, starting with improvements to the missile and submarine industries. 'It's best for us to have a full budget done&hellip;on time for us to be able to implement. It creates a lot of challenges in procurement, in general, and also in planning for us, when we have these continuing resolutions. So we're hopeful that Congress will work together and develop and pass a bill, a defense policy bill, as well as a funding bill soon,&rdquo; Laura Taylor-Kale, who leads Pentagon industrial base policy, told reporters Tuesday. The Pentagon plans to spend about $39.4 billion on the industry strategy in fiscal 2024, according to a fact sheet, and asked for $37.7 billion in 2025. In both years, the vast majority of funds&mdash;about $30 billion apiece&mdash;will go to missiles and munitions, followed by $3.3 billion for the submarine industrial base and $500 million for the Defense Department's Replicator initiative. [[Related Posts]] Taylor-Kale said the strategy was coming together during the 2024 and 2025 budget cycles, so the 2026 budget&mdash;now under construction&mdash;will be the first to fully incorporate its plans and principles. She said the department intends to update the strategy and implementation plan annually. The plan's six initiatives aim to address the biggest pitfalls the defense industrial base has from long and costly development timelines to a dearth of skilled workforce, reduced productivity, and intellectual property theft. Other initiatives include moving critical defense capabilities to reduce supply-chain vulnerabilities; adding co-production and development between U.S. and allied and partner nations; modernizing supply-chain infrastructure in the nuclear industrial base and organic industrial base, which includes facilities that make, store, and dispose of munitions; fine-tuning use of rapid acquisition for better prototyping and fielding; and protecting intellectual property. Much of this work is in progress, officials said. There will be a classified annex to the implementation plan with metrics and risks released in the coming months. 'This implementation plan offers industry, global allies, and partners clear direction on the Department's priorities for industrial capacity building,&rdquo; Taylor-Kale said in a statement announcing the plan's release. 'Implementing these initiatives will require coordinated efforts across the DoD, and support and cooperation from our interagency, industry, and international stakeholders, as well as our champions in Congress.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/budget-woes-may-slow-pentagon-efforts-strengthen-industry/400651/	2024-10-29T13:08:45-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/29/Screenshot_2024_10_29_at_10.07.01AM/large.png
UN cyber pact would help autocrats crush dissent, US lawmakers wa...	A group of Democratic senators is sounding the alarm about U.S. participation in a forthcoming United Nations cybercrime treaty vote, fearing that America's involvement could lend credibility to policies promoted by authoritarian regimes like China and Russia. The missive, led by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., is addressed to top administration officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Attorney General Merrick Garland, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, arguing the U.S. 'must not align itself with repressive regimes&rdquo; that have carried out digitally-enabled human rights abuses. The letter raises concerns about abuses by authoritarian nations, particularly around privacy, surveillance and censorship, arguing the finalized Cybercrime Convention allows for broad definitions of cybercrime and surveillance without strong safeguards for individual users. The lawmakers add that the treaty risks criminalizing good-faith cybersecurity and AI research. Countries under the proposed treaty must adopt laws or procedures that permit their authorities to demand access to computer systems or stored data from individuals or companies. The senators warn this could erode access to encrypted communications services and give broad jurisdiction back to a country's own legal standards. 'In Iran, for example, the lack of such requirements could provide international legal cover for the regime's efforts to promote the widespread surveillance and policing of women and girls. Likewise, the Convention compels countries to collect and share private internet user data with other countries regarding a wide range of crimes,&rdquo; they write. The pact led by the global diplomatic and international political standards body has been in the works for years and has the potential to rewire how countries prosecute cybercriminals and track people suspected of engaging in cybercrimes against sovereign entities. Nation-state adversaries &mdash; namely Russia, China, North Korea and Iran &mdash; are among the greatest purveyors of cybercrime activity, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency says. But the convention has become a lightning rod for debate among Western officials because it could allow foreign adversaries to have a bigger seat at the table when it comes to debating cross-border intelligence, cyber and surveillance issues. Russia has sought the creation of a cybercrime agreement in the UN as far back as 2017. The White House National Security Council declined to comment on the letter. Both law enforcement and national security officials have been debating whether the treaty should get the green light from the U.S., Politico reported last month.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/un-cybercrime-convention-will-legitimize-authoritarian-nations-cyber-behavior-senators-warn/400642/	2024-10-29T09:58:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/29/102924UNNG-1/large.jpg
The D Brief: Houthis resume ship attacks; ‘Put [feds] in trauma’;...	After an 18-day lull, the Russia-supported Houthi terrorists in Yemen targeted another commercial vessel in the Red Sea on Monday. British maritime authorities confirmed the attempted attack, but said the vessel&mdash;Liberia-flagged bulk carrier Motaro&mdash;was unharmed after three explosions occurred close to the ship as it transited the Bab el-Mandeb strait. The Houthis also claim to have attacked two other ships in the Arabian Sea, but offered no proof to support their claims, the Associated Press reported Monday. Israeli officials say a drone launched from Yemen landed in the coastal city of Ashkelon Tuesday. 'The impact caused no injuries but sparked a small fire,&rdquo; according to the Times of Israel.

Bush and claiming responsibility for the 9/11 attacks. He said the attacks were motivated partly by the 1982 Lebanese Civil War, and that he intended to bait the U.S. into wars that would bankrupt the country. Emerging tech New rule aims to stop U.S. investors from backing Chinese research into AI and quantum science. Issued Monday by the White House, the rule 'prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in certain transactions involving semiconductors, quantum and artificial intelligence. And second, it requires U.S. persons to notify [the] Treasury [Department] of certain other transactions involving semiconductors and artificial intelligence,&rdquo; a senior White House official told reporters ahead of the release. How much do U.S. investors pour into Chinese military tech? From 2015 to 2021, they pumped $40.2 billion into 251 Chinese AI companies, accounting for 37 percent of the $110 billion raised by all Chinese companies working on AI. That's according to a February 2023 paper from the Center for Security and Emerging Technologies. Defense One's Patrick Tucker has more, here.

Space Force's effort to bring in new launch providers hasn't worked yet. Officials aren't surprised. Last year, the service launched a competition called National Space Security Launch Phase 3 with two categories: 'Lane 1,&rdquo; for less risky missions, and 'Lane 2,&rdquo; for more challenging missions. The idea was that new entrants to the space launch market could get a foot in the door with a Lane 1 mission. But nothing bars established giants like SpaceX from competing in Lane 1, and on Oct. 18, the Space Force announced that SpaceX won $733.5 million for the first set of launches in that category. 'I don't look at it as a failure at all. We fully anticipated it. I mean, everybody knows who's launching right now. We knew it was going to be a very limited set, but we knew we had to start somewhere,&rdquo; said Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, program executive officer for Assured Access to Space. Defense One's Audrey Decker reports. Future of American democracy Trump's former OMB director: 'We want to put [federal employees] in trauma.&rdquo; A key ally to former President Donald Trump, Russell Vought, has plans that track closely with Trump's campaign rhetoric about using the military against domestic protesters, or what Trump has called the 'enemy within,&rdquo; ProPublica reported Monday after obtaining video of Vought's private speeches over the last two years. In those appearances, Vought described his work crafting legal justifications so that military leaders or government lawyers would not stop Trump's executive actions. As OMB chief, Vought sought to use Trump's 2020 'Schedule F&rdquo; executive order to strip away job protections for nonpartisan government workers, ProPublica reminds readers. But until these private speeches were made public, he had 'never spoken in such pointed terms about demoralizing federal workers to the point that they don't want to do their jobs.&rdquo; Why bring it up: 'Vought is widely expected to take a high-level government role if Trump wins a second term. His name has even been mentioned as a potential White House chief of staff,&rdquo; according to ProPublica. 'We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,&rdquo; Vought said. 'When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. We want to put them in trauma,&rdquo; he said. Continue reading, here. View from Capitol Hill: If re-elected, Donald Trump will behave 'like a fascist&rdquo; and 'destroy the Department of Defense,&rdquo; warned the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman Jack Reed of Rhode Island, in a conversation with reporters Monday. Reed called the meeting to bring attention to what he described as 'Trump's dystopian threats to misuse the military and trample on the Constitution.&rdquo; 'What Trump wants is power&mdash;power to first dismiss the legal cases against him, then power to accumulate more and more,&rdquo; Reed said. 'He wants to create chaos and a dysfunctional non-government, actually, because there in that context, he has more power.&rdquo; If he returns to office, Trump 'will destroy the Department of Defense,&rdquo; the senator cautioned. 'He already demonstrated at the end of his last term his willingness to essentially fire the civilian senior defense employees to his Schedule F episode. That's been replicated in the Project 2025 report, and it's going to be something he does. He will create chaos, and he will force many, many of our best officers, frankly, to decide whether they continue to serve or they must leave the service.&rdquo; 'Why is it that men Trump once called &lsquo;my generals'&mdash;men like Gen. [John] Kelly, General [Mark] Milley, General [Jim] Mattis, General [H.R.] McMaster, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and more, everyone who worked closely with him, even his own former Vice President Mike Pence&mdash;why is it they all believe Trump is unfit to be president?&rdquo; Reed asked. Citing the recent work of historian Heather Cox Richardson, Reed said that a March 1945 U.S. Army publication, Army Talks, 'tried to explain to most of the troops what fascism was. And one of the lines from the document said it is &lsquo;government by the few and for the few. The objective is seizure and control of the economic, political, social, and cultural life of the state.' And that sounds a lot like Donald Trump and Elon Musk and the gang all plotting to take over and get special powers and to go after enemies and do things like that.&rdquo; Citing that Army publication, Reed reminded reporters, fascists 'make their own rules and change them when they choose&hellip;they maintain themselves in power by the use of force combined with propaganda based on primitive ideas of &lsquo;blood' and &lsquo;race,' by skillful manipulation of fear and hate and by false promises of security.' [That] Sounds like a Trump speech,&rdquo; Reed said. 'So I'm very concerned that he would, regardless of the definition of a fascist, act like a fascist.&rdquo; But Reed wasn't entirely lacking in optimism. 'I have faith in the leadership of the military that if they detect people who are acting contrary to the law and Constitution and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, that they'll take steps and correct that; that's their job,&rdquo; he said. However, 'The question that becomes much more difficult is, if he assumes office, then I think he has powers that can basically purge the military of people with conscience and replace them with his cronies. That would be a disaster&rdquo; since 'people would be there not because they're the best strategist, tactician, etc. They're there because they'll do whatever [Trump] says. And frankly, I don't think he has a very good grasp on many issues affecting the world.&rdquo; Learn more: Review the eight-page 1945 U.S. Army publication in its entirety, here.

Space Force’s effort to bring in new launch providers hasn’t work...	The Space Force gave the first contract in a program intended to bring new companies into the launch industry to SpaceX&mdash;the world's dominant space launch provider. But officials say that's what they expected. Last year, in an effort to diversify the list of companies launching military satellites into space, the service launched a competition called National Space Security Launch Phase 3. The program splits launches into two groups: 'Lane 1,&rdquo; for less risky missions, and 'Lane 2,&rdquo; for more challenging missions. The idea was that new entrants to the space launch market could get a foot in the door with a Lane 1 mission. But nothing bars established giants like SpaceX from competing in Lane 1, and on Oct. 18, the Space Force announced that SpaceX won $733.5 million for the first set of launches in that category. 'I don't look at it as a failure at all. We fully anticipated it. I mean, everybody knows who's launching right now. We knew it was going to be a very limited set, but we knew we had to start somewhere,&rdquo; said Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, program executive officer for Assured Access to Space. The service didn't want to wait for other companies to be ready before it launched the new acquisition approach, Panzenhagen told reporters last week during Space Systems Command's annual Space Industry Days conference. 'We never expected that it was going to be immediate in the first year because this is rocket science, right? Developing rockets, designing them, producing them, buying them is hard. We've got a lot of new companies working at it that we're excited to bring on, but we know that it's going to take time to flush all this out,&rdquo; she said. To qualify for this year's contract awards, companies had to have a credible path to first flight by the year's end. Up-and-coming launch providers like Relativity Space, Firefly Aerospace, Rocket Lab, and ABL Space Systems are expected to eventually compete for Lane 1 launches, but it's unclear when these companies will have a rocket ready for primetime. The Pentagon this summer picked SpaceX, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance to compete for $5.6 billion worth of contracts in Lane 1, which includes at least 30 missions from fiscal 2025 to 2029. But additional companies will still be able to join future Lane 1 competitions, and there will be an 'on-ramp&rdquo; opening later this year, Space Force has said. Blue Origin is pitching its New Glenn rocket, which still needs to complete two certification flights, but is aiming for a first flight in November. ULA is offering its Vulcan rocket, which flew its second certification flight at the beginning of the month. ULA declared the flight 'successful&rdquo; despite an abnormality during launch where material broke off one of its solid rocket boosters. The anomaly could complicate Pentagon certification, depending on the results of the investigation. ULA needs to get Vulcan certified quickly because it's on contract to launch Space Force missions by the end of the year. The service is looking at post-flight data from the Vulcan launch and going through the standard process for new vehicle certification, Panzenhagen said. 'As far as impacts go, we don't give ourselves a certification date timeline. It's not calendar driven. It's once we've gone through all the data, and we are confident that the vehicles are ready to start flying our missions&hellip; when we reach that point, we'll have a certified vehicle and be ready to start flying missions,&rdquo; she said. Even once Vulcan comes online, it's unclear whether it will be able to challenge Elon Musk's company&mdash;especially when SpaceX's reusable mega-rocket Starship becomes operational. Starship made history earlier this month after it caught a Super Heavy booster for the first time, paving the way for faster launch turnaround times. 'While Starship does have very unique capabilities, [and] I think much of the nation is watching what they're doing and their lift capability, that's not the only exciting rocket out there, right? Every new provider gives us another chunk of resiliency and some more capability. So that's why we structured at Lane 1 in our Phase 3 acquisition strategy, the way we have to be able to bring those new providers into our launch family and benefit national security,&rdquo; Panzenhagen said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/space-forces-effort-bring-new-launch-providers-hasnt-worked-yet-officials-arent-surprised/400625/	2024-10-28T17:13:37-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/28/A_United_Launch_Alli_2500/large.jpg
White House targets US investments in Chinese AI and quantum tech	A new White House 'final rule&rdquo; announced today aims to shut down the flow of U.S. venture capital and other investment funds into Chinese technology that poses a national security risk, such as quantum computers, artificial intelligence and advanced microelectronics, senior White House officials said. The rule is intended as a guide to implement an executive order the White House put out last August, ordering the Treasury Department and other relevant agencies to identify categories of investment in Chinese tech that could pose a threat to the United States. Today's rule 'prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in certain transactions involving semiconductors, quantum and artificial intelligence. And second, it requires U.S. persons to notify treasury of certain other transactions involving semiconductors and artificial intelligence,&rdquo; a senior White House official told reporters ahead of the release. The rule bars investments in any Chinese company that is developing or scaling quantum computers or networks that could undermine encryption. That follows the publication of multiple research papers out of China purporting to show that Chinese advancements in quantum computing have rendered key U.S. encryption standards vulnerable, such as the 2,048-bit RSA encryption system used by banking systems and software makers the world over. Experts have pushed back on those papers' claims, but the White House says the threat posed by China's ongoing quantum work remains very real, even if it hasn't yet resulted in encryption-destroying capabilities. 'These technologies can be used for advanced code breaking, the development of the next generation military applications, or offensive cyber operations,&rdquo; said a senior White House official. AI is another key focus area of the new rule. Chinese investments in AI include areas like facial recognition to target minority groups, deep fakes to spread disinformation, and autonomous weapons. How big a problem is U.S. investment in Chinese military tech? A February 2023 paper from the Center for Security and Emerging Technologies said that between 2015 and 2021, U.S. investors pumped $40.2 billion into 251 Chinese AI companies, accounting for 37 percent of the $110 billion raised by all Chinese companies working on AI. According to CSET, '167 U.S. investors participated in 401 investment transactions&mdash;or 17 percent of 2,299 global investment transactions&mdash;into Chinese AI companies.&rdquo; The vast majority of those investments, more than 90 percent, came from venture capital. 'I think if you think about those sets of facts and scenarios, that's the kind of situation, that when it comes to certain artificial intelligence capable of impacting our national security, from a military intelligence, cyber, other related perspective, that's what we're concerned about,&rdquo; a senior White House official said. Said another Senior White House official, a lot of the venture capital investment that has gone to Chinese startups went to companies that eventually ended up on the Treasury Department's 'Entity List&rdquo; of companies, which restricts some types of U.S. investments. 'As we were looking at some case studies to inform the development of this executive order, and the regulation actually was focused on cyber security&hellip; we saw a number of VC investments directly into firms working on cybersecurity that ended up on the Entity List for working with Chinese military and intelligence services.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/white-house-targets-us-investments-chinese-ai-and-quantum-tech/400624/	2024-10-28T16:46:28-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/28/GettyImages_452512614/large.jpg
‘Put them in trauma': A key MAGA leader’s plans for civil servant...	A key ally to former President Donald Trump detailed plans to deploy the military in response to domestic unrest, defund the Environmental Protection Agency and put career civil servants 'in trauma&rdquo; in a series of previously unreported speeches that provide a sweeping vision for a second Trump term. In private speeches delivered in 2023 and 2024, Russell Vought, who served as Trump's director of the Office of Management and Budget, described his work crafting legal justifications so that military leaders or government lawyers would not stop Trump's executive actions. He said the plans are a response to a 'Marxist takeover&rdquo; of the country; likened the moment to 1776 and 1860, when the country was at war or on the brink of it; and said the timing of Trump's candidacy was a 'gift of God.&rdquo; ProPublica and Documented obtained videos of the two speeches Vought delivered during events for the Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump think tank led by Vought. The think tank's employees or fellows include Jeffrey Clark, the former senior Justice Department lawyer who aided Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election result; Ken Cuccinelli, a former acting deputy secretary in the Department of Homeland Security under Trump; and Mark Paoletta, a former senior budget official in the Trump administration. Other Trump allies such as former White House adviser Steve Bannon and U.S. Reps. Chip Roy and Scott Perry either spoke at the conferences or appeared on promotional materials for the events. Vought does not hide his agenda or shy away from using extreme rhetoric in public. But the apocalyptic tone and hard-line policy prescriptions in the two private speeches go further than his earlier pronouncements. As OMB director, Vought sought to use Trump's 2020 'Schedule F&rdquo; executive order to strip away job protections for nonpartisan government workers. But he has never spoken in such pointed terms about demoralizing federal workers to the point that they don't want to do their jobs. He has spoken in broad terms about undercutting independent agencies but never spelled out sweeping plans to defund the EPA and other federal agencies. Vought's plans track closely with Trump's campaign rhetoric about using the military against domestic protesters or what Trump has called the 'enemy within.&rdquo; Trump's desire to use the military on U.S. soil recently prompted his longest-serving chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, to speak out, saying Trump 'certainly prefers the dictator approach to government.&rdquo; Other policies mentioned by Vought dovetail with Trump's plans, such as embracing a wartime footing on the southern border and rolling back transgender rights. Agenda 47, the campaign's policy blueprint, calls for revoking President Joe Biden's order expanding gender-affirming care for transgender people; Vought uses even more extreme language, decrying the 'transgender sewage that's being pumped into our schools and institutions&rdquo; and referring to gender-affirming care as 'chemical castration.&rdquo; Since leaving government, Vought has reportedly remained a close ally of the former president. Speaking in July to undercover journalists posing as relatives of a potential donor, Vought said Trump had 'blessed&rdquo; the Center for Renewing America and was 'very supportive of what we do,&rdquo; CNN reported. Vought did not respond to requests for comment. 'Since the Fall of 2023, President Trump's campaign made it clear that only President Trump and the campaign, and NOT any other organization or former staff, represent policies for the second term,&rdquo; Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement. She did not directly address Vought's statements. Karoline Leavitt, his campaign's national press secretary, added there have been no discussions on who would serve in a second Trump administration. In addition to running his think tank, Vought was the policy director of the Republican National Committee's official platform committee ahead of the nominating convention. He's also an architect of Project 2025, the controversial coalition effort mapping out how a second Trump administration can quickly eliminate obstacles to rolling out a hard-right policy agenda. As ProPublica and Documented reported, Project 2025 has launched a massive program to recruit, vet and train thousands of people to 'be ready on day one&rdquo; to serve in a future conservative administration. (Trump has repeatedly criticized Project 2025, and his top aides have said the effort has no connection to the official campaign despite the dozens of former Trump aides and advisers who contributed to Project 2025.) Vought is widely expected to take a high-level government role if Trump wins a second term. His name has even been mentioned as a potential White House chief of staff. The videos obtained by ProPublica and Documented offer an unfiltered look at Vought's worldview, his plans for a Trump administration and his fusing of MAGA ideology and Christian nationalism. A Shadow Government in Waiting In his 2024 speech, Vought said he was spending the majority of his time helping lead Project 2025 and drafting an agenda for a future Trump presidency. 'We have detailed agency plans,&rdquo; he said. 'We are writing the actual executive orders. We are writing the actual regulations now, and we are sorting out the legal authorities for all of what President Trump is running on.&rdquo; Vought laid out how his think tank is crafting the legal rationale for invoking the Insurrection Act, a law that gives the president broad power to use the military for domestic law enforcement. The Washington Post previously reported the issue was at the top of the Center for Renewing America's priorities. 'We want to be able to shut down the riots and not have the legal community or the defense community come in and say, &lsquo;That's an inappropriate use of what you're trying to do,'&rdquo; he said. Vought held up the summer 2020 unrest following George Floyd's murder as an example of when Trump ought to have had the ability to deploy the armed forces but was stymied. Vought's preparations for a future Trump administration involve building a 'shadow&rdquo; Office of Legal Counsel, he told the gathered supporters in May 2023. That office, part of the Justice Department, advises the president on the scope of their powers. Vought made clear he wants the office to help Trump steamroll the kind of internal opposition he faced in his first term. Historically, the OLC has operated with a degree of independence. 'If, all of a sudden, the office is full of a bunch of loyalists whose only job is to rubber-stamp the White House's latest policy directive, whose only goal is to justify the ends by whatever means, that would be quite dangerous,&rdquo; said an attorney who worked in the office under a previous Republican administration and requested anonymity to speak freely. Another priority, according to Vought, was to 'defund&rdquo; certain independent federal agencies and demonize career civil servants, which include scientists and subject matter experts. Project 2025's plan to revive Schedule F, an attempt to make it easier to fire a large swath of government workers who currently have civil service protections, aligns with Vought's vision. 'We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,&rdquo; he said. 'When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. 'We want to put them in trauma.&rdquo; Vought also revealed the extent of the Center for Renewing America's role in whipping up right-wing panic ahead of the 2022 midterms over an increase in asylum-seekers crossing at the U.S.-Mexico border. In February 2022, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich released a legal opinion claiming the state was under 'invasion&rdquo; by violent cartels and could invoke war powers to deploy National Guard troops to its southern border. The legally dubious 'invasion&rdquo; theory became a potent Republican talking point. Vought said in the 2023 speech that he and Cuccinelli, the former top Homeland Security official for Trump, personally lobbied Brnovich on the effort. 'We said, &lsquo;Look, you can write your own opinion, but here's a draft opinion of what this should look like,'&rdquo; Vought said. The nonpartisan watchdog group American Oversight later obtained an email in which Vought pitched the 'invasion&rdquo; framework to Brnovich. Brnovich wrote in an email to ProPublica that he recalled multiple discussions with Cuccinelli about border security. But he added that 'the invasion opinion was the result of a formal request from a member of the Arizona legislature. And I can assure you it was drafted and written by hard working attorneys (including myself) in our office.&rdquo; In the event Trump loses, Vought called for Republican leaders of states such as Florida and Texas to 'create red-state sanctuaries&rdquo; by 'kicking out all the feds as much as they possibly can.&rdquo; 'Nothing Short of a Quiet Revolution&rdquo; The two speeches delivered by Vought, taken together, offer an unvarnished look at the animating ideology and political worldview of a key figure in the MAGA movement. Over the last century, Vought said, the U.S. has 'experienced nothing short of a quiet revolution&rdquo; and abandoned what he saw as the true meaning and force of the Constitution. The country today, he argued, was a 'post-constitutional regime,&rdquo; one that no longer adhered to the separation of powers among the three branches of government as laid out by the framers. He lamented that the conservative right and the nation writ large had become 'too secular&rdquo; and 'too globalist.&rdquo; He urged his allies to join his mission to 'renew a consensus of America as a nation under God.&rdquo; And in one of his most dramatic flourishes, he likened the 2024 election to moments in America's history when the country was facing all-out war. 'We are here in the year of 2024, a year that very well [could] &mdash; and I believe it will &mdash; rival 1776 and 1860 for the complexity and the uncertainty of the forces arrayed against us,&rdquo; Vought told his audience, referring to years when the colonies declared independence from Britain and the first state seceded over President Abraham Lincoln's election. 'God put us here for such a time as this.&rdquo; Vought said that independent agencies and unelected bureaucrats and experts wield far too much power while the traditional legislative process is a sham. He extended that critique to agencies like the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve, whose independence from the White House had long been protected by both political parties. 'The left in the U.S. doesn't want an energetic president with the power to motivate the executive branch to the will of the American people consistent with the laws of the country,&rdquo; he said in the 2024 speech. 'They don't want a vibrant Congress where great questions are debated and decided in front of the American people. They don't want empowered members. They want discouraged and bored backbenchers.&rdquo; He added, 'The all-empowered career expert like Tony Fauci is their model, wielding power behind the curtains.&rdquo; Fauci was one of the top public health experts under Trump at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and a key figure in coordinating the national response. What sets Vought apart from most of his fellow conservative activists is that he accuses powerful organizations on the right of being complicit in the current system of government, singling out the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, the conservative and libertarian legal network co-chaired by activist Leonard Leo. The society is widely seen as an instrumental force in cultivating young conservative lawyers and building a bench of future judges whose embrace of legal theories like originalism and textualism have led to decisions overturning abortion rights, environmental protections and social welfare policies. Yet in his 2024 speech, Vought accused the Federalist Society and 'originalist judges&rdquo; of being a part of the problem, perpetuating the 'post-constitutional structure&rdquo; that Vought lamented by not ruling more aggressively to weaken or dismantle independent regulatory agencies that Vought and his allies view as illegitimate or unconstitutional. It was 'like being in a contract quietly revoked two decades ago, in which one party didn't tell the other,&rdquo; he said. 'At some point, reality needs to set in. Instead, we have the vaunted so-called Federalist Society and originalist judges acting as a Praetorian Guard for this post-constitutional structure.&rdquo; Echoing Trump's rhetoric, Vought implicitly endorsed the false claim of a stolen 2020 election and likened the media's debunkings of that claim to Chinese Communist propaganda. 'In the aftermath of the election, we had all these people going around saying, &lsquo;Well, I don't see any evidence of voter fraud. The media's not giving enough [of] a compelling case,'&rdquo; he said. 'Well, that compelling case has emerged. But does a Christian in China ask and come away saying, &lsquo;You know, there's no persecution, because I haven't read about it in the state regime press?' No, they don't.&rdquo; Vought referred to the people detained for alleged crimes committed on Jan. 6, 2021, as 'political prisoners&rdquo; and defended the lawyers Jeffrey Clark and John Eastman, who have both faced criminal charges for their role in Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Federal law enforcement agencies, he added, 'are keeping political opponents in jail, and I think we need to be honest about that.&rdquo; The left, Vought continued, has the ultimate goal of ending representative democracy altogether. 'The stark reality in America is that we are in the late stages of a complete Marxist takeover of the country,&rdquo; he said, 'in which our adversaries already hold the weapons of the government apparatus, and they have aimed it at us. And they are going to continue to aim it until they no longer have to win elections.&rdquo; When Democrats called Trump an 'existential threat to democracy,&rdquo; they were not merely calling for his defeat at the ballot box, he said, but were using 'coded language the national security state uses overseas when they are overthrowing other governments&rdquo; to discourage the military from putting down anti-Trump protests should he win. 'They're making Trump out to be a would-be dictator or an authoritarian,&rdquo; he said. 'So they're actively working now to ensure, on a number of levels, that the military will perceive this as dictatorial and therefore not respond to any orders to quell any violence.&rdquo; Trump, Vought insisted, has the credibility and the track record to defeat the 'Marxist&rdquo; left and bring about the changes that Vought and his MAGA allies seek. In his view, the Democratic Party's agenda and its 'quiet revolution&rdquo; could be stopped only by a 'radical constitutionalist,&rdquo; someone in the mold of Thomas Jefferson or James Madison. For Vought, no one was in a better position to fill that role than Trump.

The D Brief: Israel strikes in Iran; Russia advances in Ukraine; ...	Nearly 100 Israeli jets carried out a series of daring airstrikes inside Iran early Saturday, ending nearly four weeks of suspense following Iran's October 1 missile attack on Israel, which featured at least 180 ballistic missiles. The Israeli strikes were conducted in three waves, and 'targeted around 20 locations around Tehran and western Iran, including vital air defense assets and facilities tied to the Iranian drone and missile programs,&rdquo; according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. The strikes killed four Iranian soldiers, 'presumably at the air defense sites that the [Israeli jets] struck,&rdquo; ISW reports. One target included a solid-propellant rocket motor plant in Parchin, southeast of Tehran. The facilities were inaugurated just three years ago, according to researcher Fabian Hinz of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, based in London. 'Targeted buildings appear to be related to propellant mixing and casting,&rdquo; which suggests 'Israel targeted a critical bottleneck in the missile production process (similar to its previous campaigns against missile production infrastructure in Syrian and Lebanon),&rdquo; Hinz wrote Saturday on social media. The Iranians had also used the Parchin facilities 'for high explosives testing in support of its nuclear weapons program,&rdquo; according to ISW. One suspected consequence: 'The mixers are highly sophisticated equipment that Iran cannot produce on its own and must purchase from China,&rdquo; which could take several months, Israeli officials told Axios. Other targets included a radar installation and an alleged drone factory. In photos: The Associated Press published post-strike satellite imagery from Planet Labs on Sunday. Review those images, here. Tactical note: 'The IDF struck several locations in Iraq and Syria...likely targeting early warning radars and sensors that would have given Iran advanced notice,&rdquo; ISW writes. 'Iran has in recent years worked to build an early detection network across Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon in order to better defend against Israeli airstrikes,&rdquo; the think note explained. The Israelis also destroyed four Russian-made S-300 air defense batteries inside Iran, which are 'the most advanced air defense system that Iran operates,&rdquo; ISW reported. Why that matters: 'Russia's traditional customers have lost faith in the country's defense industry and are looking for new suppliers,&rdquo; Singapore-based researcher Ian Storey told the Wall Street Journal. Relatedly, 'Moscow's foreign weapons sales fell 52% last year from 2022,&rdquo; according to researchers in Stockholm, who predicted (PDF) this past March that 'Russian arms exports are likely to remain well below the level reached in 2014-18, for at least the short term.&rdquo; According to the White House, 'The President and his national security team, of course, worked with the Israelis over recent weeks to encourage Israel to conduct a response that was targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm, and that appears to have been precisely what transpired this evening,&rdquo; U.S. officials said after the Israeli strikes. 'Should Iran choose to respond, we are fully prepared to once again defend against any attack,&rdquo; the official said. Big-picture consideration: 'Israel remains in control of the escalation and could decide to press home its advantage,&rdquo; writes Emile Hokayem of IISS. 'Israeli officials believe that the country's operational competence and success on the battlefield will overcome whatever political and moral qualms the Americans, Europeans and Arabs have about its conduct of these wars,&rdquo; he added. Meanwhile, Israeli 'defence planners are probably putting more ideas on the table,&rdquo; said Hokayem. 'But, like the Iranians, Netanyahu should beware the seductions of hubris,&rdquo; he warned.

He added, 'One reason why the Russian Central Bank struggles to control inflation is that interest rates hardly influence the ruble exchange rate. Before 2022, higher rates would lead to a stronger ruble, leading to lower prices in Russia. This doesn't work anymore due to war & sanctions.&rdquo; However, none of this means Vladimir Putin is at all interested in slowing his Ukraine invasion, Kluge noted Friday as well.

China's deepening telecoms hack sparks DHS probe	A key cybersecurity review panel will investigate a Chinese infiltration into U.S. telecom networks and affiliated wiretap infrastructure, the Department of Homeland Security said Sunday, escalating a federal probe into breaches that have targeted government officials and presidential campaign staff. The Cyber Safety Review Board, established by the Biden administration in 2022 to find the causes of major cybersecurity events, 'will initiate a review of this incident at the appropriate time,&rdquo; a DHS spokesperson said in an email. The Wall Street Journal first reported the panel's decision. It's not clear when the probe would start, but it would likely take months before public findings from the analysis are released. The Chinese state-backed hacking collective, dubbed Salt Typhoon, penetrated the networks of AT&T, Verizon, Lumen and around 10 others, and for months was likely inside systems that facilitate court-authorized wiretap requests, according to reports that first surfaced last month. The network of affected individuals has expanded since U.S. investigators began scrutinizing the incident just weeks ago. The hackers have attempted to access the phone communications of presidential campaign officials, including former president Donald Trump and running mate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, the New York Times reported Friday. The hackers have also hoovered up audio communications from U.S. political figures, including a Trump campaign advisor, the Washington Post reported Sunday. Salt Typhoon also had access to victims' unencrypted messages, added the report, which cited people familiar with the matter. At least one U.S. official was notified that hackers had accessed their personal phone. The targeting was bipartisan in nature. Staff of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and staff on Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign were also hit. 'Agencies across the U.S. government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial communications sector,&rdquo; the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said Friday. The break-ins into the wiretap request systems may have compromised some of the most sensitive national security data on U.S. surveillance targets, and have raised questions about the security architecture of the backdoor installations enabled by a 30-year-old surveillance law whose oversight falls heavily on the private sector and third-party compliance providers. 'If you want to know what diplomats are thinking, it's in their email, it's in their texts. And that's the kind of stuff that I think people have always targeted,&rdquo; Kevin Mandia, who founded the eponymously named threat intelligence firm Mandiant, told Nextgov/FCW earlier this month. It remains uncertain whether other surveillance systems, such as those governed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, were penetrated in the hacks. Data from those networks could provide Beijing with insights into U.S. overseas intelligence targets. The espionage operation likely began months ago. In early September, DHS policy undersecretary Rob Silvers said the Cyber Safety Review Board would announce an investigation 'soon&rdquo; but did not specify any further details. CSRB's review was long anticipated to focus on this past summer's CrowdStrike-enabled IT outages or the 2020 SolarWinds Orion hack, the latter of which motivated establishment of the board. In April, CSRB penned a critical report about Microsoft's security posture that enabled a separate band of Chinese hackers to access the email inboxes of top U.S. officials around summertime last year. The telecommunications espionage marks China as now the second major foreign adversary to have explicitly compromised the data and communications of 2024 presidential campaign entities, after Iranian state-affiliated hackers this past summer nabbed Trump campaign documents and floated them to media outlets with hope that they'd be published online. Individuals behind those hacks were charged by the Justice Department last month. The infiltrations are 'really concerning,&rdquo; former NSA director Gen. Paul Nakasone said in an interview. 'The scope and the scale of allegedly being in American telecommunications companies &mdash; that's a different ballgame,&rdquo; he said. 'I think the follow on question now is, okay, what are we doing about it?&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/dhs-cyber-review-board-investigate-chinese-hack-us-telecom-victim-net-widens/400606/	2024-10-28T07:28:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/28/102824telecommNG-1/large.jpg
China’s chip chokepoints	Earlier this year, American investigators were tipped off about a plan to ship semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China. The alarm was sounded after two Chicago-based buyers of a Dynatex DTX-MDB 150 'scribe and break' machine asked the California manufacturer to file export paperwork that omitted the machine's final destination: Chengdu GaStone Technology Company, a firm in southwest China under U.S. sanction for an illegal 2021 scheme to purchase military-grade integrated circuits. In April, Lin Chen was arrested and charged while Han Li escaped to China. The case illuminates the complex U.S.-China competition to produce ever-more-advanced chips. CGTC sought the Dynatex machine to handle a final step in making military-grade gallium arsenide chips, which can better withstand extreme temperatures and radiation than ordinary silicon devices. Had they succeeded, the Chengdu firm could have improved their chip-manufacturing 'success rate' and therefore their ability to meet customer demand&mdash;including from China's military. While companies such as SMIC have turned China into a chip-manufacturing powerhouse, the country remains unable to mass-produce the most advanced chips on its own. Despite massive government investment, China continues to rely on foreign companies for the chips that power everything from the AI revolution to the internet of things to the most advanced military equipment. This problem remains a huge vulnerability for China's economy, its military, and its global ambitions. Commentators inside China identify advanced chips as one of the 'chokepoint&rdquo; technologies that keep the country from technological parity with the world's most advanced economies. In 2018, the government's S&T Daily publication named 35 such technologies, most in the fields of information technology, electronics, manufacturing, biotech, and new-energy vehicles. Eight of these chokepoints related to the design and manufacture of advanced chips, casting doubt on the country's ability to produce such chips anytime soon. Western leverage While China's struggle is hardly secret, few stop to think about what exactly it means, why it is so difficult to overcome&mdash;and what leverage it might give U.S. and allied governments. To paraphrase Boromir, one does not simply insert silicon into one end of a machine and wait for an advanced chip to emerge from the other. Producing these chips is a complex, multi-stage process. And each stage, in turn, provides numerous avenues for U.S. and allied governments to apply pressure on China's efforts at its own advanced chip production. Before the chips can even be manufactured, they must be designed. This necessitates the use of electronic design automation software, which brings order to the billions of transistors that go into a modern chip, a task impossible for human engineers to accomplish on their own. Here lies China's first chokepoint. Chinese-made EDA software from companies such as Beijing Empyrean and Primarius Technologies can handle analog designs and simpler IoT applications but appear unable to compete at the high end. Thus, the Chinese market for this specialized software is dominated by the three largest U.S. developers: Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens EDA, who collectively hold 90 percent of the PRC market. In 2022, the U.S. Commerce Department placed export controls on the most advanced versions of this software, which is needed to design top-of-the-line 3nm chips. Next, raw materials must be turned into the silicon wafers that will eventually become chips. Silicon is extracted from sand, refined to 99.9999999% purity, melted, and fashioned into a single-crystal ingot. This ingot, called a 'boule,&rdquo; is sliced into thin wafers and polished to create an ultra-flat, mirror-like surface. To achieve the extraordinary nanometer-level smoothness that is required, ultra-precise polishing equipment is needed. Herein lies a second chokepoint: China appears to lack companies that can produce this equipment, although their research is showing some promising results. The leading manufacturers are in the U.S. and Germany. In 2020, the U.S. government slapped export controls on the most advanced versions of this equipment. Once the wafers are ready, one side is coated with a light-sensitive chemical called photoresist to prepare it for photolithography. Production of this chemical is a third chokepoint. 'Extreme ultraviolet&rdquo; photoresist is needed for the densest chips below 20nm, and this market is dominated by Japanese companies bound by strict export-control policies. Even South Korean and Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers depend on Japan's advanced resists. Chinese companies make less-advanced photoresists, which are in high demand worldwide for manufacturing inexpensive commodity chips such as those found in automobiles and consumer products. But their products are insufficient for leading-edge devices. Chinese firms such as Jingrui, Red Avenue, and its subsidiary Beijing Kempur, a U.S.-China joint venture, are pouring research into making advanced photoresists. This will not be easy, because older photoresist chemicals based on bis-azide photoresists cannot create circuits below two micrometers (2,000 nanometers). Further, the most advanced core technologies, including fine-particle filtering for new chemicals such as fullerenes (a zero-dimension carbon nanomaterial for high-resolution photoresists) may not be exported from the U.S. and its allies to China without a license. Next, the light-sensitive wafers are sent through a photolithography machine, which projects light through a series of reticles to produce microscopic circuit patterns. Herein lies yet another chokepoint. The most advanced machines, manufactured by Dutch company ASML, have more than 100,000 parts and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. They have carried a 'presumption of denial&rdquo; in the export application process led by Washington since 2022. While China manufactures huge amounts of less advanced chips, it remains incapable of reproducing the complex photolithography machinery needed for the most advanced devices. Based on past performance, the prospects for quickly catching up with the world's photolithography industry leaders are not good: China has striven to do so since the 1980s and has historically been a decade or two behind. China's leading producer, SMIC, can reportedly make 28nm chips, far from the global leading edge of 2 to 3nm. And while China is reportedly now producing a 7nm chip for the latest Huawei smartphone, this is believed to use a less advanced and less efficient form of lithography from a machine acquired from ASML before U.S. controls went into effect. SMIC's success rate for chips on each wafer may be low and commercially unacceptable, keeping costs high and production limited. And Washington is trying to further restrict sales and service of the lithography machines SMIC used to make them. There are almost certainly other chokepoints buried in the intricate process that produces modern semiconductors, perhaps in the stages of etching, ion implantation, metal deposition, dicing, and final assembly and testing. For instance, Chen and Li's efforts in Chicago indicate that China depends on foreign 'scribe and break&rdquo; machines to dice military-grade gallium arsenide chips, making this yet another potential chokepoint not named in S&T Daily's 2018 list. The multiple chokepoints China must contend with provide a dual picture. They show the difficulties it faces in its quest for world-class chips. Meanwhile, they show how Washington's efforts to keep cutting-edge semiconductor technology out of China have achieved some successes, but still face significant hurdles. Export controls have only been partly updated since the Cold War and rely on a network of nations and companies. The United States needs a new multilateral export regime powered by consensus among key partners that make semiconductor manufacturing tools, many of whom would prefer to continue selling to China at some level. China will continue to improve its chip-making through overt and covert means, for the one certainty about the future of the economy and warfare is that they will be powered by semiconductors. The question is where those technologies will come from, and how much volume in chips and equipment clandestine actors can manage to smuggle to China.

US efforts to protect democracy in Europe could fade under Trump	The Oct. 20 election in Moldova went off successfully&mdash;despite record Russian attempts to disrupt it&mdash;because of U.S. efforts to help, U.S. and Moldovan officials said this week. Such efforts could be imperiled should Donald Trump return to office. Last Sunday, more than one and a half million Moldovans took to the polls and narrowly passed a referendum to join the European Union, an outcome Russian President Vladimir Putin worked hard to prevent. 'Every single tool from the Soviet hybrid-war toolbox was used&rdquo; to undermine the outcome Viorel Ursu, Moldova's ambassador to the United States, said this week during a CSIS event. 'There are armies of online trolls and call centers that were established to spread deepfake videos and false information about the EU, about selling land to Europeans or hosting immigrants from Europe.&rdquo; Russia also 'created an elaborate Ponzi scheme&rdquo; to buy votes, a scam that poor Moldovans were particularly vulnerable to, Ursu said. He said other Russian efforts included 'training of young adults on conducting cyber actions and provoking violence during protests&hellip;engaging criminal groups, including foreigners, to disrupt the work of public offices in order to provoke a sense of fear and mistrust, constant bomb alerts that took resources from investigating the deeds of these criminal groups, paying religious community leaders to engage in political campaigning.' Such efforts laid bare Russia's determination to 'undermine its democracy in a truly unprecedented fashion,&rdquo; said Christopher Smith, the State Department's deputy assistant secretary for Eastern Europe and policy and regional affairs. So why did the effort not succeed? One huge factor, said Ursu, was U.S. help&mdash;millions of dollars in aid, cybersecurity training, and more&mdash;all to build up the country's resilience to attacks. 'The European Union and the U.S. partners here, the State Department, and particularly USAID, have been on on our side, on reinforcing that infrastructure&hellip;of the electoral process,&rdquo; he said. The scale of the Kremlin's effort was unprecedented: 6.5 million attacks between December and May alone, a top USAID official said. All aimed to disrupt the electoral process directly or indirectly, targeting government actors, journalists, and elements of infrastructure, said Mark Simakovsky, deputy assistant administrator of USAID's Bureau for Europe and Eurasia. 'It continues to grow, and it grew as we approached the election and even on election day,&rdquo; Simakovsky said. 'Moldova's digital infrastructure, including the site of the presidency, came under attack.&rdquo; To counter those attacks, he said, USAID worked for months to 'really ramp up our assistance&rdquo; in various ways, such as sharing intelligence about Russian cyber actors, training a cyber workforce, and providing cybersecurity tools. Smith said the United States also helps protect Moldovan elections by sanctioning pro-Russian operators such as the fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, 'All of these cyber attacks, all of these trolls, all of these bots require money. Russia can field these instruments because they use Ilan Shor's network of influence in order to support these campaigns. And throughout this year, we have leveled sanctions against multiple elements of Ilan Shor's network,&rdquo; he said. Moldova is hardly the only Russian neighbor under stress. In Georgia, which will hold parliamentary elections on Saturday, the rise of the pro-Kremlin Georgia Dream party Is beginning to bend the country to Putin's will. Western observers say a 'foreign agent&rdquo; law passed in May is modeled closely after a Russian law used to crush dissent. The law, which targets aid and non-governmental organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from foreign sources, is used to target pro-Western dissident groups and complicate Georgia's ascension into the European Union more difficult, they said. What does that have to do with Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate? As president, he repeatedly pushed to slash foreign aid, particularly through agencies like USAID. To the extent that the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 accurately reflects his agenda, foreign aid would face sweeping changes and a change in focus away from Europe toward the Pacific. Perhaps most importantly, Trump has both denied and welcomed Russian interference in U.S. elections and even briefly proposed to establish a joint Russian-U.S. cybersecurity project. And given Trump's vocal support for pro-Kremlin strongmen in Europe such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, it's unlikely he would find much urgency to help fledgling democracies protect themselves from Russian meddling.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/us-efforts-protect-democracy-europe-could-fade-under-trump/400585/	2024-10-25T16:06:07-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/25/GettyImages_1152460422/large.jpg
The D Brief: Musk, Putin talk; Trump’s record; Houthis’ satellite...	The rich man and the despot: Elon Musk has been in secretive contact with Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the past two years, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday (gift link). The private talks between the world's richest man and the world's most nuclear-armed autocrat reportedly 'raise potential national-security concerns&rdquo; among U.S. officials since conversation topics have included denying Taiwan access to Musk's Starlink service ('as a favor to Chinese leader Xi Jinping&rdquo;) and Musk has blocked Ukraine from using certain Starlink terminals in its defense against Russia's full-scale invasion. Recall that 'Musk has forged deep business ties with U.S. military and intelligence agencies, giving him unique visibility into some of America's most sensitive space programs,&rdquo; the Journal notes. For example, 'SpaceX, which operates the Starlink service, won a $1.8 billion classified contract in 2021 and is the primary rocket launcher for the Pentagon and NASA.&rdquo; Musk's duplicity doesn't end there: 'Through the first months of the year, Musk said he would refrain from backing any presidential candidate while at the same time holding private conversations discussing how he could get Trump elected,&rdquo; the Journal reminds readers. But that changed in July when Musk endorsed Trump and began campaigning on his behalf&mdash;an effort that has since morphed into a possibly illegal scheme of handing out millions of dollars to incentivize citizens in battleground states to vote so long as they sign a Trump-aligned pledge. Trump is also alleged to have been in contact with the Russian despot. Citing a Trump aide, journalist Bob Woodward reported in a new book that there have been 'maybe as many as seven&rdquo; conversations between Trump and Putin since the former left office in 2021. For details on Musk's contract with, and influence over, the federal government, see this New York Times report from earlier in the week. Musk has been doing Trump's work in the online information space this year, too. That includes spreading misleading claims about immigration and conspiracies about alleged voter fraud, which are his most popular topics to tweet about, according to an analysis of Musk's writing on X published Thursday by Bloomberg. The analysis covers more than 13 years of Musk's posts, which changed noticeably as the election season got underway in 2024. And as November 5 has gotten closer, 'Musk's effort to popularize his views on voting and migrants has become relentless &mdash; and more effective in terms of engagement,&rdquo; Bloomberg reports. Why it matters: 'In Musk, the former president has found an influential ally who is willing to launder a false conspiracy theory for the masses, helping lay the groundwork for Trump to once again dispute the results of next month's election, should they not be in his favor, according to Melissa Ryan, founder of CARD Strategies, a consulting firm that researches disinformation.&rdquo; But perhaps most importantly, 'as the most-followed account on X, Musk is the platform's single most important influencer,&rdquo; and 'He is still the most widely read person on the site today,&rdquo; Bloomberg reports. Read over the full analysis (gift link), here. Reminder: If re-elected, 'Donald Trump says he will order mass deportations, use soldiers against citizens, prosecute his enemies, abandon allies, and play politics with disasters,&rdquo; the New York Times Editorial Board writes in a multimedia presentation published Friday. 'Believe him,&rdquo; the editorial board cautions. 'The record shows that Mr. Trump often pursues his stated goals, regardless of how plainly they lack legal or moral grounding,&rdquo; they write. In contrast to his first term, 'Trump has learned from that experience to surround himself with supplicants who would instead obey his wishes and bring his words and ideas to life even if they contradict facts, the public interest or the Constitution.&rdquo; Using his own words, the board encourages readers to 'take the painful step of imagining America were his plans and promises to come to pass, to imagine the impacts to our culture, to our economy, to our security, to our shared commitment to the rule of law.&rdquo; Dive in (gift link), here.

North Korean soldiers are expected to begin arriving in Ukraine 'combat zones&rdquo; as early as Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy said Friday, citing intelligence officials. 'North Korea's actual involvement in combat should not be met with indifference or uncertain commentary, but with tangible pressure on both Moscow and Pyongyang, to uphold the UN Charter and to hold them accountable for this escalation,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said. The first tranche of North Korean troops arrived in Russia's western Kursk region Wednesday, Ukrainian intelligence officials claimed the following day. 'North Korea has transferred roughly 12,000 North Korean personnel, including 500 officers and three generals, to Russia and that Russian Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Yunus-Bek Yevkurov is responsible for overseeing the training and adaptation of the North Korean military personnel,&rdquo; the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War wrote in its Thursday assessment, citing Ukraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate. South Korea's military chief described the North Korean troops as 'mere cannon fodder mercenaries.&rdquo; North Korea's soldiers are 'being disguised with a Russian uniform and acting under Russian military command without any operational authority,&rdquo; Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun told parliamentarians Thursday in Seoul.

Problems with a German railroad contract slowed US munitions to U...	U.S. shipments of ammunition to Ukraine were delayed for at least two months last year because of problems with a U.S. military contract with Germany's Deutsche Bahn railways, according to a Defense Department Inspector General report. The 'multiple delays&rdquo; happened between December 2022 and January 2023, according to the report, around the same time Ukraine began to run out of U.S.-supplied ammunition&mdash;making it one of several instances in which U.S. aid shortfalls have affected the Ukrainian military since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The report was released to Defense One on Thursday in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. In at least one instance, 'no rail service was available to transport the ammunition.&rdquo; The problem was eventually solved by chartering boats to deliver it instead, at a cost of $1.6 million to the United States. The IG report said the delays were caused by the U.S. European Command agreement with Deutsche Bahn failing to account for some criteria or factor, but the specifics of the deficiency are redacted. [[Related Posts]] Another section of the report says the agreement 'does not contain any requirement for Deutsche Bahn,&rdquo; to take some action, but the nature of the action is redacted. The wording suggests that Deutsche Bahn denied the military's request for some kind of service. Germany's federal government owns Deutsche Bahn, which is Germany' largest rail provider. Without a revised agreement, future delays that would be 'disruptive to the flow of critical ammunition to Ukraine,&rdquo; could still occur, the report said. When the report was published in July 2023, the military had not yet fixed its agreement with Deutsche Bahn. The report also recommended that European Command investigate other means of shipping ammunition to Ukraine. European Command's deputy director for logistics agreed with the recommendation to review the military's agreement with Deutsche Bahn and enact any necessary changes. And the command agreed with the report's call to find other shipping options, saying it would look at other seaports and logistics. Germany's rail network's ability to move military goods is hampered by extensive bureaucracy, too little investment in infrastructure, and not enough flat-bed wagons for military goods, according to a June report by the German Council on Foreign Relations. Military shipments also must compete with commercial goods, the report noted. While the Germany military signed a 2023 agreement to reserve 343 flat wagons, Deutsche Bahn Cargo would struggle to do more because of commercial transport reservations, it said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/problems-german-railroad-contract-slowed-us-munitions-ukraine-ig-says/400551/	2024-10-24T16:36:13-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/24/Screenshot_2024_10_24_at_1.35.17PM/large.png
Northrop expecting next B-21 production award by end of the year	Northrop Grumman anticipates getting a second contract to continue producing the Pentagon's new B-21 Raider by the end of the year, executives announced today. 'With B-21, we are on track for meeting the milestones associated with an award&rdquo; for Low-Rate Initial Production Contract 2, or LRIP 2 'and so we are expecting that to happen in the fourth quarter,&rdquo; CEO Kathy Warden told investors during the company's third-quarter earnings call Thursday. Warden didn't say how many planes the contract would cover. But it would be the second of five annual LRIPs that are expected to total 21 aircraft&mdash;and to cost the company a total of $1.2 billion, she has said, blaming the losses on inflation, supply-chain problems, and the company's commitment to a fixed-price contract before they had a mature design. The Air Force expects to pay roughly $780 million per LRIP aircraft&mdash;officially, $550 million per plane in 2010 dollars&mdash;based on its overall plan to buy at least 100 Raiders. Northrop executives say the program will eventually be profitable. The company has negotiated a higher cost ceiling for the 19 aircraft that will follow the first 21. [[Related Posts]] The service doesn't plan to buy more than 100 Raiders&mdash;although some think tankers argue that it should&mdash;since the future may bring new and improved technology, officials say. The service is taking another look at all of its next-gen plans, as previous concepts of air superiority and adversary capabilities have changed. Said Warden, 'They are undertaking a force structure design review and the [Air Force] Secretary has been open about looking at the various options they have for increasing their force size, and has talked specifically about NGAD, and we know that B-21 is in the mix as well. It would be premature for me to suggest where that force structure review will end up, but I do think in the coming months, we may get a better indication from the Air Force as to how they're thinking about B-21 quantities in the long run.&rdquo; In the meantime, flight testing and production are moving along well, Warden said. 'The B-21 program has also made solid progress in achieving ground and flight testing milestones on the development contract, and is continuing to execute the aircraft production contract in line with our estimates,&rdquo; she said. Last month, Northrop said it has three aircraft in test, two for ground testing and one for flight testing, and has been able to conduct flight tests twice a week.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/northrop-expecting-next-b-21-production-award-end-year/400526/	2024-10-24T11:31:47-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/24/Screenshot_2024_10_24_at_8.30.09AM/large.png
The D Brief: US confirms N. Korean deployment; WH’s natsec AI mem...	After nearly two weeks of warnings from Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence officials, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed Wednesday 'there is evidence that there are [North Korean] troops in Russia.&rdquo; Ukraine's president claimed last week at least 10,000 North Koreans will be helping Russia fight Ukrainian troops, possibly in and around Russia's Kursk region, bordering Ukraine. On Tuesday, President Zelenskyy said that number could be as high as 12,000 spread across two brigades. South Korean intelligence officials said Friday the North Koreans began their journey on October 8, beginning with 1,500 or so traveling via 'four amphibious landing ships and three escort vessels owned by Russia,&rdquo; according to Yonhap news agency. White House officials said Wednesday at least 3,000 North Korean soldiers traveled to eastern Russia for military training earlier this month. 'We assess that these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wonsan area in North Korea to Vladivostok,&rdquo; National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby told reporters. 'We do not yet know whether these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military, but this is certainly a highly concerning probability,&rdquo; Kirby said. 'If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they're fair targets, and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they are defending themselves against Russian soldiers,&rdquo; Kirby told reporters. Russian leader Vladimir Putin 'may be even in more trouble than most people realize,&rdquo; Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin told reporters Wednesday. Referring to the North Korean soldiers, Austin said, 'If they're co-belligerents, if their intention is to participate in this war on Russia's behalf, that is a very, very serious issue, and it will have impacts not only in Europe. It will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific as well.&rdquo; Mapped: See the path North Koreans are believed to be traveling to training sites inside Russia via this graphic published Wednesday by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Expert reax: 'In addition to sending 8 million rounds of 122 millimeter (mm) and 152mm munitions and scores of ballistic missiles, North Korea is now providing the ultimate sign of an alliance commitment in the spirit of the renewed mutual defense treaty signed by the two leaders in June 20,&rdquo; Victor Cha of CSIS wrote in an explainer Wednesday. 'It's unclear whether these are technicians or combat troops,&rdquo; he cautioned. But 'Either way, this makes DPRK the most visible and committed supporter of Russia's aggression in Europe,&rdquo; he said. Worth noting: 'Thus far, China's reaction to North Korea's support of Russia has been caught somewhere between paralysis and incompetence, lacking either the political will or policy ingenuity to create disincentives for either party,&rdquo; said Cha. 'For one, China does not like Russia to have so much influence over the North,&rdquo; he said. 'In addition, if the longer-term ramifications of this cooperation lead to greater DPRK capabilities that invite even more U.S. military presence and allied capabilities in China's region, that does not benefit China.&rdquo; More on Ukraine after the jump...

Update: The White House won't greenlight long-range strikes inside Russia, and for reasons that have been known for months&mdash;including Russia's movement of equipment out of the range of relevant U.S.-provided weapons (ATACMS, in particular) as well as the unpredictability of second-order effects from nuclear-armed Moscow, Fox's Jacqui Heinrich reported Wednesday afternoon, citing a U.S. official. This week in data: Russia's military has used at least 36 types of missiles to attack Ukraine, CSIS researchers Benjamin Jensen and Yasir Atalan reported Wednesday. 'This diversity reflects an operational approach to firepower strikes of combining different models like long-range attack drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles to complicate the ability of Ukraine to defend its skies. Of note, many of these unique combinations were launched from different geographic sites further complicating air defense.&rdquo; That would seem to suggest 'The United States and its partners need to do more to curb the ability of [Iran, China, and North Korea] to replenish Russia's arsenal,&rdquo; they warn. What's more, 'An overall intercept rate of 79.8 percent suggests effective defense mechanisms in place,&rdquo; but 'Keeping this intercept rate high will require continued Western support for Ukraine.&rdquo; Read on, here.

That's why so many of the most notable military and national security leaders of the past two decades of war have recently broken with long tradition to publicly warn that he is manifestly unfit to serve again as commander-in-chief. No fewer than 741 former high-ranking national security and military leaders&mdash;including 233 general and flag officers, 15 four-star generals, and 10 former service secretaries&mdash;recently signed a letter endorsing Kamala Harris for president.

New AUKUS experiment shows how allies with autonomy will speed up...	U.S., Australian, British, and Japanese defense officials converged on Australia's Jervis Bay this week for a weeklong experiment to test how to integrate new, developmental tech from different countries in order to speed up intelligence and reconnaissance data transmission at sea. The results: 'Things that would have taken perhaps months were taking place minutes in terms of common operating pictures,&rdquo; one senior defense official told reporters. The so-called Maritime Big Play exercise is part of the broader AUKUS partnership between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The first pillar of AUKUS focuses on the co-development of a nuclear-powered submarine, while the second pillar involves co-development and deployment of emerging technologies like autonomous drones. Madeline Mortelmans, the current acting assistant defense secretary for strategy, plans and capabilities, told reporters Wednesday that progress on AUKUS pillar II is already changing the way the allies think about joint operations and fielding new technologies. 'We're advancing our undersea warfare capabilities by expanding our ability to launch to and recover uncrewed underwater systems from the torpedo tubes on current classes of British and U.S. submarines,&rdquo; she said. 'That will increase the range and capability of our undersea forces. We're integrating the [BAE] Sting Ray lightweight torpedo into the P-8A maritime patrol aircraft, which will support our forces in being more interchangeable while providing resilience to munitions stockpiles across AUKUS nations.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] The experimentation in Jervis Bay served as a showcase for a lot of new drone tech and other systems, both in the water and above, from across the alliance. 'Much of the gear that was brought to the party was from the partners,&rdquo; one official said. Some of the systems the United States brought include the GARC unmanned surface boat, the Vanilla long-endurance UAV, and the Ocean Aero underwater and surface vessel (Triton.) 'This was all industry. We had 30 different systems, from the sea bed to the stratosphere, involved here,&rdquo; an official said. The experiments tested how well the systems and the militaries could collect and disseminate intelligence and data. 'The testing and experimentation was driven by specific scenarios. So think of the need to use a mix of uncrewed and crewed assets to do very large area [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] for example, and to maintain a common operating picture,&rdquo; an official said. Another focus of the experiment was to identify how allies could modify or develop specific tactics, techniques and procedures to allow for faster data and intelligence sharing across the alliance&mdash;and to do so from the wide array of drones and other assets. 'We demonstrated not only the systems&hellip; but also how we would employ those systems. So the specific TTPs that will help us do that more effectively, that will accelerate our adoption, and then further it helps us understand how we would do it together, through connecting and communicating and command and controlling the devices,&rdquo; another official said. Japanese officials attended the briefings this week, as the AUKUS nations are considering closer collaboration with Japan in these areas. One former senior defense official told Defense One, 'Integrating increasingly autonomous capabilities is critical to the future success of all three navies.&rdquo; The experiment 'provides a unique platform for experimentation to ensure each country benefits from the advances of the other, helping the AUKUS partners scale better than future capabilities faster,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/new-aukus-experiment-shows-how-allies-autonomy-will-speed-naval-operations/400513/	2024-10-24T04:30:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/24/Screenshot_2024_10_23_at_11.39.49PM/large.png
White House signs national security memo on AI	President Joe Biden will issue a new national security memorandum today on artificial intelligence, aimed at helping the U.S. government deploy AI and retain its advantage over China. The United States must 'ensure that our national security agencies are adopting this technology in ways that align with our values,&rdquo; a senior White House official told reporters ahead of the unveiling. A failure to do so 'could put us at risk of a strategic surprise by our rivals, such as China,&rdquo; the official said. The memorandum provides guidance&mdash;via a framework&mdash;on how to employ AI for national security missions. 'These requirements require agencies to monitor, assess, and mitigate AI risks related to invasions of privacy, bias and discrimination, the safety of individuals and groups, and other human rights abuses,&rdquo; according to a fact sheet from the White House. The guidance will allow the government to take better advantage of the new AI tools coming out of Silicon Valley, the White House said. 'The innovation that's happened, particularly in this current wave of frontier artificial intelligence, has really been driven by the private sector, and it's critical that we continue to both foster that leadership,&rdquo; the official said. 'AI is rooted in the premise that capabilities generated by the transformer and large language model revolution in AI, often called frontier AI, are poised to shape geopolitical, military, and intelligence competition.&rdquo; There are still major concerns about applying those AI tools, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, to high-stakes areas like national security, given the propensity of such models to hallucinate and produce false positives. And the publicly available data sets those models are largely trained on can contain personal (but legally obtainable) personal information on U.S. civilians, as Defense One has reported. The national security community is 'well aware&rdquo; of the concerns, the official said. 'We have to go through a process of accrediting systems. And that's not just for AI systems, but, you know, national security systems generally,&rdquo; he said, pointing to Biden's previous executive order on AI and the establishment of the AI Safety Institute as two steps the White House has taken to mitigate AI risks, particularly in government use. The new memo designates the Commerce Department's AI Safety Institute as 'U.S. industry's primary port of contact in the U.S. government,&rdquo; according to the fact sheet. Those efforts join already existing Defense Department and Intelligence Community guidelines on AI development and deployment. The official agreed that the availability of U.S. citizens' data is a growing problem. 'We have been very concerned about the ways in which Americans' sensitive data can be sold, really through the front door, first collected in bulk, then sold through data brokers, and then end up in the hands of our adversaries. And so that's something that the President issued an executive order on [in February] to try to restrict adversary access to some of that data.&rdquo; But while the risks are real, the government still must establish a way for the national security community to 'experiment&rdquo; with AI through 'pilots,&rdquo; the official said. 'There are going to be challenges associated with adopting any new technology,&rdquo; they said. 'The framework&hellip;is one that's going to be continuously updated.&rdquo; And those updates may be subject to political disruption: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has vowed to repeal Biden's executive order on AI safety.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/white-house-signs-national-security-memo-ai/400512/	2024-10-24T03:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/24/GettyImages_1765529254/large.jpg
Heed the generals who call Trump unfit to lead	As a coda to two decades covering the post-9/11 conflicts as a correspondent, I wrote a book in 2021 profiling the 25 Medal of Honor recipients from the nation's longest wars. Theirs are stories of never surrendering despite harrowing odds, of facing death and finding the courage and faith not to be cowed, of wearing their profound scars&mdash;both physical as well as mental&mdash;like badges of honor. There is wisdom and warrior fierceness in those narratives, but also acts of profound tenderness and love. The common theme running throughout is troops united in a cause greater than themselves, caught in a brush with eternity and choosing to risk and even forfeit their own lives to save their brothers in arms. Their heroism and self-sacrifice is awe-inspiring, and explains why those privileged to lead them in combat consider these uniformed volunteers and their teammates America's 'New Greatest Generation.&rdquo; Donald Trump cannot fathom any of that. As if we needed reminding, the former and possibly future commander-in-chief continues to prove in the crudest terms imaginable that he views the U.S. military from a deep well of incomprehension, not as a sacred trust to be honored by any leader, but rather as an instrument of self-aggrandizement and brute force. That was the message behind Trump's recent description of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which he has bestowed on supporters and major campaign donors, as 'much better&rdquo; than the Medal of Honor, because service members who receive the nation's highest military honor have either 'been hit so many times by bullets, or they're dead.&rdquo; Militaries always have an irresistible allure to 'wannabe dictators,&rdquo; to borrow a phrase from Gen. Mark Milley, whom Trump appointed Joint Chiefs chairman. Trump has made no secret of his yearning to deploy the active force onto the streets of America to strike fear into his domestic political opponents, who he chillingly called 'the enemy from within&rdquo; in a recent Fox interview. He has also repeatedly telegraphed his intention to use the military to quell a supposed crime wave in Democratic-led cities, and to conduct the largest deportation in our nation's history of immigrants and 'radical left thugs&rdquo; that 'live like vermin&rdquo; inside the United States and are 'poisoning the blood of our country.&rdquo; Given Trump's Nazi-esque rhetoric, it's not surprising&mdash;yet still extraordinary&mdash;that his former chief of staff, retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, recently confirmed that Trump repeatedly praised Adolf Hitler's generals for their perceived blind loyalty, and wanted U.S. military leaders more in the mold of the German Wehrmacht under the Nazis. Nor is it surprising that Milley, now retired, has called his former boss the 'most dangerous person to this country&rdquo; and a 'fascist to the core.&rdquo; Decades of covering the U.S. military as a reporter taught me that even retired generals and admirals are instinctively resistant to engaging in partisan politics. They have been inculcated from their first days as cadets or newly minted lieutenants with the principle that the military must stay above the partisan fray in a democracy and submit to civilian authority. Their leaders know that the nonpartisan nature of the U.S. military helps explain why it has long remained the nation's most respected institution. I also know from talking with many of Milley's contemporaries, both on-the-record and privately, that they share his dire assessment, and genuinely fear for their country should Trump return to the Oval Office. That's why so many of the most notable military and national security leaders of the past two decades of war have recently broken with long tradition to publicly warn that he is manifestly unfit to serve again as commander-in-chief. No fewer than 741 former high-ranking national security and military leaders&mdash;including 233 general and flag officers, 15 four-star generals, and 10 former service secretaries&mdash;recently signed a letter endorsing Kamala Harris for president. They warn that Trump is 'too impulsive and ill-informed&rdquo; to entrust with the world's most powerful fighting force. Roughly half of my fellow citizens have chosen to ignore those warnings, and that is certainly their right. Before they vote, however, I hope they reconsider why the nation's guardians have chosen to break with tradition. Consider just one recent, revealing incident that was quickly buried beneath the media coverage of Trump's non-stop outrages and falsehoods. In August, Trump and the bully boys of his campaign pushed past an Army employee into the highly restricted Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery, the section largely reserved for the fallen of Afghanistan and Iraq, in order to illegally film a TikTok campaign video and snap a picture of the candidate with Gold Star Family members. Take a close look at that photograph of the former president grinning broadly and giving the thumbs-up over the graves of Marines who lost their lives in the Biden administration's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, and ask yourself: What must he have been thinking? Perhaps his thoughts were similar to the ones he expressed privately during a 2018 trip to France for the centennial anniversary of the end of World War I, when then-President Trump cancelled visits to cemeteries for America's fallen because he said they were filled with 'losers&rdquo; and 'suckers.&rdquo; Or perhaps his thoughts tracked with those Trump expressed to General Milley, who as JCS chairman had arranged for a severely wounded Army captain to sing at a ceremony for the president. 'Why do you bring people like that here?&rdquo; Trump reportedly asked Milley afterwards, before instructing him not to let the soldier appear in public again. 'No one wants to see that, the wounded.&rdquo; Trump has repeatedly shown that such blasphemy comes from a deep hollowness of character. How else to explain the then-president's casual cruelty during an earlier visit to Arlington National Cemetery, there supposedly to pay respects at gravesite No. 9480. It held the remains of a young Marine killed in action in Afghanistan: 1st Lt. Robert Michael Kelly, the son of Trump's soon-to-be chief of staff. 'I don't get it,&rdquo; Trump told the grieving Kelly. 'What was in it for them?&rdquo; Why young American men and women volunteered after 9/11&mdash;knowing they would be subjected to the horrors of war, running to the sound of guns as their fathers and uncles had in Vietnam, and their grandfathers had in Korea and World War II&mdash;was not something that could ever be explained to Donald Trump. Yet in his own grief, John Kelly, himself a retired four-star Marine general and decorated combat veteran, understood that his son Robert had already given the answer to the question of whether the cause was worth the sacrifice. 'In his mind&mdash;and in his heart&mdash;he had decided somewhere between the day he was born at 2130, 5 September 1981&mdash;and 0719, 9 November 2010&mdash;that it was worth it to him to risk everything&mdash;even his own life&mdash;in the service of his country,&rdquo; Kelly would later tell other grieving Gold Star families. 'So, in spite of the terrible emptiness that is in a corner of my heart and I now know will be there until I see him again, and the corners of the hearts of everyone who ever knew him, we are proud. So very proud. Was it worth his life? It's not for me to say. He answered the question for me.&rdquo; Before surrendering the fate of America's sons and daughters in uniform to the whims of an unstable commander-in-chief who simply cannot grasp the meaning of their devotion and sacrifice, I hope voters will listen to the actual patriots who have devoted their lives to our nation's defense. They know from experience that Trump will cozy up to autocratic strongmen and once again denigrate democratic allies, eroding the alliances that undergird America's global strength. They have never forgotten that on January 6, 2021, after inciting a violent mob that ransacked the citadel of our democracy on one of the darkest days in modern U.S. history, the former commander-in-chief was AWOL, watching the desecration on television for hours and breaking the chain of command at the top. They have heard him recently refer to that desecration as a 'day of love.&rdquo; Above all, they know that the hollowness and narcissism at Donald Trump's core masks a darkness that could eclipse what they and so many others have risked everything to defend. 'A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all &lsquo;suckers' because &lsquo;there is nothing in it for them,&rdquo; John Kelly said of his former boss in a blistering statement to CNN last year confirming many of Trump's outrageous comments, first reported and recently confirmed in The Atlantic. 'A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because &lsquo;it doesn't look good for me.' A person who demonstrated open contempt&hellip;for all Gold Star families&hellip;and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America's defense are &lsquo;losers,' and wouldn't visit their graves in France.&rdquo; 'A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about,&rdquo; Kelly continued in what amounted to a scream from the soul of a grieving father, and a dire warning from a renowned military leader afraid for his country. 'A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. 'There is nothing more than can be said,&rdquo; Kelly concluded. 'God help us.&rdquo; Amen.

Military must improve acquisition to win future wars, admiral say...	HONOLULU&mdash;The war in Ukraine shows how the United States must improve its acquisition process if it hopes to maintain military strength, the deputy commander of Pacific Fleet said Tuesday. Ukraine 'provides us a great example of the importance of rapid innovation and lightning-quick transition from the drawing board to the battlefield,&rdquo; Vice Adm. Blake Converse said during the opening keynote speech at AFCEA TechNet Indo-Pacific here. 'Ukrainians have perfected the rapid acquisition of technology for multi-domain combat operations. They have shown us that even without a robust military-industrial complex and infrastructure, we can integrate land, sea, air, space, cyber, and information.&rdquo; Ukraine's success in using unmanned vessels and missiles against the Russian Black Sea fleet is 'not just compelling, it's revolutionary,&rdquo; Converse said. Of course, the U.S. is not Ukraine, and the Pentagon's high-tech weapons 'weren't developed in a makerspace lab in Silicon Valley, they're the products of our acquisition systems,&rdquo; he said. 'Our imperative as a military must be to work with industry, to partner to foster innovation and to integrate emerging capabilities alongside our acquisition processes that exist today, but as fast as humanly possible.&rdquo; That speed is necessary to be prepared for 'a highly contested combat environment in the western Pacific,&rdquo; Converse said, adding that in addition to 'building capabilities, sensors, and weapons,&rdquo; the joint force must also 'massively upgrade our command-and-control systems and processes.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] That potential conflict would also require a highly resilient digital infrastructure in the region that could handle a huge influx in troops and requirements, said Marine Col. Jared Voneida, commander of DISA's Pacific field office. 'This what we're trying to build. We are looking for an infrastructure that's ready to go on day one of the fight, to absorb bandwidth increases from that joint force descending on this theater,&rdquo; Voneida said at the conference. Such a fight would be much different than the previous 20 years, Voneida said. 'Instead of deconflicting between one Marine unit and one Army unit located in the desert of Iraq, we're deconflicting globally across combatant commands. It's a global fight,&rdquo; he said. ' You need a global network. You need to be able to seamlessly move our data across, not just the Indo-Pacific theater, but the globe. Because that's where the fight is going to happen. Asked about the speed at which Ukrainians have rebuilt networks there, Voneida said the reason he believes having a 'robust, reliable, resilient, all the adjectives&rdquo; network ready before a conflict is critical is that expert technicians may not be able to physically access the infrastructure to rebuild over and over again during a war with China. 'If we can, great, I think we'll do exactly what's happening in Ukraine. If not, I think our goal is to have such a resilient network that we can gracefully degrade it as we go through the conflict,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/military-must-improve-acquisition-win-future-wars-admiral-says/400509/	2024-10-23T14:50:44-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/23/Screenshot_2024_10_23_at_11.49.15AM/large.png
Boeing will look to ‘do less and do better’: CEO	Boeing won't be able to fix its ailing defense arm, which lost $2 billion this quarter, anytime soon, but the company's CEO said Wednesday that its defense products are still core to the company. 'It's going to take a lot of work. We're not going to be able to just wave a wand and clean up these troubled contracts. We signed up to some things that are problematic,&rdquo; Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg told investors during the company's third-quarter earnings call&mdash;his first public comments since taking the job in August. Fixed-price development programs have been dragging down the company's defense arm, causing billions of dollars in losses. But Boeing couldn't walk away from these money-losing defense contracts 'even if we wanted to,&rdquo; Ortberg said. Instead, the company may consider cuts to other, non-core defense programs, he said. 'I think that we're better off doing less and doing it better than doing more and not doing it well, so we're in the process of taking an evaluation of the portfolio,&rdquo; Ortberg said. [[Related Posts]] What might Boeing cut? In the defense sector, it will likely keep its aircraft and weapons programs, and try to offload most, if not all, of its space program. But it's unclear if it could find buyers, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director for AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace consulting firm. 'This is a question of buyers, not willingness to sell,&rdquo; Aboulafia said. Sierra Space was at one point reportedly considering buying the joint Boeing-Lockheed rocket launch firm ULA, but the status of any such sale is still up in the air. Ortberg didn't offer a list of what the company might shed, but said, 'our core of commercial airplanes and defense systems are going to stay with the Boeing company for the long run, but there's probably some things on the fringe there that we can be more efficient with, or that just distract us from our main goal here.&rdquo; The company aims to finalize decisions on what stays and what goes by the end of the year, Ortberg said. In order to get the current defense programs on track and prepare for future contracts, the company needs to focus on the things it can control, Ortberg said, such as how they estimate the total cost of a project. 'We know how to run these programs. We just have lost a little bit of discipline. I don't think our people are close enough to the people in the labs, on the factory floor, identifying what's keeping us from being successful, and so, we've made some changes in that regard,&rdquo; Ortberg said. During the call, Boeing executives also confirmed previously disclosed losses on the defense side: $2 billion on the T-7 trainer, KC-46 tanker, Starliner spacecraft, and MQ-25 unmanned refueler. 'The magnitude of these losses expanded as we close the books, primarily reflecting higher estimated production costs on the T-7A program, mainly on contracts in 2026 and beyond, and an updated assessment of impacts on the KC-46A program associated with the IAM work stoppage and the decision to conclude production on the 767 freighter,&rdquo; CFO Brian West told investors. Boeing machinists have been striking for more than a month now in the Pacific Northwest, which is hitting the company's defense programs since those facilities also build the commercial-derived Air Force KC-46 tanker and Navy P-8 maritime aircraft. The workers will vote on a new contract Wednesday, just hours after Boeing released its earnings. During the earnings call, Ortberg said 'first and foremost&rdquo; the company has to end the IAM strike, and they've been 'feverishly working&rdquo; to find a solution. Following the start of the strike, Boeing announced it would cut 10% of its workforce, roughly 17,000 people. This dramatic cut was needed because Boeing is 'inefficient&rdquo; and has too much overhead, Ortberg said. 'I wouldn't think of it like we're going to take people off the production or out of the engineering labs. That's not our intent here. It's about getting ourselves more efficient and having a more lean and mean machine going forward, and I think that's going to be really important as we ramp up the production,&rdquo; he said. As the company attempts to position itself for the future, it's already started making leadership changes. Head of Boeing's defense sector Ted Colbert was pushed out in September, though the company has yet to announce his successor. Asked about the replacement, Ortberg wouldn't say whether they'd fill the spot with someone external or internal to the company, but said he's 'not averse to bringing in some additional resources to help the team, and I don't think the teams are averse to that as well.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/boeing-will-look-do-less-and-do-better-ceo/400500/	2024-10-23T13:03:48-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/23/GettyImages_2170865140/large.jpg
Army wargame to test cargo drones and live logistics data	In a future war, Army tanks growling around the battlefield may be able to send live data back to their headquarters showing every time they fire a round or burn a gallon of fuel. Using that data, logisticians back at the base might then send swarms of drones buzzing back to the tanks with new ammo, or guide fleets of drone boats laden with fuel to a beach somewhere. None of these ideas is ready for prime time yet &mdash; but the Army will test all three at Project Convergence this spring, according to Brig. Gen. Shane Upton, commander of the Contested Logistics Cross-Functional Team. Upton spoke to Defense One on the sidelines of the recent AUSA conference. Some of the work, like the tank-ammo project, consists of updating logistics for the modern era. Historically, Upton said, logisticians typically receive radio reports from units about how many rounds they have left, then add those numbers to an enormous spreadsheet by midnight each day. But that method is not flawless. A typing error could change 20 rounds to 200, he said. With logistics data updated only every 24 hours, meanwhile, a commander may make unrealistic plans based on a faulty understanding of their logistics. If soldiers in the tank can reliably send the data directly back to headquarters, by contrast, logisticians can keep a closer eye on usage rates and prioritize resupply missions. Commanders will also have an up-to-the-minute understanding of their forces' readiness. For the upcoming Project Convergence, the starting objective will be to transfer shell and fuel consumption data while the tank is stopped, with a 'stretch&rdquo; goal of transferring data when it's on the move, Upton said. Other technologies the team is prepping for Project Convergence aren't just updates, but entirely new ways of doing logistics. During the event, the team will test two heavy cargo drones capable of carrying 1,000 pounds or more up to 250 nautical miles. The aim of such drones is to deliver multiple artillery shells or precision munitions to troops, all without risking the lives of pilots who would otherwise be tasked with ferrying in munitions by plane or helicopter. The Marine Corps, which already fields a small resupply drone, is also testing options from Leidos and Kaman for a heavier-lift drone in the ranges Upton outlined. Under an 'aggressive&rdquo; schedule, that type of heavy-lift drone could be fielded to its first unit by 2030, Upton said, though that would require many more Army organizations than Army Futures Command to achieve. A smaller drone capable of lifting 150 pounds might be fielded to some units of the Army's 'transformation-in-contact&rdquo; modernization program by 2026, Upton said. The team will also test autonomous resupply boats that the Navy has already experimented with, Upton said. The Army wants the systems to be relatively cheap so it can send 'hundreds&rdquo; to the field, allowing them to disperse widely, which will make them harder for an enemy to strike. Other tech is also in the works, even if the Army isn't ready to pull the trigger on it yet. The service is watching how Ukraine is using drones for casualty evacuation, he said, and while Army discussions about implementing similar practices are 'pre-decisional,&rdquo; he called Ukraine's efforts 'very ingenious.&rdquo; The Army is also looking into better ways to supply troops with energy, but Upton noted numerous problems with existing tech even as troops rely on more and more powered tools, from drones to directed energy. Solar panels could offer frontline troops easy charging options, for example, but could be just as difficult to move as a towed generator, he said. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells or even small nuclear energy could help power bases, meanwhile, but both come with a host of policy, safety, and other problems. Still, Upton was optimistic. 'I think there's a lot of movement that's got to happen in the [power-generation] space,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/army-wargame-test-cargo-drones-and-live-logistics-data/400499/	2024-10-23T12:53:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/23/8286377/large.jpg
The D Brief: A shipyard death; Another F-35 delay?; US troops wou...	He died building a ship for the U.S. government. His family got nothing. ProPublica reports on the death of a shipbuilder at Thoma-Sea, among Louisiana's largest shipyards. Elmer De Le&oacute;n P&eacute;rez died last January as he welded inside a ballast tank of a new oceanographic-research vessel, but his family received no death benefits because he was an employee not of the shipyard, but of G-4 Services, a local staffing subcontractor. G-4 officials insisted that, one, P&eacute;rez was somehow 'not working&rdquo; as he welded, and, two, he wasn't really their employee. 'P&eacute;rez was a self-employed independent contractor and thus a claim for death benefits is not compensable,&rdquo; a lawyer for G-4 Services wrote in May. There are lessons to be learned from this incident and others like it, and a U.S. Navy and shipbuilding industry that is desperately trying to attract employees had best learn them quickly. Writes ProPublica: 'Today the lack of welders is acute. The U.S. needs at least 300,000 more of them in the next few years. Shipyards have been hit particularly hard by the gap, which has contributed to a shortfall in warship production. As in many other industries, immigrants are filling that gap. P&eacute;rez embodied many aspects of the immigration debate.&rdquo; Read on, here. Speaking of immigrants, they appear much more willing to join the U.S. military than the native-born, according to a new study that may have resonance amid military recruitment struggles and an election charged with rhetoric and misinformation. Some 60 percent of U.S. respondents expressed a willingness to fight for their country, and immigrants were nearly 30 percent more likely to do so than native-born citizens, according to the study, whose results were described in the September issue of Armed Forces & Society. Defense One's Patrick Tucker unpacks it, here. F-35 tech problems, protracted negotiations hit Lockheed finances. The company and Pentagon have yet to reach an accord on the contract for the next two production lots&mdash;18 and 19&mdash;and that kept Lockheed from collecting about $700 million last quarter, company officials said Tuesday. They've had to spend company cash to keep the production line running. Another TR-3 delay? Lockheed executives previously said that the jets' full, combat-ready TR-3 package could be ready late next spring. But the company seems to have backed away from that goal in today's earnings call. Defense One's Audrey Decker reports, here.

On this day in 1942, the Second Battle of El Alamein began in Egypt, eventually resulting in a British-led Allied victory over the Nazis and Italians after almost three weeks of fighting. The victory eased Axis threats to the Suez Canal and prevented a Nazi and Fascist advance into the Middle East. Iraq officials say they've killed a top ISIS official after a U.S.-assisted raid in the northern Hamrin Mountains, according to Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute, reporting Tuesday. It's not yet clear exactly who was killed, however. Two U.S. troops were injured in linked operations, which U.S. defense officials confirmed Wednesday and said consisted of 'strikes and follow-on raids on multiple ISIS locations in central Iraq, targeting several senior ISIS leaders and killing at least seven ISIS operatives.&rdquo; The two Americans 'were wounded while assisting Iraqi forces with site exploitation,&rdquo; but they're now in stable condition, according to Central Command. Moment of impact: A photographer in Beirut captured several milliseconds before and after an Israeli rocket struck a building allegedly used by Hezbollah in broad daylight on Tuesday. Behind the lens: Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein, who stayed around 'roughly 40 minutes after an Israeli military spokesperson posted a warning in Arabic on social media, notifying people in and around a pair of buildings on Beirut's southern outskirts that that [sic] they should evacuate the area,&rdquo; AP writes. Review about a half dozen of those images here. Retaliation watch: Israeli officials are still talking up a future attack on Iran in response to Iran's October 1 barrage featuring an estimated 180 ballistic missiles, dozens of which appear to have struck an Israeli air base hosting F-35 aircraft. 'After we strike in Iran, everyone will understand what you did in the preparation and training process,&rdquo; Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israeli troops Wednesday, according to the Times of Israel. 'Everyone who dreamed a year ago of beating us and attacking us, paid a heavy price and is no longer in that dream,&rdquo; Gallant said. It's been another busy day for Israeli air defense systems, which reportedly shot down drones and rockets allegedly launched from Lebanon, according to the Times of Israel's Mannie Fabian. And lastly: An era of 'total war&rdquo; has returned, argues former Pentagon policy official Mara Karlin, writing this week in Foreign Affairs. 'An era of limited war has ended; an age of comprehensive conflict has begun,&rdquo; she says. How so? 'In both Ukraine and the Middle East, what has become clear is that the relatively narrow scope that defined war during the post-9/11 era has dramatically widened,&rdquo; writes Karlin, who served for more than two years as the Biden administration's assistant defense secretary for strategy, plans, and capabilities. 'Indeed, what the world is witnessing today is akin to what theorists in the past have called &lsquo;total war,' in which combatants draw on vast resources, mobilize their societies, prioritize warfare over all other state activities, attack a broad variety of targets, and reshape their economies and those of other countries.&rdquo; The twist: New technologies and a globalized economy make the new total wars different from earlier eras, so strategists and planners must rethink how they fight and prepare, Karlin argues.

Immigrants show greater willingness to join the military, new stu...	Immigrants to the U.S. are more willing to 'fight for the country&rdquo; than the native-born, according to a multinational study that may have resonance amid military recruitment struggles and an election charged with rhetoric and misinformation. Some 60 percent of U.S. respondents expressed a willingness to fight for their country, and immigrants were nearly 30 percent more likely to do so than native-born citizens, according to the survey, whose results were described in the September issue of Armed Forces & Society. The researchers compared multiple surveys across several years including 2024, specifically looking at Americans and Canadians questions about background, self-identity, religious beliefs, feelings of national pride, and more. It was conducted by Christopher Simon of the University of Utah, Nicholas P. Lovrich of Washington State University, Kenneth G. Verboncoeur, of the U.S. Army, and Michael C. Moltz of Shippensburg University. The authors write that demographics will lead many Western militaries to recruit more immigrants. 'Recruitment shortfalls plaguing prominent Western militaries employing the all-volunteer force model raise concerns about the maintenance of force size and readiness. Faced with aging populations, many developed nations will increasingly rely on immigrant youth to address recruitment shortfalls,&rdquo; the authors write. (So far, in the United States, most services report being on track or above their 2024 goals to date but fell beneath their 2023 goals.) The survey also indicates that immigrants are more civic-minded and oriented toward public service than the native-born populations of the countries in which they reside. That belies many claims by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has made derogation of immigrants a chief theme of his campaign. Immigrants' propensity to 'fight&rdquo; appears to be less about their affinity for the military than for the society they have joined, the authors write. 'The evidence presented here would indicate that immigrant willingness to fight is associated primarily with building civic connectedness in the host nation and is not a function of militarism or nationalism,&rdquo; they wrote. While military service has long been a way for documented immigrants to speed up the naturalization process, much of the current national immigration debate has focused on undocumented immigrants, who are generally not allowed to join the military. Their wait for legal status averages about two years, and grew longer during the Trump administration. On the campaign trail, Trump has vowed mass deportations of even legal immigrants at gunpoint by the National Guard. It's hard to imagine such a policy gaining support among the immigrant community interested in military service.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/immigrants-show-greater-willingness-join-military-new-study-shows/400469/	2024-10-22T15:10:59-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/22/GettyImages_566039953-1/large.jpg
He died building a ship for the US government. His family got not...	On the morning of Jan. 22, 2024, Elmer De Le&oacute;n P&eacute;rez descended deep into the bowels of a ship that he was helping to build in Houma, Louisiana. P&eacute;rez was a welder, working to construct one of the U.S. government's most sophisticated ships, an $89 million vessel for tracking hurricanes and conducting oceanographic research. It was funded by President Joe Biden's signature climate legislation. P&eacute;rez's assignment had him working at the bottom of a nearly 12-foot ballast tank, according to a subsequent police report; the walls were just 4 feet apart. That meant standing inside a metal cylinder, roughly twice the size of a household water heater, using an argon-gas torch whose flame can burn as hot as 20,000 degrees. Something went very wrong that day. In the afternoon, workers noticed that P&eacute;rez, 20, had not come up for lunch. Friends and family began calling, with no answer. His coworkers found him slumped over in the tank. 'I couldn't get to him because the gas was too strong,&rdquo; one of them told ProPublica. 'I started screaming, &lsquo;Help! Help! Help!'&rdquo; When emergency workers found his body, P&eacute;rez was already showing signs of rigor mortis. A coroner's report would note that he was wearing a red hoodie, plaid pajama pants and brown steel-toed boots, and that a 'copious amount of clear fluid was noted to the mouth and nose,&rdquo; as well as on the sleeve of his shirt. The coroner concluded that P&eacute;rez 'died as a result of bilateral severe pulmonary consolidation and edema&rdquo; &mdash; fluid in the lungs &mdash; and 'copper and nickel intoxication.&rdquo; (The ship, like many, used copper-nickel alloys as a coating because they resist corrosion from salt water.) P&eacute;rez had worked for roughly the previous two years at the shipyard, which is owned by Thoma-Sea, a large employer with hundreds of millions of dollars in federal defense contracts. If employees are hurt or killed at work, they and their families are eligible for significant financial help. If one dies in an accident, for example, federal law requires companies such as Thoma-Sea to pay any surviving children. For an employee who perished the way P&eacute;rez did, that would have meant payments until his toddler son was at least 18, which could approach a total of $500,000. But P&eacute;rez wasn't working directly for Thoma-Sea; he was employed by a contractor. So when he died, Thoma-Sea paid nothing. Not to his family, including the partner that survived him. Not to his toddler son. Not even to help send P&eacute;rez's body home to Guatemala. Instead, his family borrowed money and desperately tried to raise the rest online. Family members said they haven't heard anything from Thoma-Sea since P&eacute;rez died. When P&eacute;rez's partner sought death benefits from G-4 Services, the local staffing contractor that had hired him to work for Thoma-Sea, G-4 rebuffed her. 'P&eacute;rez was a self-employed independent contractor and thus a claim for death benefits is not compensable,&rdquo; a lawyer for the company wrote in May. G-4 contends that P&eacute;rez 'wasn't working at the time of his death&rdquo; even though his corpse was found in the ship with his welding equipment. Investigators from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded in a September report that Thoma-Sea committed multiple safety violations. 'An employee was allowed to weld in a confined space that was not monitored for atmospheric changes while hot work was being done,&rdquo; OSHA's report stated. The site supervisor, the findings continued, 'did not verify that the ventilation ductwork &hellip; was set up properly to maintain a safe atmosphere.&rdquo; The agency imposed a fine of $41,480 and then, after Thoma-Sea appealed, reduced it to $31,340. As with potential death benefits, none of that money went to P&eacute;rez's family. For decades, U.S. politicians have blamed immigrants for all manner of national woes, particularly taking American jobs. These days, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump agree on the need for a border clampdown. But the truth about jobs is more complicated. There is a dire shortage of blue-collar workers in the United States. Skilled tradespeople have been aging out of the workforce for years now, with fewer people to replace them, as students have prioritized four-year college degrees. The Biden administration has pumped millions into development programs to lure young people into trades, but it'll take years to see any effects. Today the lack of welders is acute. The U.S. needs at least 300,000 more of them in the next few years. Shipyards have been hit particularly hard by the gap, which has contributed to a shortfall in warship production. As in many other industries, immigrants are filling that gap. P&eacute;rez embodied many aspects of the immigration debate. He had exactly the skills that American companies are desperate for. He was an expert welder, willing to work in the cramped, dangerous spaces inside ships. And P&eacute;rez was able to earn $23 an hour at a shipyard in Houma, many times more than he could in his home country. Slightly built with jet-black hair, P&eacute;rez was funny, diligent and eager to succeed. He had begun building a life in the U.S. But, like millions of others, Perez had not been able to do that legally. This spring, the secretary of Navy, Carlos del Toro, called for creating exactly such a pathway, to help construct the ships the Navy needs. 'What we've got to do is open up the spigot a bit,&rdquo; he said. 'Allow blue-collar workers to come here.&rdquo; Without a work permit, P&eacute;rez was vulnerable. He worked at the shipyard but not for it, a contractor for a subcontractor. P&eacute;rez's story is emblematic of a system that relies ever more on immigrants, even as employers and politicians vilify the very people doing work that generates profits and serves the nation. Employers use subcontractors and independent contractors to pass the risks and costs on to the workers, said Laura Padin, director of work structures at the National Employment Law Project. 'These companies, particularly in occupations and industries with high rates of health and safety violations, use this to shield themselves from responsibility,&rdquo; she said. 'We also see that they do this with workers who are immigrants if they think they're undocumented so that they can avoid responsibility for hiring someone who's undocumented.&rdquo; The point, Padin said, is to 'protect the entity at the top.&rdquo; Houma, about an hour southwest of New Orleans, lies at the heart of bayous and wetlands that draw tourists for swamp tours, crawfish boils and Cajun music festivals. Hollywood film crews occasionally visit for the historic plantation houses that dot the surrounding towns and the wooden structures where enslaved people first lived and labored, and where Black sharecroppers later crowded in. It's a region in decline. Damage from 2021's Hurricane Ida is still visible, and decades of oil and gas extraction, combined with the rapidly worsening effects of climate change, have caused an entire island to disappear into the Gulf of Mexico. Last month, another hurricane, Francine, slammed into the parish, and longtime residents are fleeing soaring insurance costs as much as the next storm. Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes (Houma is located near the line between the two) are sparsely populated and majority white, but with sizable Black and tribal nations communities whose ancestral homelands have been ravaged by climate change. Roughly three-quarters of the region's voters supported Trump in 2020, and there's a strain of anti-immigrant sentiment. In the small town of Golden Meadow, one family still has the sign they erected more than 15 years ago, after their son died in a workplace accident. 'An illegal alien working at Port Fourchon killed Nicholas. 5-11-06.&rdquo; (That sentiment is hardly limited to these two parishes: In June, Louisiana enacted a law that threatens prison terms for any 'alien&rdquo; found to have entered the state unlawfully.) Like much of coastal Louisiana, the region has long drawn migratory labor, such as workers who come for the jobs linked to the giant oil-services installation at Port Fourchon or Filipino visa workers who commonly labor in seafood processing plants. Latino immigration to southern Louisiana began increasing nearly 20 years ago, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. A pattern has developed: After a storm wreaks devastation, Louisianans move north while immigrants come to do disaster cleanup and other jobs deemed too dangerous or difficult even for members of a community built around grueling labor on oil rigs and the like. Hispanic residents barely register on the Census counts outside the New Orleans suburbs. But Latino immigrants are steadily becoming a stronger presence where their labor is needed. About a third of all Latino immigrants in Louisiana arrived within the last several years, according to the Pew Research Center. The Thomassie family, owners of Thoma-Sea, have run businesses in the region's trademark industries, first with family shrimping operations, and then with shipbuilding in 1990. The company initially built tugboats to tow offshore oil rigs and barges through the criss-cross of bayous and canals. Walter Thomassie took over in the early 2000s and expanded the business and its ambitions. 'My father set a good example for us, as owners of the company,&rdquo; Thomassie told The Houma Times in 2014. 'We live comfortably, but not lavishly. We re-invest heavily into the company as it is the mechanism that feeds us and it is our job to do all within our power to maintain its stability.&rdquo; Thomassie lives in Raceland, minutes from a billboard advertising workers' compensation claims for maritime injuries. A half-mile drive leads from the blend of bayou towns and sugarcane fields to his home, partially hidden from view by a garage that blocks the path. Thomassie didn't respond to multiple email and phone requests for an interview for this article, and he declined again when ProPublica approached him outside his home in June. He had emerged with a smile, wiping his hand with a rag, from the shop where he was working. But his face dropped at the mention of ProPublica. Thomassie said he had looked up the website and didn't want to talk about his company or P&eacute;rez's death. 'You really shouldn't come to people's homes,&rdquo; he said. (The company also didn't respond to a detailed list of questions from ProPublica.) The Thomassie family's political involvement has grown steadily in recent years. Walter Thomassie is a significant supporter of congressional Republicans, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who have been harshly critical of immigrants. 'You're seeing countries emptying out prisons to send people here,&rdquo; Scalise claimed this year, citing brutal crimes he said had been committed by 'someone here illegally&rdquo; in his own district, which includes part of Houma. How many immigrants or terrorists, he asked, 'are here in America planning to do us harm because Joe Biden opened the southern border?&rdquo; Thomassie made roughly $35,000 in political contributions over the past year. He and his brother, who is also a member of Thoma-Sea's board, have also donated to local Louisiana Republican candidates. Several Louisiana Republican politicians have made appearances at the shipyards. In October 2022, Thoma-Sea executives gathered with local Republican representatives and federal officials to etch one of the ships the company was building for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Discoverer, with the signature of its ceremonial sponsor, second gentleman Doug Emhoff (who didn't attend). Its sister ship, Oceanographer, where P&eacute;rez worked and eventually died, had received its ceremony and fanfare a few months earlier. Over the past several years, Thoma-Sea has secured hundreds of millions of dollars to construct and repair everything from Coast Guard cutters and Army Corps of Engineers barges to parts for Navy submarines. In 2022, Thomassie said that building the NOAA ship and a second similar one, both designed to collect climate change data that would encourage coastal resilience, would bring more than 600 jobs to the Houma shipyard. By all appearances, Thomassie's company is thriving. Thoma-Sea has another, much larger contract to build two more ships for NOAA. (Asked about P&eacute;rez's death, a NOAA spokesperson expressed 'our condolences to the employee's family and our appreciation for everyone working on these vessels&rdquo; and followed up to note that it was the U.S. Navy that selected Thoma-Sea to build the ship that P&eacute;rez worked on.) Thoma-Sea was awarded millions in new federal contracts in the months after P&eacute;rez died. A rough divide in Thoma-Sea's shipyard is visible, according to workers who spoke to ProPublica. Non-Latino &mdash; mostly white &mdash; employees tend to be on staff, with many in supervisory positions. Some Latino immigrant workers are employed directly for the company and in supervisory positions, but they are more likely to work as independent contractors with no benefits. The phenomenon is not limited to Thoma-Sea. Around Houma, Spanish advertisements for contratistas litter the windows and bulletin boards of Hispanic businesses on the long commercial and industrial strips leading to the shipyards and the Port of Terrebonne, offering positions for pipe fitters, riggers, deckhands, painters and tug welders. Some Houma-based agencies recruit for jobs in other Southern port towns in Mississippi, Alabama or South Carolina. Employers with federal contracts are supposed to ascertain workers' eligibility &mdash; and ensure subcontractors do the same &mdash; using the government's online E-Verify system, which checks identity information like Social Security numbers against federal databases. But experts say E-Verify makes it easy for workers to provide false information, and government agencies rarely monitor compliancewith these rules. Other shipyards working on federal contracts have also hired undocumented workers. At Detyens Shipyards in Charleston, South Carolina, three Mexican immigrants died between 2019 and 2023 in gruesome accidents while repairing the same Navy cargo ship. An investigation by Charleston's Post and Courierdiscovered that two of the men were working under assumed names and both had been recruited by a contractor agency based in Houma. A federal investigation found an abysmal safety record at the shipyard. But the Navy awarded Detyens several more contracts to repair ships soon after those deaths. A company representative declined to comment other than to say that it confirms every employee's eligibility to work. The same day OSHA fined Detyens for its safety record, a House Armed Services Committee hearing discussed the struggle to properly staff shipyards. Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington, gingerly broached the idea of relying more on immigrants. 'This is not a great place to bring up an immigration debate, but you know immigration is potentially one place where we could find some of those workers,&rdquo; Smith said. 'And as we are all painfully aware, there are a lot of people who want to come here. Seems to me that we ought to be able to match up those two problems a little bit better than we are.&rdquo; Smith's suggestion, which was echoed by del Toro, the Navy secretary, never gained momentum. It withered away nearly as soon as it was mentioned. Smith's office did not respond to ProPublica's request for comment. P&eacute;rez and his father, Erick De Le&oacute;n, left their hometown of San Miguel Ixtahuac&aacute;n, Guatemala, at the tail end of 2019, but they crossed into the U.S. separately. According to an account provided by his father, the 15-year-old P&eacute;rez gave himself up to U.S. authorities, leading to a brief detention, while his father crossed the border in the desert. Father and son reunited, then settled with family in Houston, where Per&eacute;z picked up jobs in restaurants and contracting jobs with his father. But by 2021, they had relocated to Houma, where several of P&eacute;rez's aunts lived with their extended families. P&eacute;rez's father eventually returned to Guatemala when his wife got sick. But P&eacute;rez stayed, finding that the welding skills he'd learned on a job in Houston were coveted in Houma. P&eacute;rez's partner, another Guatemalan immigrant, moved with him to Houma. Their son was born on Christmas Day in 2022 at the hospital in Houma, making him a U.S. citizen. They relied on his aunt and uncle, who viewed P&eacute;rez like a son, to get established in Louisiana, and his aunt remembered how his son's birth had shifted his priorities. He focused even more on building a life for his family and spent his limited free time with his son. (ProPublica interviewed several members of P&eacute;rez's family in Houma, but agreed not to name them due to the legal and employment threats that immigrants face right now.) By the time P&eacute;rez signed an independent contractor agreement with G-4 Services to work at Thoma-Sea just a few weeks later, photos of the proud father and son were filling Facebook feeds from Houma to Guatemala. 'Tenerte como hijo siempre ser&aacute; el mejor regalo del mundo,&rdquo; P&eacute;rez wrote beneath a photo with his son on Nov. 19, 2023, just two months before his death. 'To have you as a son will always be the best gift in the world.&rdquo; In the days before P&eacute;rez's death, he was pulled into extra work shifts on Saturday and Sunday. It meant he missed the service at the small Spanish-speaking church near the shipyard, but he arrived home in time to join family dinner with his aunt, uncle and cousins. Eating a huge Sunday meal they had cooked together was one of the most treasured traditions for their busy extended family in Houma, his aunt told ProPublica. P&eacute;rez had requested carne asada, one of his favorites. He wanted to bring the leftovers to work that week. The next day, Monday, marked the beginning of a harrowing ordeal for P&eacute;rez's family. It started around 3 p.m., when relatives who also worked at the shipyard received a worrisome message via Facebook: Something had happened to P&eacute;rez. Family started messaging friends and calling each other frantically, trying to figure out what was going on. When they couldn't get answers, a handful went to the shipyard itself. As they arrived at the Thoma-Sea parking lot and rushed to the security gate, one of P&eacute;rez's aunts remembers seeing a small caravan of emergency vehicles, including a coroner's van, driving in the opposite direction. The company didn't tell them anything at first, leaving them to wait in increasing despair outside the security gate. It wasn't until later, after someone emerged to break the news, that P&eacute;rez's aunt realized that it was his body that had passed them. 'It was like the world came crashing down on me,&rdquo; she told ProPublica. Standing in the shadow of the ship where he had died hours earlier, P&eacute;rez's family clutched each other and cried. Distraught, confused and angry, they returned home to break the news to P&eacute;rez's partner. Word of P&eacute;rez's death spread quickly across Facebook, mostly thanks to the tight-knit evangelical Christian community of his hometown in Guatemala. His U.S. family hosted bake sales and started a GoFundMe page, which raised just $470 toward the $8,689 undertaker's bill and other funeral costs. P&eacute;rez's hometown church in Guatemala, as well as a local evangelical Facebook page, raised much more through posted calls for financial assistance across their network. Neither P&eacute;rez's partner nor the rest of his family in the U.S. could attend the funeral in Guatemala. But they watched a Facebook livestream from the Guatemalan radio station. It showed his coffin arriving in San Miguel Ixtahuac&aacute;n, a caravan of cars following the hearse down the winding mountain road as the sun set. They watched his younger siblings and cousins weep over his open casket, then weep again as his family and neighbors buried him in San Miguel's cemetery. P&eacute;rez's family members in Houma are still reeling from his death. None of his relatives who worked at Thoma-Sea could stomach staying there any longer. They eventually quit and moved to different jobs in the region. His partner still keeps his phone exactly how he left it, the recent call list full of missed calls from family and coworkers who were looking for him that day. His son still wakes up crying for him in the middle of the night. A cousin made a TikTok of P&eacute;rez dancing with his son, the overlaid text promising that they'll find him justice. There's a chance P&eacute;rez's family could obtain financial compensation, but it's a long shot. Federal law does create a path for a workers' compensation lawsuit, even for a shipyard contractor or an undocumented immigrant. Steve Wanko, a Houma workers' compensation lawyer, said he won such a case in 2015. Another lawyer filed a claim on behalf of Per&eacute;z's partner against the contractor, G-4 Services. G-4 is disputing the benefits claim, citing Per&eacute;z's ineligibility as an independent contractor, saying his partner was ineligible because they were not legally married, and claiming the sudden death of a healthy 20-year-old was not caused by his job. His death, a medical review conducted at the request of G-4 argued, 'occurred while he was working but was not caused by workplace related factors or activities.&rdquo; Reached in May outside his home, Ricky Guidroz, one of the owners of G-4 Services, declined to discuss P&eacute;rez's death, citing the advice of his lawyers. Guidroz said he had tried to reach out to P&eacute;rez's family. Guidroz's wife came by the house crying at one point, P&eacute;rez's aunt said, but they didn't really know what to say to her. 'It's so unfortunate,&rdquo; he told ProPublica. 'Just know that my heart hurts, really.&rdquo; (ProPublica also sent a detailed list of questions to G-4 Services, which didn't respond.) This October, ProPublica visited Thoma-Sea again, one month after the OSHA report excoriated the company for not protecting P&eacute;rez. At the end of the day's shift, the workers, mostly Latino, passed an Army Corps of Engineers barge, under repair just behind the shipyard's security guard shack, in groups and pairs to reach cars in the muddy parking lot. The workers filtered out to the handful of Hispanic businesses near the Port of Terrebonne to buy tortillas for the weekend and to wire money home. Some drove upwards of an hour to reach homes scattered from the New Orleans suburbs to small towns hugging Bayou Lafourche and the Atchafalaya River. Most of them would be back the next morning, to resume building America's ships.

F-35 tech problems, protracted negotiations hit Lockheed finances	Longer-than-expected negotiations over the Pentagon's next two batches of F-35s kept Lockheed Martin from collecting about $700 million last quarter, company officials said Tuesday. Lockheed hasn't been able to strike a deal for the next two production lots&mdash;18 and 19&mdash;so they've had to spend company cash to keep the production line running. 'As expected, aeronautics was down primarily due to delayed revenue recognition of approximately $700 million associated with the lapse in F-35 program funding as we continue to work through lot 18 negotiations,&rdquo; company CFO Jay Malave told investors during a third-quarter earnings call. Company executives have previously said that the price per jet will likely need to increase in lots 18 and 19, as inflation, the jet's increasing complexity, and the Pentagon's proposed cut to the planned F-35 buy are all driving costs. Malave said he expects the contract to be awarded this year. But if negotiations extend beyond the year's end, 'we could see about 3 percent, or $2 billion of our sales shift into 2025, along with associated impacts to profit and about $1 billion of free cash flow.&rdquo; The company has to continue building the jets, even in the absence of a formal agreement, because it's 'essential&rdquo; for the health of the lower-tier suppliers, CEO Jim Taiclet said. The jet builder will also have to absorb $600 million this year after the Pentagon paused the acceptance of new jets due to delays with new technology that was supposed to be loaded onto the jet, called Technology Refresh-3. After deliveries resumed, the Pentagon said it would withhold money from the company, $5 million per jet, until the full upgrade was complete. Lockheed will earn back some of that money as it reaches various milestones in TR-3 development, Malave said. 'As you go to 2025, we'll deliver more aircraft, and so we will see the benefit of having delivered more aircraft, and we will also see the benefit of having incremental withholds released, I would quantify that today at around $300 to $400 million, and then that'll then continue to flow in 2026 and beyond,&rdquo; Malave said. The jets now being delivered to the Pentagon are loaded with a 'truncated version&rdquo; of TR-3, which can be used for training but isn't fully combat-ready. U.S. officials decided to start accepting the jets without the full capability, figuring that a partial capability is better than nothing. The company was originally supposed to have TR-3 ready in April 2023. And in addition to delays, the new technology is on track to run $1 billion over budget. Lockheed executives previously said that the combat-ready TR-3 package could be ready late next spring. But the company seems to have backed away from that goal in today's earnings call. While Taiclet said '95 percent&rdquo; of combat capabilities have been validated, the company will need to complete many more tests on the new version throughout 2025 before it's ready for prime time. The interim version currently being delivered doesn't have 'some of those incremental software validations that show that all combat systems and all weapons will be able to be effectively deployed&hellip;there are a lot of test points there, and those test points are going to be developed not just in the fourth quarter, but they're going to be developed over the course of 2025 as well. Because when I say a weapon, is it an AMRAAM? Is it an AIM-9? What weapon are we talking about? There's literally dozens of weapons, and there are multiple test points on things like distributed after system, etc. So this is a complex path to what I call release two. That's the full up combat capability,&rdquo; Taiclet said. The company delivered 48 F-35s in the third quarter, and expects to deliver 90 to 110 in total this year. The company expects to deliver 180 jets per year over the next three years&mdash;a mix of new jets coming off the line and jets that were parked&mdash;so 'cash collections will smooth out over this period of time,&rdquo; Malave said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/f-35-tech-problems-protracted-negotiations-hit-lockheed-finances/400455/	2024-10-22T13:14:45-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/22/f_345_GettyImages_2175836838/large.jpg
Adversaries will aim to ‘stoke societal unrest’ after Election Da...	Foreign adversaries are intensifying efforts to influence the outcome of the Nov. 5 presidential election, and will likely amplify disinformation campaigns about election results that encourage physical violence between next month and Inauguration Day in January, intelligence officials warned Tuesday. Russia, Iran, and China 'will remain committed to trying to undermine U.S. democracy, stoke societal unrest and position their preferred candidates,&rdquo; said one official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity per ground rules of a news conference. Russia and Iran 'are probably willing to at least consider&rdquo; tactics that would incite violence, said the official. Russia prefers former president Donald Trump, while Iran prefers Vice President Kamala Harris, according to previous assessments from ODNI, which oversees U.S. intelligence programs and activities. China, meanwhile, is seeking to influence down-ballot races because neither presidential candidate has a policy agenda that caters more favorably to Beijing, the office has previously said. With just two weeks to go before Americans cast their vote, the influence efforts have accelerated. One instance that has received national attention centered on false allegations about Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, which the ODNI official called 'manipulated&rdquo; media that was generated by Russia. Intelligence analysts used a combination of internal and commercial tools to determine the video purporting to show the abuse victim speaking out was crafted by pro-Kremlin spin doctors, a different ODNI official said. The video had previously been debunked and disputed by social media users and researchers. 'Foreign-driven or -amplified violent protests, violence, or physical threats to election workers or state and local officials could challenge state and local officials' ability to conduct elements of the certification and Electoral College process, particularly if they prevent necessary physical access to facilities or venues,&rdquo; says a party redacted whitepaper released Tuesday that was declassified Oct. 16 by National Intelligence Director Avril Haines. It adds that dynamic could extend to the January 6 election certification process, which would echo the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol that followed baseless claims from then-President Donald Trump and GOP allies about his election loss being rigged. Cyber operations and other espionage techniques may be deployed day-of. Foreign hacking collectives may attempt to alter public-facing election, state government or news websites to 'promote confusion&rdquo; about results, the declassified assessment adds. The first ODNI official on the call noted that adversaries would likely refrain from hacking attempts to disrupt vote counts. Iran and Russia are behind brazen election-related hacking and disinformation attempts, U.S. law-enforcement officials say. Last month, the DOJ filed criminal charges against a trio of operatives tied to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, alleging their involvement in a hack and leak of Trump campaign documents. Russia for months has conducted sustained influence campaigns to tip the American vote in favor of Trump, according to previous assessments and legal accusations. Moscow, Tehran, and China have vehemently denied such claims.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/adversaries-will-aim-stoke-societal-unrest-after-election-day-officials-warn/400470/	2024-10-22T11:36:56-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/22/GettyImages_1195525367-1/large.jpg
What would Harris, Trump do about Russia's invasion of Ukraine?	The U.S. presidential election isn't drawing eyes only at home; Moscow and Kyiv are watching closely, too. Regardless of who wins in November, there will be significant implications for Ukraine as it continues to resist Russia in a war heading toward a fourth year. Washington's continued support is seen by some as no less than an existential issue for Ukraine. Without U.S. arms and aid, it is unlikely that the nation would be able to continue repelling its larger, better-armed neighbor. During the presidential debate on Sept. 10, 2024, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Republican contender Donald Trump had a chance to clarify their positions on Ukraine. Trump evaded ABC moderator David Muir's question regarding the importance of Ukraine's victory over Russia, twice. Instead, he repeated his long-standing line that he would achieve a negotiated peace quickly &ndash; even before taking office as president. At the same debate, Harris dismissed the idea of Trump negotiating with 'a dictator who would eat you for lunch.&rdquo; She instead emphasized the Biden policy to support Ukraine 'as long as it takes&rdquo; in concert with U.S. allies. But detail has been light on what either candidate would actually do to support Ukraine and end the war. So, what do we know about each candidate's approach to Ukraine based on their records? Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Trump has repeatedly stated that ending the war is in the U.S.'s best interests and that he can end the war quickly. In fact, Trump is certain that had he remained president after the 2020 election, Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have invaded &ndash; an unsubstantiated claim he repeated during the Sept. 10 presidential debate. Trump has often reiterated that both Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy respect him, and he would be able to use his 'good relationship&rdquo; with both to bring them to the negotiating table and end the war. Yet, Trump's record on his relationships with Zelenskyy and Putin is rather complicated. Trump's admiration for Putin is well documented and dates back to his first presidential run in 2016, sparking numerous investigations and reports of collusion. Most recently, Bob Woodward reported that Trump secretly sent COVID-19 tests to Putin in the midst of a pandemic shortage, a claim confirmed by the Kremlin. Trump's relationship with Zelenskyy is similarly laden with baggage. A 2019 phone call between the two men, during which Trump pressured Ukraine's president to open a criminal investigation into Joe Biden, led to Trump's impeachment. In exchange, Ukraine would have received continued U.S. support for the country's defense against Russia, which had been waging a proxy war in eastern regions of Ukraine since 2014. During the subsequent hearings in Congress, one of Trump's aides testified that 'Trump did not give a sh*t about Ukraine&rdquo; and was only interested in his own political gains. Standing next to Zelenskyy during a meeting at the Trump Tower on Sept. 27, 2024&mdash;their first meeting since Sept. 25, 2019&mdash;Trump said he was sure that both Zelenskyy and Putin are interested in peace and that a 'very fair&rdquo; and 'rapid&rdquo; deal is possible. When asked what that deal might entail, Trump responded that it's 'too early&rdquo; to discuss details and that both he and Zelenskyy have 'their own ideas.&rdquo; While the Republican candidate has not been explicit on the details of negotiations or possible conditions, some of his proxies have voiced proposals. Trump's vice presidential pick, JD Vance, has laid out a plan that includes potential land concessions on the part of Ukraine and the creation of a demilitarized zone along the battle lines of the Russian-occupied territory of eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, Trump's son Donald Jr. co-authored a piece with former presidential candidate-turned-Trump ally Robert F Kennedy Jr., arguing that a concession to Russian demands for 'Ukrainian neutrality and a halt to NATO's eastward expansion&rdquo; were reasonable to avoid a nuclear game of chicken. Although these have not been echoed in Trump's own statements on Ukraine, both men have the ear of the Republican candidate. These plans have been criticized as closely resembling those of the Kremlin. Before meeting with Trump in New York, Zelenskyy had also criticized Vance's plan and expressed doubts that Trump and his team really know how to end the war. Harris has been harshly critical of Trump's approach to Ukraine. 'They are not proposals for peace,&rdquo; Harris said in response to suggestions that Ukraine cede territory for peace. 'Instead they are proposals for surrender,&rdquo; she added. Such views are in line with Harris' record. As part of the Biden administration, Harris has given vocal support to Ukraine's fight for political sovereignty and territorial integrity. At the onset of the full-scale invasion in early 2022, Harris traveled to Europe to help shore up a coalition of European allies to support Ukraine. As vice president, Harris has repeatedly condemned Russian war crimes in Ukraine. In February 2023, while attending the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, she announced that the U.S. has determined that Russian actions in Ukraine amounted to 'crimes against humanity,&rdquo; affirming U.S. commitment to the international rule of law. Along with continued support, the U.S. has provided substantial aid for Ukraine, totaling US$61.3 billion in military aid since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The Biden administration also has said that rising costs and keeping pressure on Russia through sanctions are important mechanisms to keep Moscow accountable. Harris reiterated this need to maintain sanctions and broad coalition support for Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference in February 2024 and again in June at the peace summit organized by Ukraine in Switzerland. As a presidential candidate, Harris has openly signaled her commitment to supporting Kyiv&mdash;not only for Ukraine's survival but for the collective security of NATO allies and the U.S. itself. Harris emphasized this point in the September debate, suggesting that Ukraine was not Putin's final stop and that he has 'his eyes on the rest of Europe, starting with Poland.&rdquo; Standing next to Zelenskyy in Washington on Sept. 26, 2024, Harris reiterated the point: 'The United States supports Ukraine not out of charity, but because it's in our strategic interest.&rdquo; Yet, White House policy on Ukraine has been criticized for being slow and hesitant in supplying weaponry. The U.S. has imposed rules on the use of heavy weaponry against targets inside Russia. Furthermore, the U.S. has so far been reticent on Ukraine's invitation to join NATO, which is seen as crucial for any lasting peace in Kyiv. How Harris' White House would differ from Biden's on these issues is not clear. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, the U.S. Congress has passed five bills that provide aid to Ukraine, totaling US$175 billion. However, a six-month delay in aid in early 2024 highlighted growing partisan tension in Congress over continued aid to Ukraine. The composition of Congress after the November election is another unknown factor in Washington's support for Ukraine. Zelenskyy met with congressional leaders during his visit to the U.S. in September, but notably absent was Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who in the past has shown reluctance to support continued funding. For the large part, support for Ukraine remains bipartisan in Congress and among American voters. Yet there is a risk the election could further politicize the issue. And the outcome of November's vote could determine whether U.S. efforts focus more on pushing for a negotiated deal or ongoing support for Ukraine.

The D Brief: Kyiv’s big EU loan; F-35 readiness still low; Crash ...	European lawmakers approved a &euro;35 billion loan for Kyiv, with the money set 'to be repaid with future revenues from frozen Russian assets,&rdquo; officials from the Strasbourg, France-based body announced Tuesday. The loan follows through on an agreement forged by G7 members in June. Where the money comes from: 'Approximately &euro;210 billion in assets from the Central Bank of Russia are held in the EU and remain frozen under sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,&rdquo; the European Parliament said. EU members have elected to use that money to support Ukraine's military as well as reconstruction efforts across the invaded country. To be clear, officials are 'not confiscating sovereign Russian assets in Europe, but using the profits and interest accrued from them,&rdquo; the BBC reports. The Brits are contributing nearly $3 billion of those funds for Ukraine's military. Fine print: The $37.8 billion loan 'is conditional upon Ukraine's continued commitment to uphold effective democratic mechanisms, respect human rights, and further policy conditions to be set out in a memorandum of understanding.&rdquo; More from the EU, here.

On this day in 1707, the British Royal Navy suffered one of its worst disasters at sea when four warships ran aground in poor weather off the Isles of Scilly, killing at least 1,400 sailors. Developing: Officials in South Korea are openly considering arming Ukraine with lethal weapons, which Seoul has not done yet, the Guardian reports. 'We would consider supplying weapons for defensive purposes as part of the step-by-step scenarios, and if it seems they are going too far, we might also consider offensive use,&rdquo; the presidential official told reporters Tuesday. South Korea could also send monitors inside Ukraine to more closely track 'the tactics and combat capabilities of North Korean special forces dispatched in support of Russia,&rdquo; Yonhap news agency reported Tuesday, citing an intelligence source. The possible moves come in response to North Korean special forces training inside Russia for possible deployment against Ukraine. South Korea is sending a team of intelligence and military officials to NATO headquarters in Brussels some time over the next few days to detail their findings, according to Yonhap. That's expected to be one of a possible series of 'phased measures&rdquo; Seoul is pondering in response to the North Korean developments. From Seoul's perspective, 'North Korea will expect a generous payoff from Moscow in return for its troop contribution,&rdquo; the country's Ambassador to the UN Joonkook Hwang said Monday. 'It could be either military or financial assistance. It could be nuclear weapons-related technology,&rdquo; he said in New York. Tactical considerations: 'If North Koreans have to call for air support and artillery fire, language and procedural differences will be a challenge,&rdquo; retired Australian Army Maj. Gen. Mick Ryan writes in his blog. 'Will they operate fully integrated within Russian formations and be subject to the full command of Russian commanders? Or will they be under a form of operational command or control with caveats on their employment, such as not being used as meat troops?&rdquo; A bit more, here. Meanwhile on the battlefield, 'Russian forces continue to systematically perpetrate war crimes, including the continued executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war and use of chemical weapons,&rdquo; including chloropicrin, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War writes in its latest Ukraine assessment published Monday. And perhaps unsurprisingly, 'There is no evidence that Russia is holding Russian personnel accountable for the violations of the laws of war that have been reported,&rdquo; ISW reports. Update: Ukraine's population has fallen by 10 million since Russia invaded in February 2022, with 6.7 million refugees living abroad, a United Nations official said Tuesday. Making matters worse, Ukraine now has the lowest birth rate in the world, according to Florence Bauer, the U.N. Population Fund's Eastern European chief. Reuters has a tiny bit more. Overnight Russian drone strikes killed at least three people, including a child in the northeastern city of Sumy, according to President Zelenskyy. ICYMI: Ukrainian officials claim to have assassinated a Russian officer believed to be responsible for a cruise missile attack on a shopping center in the city of Kremenchuk in June 2022. That attack killed 22 people. The officer, Col. Dmitry Golenkov, served in Russia's 52nd heavy bomber regiment. He was reportedly 'found bludgeoned to death with a hammer&hellip;outside the village of Suponevo in the Bryansk region of Russia,&rdquo; according to the Telegraph, reporting Monday.

Tragic update: Naval aviators who died in Growler crash were combat veterans just back from nine-month deployment. Lt. Cmdr. Lyndsay Evans and Lt. Serena Wileman, both 31, flew multiple missions over Yemen while defending commercial shipping from Houthi attacks, the Navy said in a Monday release.

Researchers sound alarm on dual-use AI for defense	A growing number of Silicon Valley AI companies want to do business with the military, making the case that the time and effort they've put into training large neural networks on vast amounts of data could provide the military new capabilities. But a study out today from a group of prominent AI scholars argues that dual-use AI tools would increase the odds of innocent civilians becoming targets due to bad data&mdash;and that the tools could easily be gamed by adversaries. In the paper, published by the AI Now Institute, authors Heidy Khlaaf, Sarah Myers West, and Meredith Whittaker point out the growing interest in commercial AI models&mdash;sometimes called foundation models&mdash;for military purposes, particularly for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance. They argue that while concerns around AI's potential for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons dominate the conversation, big commercial foundation models already pose underappreciated risks to civilians. Some companies pitching foundation model-based AI to the military are 'proposing commercial models that already have been pre-trained on a set of commercial data. They are not talking about military-exclusive commercial models that have been purely trained on military data,&rdquo; Khlaaf told Defense One. The problem lies in how these foundation models are trained: on large amounts of publicly available data, often including personal data that has made its way to the web via data brokers or regular websites and services. 'Data is the fundamental issue here. It causes a huge amount of concerns and vulnerabilities, and it's not being accounted for when we talk about things like traceability broadly,&rdquo; said Whittaker, who currently serves as president of the Signal Foundation. These neural nets don't use reasoning like a human would. Other research has shown they are essentially doing pattern matching on a huge scale, finding combinations of words to create statistically-sound extrapolations of what words might come next, or taking data points on millions of individuals and drawing correlation connections between them (as opposed to causative connections.) Foundation models perform well in scenarios where the cost of false positives is low, such as trying to come up with interesting points for a research paper or a list of people to market a product to. [[Related Posts]] Applied to military contexts&mdash;specifically the task of surveilling a population for potential targets&mdash;the cost of a false positive could be an innocent life. Some militaries, such as Israel, through its Where's Daddy and Lavender programs, are already employing pattern-extrapolating foundation models to assemble target lists. That's contributing to the normalization of these tools for targeting in warfare, the authors say. A report from Israel-based publication +972 found that the error rate for Lavender alone was near 10 percent. Speaking of Israeli use of AI in its Gaza operations (and beyond) Khlaaf said 'We're seeing... data being pulled from WhatsApp, metadata, right? We're seeing data pulled from Google Photos and other sources, of course, that we're unaware of and haven't really been covered. So the data is inaccurate and [the models] sort of attempt to find patterns that may not exist, like being in a WhatsApp group with a&hellip;Hamas member should not qualify you for [a death] sentence. But in this case, that is what we're observing.&rdquo; Said Whittaker, these Israeli tools function based 'on surveillance of a given population, right? One of the reasons Ukraine can't implement systems with the type of characteristics of Lavender and Where's Daddy is they don't have that very fine-grain population-level surveillance data, of say, all of Russia's population. So you see here the role of personal information in informing systems that then use these data models.&rdquo; This problem is one reason the Defense Department puts such an emphasis on 'traceability of data&rdquo; in its AI ethics principles. As Defense One has reported, the Defense Department's AI principals list is considerably more detailed and specific than similar AI ethics guidelines from Silicon Valley companies. But it's also a voluntary framework, and the Defense Department has given itself work arounds. The authors argue that a self-adopted ethical framework doesn't protect civilians against commercial AI models that are trained on personal data, especially when the government seems willing to make exceptions for commercial AI tools. Said West: 'We've seen this propensity, you know, even like the introduction of fast-tracking Fed RAMP in order to promote rapid adoption of generative AI use cases, the creation of these carve outs, which is why these sort of voluntary frameworks and higher order principles are insufficient, particularly where we're dealing with uses that are very much life-or-death stakes, and where the consequences for civilians are very significant.&rdquo; Even the Navy's chief information officer, Jane Rathbun, has said commercial foundation models are 'not recommended for operational use cases.&rdquo; Adoption of these models by the Defense Department would also introduce vulnerabilities into operations, they argue, since publicly-available data can be gamed or manipulated by adversaries. 'The ubiquitous and unfettered use of web-scale datasets for training commercial foundation models has led to the exploitation and use of several avenues that allow adversarial actors to execute poisoning attacks &lsquo;that guarantee malicious examples will appear in web-scale datasets,'&rdquo; the paper notes. That broadens the ramifications of the paper's findings beyond the question of what tools the Defense Department may or may not adopt. In an era where such tools are increasingly commonplace, the personal data of American civilians becomes a national strategic vulnerability. And the Biden White House's executive orders on bulk meta data collection and safe AI don't go far enough to keep Americans' data out of the hands of adversaries armed with similar models, the authors said. However, Whittaker said, the broadening of U.S. privacy laws to more effectively cover personal data 'could actually be hugely beneficial in reducing adversarial access to the type of personal data that, one, is used to train [large language models] and, two, is extractable via exactly the kinds of attacks Heidi [Khlaaf] has studied, to which there are no current remediations.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/researchers-sound-alarm-dual-use-ai-defense/400432/	2024-10-22T03:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/21/GettyImages_1206412761/large.jpg
How two units are learning from each other as the Army moves to m...	When Col. Josh Glonek has a question about how to use the mountain of new technology the Army is sending his way, he knows just who to ask: Col. James Stultz. That's because Stultz has been there&mdash;since April, his unit has been learning how best to use the dozens of drones, various electronic warfare systems, and new comms gear given to them as part of a major Army modernization effort dubbed 'transformation-in-contact.&rdquo; Now, they can pass on that knowledge to new brigades. 'They should not have to learn any of the lessons that we learned,&rdquo; Stultz said. Announced in February, 'transformation-in-contact&rdquo; consists of the Army giving three brigades an assortment of tech inspired in part by the war in Ukraine&mdash;then letting those units figure out what works and what doesn't.. The three brigades are Stultz's 101st Airborne 2nd Brigade, the 25th Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade, and Glonek's 10th Mountain Division's 3rd Brigade. As the Army presses ahead with its effort, including expanding it to four more brigades, units already in the program are sharing what they've learned. In a joint interview with Glonek and Stultz during the Association of the U.S. Army's annual Washginton conference, the commanders also said they are using their work to identify more modernization needs for the future. The first in line Stultz's 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, is furthest along in the transformation process, having tested out new gear and organizational concepts during an August rotation to one of the Army's most realistic combat training centers. The 2nd Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division recently completed a tour at a similar center in the Pacific, while Glonek's 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division has a tour to a Europe-based center coming up this winter. Stultz said his brigade's rotation through the Joint Readiness Training Center showed some of the equipment is working well. Transporting soldiers with the new Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV), a quiet, nine-seat vehicle based on a pick-up truck design, is 'huge,&rdquo; Stultz said. 'The ISV can get things where other vehicles just can't.&rdquo; That flexibility means his unit can pop up where the enemy least expects it. During the exercise, Stultz's brigade executed what he called a 'bold flanking maneuver&rdquo; right past the noses of the U.S. forces playing their enemy. '[The enemy roleplayers] had no idea where we were&mdash;because we could go a long way, very fast, and move a lot of people,&rdquo; he said. Soldiers from the 2nd Brigade are now using the vehicle to help assist in Hurricane Helene relief efforts. [[Related Posts]] Stultz also praised the unit's communications gear, which allowed him to run satellite comms, radio traffic, and other forms of communication from a cell phone. 'Having the ability to use my cell phone as a [satellite] phone was a game changer,&rdquo; Stultz said. Stultz also noted the success of a program called Shrike AI, formerly known as Sentinel AI. The program automatically detects objects in drone feeds and sends the coordinates to the Army's artillery-coordinating software, the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System. The system also calculates targeting adjustments based on where it sees an artillery round strike. The program 'cuts about a minute,&rdquo; off the time it takes to coordinate an artillery strike, Stultz said. 'It is a game changer.&rdquo; Data exhaust The fielding program is intended to quickly reveal what works and what doesn't so the Army can adjust, and Stultz said it has already raised some new questions for his unit. One challenge, he said, is that having dozens of drones creates a significant amount of data that someone must comb through for relevant information. It's particularly difficult when soldiers are already stressed out, hungry, and tired, and they may fail to spot enemy vehicles hidden in the hours of drone footage. But incorporating object detection into the drones would help observers sort through the visual clutter: 'We have got to put some sort of robot in between the feed and the operator,&rdquo; he said. Stultz's unit currently lacks the ability to easily stream drone footage back to its command posts, as drone operators do in Ukraine. But he said he prefers not to stream video anyway, as it could be a distraction. Instead, he wants tools that would alert soldiers when an enemy vehicle had been detected. 'More people don't need to see the feed&mdash;we just need the data on it,&rdquo; he said. Glonek agreed, pointing out that more automation would mean fewer people in a command post, which could make the command post harder for enemy forces to spot. Stultz also learned another lesson about command posts: During its August training exercise, the brigade operated two. One was smaller and another larger, which combined administrative, logistic, and planning functions. The larger command post just had too much going on, Stultz said. 'Everybody [was] talking right next to each other, and they can't think,&rdquo; he said. Next time, Stultz wants to set up three command posts: 'one can be administration, logistics, one could be plans, and then the other is current operations.&rdquo; The last in the process All those lessons are now filtering to Glonek, who is getting his troops ready for a winter rotation to a similarly realistic combat training center in Europe. The two talk frequently about how best to use their communications network, and the best way to do electromagnetic deception, Glonek said. Glonek has also set up a company in every battalion that pairs a drone platoon with reconnaissance and mortar units, similar to how Stultz arranged his forces. Stultz's drone-enabled company is dubbed the 'Multi-Purpose Company,&rdquo; while Glonek's units are called 'Strike&rdquo; companies. Though the two brigades' capabilities are similar, there are some differences. For example, Glonek's brigade lacks Stultz's Multi-Functional Reconnaissance Company (MFRC), a drone and electronic-warfare heavy company capable of dwelling deep behind enemy lines and identifying targets. 'It'll be a big learning objective for the Army to understand what he was able to achieve, with the MFRC, versus what I'm able to achieve, which will be through the use of technology, not an actual ground formation,&rdquo; Glonek said. And the Army is also considering changes to the MFRC, Stultz said, noting the unit 'comes at a cost.&rdquo; 'We're trying to look at multiple options as an Army, of like, OK, could we do it without it, or do we need it?&rdquo; he said. Glonek's brigade will come to their winter training exercise loaded with even more drones than Stultz did&mdash;including what Glonek called 'massive amounts&rdquo; of small drones. Every platoon will get three short-range drones, for a total of 145 small drones across the brigade, Glonek said. Those drones will be from Skydio, the current drone provider of the Army's Short Range Reconnaissance Program. Inspired by observations from Ukraine, the unit will also equip some of its small drones with bomb release mechanisms. The mechanisms are 3D printed based on a design from a NATO-backed effort, Glonek said. The Army has also given the brigade $5 million to buy medium-range reconnaissance drones to equip the Strike company's drone platoon. These systems will allow the drone platoons to fly longer and farther. In September, the Army chose two systems for tranche one of its medium-range drone program: Anduril's Ghost X and Performance Drone Works' C-100. The brigade will also bring a drone capable of automatically tracking enemy vehicles, Glonek said. Before deploying, the brigade will upload images of the vehicles used by the forces playing their adversary. If the drone finds an 'enemy&rdquo; vehicle along the predetermined route, it will then send a picture, the vehicle's coordinates, and other info back to the command post, Glonek said. Glonek's unit will likely need bigger, more substantial command posts than the 101st, because of Europe's freezing winter temperatures. 'It's hard to get into a super small, austere command post&rdquo; in winter, he said. It will also do deception operations differently. Stultz's troops brought along miniature computers meant to broadcast as if they were devices in a command post, which was sufficient because they knew the forces playing their enemies relied on detecting electronic emissions. Glonek, though, knows the soldiers playing the enemy at the European center are likely to check out suspected 10th Mountain positions by drone. He'll therefore need to also set up fake physical sites, and said, which he will likely do by setting up tents or designating a radar, since it can be wheeled around easily. Still, there are trade-offs, Glonek said: the more realistic the unit makes the fake sites, the more soldiers must do to set them up, which could draw the enemy's attention. Regardless, Glonek knows he can always go to Stultz for what to do&mdash;and what not to do. 'We're on a pyramid of innovation,&rdquo; Stulz said. 'What we did was kind of that base layer.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/how-two-units-are-learning-each-other-army-moves-modernize/400431/	2024-10-21T15:49:04-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/21/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_12.31.35PM/large.png
F-35s still missing readiness goals—despite rising spending	The F-35 program has failed to meet a key readiness metric for six straight years, despite a steady increase in spending to operate and maintain the aircraft, according to a new report from a government watchdog agency. The Pentagon spent more than $12 billion to operate and maintain the F-35 fleet from fiscal 2018 to 2023, according to the GAO. But the three F-35 variants were not alone. Seven of the Pentagon's other tactical aircraft programs also failed to meet mission-capable goals for six years straight, and the other five programs missed the target three to five of the last six years. The mission capable rate is the percentage of time during which the aircraft can fly and perform at least one of its tasked missions. 'None of the 15 tactical aircraft variants met their mission-capable goals in fiscal year 2023. Only two&mdash;the F-15C and the F-16C&mdash;met their annual goals in at least half of the years since fiscal year 2018,&rdquo; the GAO said. The F-35 Joint Program Office launched an effort last year to fix the aircraft's poor mission capable rates, called the 'War on Readiness.&rdquo; The program's goal was to increase the fleetwide F-35 mission capable rate by 10 percent by the end of March 2024. However, officials said readiness only rose 2.6 percent within that year, up to 55.7 percent. 'We're not where we need to be on our mission-capable rates, but we have put the elements, I think, into the system that has shown us a path of how we can get there,&rdquo; Lt. Gen. Michael Schmidt, F-35 program executive officer, told reporters last month. Of the 40 previous 'top degraders&rdquo; of readiness, 21 are no longer at the top, Schmidt said in September. But two main problems are still dragging down F-35 readiness, officials say. JPO won't disclose what those two problems are, but Schmidt told Congress in April that if the program can overcome them, the fleetwide mission capable rate would increase to more than 70 percent. [[Related Posts]] The F-35 has long had a rash of sustainment problems, including delays in depot maintenance, spare parts shortages, heavy reliance on contractors, and lack of access to technical data for repairs. Lockheed Martin currently leads and manages sustainment, but that has left the Pentagon with 'limited decision-making ability and influence over depot maintenance,&rdquo; GAO has said. The company will have to relinquish some control over sustainment in the coming years, after lawmakers in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act formally required the military services to take over management of F-35 sustainment by 2027. The total cost of operating and maintaining the triservice jet is expected to surpass $1.5 trillion, according to GAO. From start to finish, the F-35 program is estimated to reach a total cost of $2 trillion.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/f-35s-still-missing-readiness-goalsdespite-rising-spending/400424/	2024-10-21T13:39:16-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/21/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_10.27.57AM/large.png
The D Brief: Russia increases drone strikes; US troops attacked i...	Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin visited Ukraine to announce a new $400 million U.S. weapons pledge Monday. Austin's trip, his fourth as defense secretary, comes as the rate of daily Russian drone attacks have reportedly risen nearly threefold over the past two months heading into winter. At least 116 Russian drones targeted locations across the invaded country, including 10 sent to the capital city from several directions and in different waves over about five hours, military official Serhiy Popko said on Telegram. Panning out: Russian drone attacks in Ukraine 'have increased from 350 strikes in July, to 750 in August, to 1,500 in September,&rdquo; the New York Times reports, citing two Western officials. Austin met with President Volodymir Zelenskyy to discuss 'Ukraine's air defense capabilities, preparations for the winter period, and the expansion of long-range weapon use against Russian military targets,&rdquo; Zelenskyy wrote on social media, thanking the White House as well as 'both parties in the U.S. Congress, and the American people for all their support.&rdquo; Developing: Estonia is looking to acquire weapons and gear to hit an invading force before it reaches the country's borders, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reported this weekend. Officials in Tallinn are also considering boosting their spending on anti-air defenses, perhaps short-range man-portable missiles or longer-range interceptors, the head of Estonia's defense procurement office said. Details, here. NATO chief Mark Rutte called South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Monday, both officials confirmed afterward. Driving that conversation: Recent allegations North Korea has sent around 1,500 special forces to Russia for use against Ukraine. Rutte: 'North Korea sending troops to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine would mark a significant escalation,&rdquo; the new alliance chief said on social media Monday. Yoon: 'Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the reckless military alignment between Russia and North Korea once again confirm that the security of the Indo-Pacific region and the Atlantic region are inextricably linked,&rdquo; the South Korean leader said in a statement. 'This undermines the rules-based international order, threatening peace on the Korean Peninsula and globally, and the government will never stand by and let this happen,&rdquo; he wrote. Expert reax: 'Manpower is likely the single most important factor in the war,&rdquo; said Rob Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. 'If Ukraine's mobilization numbers continue to decrease and Russia can sustain its monthly recruitment efforts (including possibly with North Korean soldiers), the situation will continue to deteriorate unless Ukraine's foreign partners can provide greater support,&rdquo; he warned on social media Saturday.

On this day in 1944, Japanese pilots carried out what some historians believe to be the first-ever deliberate kamikaze attack when an Aichi D3A struck Aussie cruiser HMAS Australia's foremast in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, killing 30 people, including the ship's captain, and wounding 64 others. Update: Navy pronounces missing EA-18G Growler aviators dead. The electronic warfare jet crashed east of Mount Rainier on Tuesday. Their names are being withheld pending notification of next of kin, AP reports. GAO: The U.S. Army has a fleet of 70 boats, but less than 40% are ready to go. That's a steep drop from 75% just four years ago for a fleet spread across Virginia, Hawaii, and Japan, according to a congressionally-mandated watchdog report published last week. Why bring it up? 'Demand for Army watercraft is increasing, especially in the Indo-Pacific,&rdquo; the Government Accountability Office writes in its report. Some of those boats were also called upon to help in the construction a pier for humanitarian aid to Gaza this past spring; in the process, four were beached after becoming unmoored, scattering the pier during bad weather in late May. A Navajo Code Talker from World War II has died at 107. John Kinsel Sr., was among the hundreds of Navajos recruited by the Marines to serve as Code Talkers during the war, 'transmitting messages based on their then-unwritten native language,&rdquo; AP reports.

How might Donald Trump use the U.S. military if he returned to the Oval Office? Against his political enemies, as the GOP president said recently in a Fox interview. Former members of Trump's own national-security team have issued their own warnings about their former boss, documenting his interest in shooting protestors and calling him 'the most dangerous person to this country.&rdquo; Mark Esper: 'He's spoken about this before. If you recall a year ago or so, he spoke about a second Trump term being about retribution. So, yes, I think we should take those words seriously,&rdquo; the former defense secretary told CNN last week. Members of the military should think carefully about how they would react to such orders, observers said.

Trump’s radical view would test the military	How might Donald Trump use the U.S. military if he returned to the Oval Office? Against his political enemies, he says. That's not a warning from his former defense secretary, who has documented the then-president's interest in shooting protestors, nor from the man he appointed chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has since called him 'the most dangerous person to this country.&rdquo; Those are the GOP presidential candidate's own words. Members of the military should think carefully now about how they would react to such orders, observers said. In an extraordinary escalation of rhetoric, Trump suggested the deployment of the National Guard or military against what he terms 'the enemy from within,' which he said included members of his political opposition. The remarks, aired during an Oct. 13 interview on Fox, mark an unprecedented departure from any major-party presidential candidate's publicly evinced view of the role of the military in domestic politics. Trump, asked whether he anticipated Election Day unrest, dismissed concerns about his own supporters and turned his focus to the political opposition, declaring that 'radical left lunatics' posed the true threat. His proposed solution? 'It should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen,&rdquo; he said. The interview Elsewhere in the Oct. 13 interview, Trump also named a former political antagonist as an 'enemy from within.&rdquo; When Fox's Maria Bartiromo asked, 'How are you going to guard against the bureaucrats undermining you?&rdquo;, he responded: 'Well, I always say we have two enemies. We have the outside enemy and then we have the enemy from within, and the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia, and all these countries because if you have a smart president he can handle them pretty easily. I handled&mdash;I got along great with all with&mdash;I handled them. [Much evidence suggests otherwise.] But the thing that's tougher to handle are these lunatics we got inside like Adam Schiff, Adam Shifty Schiff. Thing is this guy's going to be a senator. He's running against a guy who doesn't understand politics at all. Garvey. But he was a good baseball player. But he doesn't understand politics at all. Adam Shifty Schiff, who's a total sleazebag, is gonna become a senator. I call him the enemy from within. You look at the danger he put our country in, potentially, because of Russia with a phony made-up deal that he made up with Hillary and some bad people....&rdquo; Trump was apparently referring to his 2019 impeachment, when he was tried in the Senate for attempting to gin up political dirt by withholding military aid to Ukraine and for allegedly blocking Congressional investigations. Then-Rep. Schiff, D-California, led the House presentation of evidence. He might also have been alluding to the GOP-led Senate investigation that documented 'hundreds of actions by Trump, his campaign, and his associates in the run-up to the 2016 election that involve some degree of participation by Trump or his associates in Russian activity,&rdquo; as Lawfare put it. Trump has long threatened to use state power for personal revenge&mdash;for example, to 'lock up' Hillary Clinton, jail social-media CEOs, and prosecute a wide range of other people, from election workers to the federal and state prosecutors who have charged him with crimes. But by suggesting that domestic political rivals pose an existential threat akin to foreign enemies, he sets up his case for military action. It's a well-worn tactic of authoritarians, whose language Trump apes and whose policies he admires, right down to his stated desire to become a dictator. (Only 'on day one,&rdquo; he said, echoing would-be autocrats' usual promise to resume normal governance at some point.) And Trump has long called for using troops domestically. During his presidency, he repeatedly talked about sending the National Guard to deal with civil unrest, such as the protests following the killing of George Floyd. (Notably, he did not send in the Guard when his supporters stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021.) As a candidate, Trump has vowed to use the military inside America. 'As he has sought a return to power, he has made clear that he intends to use the military for a range of domestic law enforcement purposes, including patrolling the border, suppressing protests that he deems to have turned into riots and even fighting crime in big cities run by Democrats,&rdquo; the New York Times wrote in August. The decline of guardrails Such actions would not necessarily be illegal. Constitutionally, Congress may authorize the deployment of the militia 'to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.&rdquo; With the 1807 Insurrection Act, lawmakers broadly delegated this authorization to the U.S. president, who may call out the troops if 'any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy&rdquo; hinders the execution of state or federal law. (And the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act does not bar the use of troops for law enforcement 'in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.&rdquo;) But the Insurrection Act has been used to deploy troops just twice since the 1960s. 'Why the reticence in using this law?&rdquo; Elizabeth Goitein of Brennan Center wrote in 2020. 'Simply, Americans don't like the idea of armored tanks rolling into their cities. It smacks of authoritarianism; it goes against our values and our national self-concept. And so, even in cases where the Insurrection Act might provide a legal opening&mdash;for instance, in the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina&mdash;the fear of political blowback has been enough to stop presidents from exploiting it.&rdquo; Today, it's not clear that any legal opening is even necessary, thanks to the Supreme Court's recent decision to grant the U.S. president immunity from criminal acts in the conduct of official duties. 'It's almost impossible to conceive of any presidential use of the military as unofficial or private business,&rdquo; National Defense University professor Gregory Foster wrote in a recent op-ed. (One former acting vice chief of the National Guard said it would be easy for a president to turn Guard units into his 'personal police force.&rdquo; Randy Manner, a retired Army two-star, told CNN recently that if Trump found one state governor to go along, he could authorize funds to 'use the National Guard almost in any way that he wants...Most Americans don't know how very easy it would be for an unhinged president to use the military against our own citizens.&rdquo;) Far from worrying about political blowback for sounding authoritarian, Trump is making political hay of it. In 2016, a voter's inclination toward authoritarianism was a better predictor of support for Trump's candidacy than race, gender, or education. Four years later, a quartet of surveys found that some 18 percent of Americans were highly disposed to authoritarianism, and 'a further 23 percent or so are just one step below them on the authoritarian scale,&rdquo; wrote political scientist Matthew MacWilliams. 'When activated by fear, authoritarian-leaning Americans are predisposed to trade civil liberties for strongman solutions to secure law and order; and they are ready to strip civil liberties from those defined as the &lsquo;other.'&rdquo; Who does Trump call the 'other&rdquo;? Immigrants and minority groups, to be sure, but as of this week, also members of the opposition political party. His statements raise the prospect that U.S. troops might be deployed against Americans dubbed 'the enemy&rdquo; for voicing opposition to a president. Mark Esper, who served as defense secretary under Trump, says his former boss intends to do so. 'He's spoken about this before. If you recall a year ago or so, he spoke about a second Trump term being about retribution. So, yes, I think we should take those words seriously,&rdquo; Esper told CNN this week. What happens if he does give the order? The U.S. military, which spends the vast majority of its time contemplating and preparing for contingencies, should prepare for this one as well. Echoing scholars of authoritarianism, NDU's Foster suggests troops and commanders contemplate their moral, ethical, and legal duties now. MacWilliams agrees. 'If he wins [the] election, the military will be asked to do things that violate their oath of office&mdash;the oath they swear to the Constitution. And what are they going to do? They need to think about it ahead of time,&rdquo; he said in a recent interview. 'If Trump wins, the military will decide the future of this country by the actions that it takes.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/trumps-radical-view-would-test-military/400385/	2024-10-18T12:04:20-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/18/trump_GettyImages_2178637365/large.jpg
