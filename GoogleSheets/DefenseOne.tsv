Army to expand tech equipping effort	The Army will expand a new equipment-fielding initiative focused on drones, electronic warfare, and other modern tech to several more units, service leader Gen. Randy George said Tuesday. Two armored brigade combat teams, two Stryker brigade combat teams, and other units in the Guard and Reserves will all get new tech under the program, which George dubbed 'Transformation in Contact 2.0.&rdquo; The Army's transformation-in-contact, or TiC, approach launched in February with the service flooding three brigades with drones, electronic warfare equipment, communications tech, and other technologies. The three brigades are the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division; 2nd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division; and 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. The effort draws in part on lessons learned from Ukraine, where significant drone use has defined the battlefield and underscored the need for smaller command posts as well as counter-drone operations. The three original brigades now boast more than 140 drones, George said. The effort is running in tandem with Army efforts to hide in plain sight on the battlefield, which George said has resulted in the brigades reducing their electromagnetic and physical presence by nearly 90 percent. [[Related Posts]] Transformation in Contact 2.0 will also equip 'protection and sustainment&rdquo; units by the end of fiscal year 2025, George said. Additionally, George said, the Army will focus on three other priorities: improving counter-drone systems, increasing the range and accuracy of Army long-range missiles and other forms of indirect fire, and modernizing Army munitions manufacturing. 'We have to give every formation the right systems to sense, seek, and defeat enemy [drones] to enhance their protection and security,&rdquo; George said. George also repeatedly emphasized that the Army could no longer afford to take a decade or more to field systems. 'We cannot buy programs for ten years at a time anymore, technology changes too fast.&rdquo; Going forward, the service will cut programs that don't support transformation-in-contact efforts, George said. 'There are also some things that we are going to stop buying: old, stand-alone tech that doesn't connect to our network, equipment that can't operate in our [transforming-in-contact] formations, all of the outdated stuff that isn't survivable on the modern battlefield,&rdquo; George said. That could include the cancellation of programs of record, he added. In place of the old acquisition progress, George wants to buy more equipment in tranches, so the Army can purchase different systems from year to year to fulfill a defined need, such as drones. The method would allow the Army to buy whatever technology is newest, rather than committing to a single platform that may be outdated by the time it's rolled out to the last brigade. 'It should be clear to all of us that the days where we indiscriminately could buy an entire Army's worth of inventory in a single program of record are gone,&rdquo; said George. 'We can't afford to invest in obsolescence.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/army-expand-tech-equipping-effort/400296/	2024-10-15T14:33:49-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/15/Screenshot_2024_10_15_at_11.31.38AM-1/large.png
US Army rushes to boost defenses as Russia ups strike-drone auton...	Russia is giving its armed drones more autonomy as Ukraine's defenses tighten, a dynamic that has the U.S. Army working harder to bulk up its own anti-drone and -missile systems, service and industry officials said. Defense One caught up with Sgt. Maj. Kellen Rowley, the top enlisted leader of the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, at the AUSA conference in Washington, D.C. We asked him whether Russia is increasingly relying on autonomy software for drone attacks in order to thwart defensive measures that target the connection between the weapons and their operators. 'They are,&rdquo; Rowley said. 'They are becoming more adaptive. We saw them struggle quite a bit with dynamic targeting. As time has gone on, they've adapted.&rdquo; He declined to comment further. An official from Epirus, which makes advanced counter-drone defenses, said greater autonomy was a growing trend in Russian drone attacks on Ukraine. 'There is clear evidence that full drone autonomy and swarming technology will become more pervasive in this new era of asymmetric warfare. One significant advancement in drone tech we've been closely tracking is the use of fiber-optic-guided and AI-enabled UAS that are immune to jamming and other EW countermeasures. Without a connection to jam or spoof, AI-enabled drones have seen success in Ukraine,&rdquo; the official told Defense One. [[Related Posts]] Epirus makes the Leonidas high-powered microwave system, which is designed to overloads an incoming drone's circuits with energy. That's just one example of the various solutions that the Army is rushing to put in place to deal with drone threats that are growing more diverse and difficult to stop. Russia, Iran, China and North Korea are deepening their collaboration in multiple theaters, resulting in ever-more-capable drones emerging from adversaries that weren't considered terribly high-tech. Maj. Gen. David F. Stewart, a leader of the Army's efforts on fires and anti-drone systems, told the crowd at AUSA that better drones and new tactics are enabling even low-tech adversaries to punch up their attacks, such as a Hezbollah drone strike that killed four Israeli soldiers on Sunday. 'We're seeing a lot of changes in tactics to take these procedures from the adversary. Their flight profiles now are becoming more challenging for radar systems to detect,&rdquo; said Stewart, the director of the Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office and director of fires at the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff. 'I think the better capability to detect the Group 1, 2, and 3 would be very helpful.&rdquo; Brig. Gen. Patrick Costello, who leads the 94th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, said that some new adversary drone weapons were emulating U.S. technology advancements, a trend further enabled by collaboration with Russia and China. 'North Korea recently unveiled a reconnaissance and multi-role UAV that employs a reverse engineered copy of a Hellfire missile similar to an RQ-4 and MQ-9. And so as we watch the relationships that are building,&rdquo; Costello said. He said the Army had just finished an engineering test with the Northrop Grumman XM1211 High Explosive Proximity round, an air-defense munition that is designed to explode near drones that may be attempting counter maneuvers. 'We want to extend it further,&rdquo; he said, with work on an anti-drone proximity round that can be fired from an Mk19 40mm belt-fed automatic grenade launcher. But the need for better drone defenses in more places is adding pressure on the Army to more quickly adapt as it meets the needs of partners. An example is last October's decision to send two Iron Dome systems back to Israel. U.S. Army Multi-Domain Task Force teams in the Indo-Pacific region are working to develop an entirely new capability to replace those Iron Domes: the Indirect Fire Protection Capability &ndash; High-Power Microwave, or IFPC-HPM, also from Epirus. 'We have soldiers out there testing the system. We will be employing it in the next couple of years. As the formation grows, we'll transition from structure of two Iron Dome batteries to a structure of three IFPC batteries, giving us nine platoons worth the capability,&rdquo; he said. 'Absolutely [we are] watching what's going on in CENTCOM, absolutely watching what's going on in UConn, taking every one of those lessons that we could, that we could apply to our theater.&rdquo; But counter-drone defenses are more complicated than roboticized attack drones for reasons beyond autonomy and technology, such as the increasing bureaucratic burdens of trying to work with more partners. Said Rowley of the 10th AMDC, 'I think probably our single biggest challenge is operating inside of NATO. There are 32 member nations in NATO, and our adversaries are exporting gaps to NATO policy. Group one, group one, UAS are able to operate below the threshold, and it's a challenging bit for us, under peacetime conditions and authorities for soldiers to recognize when they should or can engage.. All of that points to a need for more collaboration across the services, the U.S. government and with researchers, industry, and partners, said Stewart, the counter-drone office chief. 'I'm pushing for a whole-of-nation approach, not just a whole government. When we're talking about other interagency partners, it really is going to have to be academia. You're going to have to have the government involved, and then on down the line with the industry as well.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/us-army-rushes-boost-defenses-russia-ups-strike-drone-autonomy/400291/	2024-10-15T13:53:51-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/15/Screenshot_2024_10_15_at_10.45.24AM/large.png
Protest puts Army’s HADES spy plane on hold	Work is paused on the U.S. Army's effort to equip high-flying jets with spy gear as L3Harris protests the service's decision to give the contract to the Sierra Nevada Corporation. In August, SNC won a 12-year contract worth up to almost $1 billion to load Bombardier's Global 6500 jet with spy systems, beating out a team of three companies: L3Harris, Leidos, and MAG Aerospace. L3Harris filed a formal protest on Sept. 16 asking the Government Accountability Office to review the decision, according to a company spokesperson. 'We carefully reviewed the information during the Army's debrief process, which led us to challenge the HADES decision and request further analysis to ensure the proposal received an equitable evaluation,&rdquo; they said. This protest is only a 'temporary setback,&rdquo; said Tim Harper, SNC's vice president of business development. Harper said he's confident in the process and awaits the GAO's decision. 'We stand by our proposed solution and the experienced team of professionals who have diligently worked to create an aerial ISR solution that will give the Army the advantage required for the near-peer fight. Regarding the protest, we remain fully committed and are confident in the superiority of our solution and the Army's selection of SNC for the HADES contract,&rdquo; Harper said. Army officials have previously called 'deep sensing&rdquo;&mdash;that is, efforts to track enemies at a distance&mdash;the service's No. 1 operational imperative for the Army of 2030. The office will make a decision on the protest by Dec. 26. Aviation Week was first to report the protest. As work on HADES is stalled, SNC is continuing to work on the Army's Theater-Level High-Altitude Expeditionary Next Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platform&mdash;called ATHENA, which is gearing up for flight tests this month. The Army is using ATHENA and other prototype programs to figure out requirements ahead of HADES production.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/protest-puts-armys-hades-spy-plane-hold/400277/	2024-10-15T10:06:06-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/15/snc_army_hades_intel_bizjet_contract_copy/large.jpg
In Pacific, Army brigade tweaks its modernization program for jun...	The lone Pacific brigade chosen for the Army's new equipment strategy is finding that the new tech has unique advantages for its terrain &mdash; as well as challenges, the unit's commanding general said Friday. The unit, the 2nd Brigade of the Hawaii-based 25th Infantry Division, is one of just three brigades selected for the Army's 'transforming-in-contact&rdquo; strategy. The two others are the 101st Airborne Division's 2nd Brigade and the 10th Mountain Division's 3rd Brigade. Under the strategy, units are given a range of new tech and told to figure out how to best use it at their home bases and in challenging field exercises. The Army has so focused on drone, counter-drone, and electronic warfare for the strategy, drawing in part on lessons from Ukraine. In an exercise running Oct. 7 to 16 at the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center, the unit brought as many as 150 small drones, said 25th Infantry Division commander Maj. Gen. Marcus Evans. Those drones include around 130 Skydio drones fielded under the Army's Short Range Reconnaissance program, plus Parrot and Teal drones, a 25th Infantry Division public affairs officer said. The Army also leased several Kraus K1000 drones, the spokesperson added. That's a lot more small drones than Army units have generally carried. The service only recently began acquiring such systems and so far has bought them in quantities of a few hundred a year&mdash;generally under the Short Range Reconnaissance Program. Evans said the unit's drones and electronic warfare units are seeing successes in the exercise. After spotting a 'enemy&rdquo; unit through electronic means, they tracked it with drones, and then called in a simulated loitering-munition strike. The unit uses the Switchblade 600 loitering munition, which the Army acquires under the Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance, or LASSO, program. Based on advice from the 101st's 2nd Brigade and their own experience, the 25th's 2nd Brigade has also increased the number of Starlink satellite terminals it uses, Evans said. The 19-by-12-inch dishes provide far faster transmission speeds than traditional Army satellite systems, while being much more portable and easier to hide. The brigade is experimenting with three to four terminals that the commander can re-distribute as necessary, as well as two terminals per battalion. Sustainment assets also get Starlink terminals, Evans said. The terminals are particularly useful for allowing sustainment efforts to disperse, thereby becoming harder to hit. 'They can't all stay together, because they will be targetable,&rdquo; he said. Starlink devices are particularly important in the vast distances of the Pacific. One battalion, for example, is deployed 200 miles away from its brigade command, on a different island, Evans said. The Starlinks allow the brigade to 'overcome the tyranny of distance,&rdquo; he said. At the same time, some Pacific-related factors&mdash;like heat&mdash;play havoc with the very systems at the center of the 'transforming-in-contact&rdquo; experiment. During a previous rotation to the Philippines, drones had 'much less endurance&rdquo; because heat drained their batteries, Evans said. To get more power, the 25th Infantry is testing out a solar-powered generator that allows small light infantry units to recharge batteries used for drones and other systems, he said. The Pacific rains also made problems for drones and mission command systems. Fortunately, the 2nd Brigade has partners &mdash; the two other brigades that are also going through transformation-in-contact. Evans said the 2nd Brigade works closely with the 101st's 2nd Brigade, and has duplicated many elements of how that unit has set itself up. 'Our collaboration with them has been nearly seamless from how we structure our network to how to employ deception measures,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/pacific-army-brigade-tweaks-its-modernization-program-jungle-warfare/400275/	2024-10-15T09:29:51-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/15/2nd_brigade_462793396_957422419759085_8170544672272077243_n/large.jpg
The D Brief: Chinese blockade drill encircles Taiwan; Army progra...	New: China's military carried out snap drills Monday encircling the democratic island of Taiwan, and it did so with no 24-hour notification, no specific locations announced, and no end date for what it referred to as its Joint Sword 2024B exercises&mdash;the -A portion having occurred this past May. Beijing's stated objectives included a 'blockade of key ports and areas,&rdquo; and practicing an 'assault on maritime and ground targets.&rdquo; China's Coast Guard also patrolled the waters surrounding Taiwan over the course of the 12-hour exercise. And Beijing set a new record for aerial pestering around Taiwan, using 153 aircraft&mdash;111 of which entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone, according to Taipei Defense Ministry. 'This is the highest single-day total ever recorded,&rdquo; said Taiwan-watcher Ian Ellis. Taiwan's defense ministry condemned China's actions as 'irrational and provocative&rdquo; and vowed to 'deploy appropriate forces to respond and defend our national sovereignty.&rdquo; It also distributed a map purporting to show China's operating areas around the island. Worth noting: The drills occurred four days after Taiwan President William Lai delivered a 'National Day&rdquo; speech in which he said officials in Beijing have 'no right to represent Taiwan&rdquo; and that the democratic island is 'not subordinate&rdquo; to Beijing, the Taipei Times reports. Official Chinese military reax: The exercises are 'a stern warning to the separatist acts of &lsquo;Taiwan independence' forces,&rdquo; and 'a legitimate and necessary operation for safeguarding national sovereignty and national unity,&rdquo; Eastern Theater Command spokesman Senior Captain Li Xi said in a statement. Official Pentagon reax: 'This military pressure operation is irresponsible, disproportionate, and destabilizing,&rdquo; Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement Monday. 'It is a long-standing tradition for Taiwan's president to deliver remarks on [October 10],&rdquo; he said. 'It is a routine, domestic-focused address that has historically prompted little response from the [People's Republic of China]. Still, the PRC has chosen this opportunity to take provocative, military action.&rdquo; Expert reax: 'It was pretty clear from the outset that no matter what President Lai said, Beijing would use his address to &lsquo;justify' the exercises,&rdquo; said consultant J. Michael Cole. Was China looking to impress Russia? Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov visited Beijing on the very day the snap drills took place, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted Monday evening. 'Russian forces have experience repelling Ukrainian autonomous naval drone strikes against Russian naval and port infrastructure, and the [Chinese military] may hope to absorb some of these lessons in planning for the PRC's potential future actions against Taiwan,&rdquo; ISW wrote atop their daily assessment. New: Taiwan's army just signed contracts to buy nearly 1,000 U.S.-made attack drones, including 685 Switchblade 300 loitering munitions and 291 Altius 600M-V anti-armor attack drones, the South China Morning Post reported Tuesday. Altogether, the contracts are just under $164 million. But don't expect these anytime soon: 'The Switchblade drones are expected to be delivered by the end of November 2029 while the Altius drones are expected to be delivered by the end of 2027,&rdquo; SCMP writes.

Ingram was on the deck of his submarine, Cassin (DD-43), when a German torpedo approached; he rushed to throw depth charges overboard to prevent their detonation and died in the torpedo's explosion. He received the Medal of Honor and became the namesake of a U.S. Navy warship, the first U.S. enlisted sailor so honored. Developing: The Pentagon is sending a THAAD air defense battery to Israel in anticipation of additional attacks from Iran. After all, according to manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the system is a 'combat-proven defense capability against short, medium and intermediate-range ballistic missile threats.&rdquo; And Iran has an enormous stockpile of ballistic missiles, as think tanks like the Center for Strategic and International Studies note. Latest: 'An advance team of U.S. military personnel and initial components&rdquo; arrived Monday, with the rest expected 'in the coming days,&rdquo; the Pentagon's Maj. Gen. Ryder said in a statement Tuesday morning. Sending the battery to Israel 'underscores the United States' commitment to the defense of Israel and to defend Americans in Israel from any ballistic missile attacks by Iran,&rdquo; Ryder said, declining to elaborate on precise timelines 'for operations security reasons.&rdquo; By the way: Israel 'faces a looming shortage of interceptor missiles as it prepares itself for attacks from Iran and its proxies,&rdquo; the Financial Times reported Tuesday, citing industry executives, former military officials and analysts. Developing: Israel is also planning to attack Iranian military targets instead of its energy sector, the Washington Post reported Monday afternoon. Israeli officials have promised a response following Iran's attack on October 1 featuring around 200 ballistic missiles, many of which appear to have struck an air force base hosting F-35 jets in southern Israel, according to satellite imagery. Oil prices dropped 4% on the news, Reuters reported Tuesday morning. ICYMI: A Hezbollah drone attack Sunday killed four Israeli soldiers and wounded 61 others in the town of Binyamina. The Iran-backed militants used at least three different kinds of projectiles&mdash;drones, rockets, and three precision missiles&mdash;simultaneously to attack Israel, which likely contributed to the attack's unusually high casualty count, according to a preliminary investigation by the Israeli air force. 'The [Israeli] Navy and Iron Dome [air defense system] intercepted two of the drones near Nahariya and Acre but detection systems lost track of a third drone, a Shahed 107&mdash;which ultimately impacted in Binyamina,&rdquo; the Washington-based ISW relayed Monday afternoon. Notable: Hezbollah reportedly attempted a similar tactic on Monday, but did not have similar results.

New: The U.S. Army wants to recruit 61,000 new soldiers this fiscal year, which is a sharp increase over last year, Defense One's Sam Skove reported Monday from the annual Association of the U.S. Army convention in Washington. The 61,000 number is similar to the Army's 2022 recruiting goal of 60,000 and its 2023 target of 65,000 new soldiers. Both years the Army missed its target by about 15,000 soldiers, Skove writes. But the service exceeded its fiscal year 2024 recruiting target of 55,000 new soldiers&mdash;though by just half a percent. Notable: Secretary Christine Wormuth signaled that the Army is open to cutting more programs. That warning comes nine months after the service canceled a major helicopter program because it said unmanned, current, and space-based assets could do the job. (The service had already spent nearly $2 billion on the program, known as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft.) 'As we continue modernizing our weapons systems, we are also asking ourselves every step of the way, 'Does this capability make our troops more lethal?&rdquo; Wormuth said. 'If the answer to any of those questions is 'no' or even 'maybe,' we are willing to make hard choices and adjust course.&rdquo; More, here. Also in Defense One: 'The X-Men and Avengers have lessons for international defense cooperation,&rdquo; writes retired Air Force Lt. Col. Dan Ward, who is now Senior Principal Systems Engineer at the MITRE Corporation; And global 'Sales of anti-armor missiles [are] projected to slow,&rdquo; according to a report from our sister site, Forecast International. And lastly: Former President Trump suggested using the National Guard and military against his political enemies. In an echo of 1950s-era Sen. Joe McCarthy, the GOP presidential candidate said on a Sunday interview show that the United States is threatened by an 'enemy from within.&rdquo; And should a violence break out on Election Day, 'I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen,&rdquo; he told a Fox interviewer, adding that 'the bigger problem is the enemy from within, not even the people that have come in and destroyed our country.&rdquo; Who is the enemy? He named Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who presented evidence against him during his first impeachment trial.

Sales of anti-armor missiles projected to slow	The long-predicted demise of the tank has not arrived yet, despite the continuing sales of anti-tank munitions. Armed forces will likely spend $20 billion on short-range anti-armor weapons in the next decade, according to a new report out from Forecast International. Annual sales are expected to dip in the short term, but will likely rise again after that, with total production expected to average around 26,000, the report says. The U.S. and Europe are working on new missiles to meet the needs of different military services. The U.S. Joint Air-to-Ground Missile program has seen several delays to its planned in-service date, but appears to be avoiding the fate of its predecessor: the cancelled Joint Common Missile program. U.S. firms, such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are the leading players in this market, accounting for a combined 28 percent value share with the Javelin joint venture and other programs. Europe's position has declined to around a 19 percent value share but is expected to improve with the development of new systems. Europe is moving to develop new anti-armor missiles and hold on to its share of this market. The MMP (Akeron MP) and MLP programs aim to replace the MILAN and HOT, respectively. MBDA is working to interest more European companies in participating in these programs. A trend to watch out for: anti-ship missiles have begun to become multi-purpose weapons that can engage a wider variety of targets. Could anti-armor missiles be next?	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/militaries-are-snapping-anti-armor-missiles/400267/	2024-10-14T16:15:10-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/14/A_Ukrainian_Army_sol_2500/large.jpg
Army ups recruiting target for FY25 after hitting goal	The Army wants to recruit 61,000 new soldiers this fiscal year, a sharp increase over last year and a return to the higher goals of the previous two years. The target is 'ambitious, but achievable,&rdquo; Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said as the annual meeting of the Association of the U.S. Army, or AUSA, opened on Monday in downtown Washington, D.C. The Army has already begun working on its fiscal 2025 goal: recruiters have enlisted some 11,000 soldiers who will begin serving next year under the delayed entry program. The Army exceeded its fiscal year 2024 recruiting target of 55,000 new soldiers by half a percent. Its success was due in part to its implementation of a program designed to get applicants' physical fitness and test scores up to scratch. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, this Future Soldier Preparatory Course graduated 13,206 students into basic training in 2024. The 61,000 number is similar to the Army's 2022 recruiting goal of 60,000 and its 2023 target of 65,000 new soldiers. Both years the Army missed its goal by about 15,000 soldiers. The service has attributed its recruiting struggles to low unemployment numbers, the prevalence of obesity, and the COVID-19 pandemic preventing recruiters from visiting high schools. At the same time, the Army is working to retain the talent it already has, especially in technically complex fields like electronic warfare and drone operation, which are at the center of an Army modernization pushed dubbed 'transforming in contact.&rdquo; Speaking at a media roundtable after Wormuth's speech, Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Randy George said retention numbers are higher than normal in the three brigades selected for the modernization program. Wormuth also signaled that the Army is open to cutting more programs, nine months after canceling a major helicopter program because it concluded unmanned, current, and space-based assets could do the job. The Army had already spent nearly $2 billion on the program, the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft. 'As we continue modernizing our weapons systems, we are also asking ourselves every step of the way, 'Does this capability make our troops more lethal?&rdquo; Wormuth said. 'If the answer to any of those questions is 'no&rdquo; or even 'maybe,&rdquo; we are willing to make hard choices and adjust course.&rdquo; The Army is also collaborating with Congress to develop what Wormuth called 'more agile funding&rdquo; mechanisms to acquire drones and counter-drone and electronic warfare technology. The service recently worked with Congress to reprogram money to start fielding company-level drones in 2025 instead of 2024, and to field 3D printers to units for creating their own drones, Army acquisition secretary chief Doug Bush said at an event held by think tank CSIS.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/army-ups-recruiting-target-fy25-after-hitting-goal/400265/	2024-10-14T15:43:56-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/14/Army_Secretary_Chris_2500/large.jpg
The X-Men and Avengers have lessons for international defense coo...	As tensions rise with Russia and China, America's greatest strategic advantage lies not in any single weapons system, but in our unparalleled network of global alliances. While our rivals struggle to maintain even a handful of true partners, the United States stands at the center of a coalition that is greater than anything Nick Fury and Charles Xavier combined could ever imagine. But are we fully leveraging this strength when it comes to developing and acquiring new military capabilities? The truth is, we're not&mdash;at least not yet. Despite fighting alongside coalition partners in virtually every modern conflict, from Afghanistan to the Pacific, America's defense acquisition workforce tends to operate in relative isolation. Our program offices develop new systems with little input from the very allies who will fight beside us. We train as we fight, but we don't buy as we fight. It's as if we're trying to save the world with Iron Man suits while ignoring the rest of the Avengers. Yes, Tony Stark's tech is amazing, but he's far less effective when he goes solo. The real-world disconnect between our operational reality and our acquisition practices introduces unnecessary risks into our national defense posture. Systems developed without allied input may lack crucial interoperability features or fail to account for coalition priorities. We may reinvent wheels that our partners have already perfected or miss opportunities to pool resources and talent. It's like one hero trying to close that scary portal over New York City without coordinating with the rest of the team; it's inefficient and potentially disastrous. Talking with our allies is essential The solution is surprisingly simple, although not necessarily easy: Our acquisition professionals must talk to their international counterparts. Their conversations need not be restricted to formal, highly structured environments&mdash;which certainly have their value&mdash;but should also include informal personal connections that foster collaboration and mutual understanding. It's less about building 'International Joint Coalition Allied System Program Offices&rdquo; (which, let's be honest, would be a nightmare to develop) and more about quietly eating shawarma together after the battle. Those are the connections that make the more rigorous conversations easier. Imagine if every American program manager, engineer, and contracting officer had ongoing relationships with peers in allied nations. It would be like creating our own global defense version of S.H.I.E.L.D. Acquisition professionals from around the world could share ideas, discuss common challenges, and identify opportunities for joint development or shared investment. They could build an organic understanding of each other's needs, priorities, capabilities, and limitations. This web of connections would not only improve our technical capabilities but also evolve in unpredictable ways and strengthen the human bonds that form the true foundation of our alliances. After all, even Iron Man and Wolverine eventually learned to trust and work with others. Creating these connections doesn't require massive policy overhauls or new international agreements. As I stated in a recent whitepaper, some policy updates would help, but ultimately it starts with simple steps like creating forums for international exchange, establishing fellowship programs, or even just encouraging acquisition professionals to reach out to their foreign counterparts. We may not have Professor X's Cerebro system, but we do have smartphones. Let's use them. And to be clear, this is not just about increasing the Defense Department's foreign military sales efforts. Instead, it's about widening the ecosystem and designing our systems with allies in mind, which means actually talking with them and building partnerships that flow in both directions. We might even discover that some of Wakanda's tech outperforms Stark Industries. One promising sign is the new International Joint Requirements Oversight Council, or I-JROC, initiative, which brings together the vice chiefs of defense of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia to 'identify and validate joint and combined warfighter proposals.&rdquo; As Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Christopher Grady explained in a recent article, 'Interoperability and interchangeability are easier to achieve when pursued from the beginning&hellip;&rdquo; and that he would like to 'add more allies and partnerships to the conversation to address our future challenges and opportunities&mdash;together.&rdquo; With an I-JROC validating warfighter proposals, we also need program managers who have an informed international perspective as they turn these proposals into capabilities. On a similar note, last month President Biden hosted the 'Quad&rdquo; Leaders&mdash;prime ministers from Australia, India, and Japan&mdash;to discuss military defense in the Indo-Pacific, among other topics. Their conversation is an outstanding example for the wider acquisition community to follow. I'm sure you can draw your own superhero-themed metaphor at this point. Benefits outweigh technical challenges The benefits of this approach extend far beyond improved interoperability. By tapping into the collective expertise of our allies, we gain access to a broader pool of innovation and talent. We can aggregate demand to drive down costs and accelerate delivery timelines. It's the difference between facing Thanos alone or with the combined might of Earth's mightiest heroes. And just as importantly, it would send a powerful message of deterrence, based on the strength and unity of our alliances&mdash;a message that stands in stark contrast to the isolation of our rivals. Critics may point to potential security risks or the technical challenges of 'design by committee.&rdquo; These are valid concerns, but they are far outweighed by the risks of continuing to develop capabilities in isolation. With thoughtful guidelines and a clear shared vision, international collaboration can actually improve security by creating legitimate pathways for technology sharing that reduce incentives for espionage. Creating something like Five Eyes for the Industrial Base would be an intriguing piece of this puzzle. As we face a future of intensifying great power competition, America's alliances remain our ace in the hole. Russia and China, for all their bluster, can count their true partners on one hand&mdash;or one finger. They're more Hydra than Avengers. In contrast, the United States has dozens of genuine partners, representing a staggering share of global military and economic power. By fostering personal connections between our acquisition professionals and their allied counterparts, we can turn this latent strength into a true force multiplier. It's time to buy the way we fight: together, with our allies. Dan Ward is a military technologist and innovation catalyst at MITRE.

Boeing defense will take $2B in 3Q losses; company to cut 10% of ...	Boeing's defense business continued bleeding in the third quarter of 2024 as troubled programs, fixed-price contracts, and an inability to reach a deal with thousands of striking machinists dragged down the company. On Friday, the aerospace giant announced that it will cut 10% of its entire workforce, roughly 17,000 people, in order to 'position&rdquo; itself for the future. The dramatic move comes after 30,000 company workers rejected a new labor contract and stopped working last month&mdash;a strike with no end in sight. In a letter to employees, CEO Kelly Ortberg noted 'substantial new losses&rdquo; for Boeing's defense business, driven by work stoppage on military aircraft built at its factories, including the commercial-derived Air Force KC-46 tanker and Navy P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, continued program challenges, and the decision to end production of its 767 freighter, the basis of the KC-46, in 2027. 'Defense, Space & Security expects to recognize pre-tax earnings charges of $2 billion on the T-7A, KC-46A, commercial crew, and MQ-25 programs. The T-7A program pre-tax charge of $0.9 billion was driven by higher estimated costs on production contracts in 2026 and beyond. The KC-46A program pre-tax charge of $0.7 billion reflects the decision to conclude production on the 767 freighter and impacts of the IAM [International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers] work stoppage. Results also include unfavorable performance on other programs,&rdquo; according to the company's preliminary third-quarter results. The head of Boeing's defense sector, Ted Colbert, was pushed out of the job just a few weeks ago, and the company has yet to announce his successor. The company will hold its third-quarter call on October 23.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/boeing-defense-will-take-2b-3q-losses-company-cut-10-entire-workforce/400258/	2024-10-11T15:16:11-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/11/A_strike_sign_is_pic_2500/large.jpg
How many drones does the Army need? More.	The Army is buying hundreds of small drones as it starts to equip its infantry with warfare's latest must-have weapon, but that's not nearly enough. The experience of current units suggests the service will need to buy thousands per year just to meet training objectives, let alone go to war. In February, Army Chief of Staff Randy George announced the 'transforming-in-contact&rdquo; effort, in which would send new kit to three infantry brigades that would evaluate it. The strategy focuses on technologies the Army sees as important for the future of warfare, including improved communications, electronic warfare capabilities, and small drones. The three units are the 101st Airborne's 2nd Brigade, the 25th Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade, and 10th Mountain 3rd Brigade. The Army may yet add more; the 3rd Infantry Division, for example, is hastening to apply lessons from these brigades' experience. Alongside the new tech have come new formations designed to use the drones for maximum effectiveness. In the 101st Airborne, drone-focused units include the Multifunctional Reconnaissance Company, or MFRC, a formation designed to dwell deep behind an enemy's lines and observe their movement. The company consists of three reconnaissance platoons, as well as an electronic warfare platoon and a robotics and autonomous systems, or RAS, platoon. Each reconnaissance unit comes with up to six short-range drones, while the robotics and autonomous systems platoon fly heavier, longer-range drones like Performance Drone Works C100. The drones are used for reconnaissance, artillery fire correction, and light bombing. In addition to the MFRC, the 101st's three battalions also have one new drone platoon apiece.. The platoons are staffed by seven operators for their 12 short-range drones, or a little under two drones per operator. In total, that's as many as 54 short-range drones, plus the heavier systems used by the RAS platoon. That's much more than units previously fielded, but even more may be needed to make up for losses in training. During intensive training, like that seen during rotation in a combat training center, one drone platoon commander said he expected that at least one drone every other day would fall victim to operator or mechanical error. While sturdy, drones are prone to any number of accidents: an operator may accidentally clip a tree branch, the drone could lose signal, or the battery could drain before the drone gets back to base. Other brigades are fielding similarly large numbers of drones, and are also grappling with malfunctions. In 2022, the Army's 25th Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade began experimenting with drone training and acquisition even before it was selected as a 'transforming-in-contact&rdquo; brigade this year. After months of effort, the unit's rifle platoons are now 'fully fielded&rdquo; with between five and seven small drones per platoon, said brigade commander Col. Graham White by email in August. That's a total of 189 small drones. White said that it was a 'safe assumption&rdquo; that around 25 percent of drones would irretrievably break or or be lost during intensive training missions, like those in a combat training center. White is now chief of staff of the 25th Infantry Division. Overall, he said he expected that all of a platoon's drones would 'break, crash or require minor repair&rdquo; over an expected five year life cycle. White added that 3D printing and in-house repair systems and technicians were therefore key for keeping drone units operational. He said they were 'gaining ground in both areas.&rdquo; At an September event held by think tank CSIS, Army acquisition head Doug Bush said that the service had recently gotten approval from Congress to reprogram money to give units 3D printers to print drone parts. The numbers deployed by the 101st Airborne Division and 25th Infantry Division, in turn, suggests the Army will need to start buying drones by the thousands. If all 59 of the Army's active and National Guard brigades follow the lead of the 101st Airborne, for example, over 3,000 short-range drones would be required to equip their platoons. To make up for training losses, the Army will also need to regularly buy replacements. Assuming a rate of 25 percent lost per year during intensive training, the Army might need to purchase another 1,000 drones or so per year. This number may vary by brigade type, which could increase or decrease drone needs. An armored brigade, for example, can more easily take advantage of tethered drones, which can be connected to a vehicle and therefore less easily lost. That number does not include a number of other drones the Army is buying or considering. In September, the Army chose Anduril's Ghost X and Performance Drone Works' C-100 to field as their company-level drone. The Army is also working on plans to acquire long-range drones, first-person-view loitering munitions, and tethered drones. It also does not include the number of drones needed in an actual war. Russia and Ukraine both lose thousands of drones per month to electronic warfare, bullets, and missiles. Industry observers could see some concrete steps in the coming months. In December and January, Teal and Skydio, respectively, announced they were competing for the second tranche of the Army's Short Range Reconnaissance program. The Army is moving relatively swiftly to buy drones. The requirement for the company-level drone, for example, was approved in June 2023, with an award for tranche one in September 2024. And the Army has signaled it wants to buy in quantity. Speaking at a Defense News event in September, Bush said that the Army was seeking to buy drones in the same quantity it buys ammunition. 'We need them potentially at a very large scale and very quickly,&rdquo; Bush said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/how-many-drones-does-army-need-more/400251/	2024-10-11T13:57:41-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/11/8273054/large.jpg
How Russia, China envision nuking US satellites: from above and b...	Nearly six decades after the Outer Space Treaty banned military activities in space, its norms appear to be losing their power. In May, U.S. officials from the Defense and State Departments disclosed the possibility of Russia deploying a nuclear-detonation device into space, and that a suspected testbed satellite had already been in orbit for two years. China, meanwhile, has embarked on a campaign to expand its strategic nuclear forces beyond the numbers required for 'minimum deterrence&rdquo; and develop new delivery platforms, including a fractional orbital bombardment system. Chinese and Russian interest in space nukes derives from their expressed anxiety over the U.S. strategy of deploying large and widely dispersed satellite constellations, such as the Space Development Agency's 'Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture,&rdquo; as well as commercial networks such as SpaceX's Starlink communications satellites. SDA Director Derek Tournear has described his agency's 'proliferation&rdquo; as a game-changing strategy of resilience, using numbers and architecture to keep U.S. space networks working despite single-point attacks via kinetic, directed-energy, or electromagnetic means. However, this has threatened the sense of 'space deterrence&rdquo; gained by China and Russia through their own investments in anti-satellite weapons. Using nuclear effects to hold entire orbital regimes at risk offers an alternative way to counter such proliferated constellations. Yet not all nuclear detonations in space are equal. Understanding the different Russian and Chinese concepts for nuclear ASAT weapons, so far as they are understood in the public realm, will be crucial to any multilateral efforts to secure the space domain. Russia aims high... In early May, Assistant Secretary of State Mallory Stewart said Russia had not yet deployed an operational nuclear device in space, and, even if they had, it would not directly threaten human life. She did disclose, however, that Russia had launched a test satellite. 'Russia has publicly claimed that their satellite is for scientific purposes,&rdquo; Stewart said. 'However, the orbit is in a region not used by any other spacecraft&mdash;that in itself was somewhat unusual &ndash; and the orbit is a region of higher radiation than normal lower-Earth orbits.&rdquo; Amateur observers quickly identified the satellite as Cosmos-2553 and its unusual orbit to be 2,000 km up, at the upper edge of low-Earth orbit, or LEO. Ostensibly carrying a synthetic aperture radar payload, Cosmos-2553 may have secondary payloads or otherwise be used to help understand the radiation and electromagnetic environment relevant to a nuclear ASAT program. In Congressional testimony, then-Assistant Defense Secretary John Plumb revealed a rationale for why that might be important. 'Some [satellites] would be caught in an immediate [nuclear] blast, which they would not be able to survive the flux of that. And then others could be damaged over time&hellip;if [the] Van Allen belts are pumped,&rdquo; Plumb told lawmakers. Plumb was referring to the Van Allen radiation belts that surround Earth. Cosmos-2553 orbits within the inner Van Allen belt&mdash;much higher, incidentally, than the infamous 1962 Starfish Prime nuclear detonation by the United States that damaged or disabled one-third of the satellites in orbit at the time. U.S. analysts appear to believe that the Russian nuclear ASAT intent is to rapidly 'pump&rdquo; the inner Van Allen radiation belt and transform areas of low-Earth orbit and some higher altitudes into high-exposure zones. Most satellites in LEO are designed to operate in a relatively benign radiation environment, given the natural protection of Earth's magnetic field. Satellites in higher orbits are generally built to withstand higher radiation exposure, so they would be less susceptible than their more numerous compatriots closer to Earth. A nuclear blast 2,000 km up would likely not cause much immediate damage, but repeated passes through artificially augmented radiation belts could quickly degrade satellite electronics. Sun-synchronous satellites and any others with inclinations taking them through energized field lines would be the first to fail. This effect would also linger. Plumb indicated that the effects of a Russian attack might last a year. High-energy particles released by Starfish Prime stayed in orbit for at least five. ...while China goes low Beijing appears to have different ideas about nuclear detonation in space. China's leading military technologists and strategic thinkers have identified space as the linchpin for U.S. military operations, with a remarkably close reading of U.S. military concepts and verbiage. For example, Wu Mingxi, chief scientist at one of China's largest military conglomerates and author of an influential book on the future of warfare, writes, 'In space-based information network construction and space-based information applications, the United States is the leader.&hellip;Through the practice of war, they have accelerated space-based information applications and increased the pace of progress&hellip;greatly decreasing the time of their &lsquo;Observe, Orient, Decide, Attack' (OODA) loop.&rdquo; Col. John Boyd defined the final segment of his OODA loop as 'act,&rdquo; but here Wu rendered it as '攻击&rdquo; or 'attack.&rdquo; The central thesis of Wu's vision is not to overmatch the United States in a correlation-of-forces contest, but to change the terms of conflict by unleashing a networked system-of-systems powered by AI to react exponentially faster than an opponent. Using nuclear detonation to strike a critical blow to U.S. space assets would severely hamper the operational tempo of U.S. forces, despite the SDA's proliferated networks. A review of literature of PRC papers on nuclear detonation in space has shown a steady progression from relatively crude simulations of burst-shell dynamics to fine-tuning the parameters of a detonation to achieve different shapes and effects. Advancements in AI and supercomputing also allow research and planning that was not possible back in the Cold War. China has the capacity to model these nuclear detonations precisely without the need for real-world testing, which is prohibited by international treaties. In contrast to the apparent Russian model of pumping the Van Allen belts from above, PRC research has focused on using atmospheric effects from below LEO, generating ionizing radiation and high-energy particles closer to Earth. Such effects could be more finely modulated with yields as low as one kiloton. One potential delivery means might be the FOBS-Hypersonic Glide Vehicle hybrid platform that China demonstrated in 2021. It could carry a warhead to any point around the Earth, but in a different path than traditional ballistic missile delivery, making it less likely to be perceived as a strategic nuclear attack. A detonation from below LEO would produce immediate radiation effects on any satellites within line-of-sight. A localized augmented artificial radiation belt and a plume of radioactive debris might persist for weeks or longer. Such a weapon would still be indiscriminate and affect any satellite passing through the region. Closer to Earth, such a device would also generate an electromagnetic pulse propagating downward through the atmosphere to affect any unshielded terrestrial electronics, particularly long-distance wires such as power lines or telecom cables. Still, a single shot would be less global in scale and shorter in duration than the above apparent Russian nuclear ASAT. Intentions matter How likely are China and Russia to implement such an extreme and treaty-breaking plan for weaponizing space? After China's 20th Party Congress in 2022, party leaders directed its military to 'construct a strong strategic deterrence force structure,&rdquo; and face down the 'myriad cross-domain challenges of a networked space force.&rdquo; To create this new deterrence force structure, the People's Liberation Army was directed to go beyond traditional thinking and use both nuclear and conventional forces in new ways. In Russia, Vladimir Putin revealed novel nuclear doomsday devices in 2018 and has since repeatedly rattled his nuclear sabers during his invasion of Ukraine. Prominent Russia analyst Masha Gessen concluded that Putin is determined to foist new nuclear doctrine on the world. One aspect that is still unclear about either mode of nuclear ASAT is whether the warhead would be a thermonuclear or fission bomb. Fusion detonations are more efficient at producing prompt radiation effects, while a fission bomb might be more effective at contaminating the space environment with persistent radioactive flux. After Starfish Prime detonated a thermonuclear warhead 400 km up, Apollo program engineers were particularly concerned about an explosion doped with uranium-238, which would generate a higher concentration of beta particles and other fission debris, pumping the Van Allen radiation belts 'a hundredfold.&rdquo; A specially designed warhead could optimize the destructive advantages of both. In April 2024, the international community called upon Russia and China to recommit to their obligations as signatories to the Outer Space Treaty and its prohibition against deploying nuclear weapons in space. Tellingly, Russia vetoed the UN Security Council resolution and China abstained. For the sake of the global commons, the urgency to forestall and reverse the weaponization of space has rarely been higher. David D. Chen is a Senior Analyst for BluePath Labs.

CMMC's final rule has now landed	The Defense Department on Friday released the final rule for its Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification program, but this is just one of several final steps until CMMC goes into force. DOD will publish the rule officially on Monday and that is when the clock starts ticking for Congressional Review Act period. Congress does not have to approve the rule, but it does have 60 days to block the rule. Most observers have told us that is unlikely. CMMC is DOD's effort to get contractors to protect controlled but unclassified information they hold in their systems. Contractors need that information to do their work for defense and intelligence agency customers. This data is generally called CUI. CMMC creates a third-party certification process contractors must go through to show they comply with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's cybersecurity standard 800-171. Until this point, contractors have self-certified their compliance. At a Professional Services Council-hosted event on Tuesday, a pair of DOD leaders hinted at CMMC's imminent release and offered advice to industry on how to comply once the rule is final. The clock begins ticking on Monday (Oct. 14), so the 60-day window ends on Dec. 13. The final rule released n the Federal Register pre-publication site is known as a part 32 rule, which has been described to us as the internal mechanisms DOD must have in place and hold contractors responsible for. Comments are due Tuesday for the part 48 CMMC rule, which is the 'external.&rdquo; This rule dictates the changes in Federal Acquisition Regulations that implement the part 32 rule. The part 48 rule is widely expected to become final by the end of this year, or into early 2025. It also must go through the 60-day Congressional Review Act process. Only when both part 32 and 48 are final will the full roll-out of CMMC begin. But DOD can begin to act on the rule while it is going through the Congressional Review Act process. The final rule released Monday likely does not contain wholesale changes from the draft final rule released in December 2023. But any changes could be seen as significant. There were open questions with the draft, particularly around how managed service providers would be handled. The rule is 470 pages long, so there is a lot of reading for all of us to do. Download the final rule here.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/cmmcs-final-rule-has-now-landed/400224/	2024-10-11T10:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/11/CMMCruleWT20241011-1/large.jpg
The D Brief: Israeli strikes in Lebanon, Syria; More Red Sea atta...	Israeli forces grind on in Lebanon: Nearly two dozen people were killed and at least 130 others wounded in an overnight attack by Israeli forces in Beirut. According to Reuters, 'Security sources said the target was senior Hezbollah official Wafiq Safa, and that he had survived.&rdquo; New: The United Nations says two of its peacekeepers were injured Friday 'after two explosions occurred close to an observation tower&rdquo; in southern Lebanon, where Israeli forces are trying to force residents to flee while they hunt suspected Hezbollah militants. UN spox, speaking to the BBC: 'It looks more of a deliberate attack against our troops, who have been in the south to try to bring back stability at the moment, and it's very, very challenging,&rdquo; Andrea Tenenti said Friday. 'How can this be a mistake from an army that is pretty well prepared, and they know what they're doing?&rdquo; he asked. Also new: Israeli tanks also broke into a UN position elsewhere in Labbouneh on Friday. 'This is a serious development, and [UN forces in Lebanon, aka UNIFIL] reiterates that the safety and security of UN personnel and property must be guaranteed and that the inviolability of UN premises must be respected at all times,&rdquo; the UN said Friday. 'Any deliberate attack on peacekeepers is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and Security Council resolution 1701 (2006),&rdquo; UN officials said. Israeli military reax: 'Hezbollah operates from within and near civilian areas in southern Lebanon, including areas near @UNIFIL posts,&rdquo; the Israeli Defense Forces said Thursday on social media, without offering supporting evidence in this instance. After confirming its troops were indeed near that position in Labbouneh, the IDF said it had 'instructed the UN forces in the area to remain in protected spaces, after which the forces opened fire in the area.&rdquo; Read more on why Israel is undeterred by the allegations, according to Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, here. A separate UN report Thursday accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza 'with relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities,&rdquo; officials announced from Geneva. 'Children in particular have borne the brunt of these attacks, suffering both directly and indirectly from the collapse of the health system,&rdquo; the UN said. UN: 'Israeli security forces have deliberately killed, detained and tortured medical personnel and targeted medical vehicles while tightening their siege on Gaza and restricting permits to leave the territory for medical treatment. These actions constitute the war crimes of wilful killing and mistreatment and of the destruction of protected civilian property and the crime against humanity of extermination.&rdquo; Separately, 'Male detainees were subjected to rape, as well as attacks on their sexual and reproductive organs and forced to perform humiliating and strenuous acts while naked or stripped as a form of punishment or intimidation to extract information,&rdquo; the UN said. 'The lack of accountability for actions ordered by senior Israeli authorities and carried out by individual members of Israeli security forces and the increasing acceptance of violence against Palestinians have allowed such conduct to continue uninterrupted, becoming systematic and institutionalized,&rdquo; said Navi Pillay, who chaired the commission that investigated the alleged war crimes. Israeli reax: 'This U.N. report is detached from reality and includes baseless claims about Israel,&rdquo; said Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon. Stateside observation: 'So far the penalties or accountability measures the IDF and Netanyahu government experience for failure to meet [the State Department's] basic expectations regarding civilian safety are invisible, if they exist at all,&rdquo; Defense One's Patrick Tucker wrote this week on social media. And in case you missed it, 'Israel's air campaign across Syria last week was the most aggressive seen in the 13yr crisis&mdash;with 17 rounds of strikes in 7 [out of] 14 of Syria's provinces,&rdquo; Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute noted Thursday on social media.

On this night in 1942, the Battle of Cape Esperance took place at the Solomon Islands amid what we now refer to as the Guadalcanal campaign. U.S. forces at Central Command have been awfully quiet lately despite recent Houthi calls to continue attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea and along Yemen's coast. The European Union's regional naval mission EUNAVFOR ASPIDES has been similarly quiet about action off the Yemeni coast over the past several days. New: British maritime authorities say another ship was hit with unspecified projectiles (reportedly drones) off Yemen's coast Thursday, near the Bab el Mandeb strait. The vessel 'sustained damage,&rdquo; but no fires broke out and no one was harmed. About the targeting location: The Bab el Mandeb 'is a place where one can bottleneck and quite precisely predict a tankers movement based on bearing and speed,&rdquo; regional analyst Mike Knights writes. 'An anti-ship ballistic missile needs under 120 secs to reach the target loc from launch sites north of Taizz,&rdquo; he adds. Targeted: The chemical tanker Olympic Spirit as it traveled from Egypt's Port Said to Muscat, Oman, according to regional security analyst Basha. The Houthis claim to have used 11 ballistic missiles and two drones in their attacks on Olympic Spirit. The Houthis also say they struck a different container ship (St. John) using a 'winged missile&rdquo; on Thursday. Context, via Reuters: 'Houthi fighters in Yemen have carried out nearly 100 attacks on ships crossing the Red Sea since November and say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's year-long war in Gaza. They have sunk two vessels, seized another and killed at least four seafarers.&rdquo; NATO's commercial-space strategy will resemble the Pentagon's six-month-old strategy, said Maj. Gen. Devin Pepper, deputy chief of staff for strategic plans and policy at NATO's Allied Command Transformation. Set for release next year, the alliance strategy will reflect a growing commercial market, and the need for a 'new relationship&rdquo; between the military and industry, NATO officials said in an Oct. 2 release. The U.S. strategy aimed to define what needs industry could fill, and opened the door for military protection of industry assets, but was criticized for breaking little ground, and lacking a specific roadmap. DIA's AI-powered intel repository heads to the cloud. 'We expect&rdquo; the Machine-assisted Analytic Rapid-repository System to be approved to run on the SIPRNet 'within the next few weeks, actually,&rdquo; said Doug Cossa, chief information officer of the Defense Intelligence Agency, speaking at an Intelligence and National Security Alliance virtual event on Tuesday. MARS will replace the MIDB&mdash;the late-1990s Modernized Integrated Database&mdash;as the Pentagon's main repository for 'foundational military intelligence,&rdquo; the info collected on other countries' militaries and infrastructure. A year behind? Last November, the DIA's then-chief said MARS would hit full operational capability in 2025. This week, DIA officials said in separate statements that 'the scheduled FOC is 2026&rdquo; and then that it would be reached 'as early as 2025, but no later than 2026.&rdquo; Secret space plane tests new orbit-switching maneuver. One of the Space Force's X-37Bs will try aerobraking&mdash;using the Earth's gravity and atmosphere to change orbits&mdash;in a maneuver that promises to use less fuel that the usual firing of rockets.

(Fans of 1980s sci-fi may recall the aerobraking scene in '2010: The Year We Make Contact.&rdquo;) Update: Drownings of 2 Navy SEALs were preventable, military investigation finds. AP obtained a redacted version of the investigators' report into the Jan. 11 drowning of two members of SEAL Team 3 on a mission to intercept arms being smuggled to Houthi fighters in Yemen. Investigators concluded that the drownings of Chief Special Warfare Operator Christopher J. Chambers and Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Nathan Gage Ingram were due to 'glaring training failures and a lack of understanding about what to do after falling into deep, turbulent waters.&rdquo; Read on, here. Several online trends are making Americans more susceptible to rumors and lies, and that's not good news for democracy or the U.S. military. That's the common thread through three recent studies of online behavior, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reports. One recent study found that people's views of reality are increasingly shaped by the online groups they identify with. A second found that views of society are shaped by the extreme voices that dominate social media. And a third found that groups that use encrypted messaging apps are becoming more insular. Their findings hold clues to the future of authoritarian currents and extremist political violence in the United States. Read more, here.

Three key conclusions, according to the authors: 'More than 70% of Russia's computer numerical control machines come from China, 55% of its chromium is imported, and its imports of nitrocellulose have increased by 70% since 2022, for example.&rdquo; Those are the chief vulnerabilities identified by RUSI and OSC. 'There is redundancy within the supply chain, and even a complete disruption of the Plastmass ammunition plant &ndash; a major producer &ndash; would not lead to a collapse in Russia's ammunition supply.&rdquo; 'Russia's defence industry is expanding, with major works identified at the Perm and Kazan Gunpowder plants, Izhevsk Unmanned Systems Research and Production Association, several armoured-machine repair plants and Kurganpribor. However, the industry faces challenges such as a lack of personnel and a crumbling rail infrastructure&hellip;as well as the need for imported machinery to meet its aggressive expansion goals.&rdquo; Exhibit 2 is called 'The Central Brain of the Russian Armed Forces:The Modern Russian General Staff in Institutional Context,&rdquo; and it comes from two researchers at the Virginia-based Center for Naval Analyses. The idea there is to provide 'a primer on the Russian General Staff for a public audience,&rdquo; CNA says. That's it for us this week. Thanks for reading, and you can catch us again on Tuesday&mdash;when AUSA week begins in Washington. Stay tuned&hellip;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-11-2024/400223/	2024-10-11T08:17:58-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/11/DB_lander/large.png
How the internet is making America more susceptible to rumors and...	New trends in online interaction are making Americans more susceptible to the rumors and lies that undermine democracies and their militaries. That's the common thread through three recent studies of online behavior. One found that people's views of reality are increasingly shaped by the online groups they identify with. A second found that views of society are shaped by the extreme voices that dominate social media. And a third found that groups that use encrypted messaging apps are becoming more insular. Their findings hold clues to the future of authoritarian currents and extremist political violence in the United States. The first study, by Matthew Facciani of the University of Notre Dame and Cecilie Steenbuch-Traberg of the University of Cambridge, found that people with politically homogeneous personal networks&mdash;that is, they largely interact with people they believe to be like them&mdash;are more likely to believe and share politically fake news and rumors that reflect well on their group or poorly on the opposite group. The study analyzed data from 214 participants, evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. It looked at two factors: network homogeneity and what's sometimes called 'cognitive reflection&rdquo;: basically, how quickly and emotionally people form perceptions from stimuli. It measured those factors against the likelihood of the participants spreading two types of misinformation: political rumors and fake news headlines. Results showed that network homogeneity significantly increased belief in and sharing of fake news that matched the participants' group identity. 'Both Democrats and Republicans with a politically homogeneous network will be more likely to rate politically congruent rumors as true,&rdquo; the authors wrote, though Republicans were more likely to believe politically congruent fake headlines. Another study, appearing in the December issue of Current Opinion in Psychology, indicates that the polarization of the American public is only going to deepen. The authors found that social media distorts perceptions of social norms in what they dub 'a funhouse mirror effect.&rdquo; Political discourse online is largely dominated by extreme ideological voices, creating a false perception, even among normal, level-headed people, that these views are more widely held than is the case. Thanks to social-media platforms and their engagement-seeking algorithms, a small portion of users are able to have outsized effects. For example, only 3% of active accounts on Twitter are responsible for producing one-third of the content, and 0.1% of users share 80% of fake news. 'Not only does this extreme minority stir discontent, spread misinformation, and spark outrage online, they also bias the meta-perceptions of most users who passively &lsquo;lurk' online,&rdquo; write authors Claire Robertson, Kareena del Rosario, and Jay Van Bavel. Why does that happen? The problem is that people naturally take mental shortcuts to make judgements, a phenomenon called ensemble coding. It's sort of like prejudice but a bit more nuanced. When you are thinking about what a particular group believes, you are going to rely on the voices of the most prominent members of that group and extrapolate that those voices are a good representation of the whole crowd. 'Ensemble coding is cognitively efficient, allowing people to encode a single representation of a set of stimuli, rather than encoding and memorizing every item,&rdquo; they write. 'Socially, ensemble coding allows people to form a single estimation of group emotion or opinion, rather than individually encoding each person's reaction.&rdquo; That natural neurological tendency to assume that the loudest members speak for a group can work fine when those voices are actually representative. It's why advocacy groups and political parties have leaders to push their causes to the broader population. But online, the study shows, the most prominent voices representing various groups are not representative. They're just the loudest and most angry. 'The most widely shared content on Twitter/X and Facebook is moralized content, such as expressions of outrage and hostility towards political outgroups,&rdquo; the authors observe. That means that the more time people spend online, the more they're performing the normal mental task of ensemble coding based on coked-up data. 'This may be especially problematic for topics like politics, where opinions are invisible and people are generally hesitant to share their opinions with others in everyday life,&rdquo; the authors write. That's a big issue for the future of democracy in general. Other research finds that as more and more people feel worse about other groups in their country, and become convinced that those groups are very extreme in their views, it can lead to 'support for authoritarian regimes.&rdquo; Why does that matter to the military and to national security? Consider those findings in the context of the revelations of a third study that shows small, insular groups increasingly congregate on encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram, Whatsapp, and Viber. Published on Thursday, the study shows that such group chats are exposing more people to propaganda and even recruitment into violent organizations, and doing so in ways that are increasingly invisible to the outside world. Scholars at the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights and the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas in Austin looked at 4,500 encrypted messaging app users in nine countries. Those users included 'propagandists,&rdquo; which the researchers defined as 'individuals or groups working to leverage media and communication in purposeful efforts to manipulate public opinion, particularly during elections and other events of civic significance.&rdquo; Apps like Telegram are increasingly playing a role in conflict. Violent extremists have used it to plot attacks against Western targets. Members of the Russian military use it to communicate in the absence of more secure tools. Such apps have important value for privacy, freedom of expression and communication with the free press. And the scholars are adamant that policy restrictions on such apps should not aim to break encryption. But the way some individuals can use the 'broadcast&rdquo; feature to convene and then directly message self-selected groups is ripe for abuse. 'Our survey of messaging app users confirms that propagandists are able to reach non-consenting recipients despite existing safeguards. Among users who reported receiving political content via messaging apps in the last year, 55% said some of that content came from people or accounts they did not recognize,&rdquo; they write. Content moderation on encrypted platforms is almost non-existent, even compared to the decreasing content moderation on other social media platforms. 'The average removal rate of terrorist content is lower on messaging apps than on almost all other platform types, including social media, video-sharing sites, and file-sharing platforms,&rdquo; they find, citing other published research on the topic. These trends still may not seem directly relevant to military leaders&mdash;especially since, by law and job function, there is little officials can do to alter them. But when Col. Michael Kelley of the U.S. Army Reserve looked at Russian disinformation around the war in Ukraine, he concluded that U.S. defense leaders have 'failed to assess [the] impact or sufficiently negate&rdquo; foreign disinformation efforts. In a May article published by the Army War College, Kelley suggests that greater media literacy and much more timely and accurate releases of information could be one important tool for countering those trends, at least for the military. 'This proposal may raise the ire of those who believe the US military's only purpose is to fight and win kinetic wars,&rdquo; he writes. 'The Joint Force is involved in many other activities to advance America's strategic interests. An information literacy campaign can be seen as battlefield preparation. Correctly done, this campaign will better prepare allies, partners, and others to accept truthful Western narratives and reject disinformation disseminated by adversaries.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/how-internet-making-america-more-susceptible-rumors-and-lies/400212/	2024-10-10T14:35:02-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/10/GettyImages_2169780434/large.jpg

NATO aims to publish its own commercial space strategy next year	NATO is devising a commercial space strategy as allied militaries realize just how much they might need industry's satellites in wartime. It will resemble the Pentagon's six-month-old commercial space strategy, said Maj. Gen. Devin Pepper, deputy chief of staff for strategic plans and policy at NATO's Allied Command Transformation. The U.S. strategy aimed to define what needs industry could fill, and opened the door for military protection of industry assets, but was criticized for breaking little ground, and lacking a specific roadmap. NATO officials said in an Oct. 2 release that their nascent strategy will reflect a growing commercial market, and the need for a 'new relationship&rdquo; between the military and industry. 'As we see from Maxar supporting the Ukraine, or Starlink, there's a lot of commercial capability out there that we can leverage to increase our own resiliency at NATO. So we want to be able to capture that, and because right now we have contracts with several commercial companies today [but] we want to be able to expand that and make sure that we can rely on that in a conflict if we need it,&rdquo; Pepper said Thursday at an event hosted by the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. The planned NATO strategy, which was first publicly mentioned at the alliance's summit in July, may differ from the U.S. document in its requirements for commercial space systems, Pepper said, but will likely aim to fill similar needs: communications, space domain awareness, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. 'We need to be able to have that data and that information available in a fight, whether it comes from the military or not. But if that gets shut down, we have got to be able to ensure that we can still prosecute a fight, leveraging commercial capability,&rdquo; he said. Officials have started polling NATO nations to figure out what space systems they have and what commercial companies in their country might be of use, Pepper said, since not every allied country is a 'space-faring nation.&rdquo; Currently, the U.S. supplies most of NATO's space capabilities. The alliance established space as the fifth operational domain in 2019, and officials have been talking more frequently about the importance of space in military operations. But it's unlikely that other NATO countries will set up their own 'space force&rdquo; anytime soon. The U.S. Space Force could be a model for other countries to adapt, but most nations can't, given the small size of their militaries, Pepper said. 'A lot of nations can't do that, but certainly, what I appreciate about NATO is the level of importance that NATO has placed on the space domain by declaring it an operational domain in 2019, certainly taking steps to integrate space capabilities into our operations, making sure that we have resiliency in our systems, making sure that we can partner with each other to develop capability,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/nato-aims-publish-its-own-commercial-space-strategy-next-year/400204/	2024-10-10T13:22:22-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/10/pepper_424708695_813566714144778_1396358678288170023_n/large.jpg
Secret space plane tests new orbit-switching maneuver	A U.S. X-37B space plane is slated to test a new way of rapidly changing its orbit, part of the Space Force's quest for fuel-sipping maneuverability. The spacecraft will experiment with aerobraking, which uses Earth's atmosphere to slow down and switch orbits. 'The use of the aerobraking maneuver&mdash;a series of passes using the drag of Earth's atmosphere&mdash;enables the spacecraft to change orbits while expending minimal fuel,&rdquo; the service said in a release today. NASA has used the maneuver, but it is 'novel&rdquo; to the X-37B, the release said. One of the Space Force's two X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles&mdash;OTV-7&mdash;was launched into space in December, the program's seventh known mission. The U.S. military has disclosed few details about its mission or purpose in low Earth orbit, other than noting that X-37 tests include operating in new orbital regimes and experiments with space domain awareness technologies. 'Once the aerobrake maneuver is complete, the X-37B will resume its test and experimentation objectives until they are accomplished, at which time the vehicle will de-orbit and execute a safe return as it has during its six previous missions,&rdquo; the Space Force said. The announcement of this new maneuver raises further questions about the plane's purpose in space, and how the military could use this capability to avoid threats or weapons in space. 'This first of a kind maneuver from the X-37B is an incredibly important milestone for the United States Space Force as we seek to expand our aptitude and ability to perform in this challenging domain. The success is a testament to the dedication and perseverance of the team,' Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman said in a statement.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/secret-space-plane-tests-new-orbit-switching-maneuver/400193/	2024-10-10T11:05:09-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/10/Artist_rendering_of_2500/large.jpg
DIA's AI-powered intel repository will be fully operational about...	An AI-powered replacement for the repository of intelligence on foreign militaries is headed for the Pentagon's classified network, where it will help pioneer new security techniques and become fully operational about a year later than planned, officials said. 'We expect&rdquo; the Machine-assisted Analytic Rapid-repository System to be approved to run on the SIPRNet 'within the next few weeks, actually,&rdquo; said Doug Cossa, chief information officer of the Defense Intelligence Agency, speaking at an Intelligence and National Security Alliance virtual event on Tuesday. MARS is to replace the Modernized Integrated Database, or MIDB, the Pentagon's main repository for 'foundational military intelligence&rdquo;: the information collected by the intelligence community on other countries' militaries and infrastructure. The DIA began working on MARS in 2018, adding new tools and AI-powered capabilities along the way, but it has only been accessible in certain locations. An agency spokesperson declined to say where. The move to SIPRNet will make MARS far more widely available. Full operation is expected in 2026, the spokesman confirmed, about a year later than originally planned. The intelligence community has been working to improve their ability to sense, aggregate, display, and share data. But with each agency and military branch working on their own efforts, integrating them to form a common operating picture is an ongoing challenge. 'The challenge we have ahead of us is: how do we actually integrate that data into one common operating picture? And this is a priority of not just the [director of national intelligence], but the [under secretary of defense for intelligence and security] of collaborating across the intelligence and defense enterprise to create that common operating picture to where we are all leveraging each other's data in an authoritative way, but the same sheet of music in a synchronized fashion,&rdquo; Cossa said. The Pentagon asked for $890 million in 2024 and $977 million in 2025 to upgrade its networks to zero trust architecture. Those funds will be used to spur several pilots over the next year despite limited cyber personnel for vulnerability testing, said Randy Resnick, who leads the Pentagon's zero trust office. 'We're pretty complete with all the foundational documentation and how it glides or fits into the authorization to operate process, and now we're doing pilots,&rdquo; Resnick said Wednesday during a panel discussion at NVIDIA's AI Summit in Washington, D.C. 'I'm expecting some successes, many successes, which will show that we can hit what we're calling &lsquo;target' or &lsquo;advanced level' zero trust. And that whole strategy is meant to stop the adversary.&rdquo; To meet the Pentagon's 2027 deadline for implementing zero trust&mdash;the principle that focuses on securing data and that no device or user should be automatically trusted, Cossa said the agency put much of its zero trust 'investments&rdquo; for 2024 and 2024 in MARS. Moreover, he said MARS will be the first DIA system to offer 'fine-grained entitlements,&rdquo; a way to customize and manage access down to individuals and devices. These and other security measures could help the intelligence community and Defense Department inch towards a common operating picture when it comes to military intelligence. The goal is to ensure that data pulled from a myriad sources across the IC and DOD is secure and can integrate with MARS. Moreover, employing zero trust as a baseline for defense and intelligence systems could be the key to frictionless information sharing with allies and partners. 'It means that we don't need these disparate networks anymore. We can actually host data in one place and regulate and control and secure access through those fine-grained entitlements for both users and devices. That's the future of where we're going,&rdquo; Cossa said. 'When we say we're going to put MARS on SIPR, yeah, we're going to. But what we want to see in the future&mdash;and really the objective&mdash;is we don't have to deploy it in different networks. We deploy in one area, and we manage the accesses through entitlements.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/new-ai-powered-intel-repository-will-be-fully-operational-about-year-late/400188/	2024-10-10T09:00:14-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/10/Selfsacrificers_of_the_Sanctuary_of_Velayat_XI_023-1/large.jpg
The D Brief: Kyiv hikes taxes; DOD’s space turf war; Smart new dr...	It's been 962 days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv's lawmakers just passed the largest tax hike of the war so far, increasing the rate on personal income from 1.5 to 5%, according to the New York Times. Kyiv is looking to spend $12 billion more on its military over the coming year. After all, 'it must cover the salaries of its service members and domestic arms production from its own revenues. That military spending accounts for more than half of the state's $100 billion annual budget,&rdquo; the Times reports. 'We will be hated, but we don't have any other option,&rdquo; one lawmaker said. President Volodymir Zelenskyy is in London for talks with British and NATO officials, he announced on social media Thursday. Those talks include possible long-range missile use for targets inside Russia, new alliance chief Mark Rutte told reporters afterward. 'We discussed it today, but in the end it is up to the individual allies,&rdquo; Rutte said, according to Reuters. Zelenskyy later flew to Paris for talks with officials there. Then he's off to Rome and Berlin on Friday. Update: More than 600,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday. Also notable: 'Russian forces sustained their highest month-on-month losses of the war in September,&rdquo; a senior military official said, citing a Russian push toward Pokrovsk as a leading factor there, Defense One's Sam Skove reports. Why bring it up? Moscow's losses could eventually influence Putin's calculus on continuing the war as he seeks to balance his foreign and domestic goals, a senior government official said. This doesn't yet seem to be the case, however; though it is worth noting Putin has not announced a 'mass mobilization because of the effect that would have on Russia's domestic population,&rdquo; the official said. But he has announced two partial mobilizations, in September and October 2022. More, here. Russian war fatigue rising? According to polling from September, there is a rise in those who are willing to say they believe war in Ukraine is bad for Russia&mdash;47% in the latest Lavada Center survey compared to 41% in results published this past May. And those who feel 'war is good&rdquo; for Russia has dropped to 28% compared to 38% four months prior. Still, some 60% say they feel the war is going well for Russia. For comparison, 70% said they felt that way in February. And notably, '72% of respondents said they would support Vladimir Putin's decision to end the military conflict,&rdquo; according to Levada. But that number drops to just 31% if it means giving Ukraine back the territory Putin has annexed so far. Coverage continues after the jump...

On this day in 1985, the airliner carrying the Palestinian hijackers of the Achille Lauro cruise ship was intercepted by U.S. Navy F-14s and forced to land in Sicily. Attention, Europe: There are serious limits to how much the U.S. can help, should Russia trigger a major war with NATO, analyst Franz Stefan-Gady, formerly of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, warned last week in a generous analysis published in the German language periodical Der Pragmaticus. Who is this guy? Stefan-Gady (aka @HoansSolo) is a highly regarded researcher who has spent the last few years traveling in and out of Ukraine to better understand contemporary warfare against Russia and Vladimir Putin's war machine. His analysis reflects a particular kind of realism and urgency for the continent. Consider the following: 'Of the approximately 450,000 active soldiers in the U.S. Army, only around 122,000 could be sent to Europe,&rdquo; he predicts. And 'Of the more than 2,600 battle tanks, the Americans could bring around 700 to Europe, and of their 40 submarines, only four would probably be used. Conclusion: Europe must&mdash;regardless of Donald Trump&mdash;be able to wage war and deter its enemies without major U.S. support.&rdquo; However, according to Stefan-Gady's reading of NATO capabilities, 'No European country is currently in a position to lead a large unit such as a corps (up to 50,000 men), let alone an army, without American support.&rdquo; And that is a big problem. Sobering reminder: Lithuania's capital city of Vilnius 'is only 30 kilometers from the Belarusian border and thus within range of Russian heavy artillery,&rdquo; Stefan-Gady writes. According to NATO planners, 'The strategic goal for Russia in this scenario is to take the city of Vilnius hostage in order to force NATO to stop fighting under the threat of using nuclear weapons.&rdquo; The wider goal for Russia 'would be to destroy NATO and cause the USA to lose credibility.&rdquo; Informed prediction: Trench warfare would very likely return to Europe, only this time 'across the Baltics or from Kaliningrad across the Suwalki Gap to Belarus.&rdquo; According to the associated logic, 'Russia could dig in, as in Ukraine, and build dense defensive positions secured by wide mine belts.&rdquo; After all, Stefan-Gady cautions, 'No NATO force has practical experience of how to overcome such defensive systems,&rdquo; and 'Any attempt would therefore claim countless victims.&rdquo; When it comes to air and missile defense, 'the European members of NATO could together provide only five percent of the equipment needed to protect troops in the Baltics, major cities and other important critical infrastructure,&rdquo; he writes. Those NATO members have just 36 such systems; '70 to 90 long-range air defense systems would be needed in the two Baltic scenarios just to protect NATO units on the ground,&rdquo; he estimates. At least an additional '50 additional long-range air defense systems would be needed in Eastern Europe to protect cities and critical infrastructure,&rdquo; Stefan-Gady warns. And that's not something that can be remedied by a huge pile of cash, since 'more than four years can pass between the signing of the contract, production and delivery of a single system such as an M902 Patriot,&rdquo; he reminds readers. One notable X factor: The U.S. could theoretically turn its ship around in terms of its inefficient defense procurement processes, thereby 'creat[ing] the capacities necessary for such a [two-front] war in the national arms industries.&rdquo; Should that herculean turnabout occur, 'the Russian and Chinese calculations [in a two-front war against the U.S. and NATO] may not work out,&rdquo; Stefan-Gady says. But this seems highly improbable at present, he concedes. And even if such industry changes do come about, 'it remains unclear whether the West has the will to endure a long war of attrition,&rdquo; especially given its strong historical inclinations toward isolationism.

A Pentagon turf war has &lsquo;hamstrung' the commercial space industry, execs say. Here's how it breaks down: the NRO is in charge of buying commercial ISR imagery for the Pentagon, while the NGA handles analytic products&mdash;and the five-year-old Space Force is pushing to break their monopolies, arguing that it can move the data and intelligence more quickly to combatant commands. Industry execs like the way the Space Force is trying to do things, reports Defense One's Audrey Decker, here. Anduril's new AI-powered strike drone shows how quickly battlefield autonomy is evolving.

WSJ: 'Sinwar, who has been Hamas's top leader in Gaza for years, took control of the politburo in August after Israel killed the previous leader, Ismail Haniyeh, the preceding month.

Hurricane Milton eased to a category three storm as it made landfall overnight along the Florida coast, spawning 36 tornados and causing sporadic flooding as it advanced eastward from Siesta Key, south of Tampa, toward Daytona Beach. Residential roofs were shredded and many boats transplanted along roads and beside homes, according to aerial photography from ABC News. Portions of the stadium roof at Tropicana Field, which hosts the Tampa Bay Rays, were ripped off by winds that reached 97 mph. Tampa recorded one foot of rain, while eight inches fell around Daytona Beach, causing flash floods at Cape Canaveral. By the time Milton passed over the state, it had been downgraded to a Category One hurricane. So far, four people are believed to have died from the storm, according to Tampa's NBC affiliate WFLA News Channel 8. But that number could rise as first responders get to work and more debris is cleared. In the meantime, 'Officials in the hard-hit counties of Hillsborough, Pinellas, Sarasota and Lee urged people to stay home, warning of downed power lines, trees in roads, blocked bridges and flooding,&rdquo; WFLA reports. MacDill AFB latest: The base 'remains closed at this time and personnel&hellip;should not attempt to access the installation until further notice,&rdquo; officials said Thursday on Facebook.

However, '635,996 accounts have already been restored as of 6:00 AM,&rdquo; Gov. Ron De Santis said Thursday morning. State personnel have begun clearing roadways, 'and 150 inspectors have begun performing inspections to ensure bridges can reopen safely in impacted areas,&rdquo; the governor said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-10-2024/400186/	2024-10-10T08:12:48-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/10/DB_lander/large.png
New AI-powered strike drone shows how quickly battlefield autonom...	Small drones have been changing modern warfare at least since 2015, when Russia and Ukraine began to use them to great effect for rapid targeting. The latest addition is a strike-and-intelligence quadcopter that its builder hopes will do more things with a lot less operator attention. The point of the Bolt-M, revealed by Anduril today, is to make fewer demands on the operator and offer more information than, easy-to-produce first-person-view strike drones, the type that Ukraine is producing by the hundreds of thousands. The U.S. Army, too, is looking at FPV drones for infantry platoons. But they require special training to use and come with a lot of operational limits. The Bolt-M, according to an Anduril statement, works 'without requiring specialized operators.&rdquo; The company has a contract from the U.S. Marine Corps' Organic Precision Fires &ndash; Light, or OPF-L, program to develop a strike variant. Bolt-M's key selling feature is its autonomy-and-AI software powered by Anduril's Lattice platform. The operator can draw a bounding box on a battlefield display, set a few specifications, and send the drone on its way. 'Once a target is identified in Lattice, an operator can specify a standoff position for Bolt-M to maintain, tasking the system to stalk the target from beyond visual or acoustic detection range even as the target moves and is occluded,&rdquo; the company statement said. 'When it's time to strike, an operator can define the engagement angle to ensure the most effective strike, while onboard vision and guidance algorithms maintain terminal guidance even if connectivity is lost with the operator.&rdquo; But the system is also intended to handle some reconnaissance tasks that humans do but other small cheap strike drones don't. In conversation with reporters on Wednesday, Anduril chief strategy officer Chris Brose said that the Bolt-M is intended to help its operator 'to understand what's happening on the battlefield, whether it's kind of known targets or targets that are recognizable to the systems on board, or whether it's unknown things that that operator can then select through its interaction with the autonomous system, tell it to track, tell it to follow, eventually, if so desired, based on the human saying &lsquo;Go,' to actually fly in and engage that target.&rdquo; Brose said the Bolt-M might even be able to spot new variants of older weapons. 'If the Russians in this instance start modifying them and building these kinds of turtle tanks, maybe the computer vision hasn't seen that already&hellip;it can still surface that insight back to an operator.&rdquo; Over the next six months, the Marine Corps will put the Bolt-M's munition variant through 'a pretty rigorous test and evaluation campaign,&rdquo; he said. The Bolt-M pushes right up to the limits of the Pentagon principle that robotic weapons should always have a person involved in lethal decisions. Brose said that their efforts are guided by the company's experiences in Ukraine, particularly feedback from Ukranians who are face-to-face with Russia's electronic warfare. The drone can fly to GPS waypoints. But in places where GPS is under attack, operators can manually control it&mdash;and it can maintain custody of the target and execute previous operator-delivered commands even when links are broken. In many ways, the Bolt-M derives its real value, and its intelligence, from the Lattice platform, which can integrate data from varioussensors and sources. Anduril is working to make sure that Lattice works with a variety of drones, even from other manufacturers, said Brose. That could give the company a key, central role as different forces buy different drones or make their own in the field. 'What we are doing with Lattice is to deliver as much autonomy across that entire kill chain to put that human being on-the-loop so that they can make better decisions faster. They can make more decisions. They can take more actions because they have an intelligent system that's incorporating&hellip;sensor data, platforms, vehicles,&rdquo; he said. But what decisions? The Defense Department maintains a list of AI ethical principles that say that human beings must be able to 'exercise appropriate levels of judgment and remain responsible for the development, deployment, use,&rdquo; over AI-enabled weapons. Last year, the Pentagon sought to clarify what is and is not allowable&mdash;while leaving room to adjust the rules if things change. One of the key lessons from Ukraine's battlefield is that battlefield conditions can move very rapidly. Different nations, allied and adversary, will have different policies around lethal autonomy. Those other policies will change rapidly, too, depending on what's happening on the front lines. As attacks against the connections binding humans to drones become more effective, the need for more capable autonomy will increase. Brose said Anduril anticipates that U.S. policy will change, and they want to be ready to serve the Pentagon's new needs when it happens. 'We're not going to go out and solve for every sort of hypothetical edge case,&rdquo; he said. 'Our focus is on making the system as capable as possible based on how we believe users want to and need to use it now and in the near future. Then, to the extent that that gets limited or governed or restrained by policy or rules of engagement, that is entirely the decision of the government. We want them to have that choice, rather than realize that they would like to have a more capable system, but, but, you know, we're not capable of providing it to them.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/new-ai-powered-strike-drone-shows-how-quickly-battlefield-autonomy-evolving/400179/	2024-10-09T21:01:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/09/2024_Bolt_Hero_1/large.jpg
Russian casualties have topped 600,000 in Ukraine war, US says	More than 600,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday. Ukrainian drone strikes have taken out large amounts of Russian supplies as well, the official added, speaking on background. Hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition have been destroyed in Russian and North Korean weapons stockpiles in Russia. The attacks have made a 'serious dent&rdquo; in Russian supply lines, the official said, adding that Russia would likely need to move munitions dumps farther from the front lines, thereby slowing deliveries to the front. Russia has also lost more than two-thirds of its tanks, and has begun drawing on Soviet-era stocks that date back to World War II, the official said. Russian forces sustained their highest month-on-month losses of the war in September, said a senior military official, who cited a Russian push toward Pokrovsk as a leading factor in the high casualty rate. Russia has been making gains near Pokrovsk thanks to a grinding offensive that has seen its forces inch forward as Ukrainian troops are constrained by ammunition shortages, deal with flagging morale, and struggled to recruit soldiers. Moscow's losses could eventually influence Putin's calculus on continuing the war as he seeks to balance his foreign and domestic goals, said the senior government official. 'Putin is trying to avoid a mass mobilization because of the effect that would have on Russia's domestic population,&rdquo; the official said. 'At this point, he has been able to significantly increase the pay of these voluntary soldiers, and he has been able to continue to field those forces without doing a major mobilization. And I think we're just watching very closely how long that stance can actually be one that he can maintain.&rdquo; It's a proposition that bears similarity to a victory plan proposed by Estonia in December 2023, which sought to increase weapons transfers to Ukraine and training for its troops in order to exhaust Russian forces and force Putin to either make unpopular mobilization choices or make peace. Russia performed partial mobilization in September and October 2022. At the time, tens of thousands of Russian men left for neighboring countries to avoid the draft. Moscow is now meeting its need for soldiers by offering lucrative contracts that push soldiers' pay far past the average for Russian citizens. Russia has also decreased its standards for soldiers in order to avoid mobilization, leading to greater reported crimes and discipline problems within its army. Putin's decision to only partly mobilize troops so far is evidence that he sees political risks in expanding recruiting, said John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center. 'This is a potential point of vulnerability for the regime,&rdquo; Herbst said. 'The Russian people are not in this war. They're not marching towards the sound of the drums.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/russian-casualties-have-topped-600k-us-says/400181/	2024-10-09T20:35:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/09/Russias_Southern_Mi_2500/large.jpg
Lockheed taps deputy F-35 chief to take over program	Lockheed Martin is switching the leader of its behemoth F-35 fighter jet program, announcing today that the program's deputy, Chauncey McIntosh, will take the helm. On Dec. 1, McIntosh will succeed Bridget Lauderdale, a long-time Lockheed executive who led the company's F-35 efforts for three years. Lauderdale will retire at the end of the year, according to a company statement. McIntosh will take over after a rocky year for the program: the company is dealing with major delays while developing new technology for the jet, which resulted in the Pentagon halting deliveries last year. Company officials have yet to finish negotiations over the price tag of jets in the next production lot. F-35 sustainment costs remain high, and the company has failed to convince Pentagon officials to move to a long-desired, performance-based logistics sustainment deal. 'As the vice president and general manager for the F-35 program, McIntosh will be responsible for further strengthening positive customer experiences by reinforcing and continually growing the capability and reliability of the F-35; showcasing significant program progress; and ensuring the F-35 program meets the speed, agility, quality and affordability requirements deserved and expected by U.S. and international customers,&rdquo; the company said. Before joining the F-35 program as deputy, McIntosh led Lockheed Martin's integrated warfare systems & sensors business, which develops software for Aegis air-defense systems. Before that, he was the vice president and general manager for Lockheed's training and logistics business, leading mission readiness and sustainment programs for the F-35 and other products. He has also worked on aspects of the F-22, C-5, P-3, and S3 programs.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/lockheed-taps-deputy-f-35-chief-take-over-program/400163/	2024-10-09T11:15:24-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/09/7791195/large.jpg
Industry ‘hamstrung’ by Space Force-intel community’s turf war	The space industry is waiting for the Space Force and intelligence community to come to an agreement over buying commercial satellite imagery and related analysis&mdash;a fight, some say, that is preventing troops from making the fullest use of orbital capabilities. Currently, the National Reconnaissance Office is in charge of buying intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance imagery from commercial space providers, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in charge of purchasing analytic products. But in the five years since the Space Force was created, the young service has increasingly pushed for funds and leeway to work directly with commercial firms, arguing that it can more quickly get important information to combatant commands. Earlier this year, Space Force launched a $40 million pilot program to show just how fast it could move information and insights from orbiting sensors to troops on ground. It began soliciting bids for 'tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking,&rdquo; or TacSRT, through a 'marketplace,&rdquo; Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman told reporters last month. 'What TacSRT is doing with this pilot in particular is: we simply ask a question into the marketplace: &lsquo;Hey, what generally does it look like around Air Base 201? Are there any items of interest, trucks, that are massing? Is there a huge parking lot? Do we see people milling around?' We simply ask the question. And commercial industry provides us products that try to help us answer the question,&rdquo; he said. Saltzman has emphasized that the pilot program buys analysis based on imagery but not images themselves, carefully skirting NRO's territory. Executives with commercial space companies that have participated in the pilot's marketplace call it revolutionary. Some jobs have moved from a work statement announcement to the start of a mission in as little as 24 to 72 hours. But these executives say that unless TacSRT gets more funding, and the intel community gives more leeway to the Space Force, commercial companies and combatant commands could suffer. Under the current NGA-centric process, it can take weeks for military analysts in a relatively quiet command&mdash;i.e., anywhere that's not China, Ukraine, or the Middle East&mdash;to hear back on a request for satellite imagery, said Joe Morrison, the vice president of remote sensing at Umbra, which operates a synthetic aperture radar constellation and provides data to analytics firms in the TacSRT program. Morrison said the current system was designed to manage requests for a scarce number of very-high-quality, very-much-in-demand 'national assets&rdquo;&mdash;not to draw efficiently on commercial offerings to make sure all needs are met in timely fashion. He said this has discouraged analysts from even putting in a request for imagery or insights, which has artificially depressed apparent demand for them and has 'hamstrung&rdquo; Umbra's ability to demonstrate its utility. 'If there's one way in which the inability for us as a nation to come to terms on Title 10 versus Title 50 has probably hurt Umbra&mdash;and really the commercial remote sensing industry in the United States more generally&mdash;is that we haven't been able to show how effective we can be as quickly as we were able technically because of the vestigial bureaucratic processes that are set up in order to avoid government waste, which is a good reason to set them up, but the reality on the ground is changing faster than those policies can change,&rdquo; Morrison said. NGA officials have recently pushed back on allegations that the agency moves too slowly: 'My inbox would be full of emails if we were failing in this regard&mdash;and it is not. I do not get negative reports from the COCOMs on our timelines,&rdquo; NGA director Vice Adm. Frank Whitworth told reporters in August. Decision time While officials in the intelligence community and Space Force generally agree that they will need to use commercial capability, especially in wartime, the entities still have to draw lines over who has tasking authority for specific situations and who is in charge of the COCOMs' needs. And it's not easy to change the culture of the intel community, which for decades has only been trusting systems made in-house. 'It's only natural for an entity in the IC that's used to building really badass systems and is anointed on behalf of the entire government to do it, to bristle at the fact that someone else is going to come in and say they have a new way of doing things. For sure, there will be resistance when Space Force tries to scale it, if for nothing else other than it's going to require moving someone's cheese,&rdquo; said Eric Jensen, CEO of ICEYE U.S., a subsidy of a Finnish SAR imagery provider that participates in the Space Force's TacSRT program. Despite this reticence, Jensen said, there has to be policy change so the Space Force can provide surge capacity to the COCOMs when they need it&mdash;and to support commercial-space companies like his. 'The question is: is the government going to continue to support the crossing of the chasm where these companies are able to truly operationalize their capabilities in a way that is well defined? I think that that's been painful for companies that, like us, can move very quickly, but are somewhat beholden to the government's bureaucratic timelines,&rdquo; Jensen said. Programs like TacSRT are key to incubating space startups that can work quickly, said Derek Tishler, founder of analytics provider BoxMica, a five-person company whose 2024 revenue has largely come from TacSRT jobs. 'With a few million dollars, a half dozen or more companies like ours would flourish and imagine if it's a little bigger budget when it comes to things like TacSRT,&rdquo; Tishler said. 'The NRO might not be working at such a small contract level, or a lot of those organizations, so I really hope there's a place for both, and then they can meet in the middle ground where everyone gets a little bit more money and a little bit more opportunities.&rdquo; He said he hopes the Space Force gets 'a lot more leeway&rdquo; to work directly with commercial firms. A potential compromise would see the NRO keep the high-resolution, exquisite capability and hand the tactical ISR mission to the Space Force, said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. But that would likely require intervention by higher levels of government. 'I would think that is something the next administration should tackle and the National Space Council, but I'm not optimistic that they're going to reach any kind of a consensus on how to do this going forward in the near future, so I think we're going to be stuck in this bureaucratic paralysis where what's suffering is the Space Force's ability to do its job and the warfighters ability to leverage commercial space to the fullest extent,&rdquo; Harrison said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/industry-hamstrung-space-force-intel-communitys-turf-war/400156/	2024-10-09T10:16:50-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/09/02_nelsonmandelabridgeandbraamfonteinrailyard_johannesburgsouthafrica_24july2024_wvl/large.jpg
The D Brief: Baltics raise defenses; Israel orders hospital evacu...	Lithuania's military says it's ready to blow up its bridges to Russia's Kaliningrad exclave, which is located on the Baltic coast between Poland and Lithuania. The Lithuanians have placed vehicle obstacles known as 'dragon's teeth&rdquo; on a bridge over the Nemunas River, which leads to Kaliningrad. Those obstacles 'will eventually be supplemented with iron beams, which will be sunk in and anchored,&rdquo; Defense Minister Laurynas Kasčiūnas said Wednesday on Facebook with an illustrating photo. 'The Lithuanian army is now testing them, evaluating how they hold back the advancing heavy equipment.&rdquo; 'Fortifications will be supported by firepower, in case it's needed, to stop and destroy the enemy&hellip;with some bridges set to be demolished,&rdquo; the Lithuanian Defense Ministry said Wednesday on social media. Context: 'Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania agreed to build a Baltic defense line in the coming years to strengthen the eastern border with Belarus and Russia, the Estonian Defense Ministry said on Jan. 19,&rdquo; the Kyiv Independent reports. 'Russia's war in Ukraine has shown that, in addition to equipment, ammunition and manpower, we also need physical defense facilities on the border to protect Estonia from the first meter,&rdquo; Estonia's defense minister said at the time. Rewind: You may recall that when Defense One traveled to Denmark in 2019 to observe Danish military training, troops spent part of their time rehearsing river crossings in anticipation of a possible invasion by the Russian military. 'Our major problem fighting in an environment like the Baltics would be bridging capacity,&rdquo; one officer explained. 'There are so many rivers, and they are so wide, and we only have bridges that can stretch 20 meters. And we don't have very many bridges. And that's as I see it our major challenge to fighting in the Baltics.&rdquo; For what it's worth: Most of Kaliningrad's border with Lithuania follows either the Nemunas or &Scaron;e&scaron;upė rivers. Additional reading: 'Most of Europe is fine without Russian gas,&rdquo; Politico reported Wednesday; 'Russia bans Discord chat program, to the chagrin of its military users,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Friday; And 'Ukraine's Allies See Kyiv Getting More Flexible Over War Endgame,&rdquo; Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

Ukraine says it has blown up another Russian weapons depot, this time with North Korean weapons destroyed as well, the General Staff announced on Facebook. Alleged location: The Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation in the Bryansk region, Ukrainian officials said. The strike occurred late Tuesday and featured troops with Ukraine's drone forces. 'The arsenal stored ammunition for missile and artillery systems, including those delivered from North Korea, as well as glide bombs,&rdquo; the General Staff said, adding, 'Much of the ammunition was stored in the open.&rdquo; Relatedly, Russian authorities declared a 'state of emergency&rdquo; in the region Ukraine says it attacked overnight, according to Reuters. 'The Bryansk emergencies ministry said the situation was under control, and made no mention of a weapons arsenal,&rdquo; the wire service reports. How to build a multi-sensor anti-drone dashboard in just two weeks. Today's air-defense troops must bounce between multiple systems, wasting precious seconds as they scramble to identify incoming drones. But it doesn't have to be that way, according to a recent experiment. In just two weeks, private companies led by U.S. Central Command managed to integrate multiple sensors onto a single display that Army troops tested in upstate New York. While the tech won't be sent to the Middle East just yet, officials hope it will serve as a building block for future efforts. Defense One's Sam Skove reports. Taking a public pulse, Taiwanese version: Most Taiwanese believe China is unlikely to invade in the next five years, according to a survey conducted last month by the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, which Reuters calls Taiwan's top military think tank. Key results: 61% of respondents believe an attack is 'unlikely or very unlikely.' More than 67% said they would fight back if China did invade, but were about evenly split over whether Taiwan's military could actually turn back an invasion. Some 74% believed the U.S. government was likely to 'indirectly' help Taiwan by providing food, medical supplies, and weapons, but just 52% thought the U.S. would send military forces to fight. Read more from Reuters, here. U.S. version: If China invades Taiwan, Americans would support airlifting supplies (74%) and sending weapons to Taipei (59%) but not putting US forces into a position that could lead to war with China (58% oppose)&mdash;all that according to respondents to a recent survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Other findings: 51% said the U.S. should encourage Taiwan to maintain the status quo rather than move toward independence (36%) or unification (4%). Just 42% want to commit to defend Taiwan from China, but more support Taiwan's inclusion in international organizations (59%) and want a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement (62%).

Trump’s refusal, so far, to accept transition assistance creates ...	Donald Trump's presidential campaign has missed deadlines to accept assistance from the federal government to prepare for a transition should he win the election, potentially making a change in administration even more stressful for federal employees. Presidential campaigns are supposed to conclude two memorandums of understanding about transition assistance: the first by Sept. 1 with the General Services Administration, concerning office space and information technology; and the second by Oct. 1 with the White House, to cover transition staffers' access to federal agency facilities, documents, and employees. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign reached its agreement with GSA on Sept. 19, almost three weeks late, and a Biden administration official told Government Executive in a statement that it has entered an MOU with Harris, although such a document has not yet been made public. Her campaign has posted its accompanying ethics plan for transition-team members. (Sample: 'Transition Team members will avoid both actual and apparent conflicts of interest.') The official said that the federal transition coordinator is 'actively working with the Trump transition team to complete an MOU.&rdquo; The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment but has previously told Government Executive that it is continuing 'to evaluate and communicate with GSA about the options related to the support offered by GSA.&rdquo; A GSA spokesperson said that the agency 'is prepared to begin providing services to the Trump transition team once an MOU is executed.&rdquo; It would be challenging for the White House to establish the second agreement with Trump without the first, because GSA provides the secure networks and .gov email addresses that enable federal employees to safely exchange information with verified individuals. Agencies 'need to plan. There's a lot of investment that goes in, so the uncertainty of not having those MOUs in place presents a real challenge to them,&rdquo; said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, at a press briefing on Monday. 'There's going to be a ton of work that has to be done&hellip;the early investment is critical to get it done and not to put even more burden on the career civil servants.&rdquo; PPS, a nonpartisan good-government group, hosts a Center for Presidential Transition that provides assistance to campaigns and agencies with respect to changes in administration. Valerie Smith Boyd, who leads the PPS Center for Presidential Transition, said the agreement with the White House is necessary for the incoming administration to access the agencies it is about to manage. 'We have one president at a time. The federal agencies are part of the current administration. And for federal agencies to share information and to meet with a president-elect, it's important to define the terms of where that takes place [and] what type of information may be shared at a high level,&rdquo; she said. While the MOUs are optional, Stier argued they're 'optional at a real risk.&rdquo; 'On this proposition [of] &lsquo;we don't trust the government,' that's a problem, because at the end of the day, if you're running it, you're going to have to be trusting it,&rdquo; he said. 'There may be elements of things that you're concerned about, but you're going to need to engage, and if you don't engage, that really will put our country in jeopardy.&rdquo; Boyd said other aspects of transition planning are moving along. The White House has set up a Transition Coordinating Council composed of senior Biden administration officials. Both campaigns have named leaders for their transition teams. And each agency has named an employee in the career Senior Executive Service as transition director.

How to build a multi-sensor air-defense dashboard in just two wee...	It takes just a moment to add a new app to your phone, but adding a sensor to a military radar display takes years. That's why air-defense troops must bounce between multiple systems, wasting precious seconds as they scramble to identify incoming drones. But it doesn't have to be that way, according to a recent experiment led by U.S. Central Command. In just two weeks, private companies managed to integrate multiple sensors onto a single display that Army troops tested in upstate New York&mdash;thanks in part to CENTCOM officers who paved the way by negotiating past bureaucratic blocks and assuaging company execs worried about intellectual property rights. While the tech won't be sent to the Middle East just yet, officials hope it will serve as a building block for future efforts. The event began with a week in which companies worked out how their devices would share data to a display. Then, from Sept. 30 to Oct. 4, soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division tested the rig at Fort Drum against 'adversary&rdquo; drones. The unit was selected to test the kit because it currently provides counter-drone support in the Middle East. Army air-defense leaders have said that it takes multiple sensors to identify enemy drones, which can approach friendly forces in a variety of directions, speeds, and courses. Putting all those sensors onto one platform is typically an arduous process, said Master Sgt. Clark Davis, senior non-commissioned officer for CENTCOM's chief technology office. 'If you look at program-of record systems through the acquisition and software development timeframes, most systems take 18 to 24 months to integrate anything&mdash;and that's fast&rdquo; for the Defense Department, Davis said. One previous attempt to integrate a company's sensor into an existing Terminal High Altitude Area Defense radar took 24 months, added Maj. Bryan Cercy, who works with Davis. In principle, integrating multiple displays onto a single screen should be simple, said Schuyler Moore, CENTCOM's chief technology officer. Private companies do such things all the time, such as when mobile developers share their applications on a phone's operating system. But the Defense Department isn't used to it, Moore said. 'The department hasn't necessarily always had to flex that muscle of doing it really quickly in the way that the tech sector has,&rdquo;she said. One obstacle may be technical talent. Age is another problem, with some sensors having been built decades ago before it became standard to make it easy to share data, said Col. Nate Huston, CENTCOM's director of innovation. Getting them to interact with a brand-new display is like 'trying to use your first-gen iPhone in today's world,&rdquo; he said. To change that, the Defense Department needs to get better at encouraging companies to develop products that can be swapped out, Huston said. 'We just have to think more and more creatively about how we incentivize interoperability.&rdquo; Bureaucratic hurdles were another factor, as were companies hesitant to share data lest they lose intellectual property. 'We were working through a lot of concerns,&rdquo; Cercy said. He credited Army senior leaders' focus on the problem for helping to get companies on board. The resulting system will not deploy to the Middle East just yet, said Moore. However, it sets the stage for a second effort that will focus on helping soldiers identify threats faster amid the many signals pinging on their screens. It's the sort of effort that could help prevent deadly attacks like the January one that killed three U.S. soldiers and wounded dozens more in Jordan. The Wall Street Journal reported that air-defense troops misidentified the enemy drone as a friendly one. 'The second piece will be to take all of the data that we have pulled from this week and start working on that quicker tag of hostile or non-hostile,&rdquo; she said. While the sensor systems that CENTCOM tried in the recent experiment are built for the larger drones that soldiers face in the Middle East, the platform for sharing sensors could also eventually integrate sensors for the smaller first-person-view drones common in Ukraine, Moore added. 'We've discovered in conversations with a lot of the vendors that they have the ability to drop down to smaller sizes if we were to give them the chance,&rdquo; she said. Moore said her team is also closely focused on what Ukraine is doing against drones, and has talked multiple times with Security Group Assistance Ukraine, the U.S.-led body that coordinates aid for Ukraine. 'We have, in many ways, been watching Ukraine for the last three years as it goes through Christmas future of what we would experience in our theater,&rdquo; she said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/how-build-multi-sensor-air-defense-dashboard-just-two-weeks/400135/	2024-10-08T12:03:04-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/08/desert_guardian_Screenshot_2024_10_08_at_2.15.23PM_2/large.jpg
Foreign adversaries will aim to discredit US election results, in...	Certain foreign countries will attempt to cast doubt on the results of the upcoming U.S. election by amplifying false claims and disinformation, intelligence officials warn. The intelligence community 'expects foreign influence actors to continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the election's results after the polls close,&rdquo; an official in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told reporters on a Monday call. 'Thus, in such a contested post-election atmosphere, foreign actors probably will use tactics similar to those that they are using today to undermine trust in the integrity of the election and election processes, as well as to further exacerbate divisions among Americans,&rdquo; said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity per ground rules of the call. The assessment, delivered just under a month before Election Day, adds that foreign adversaries are expecting the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump to be a close call. Foreign nations &mdash; namely China, Iran, and Russia &mdash; have already made attempts throughout the past year to meddle in election outcomes and political discourse. The U.S. last month charged Iranian operatives with carrying out hacking activities to disrupt the election, including a breach into the email inboxes of Trump campaign staff. Officials also said that China, Cuba, and Russia are aiming to influence the vote in select congressional races to promote candidates that are more in favor of the nations' geopolitical or economic stances. Moscow, for instance, backs candidates opposed to sending more aid to Ukraine, while Beijing is pushing for those that support core interests around its claims to Taiwan. Cuba is focused on top-of-mind political issues, including trade embargoes and travel restrictions. 'Havana considers election influence activities as part of its standing requirements to influence those policies, and Florida is a prime target of their activities,&rdquo; said the ODNI official, who added that Cuban operatives have focused heavily on the Latino population and Spanish-speaking voters. A different ODNI official said that campaigns have received 'defensive briefings&rdquo; about the malign influence efforts but declined to name specifics. The official added that the office has delivered more than 'three times the number of briefings that we have delivered in prior election cycles.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/foreign-adversaries-will-aim-discredit-results-after-election-day-intel-officials-warn/400129/	2024-10-08T08:45:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/08/100824electionNG-1/large.jpg
The D Brief: MacDill AFB evacuates; Ukraine hits oil terminal; Ru...	Milton intensifies: Florida residents in the vicinity of Tampa Bay are under new evacuation alerts after Hurricane Milton quickly strengthened Monday into a category five storm headed for the Florida coast. In the hours since, however, it has reduced somewhat into a category four storm expected to make landfall in Florida on Thursday. Latest: 'Milton has the potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida,&rdquo; the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday. On Monday, it reached a maximum intensity of 180 mph, 'making it one of the most intense Atlantic Basin hurricanes on record,&rdquo; according to the Weather Channel. New: Personnel on MacDill Air Force Base are under a limited evacuation order, with basewide closure expected later today. MacDill, which is home to U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command, is situated on a peninsula between St. Petersburg and Tampa&mdash;almost directly in the path of Milton as it's projected to sweep northeast toward Orlando and Daytona Beach. Evacuations began Monday, base officials said in a video on Facebook. The airfield itself is already closed. The base commissary and Post Exchange are closing today at 12 p.m. ET. Portions of seven surrounding counties are also under that limited evacuation order. For more details, you can read over the order (PDF) here. Meanwhile in North Carolina, portions of the 101st Airborne Division are going house to house to find out what storm-hit families need, Liz Friden of Fox reported from Garren Creek, near Asheville. 'Once checked, the soldiers tied a pink ribbon on the houses to mark they had what they needed and told residents they would come back in a few days,&rdquo; said Friden's colleague, Jenn Griffin.

Ukraine is keeping up its campaign of attacking Russia's oil infrastructure, including an early morning strike Monday at a large terminal in occupied Crimea. Troops with Kyiv's missile forces carried out the attack, Ukraine's General Staff said on Facebook. 'The Feodosia terminal is the largest in Crimea in terms of transshipment of oil products, which were used, in particular, to meet the needs of the occupation army of the Russian Federation,&rdquo; the military said in a statement Monday. A bit more, here. Invasion latest: 'Russian troops have now entered Toretsk, a strategic hilltop city, and are pressing with assaults elsewhere in the Donetsk region,&rdquo; the New York Times reported Tuesday from Kyiv. 'To seize the remaining third [of Donetsk], it would need to break through several Ukrainian defensive lines of trenches and anti-tank ditches, and battle its way through densely populated urban centers &mdash; a grueling fight that U.S. officials believe the Russian army cannot successfully wage in the short term.&rdquo; ICYMI: Russia downed one of its prototype UCAVs over Ukraine. Why? In what The War Zone described as 'a bizarre situation,&rdquo; a Russian fighter jet fired a missile at a S-70 Okhotnik-B flying-wing unmanned combat air vehicle on Saturday, downing it miles behind the Ukrainian front line. The UCAV was carrying at least one precision glide bomb, leading to speculation that it was on some sort of operational trials. Purported photos of the downed S-70 are here, and you can read more, here. Iran apparently has China's Silent Hunter anti-drone laser system. The system, which can dazzle or possibly even damage incoming UAVs, made a cameo appearance as part of security measures around a rare public sermon by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Is &lsquo;Big AI' beating 'small AI'&mdash;and what does that mean for the military? The prevailing 'bigger-is-better' approach to artificial intelligence&mdash;ingest more training data, produce larger models, build bigger data centers&mdash;might be undermining the kind of research and development the U.S. military actually needs now and in the future. That's the argument in 'Hype, Sustainability, and the Price of the Bigger-is-Better Paradigm in AI,' a new paper that scrutinizes common assumptions driving AI research. Defense One's Patrick Tucker unpacks that, here. Diego Garcia negotiations update: No 'foreign armed forces.&rdquo; One week after the British announced plans to relinquish sovereignty over a small chain of islands in the Indian Ocean&mdash;except for one with a 99-year lease&mdash;the UK's top diplomat said Mauritius has agreed to new terms that include 'preventing foreign armed forces from accessing or establishing themselves on the outer islands&rdquo; known collectively as Chagos, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced Monday. Chagos includes the island of Diego Garcia, which hosts an obscure yet key outpost for the British and U.S. militaries, as many folks with a naval background are apt to tell you. (That's the island with the nearly century-long exemption from Mauritian sovereignty.) Self-declared 'right of center&rdquo; U.S. naval blogger Cdr. Salamander was particularly aggrieved over the surprise developments when Lammy first announced them last week. An 'epic own-goal&rdquo; is how Salamander described the new direction from the Brits, alleging they seem to get a 'masochist's thrill from damaging themselves and their nation.&rdquo; Some history: The Brits occupied Diego Garcia during the Cold War in a process that ran afoul of the United Nations, forcibly displacing at least 2,000 locals to make room for a naval base. Its location was especially useful later during the U.S.-led Global War on Terror, and British and U.S. officials are keen to not lose that perk&mdash;even though it comes with the baggage of that bygone era of colonialism. Contemporary British officials are trying to thread the needle of shedding some of that baggage while also retaining the strategic benefits of the naval base's geography. That's why the Brits announced last week the islands were indeed Mauritius's sovereign territory, but that the Brits don't plan to depart the base at Diego Garcia until at least another 99 years. The other big fear? Chinese developers would very likely step in where the Brits and U.S. depart. That helps account for the language from Lammy about 'foreign armed forces&rdquo; on Monday. 'From countering malign Iranian activity in the Middle East to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, [Diego Garcia] is critical for our national security,&rdquo; Lammy reminded British lawmakers Monday. 'Without surety of tenure, no base can operate effectively&mdash;nor truly deter our enemies.&rdquo; Perhaps more importantly, at least in the short term, continuing to occupy Diego Garcia without agreeable terms from Mauritius, 'undermined our international standing,&rdquo; Lammy said Monday. With the updated terms, 'We are showing that what we mean is what we say on international law and desire for partnerships with the Global South,&rdquo; which 'strengthens our arguments when it comes to issues like Ukraine or the South China Sea,&rdquo; he said. Next steps: 'After Mauritian elections, the government will move towards treaty signature&rdquo; to formalize the new terms, the foreign secretary said. Afterward, 'it is then our intention to pursue ratification in 2025, by submitting the Treaty and a Bill to [the House of Parliament] for scrutiny,&rdquo; he said In the meantime (emphasis added), 'Mauritius is now free to implement a resettlement programme to islands other than Diego Garcia,&rdquo; which 'has an uncontested long-term future&hellip;under full UK control well into the next century,&rdquo; said Lammy.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-08-2024/400125/	2024-10-08T08:26:40-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/08/DB_lander-1/large.png
Is ‘Big AI’ beating 'small AI'—and what does it mean for the mili...	The prevailing 'bigger-is-better' approach to artificial intelligence&mdash;ingest more training data, produce larger models, build bigger data centers&mdash;might be undermining the kind of research and development the U.S. military actually needs now and in the future. That's the argument in 'Hype, Sustainability, and the Price of the Bigger-is-Better Paradigm in AI,' a new paper that scrutinizes common assumptions driving AI research. Its authors demonstrate that the performance of larger models doesn't necessarily justify the vastly increased resources needed to build and power them. They also argue that concentrating AI efforts in a relative handful of big tech companies adds geopolitical risks. Broadly speaking, the Defense Department is pursuing AI along two tracks: large models that require enormous computational resources, and smaller, on-platform AI that can function disconnected from the internet. In some ways, the study validates the second approach. But, the authors note, future research in 'small AI&rdquo; could be limited due to growing influence of large AI providers. Where does the idea that bigger is better, at least in AI, come from? In their paper, Ga&euml;l Varoquaux of Universit&eacute; Paris-Saclay, Alexandra Sasha Luccioni of the Quebec AI Institute, and Meredith Whittaker of the Signal Foundation trace it to a 2012 paper by University of Toronto professor Alex Krizhevsk, who argued big data and large-scale neural networks offered much better results for image classification than smaller ones. This idea was borne out by other researchers, and has since become a staple of the way large companies are approaching AI. 'The consequence of this is both an explosion in investment in large-scale AI models and a concomitant spike in the size of the notable (highly cited) models. Generative AI, whether for images or text, has taken this assumption to a new level, both within the AI research discipline and as a component of the popular &lsquo;bigger-is-better' narrative surrounding AI,&rdquo; they write. The authors gather evidence to show that benefits of scaling up AI models diminish rapidly compared to the increased computational demands. For instance, the environmental cost&mdash;measured in energy consumption&mdash;rises significantly faster than the improvement in model performance, making large-scale AI not especially efficient. That's lost on a lot of big AI's richest and most well-known boosters like former Google chairman Eric Schmidt, who argued last week that businesses and governments should continue to pursue energy-intensive large AI models regardless of the energy cost because 'we're not going to hit the climate goals anyway.&rdquo; The military can't take such a cavalier approach to the massive energy costs of AI. The Defense Department views climate change as a national security concern but, more immediately, also views energy efficiency as a key military objective for future operations. What's worse, the bigger-is-better conventional wisdom AI research is narrowing and losing diversity, they write.''The bigger-is-better norm is also self-reinforcing, shaping the AI research field by informing what kinds of research is incentivized.&rdquo; That means that researchers will increasingly ignore areas where smaller models could make a big difference, in fields like healthcare and education. Although the authors don't address it in their paper, that narrowing effect has ramifications for the military's own development of AI. Smaller models could also make a big difference in places where computer resources are scarce and connectivity is intermittent, sparse, or even non-existent. That could apply to everything from autonomous drones operating in environments saturated with adversary electromagnetic warfare effects to small bases in forward locations where energy is scarce and connectivity is weak. The rapid evolution of weapons and tactics means that more and more operators close to the edge of combat will have to invent or modify their own gear and weapons. Operators at forward bases might face a lot of situations where they may have good use for an AI model that runs on a relatively small corpus of data and doesn't require a massive server farm or lots of GPUs to work. These might include applications that analyze drone- or satellite-image data for specific types of vehicles , parsing the specific electromagnetic weapons signatures they are encountering, or even just understanding local economic, weather, population or consumer data to plan more effective and safe operations in dense urban settings. But if the AI research field prioritizes expertise in big AI over small, that could mean less scholarship and fewer experts to train operators in how to make their own small AI models well. The growing trend toward big AI has another geopolitical implication, a concentration of power. Only a few companies possess the resources to build and deploy massive models. 'The concentrated private industry power over AI creates a small, and financially incentivized segment of AI decision makers. We should consider how such concentrated power with agency over centralized AI could shape society under more authoritarian conditions,&rdquo; they write. One obvious example of the threat that poses is Elon Musk, one of the world's richest defense contractors and, through SpaceX, a key supplier of space access and satellite communications to the Pentagon. Musk also has close financial ties to Saudi Arabia and has used his large and expensive social media presence to boost posts and content linked to Russian disinformation operations. Musk is also emerging as one of the key financial players in the development of future AI. Whittaker and her fellow authors are among a small but growing number of AI-focused researchers who point out the risks posed by the prevalence of the bigger-is-better school of AI. A separate paper, published in September by a group of researchers at Berkeley also notes 'It is exceedingly common for smaller, more task-focused models to perform better than large, broad-purpose models on specific downstream tasks.&rdquo; A new class of innovative AI practitioners are also highlighting the degree to which the conversation around big AI is drowning out approaches that could be more useful for specific groups. Pete Warden, CEO of AI startup Useful Sensors, is one of them. Warden's work focuses on embedding intelligence into devices or computers. He says that the industry and academic obsession with larger AI is missing what most people actually want from the AI they interact with. 'Academic benchmarks have diverged from real-world requirements,&rdquo; Warden said. 'For example a lot of customers just want to be able to retrieve results from existing information (like user manuals) rather than generating new text in response to questions, but that isn't seen as interesting by researchers.&rdquo; Retrieval-Augmented Generation, he said, is an academic hobby horse. But customer applications don't need that level of complexity,&rdquo; he told Defense One. 'For a lot of realistic problems, like drone tracking for example, the underlying models are now good enough and the real challenge is integrating them into larger systems. We don't need any more computer vision breakthroughs or new model architectures. We just need better data that reflects the actual problems in deployment and a way to fit the models onto hardware.&rdquo; Drew Breunig ran data science and strategic client projects at PlaceIQ, which is now part of Precisely. In September he wrote a post on how many peoples' high expectations of generative AI, the quintessential example of large AI models, are unlikely to be met. When those realizations settle in, that could lead to a broader discussion about different potential paths for AI development. Breunig told Defense One: 'The capability of our existing models greatly outpace the [user interface] and frameworks we've built to deliver their intelligence for nearly all the real world problems they solve.&rdquo; He breaks AI into three groups. 'Gods,&rdquo; which he defines as 'Superintelligence AGI stuff. Replacement for humans doing lots of different things, unsupervised.&rdquo; Beneath them are 'interns&rdquo; which he describes as 'Copilots. Domain-specific applications that help experts with busy and tedious work, doing things an intern might. Interns are supervised by experts, so your tolerance for hallucinations is high. The programmer, writer, or whomever spots the mistakes when they occur and moves on.&rdquo; Finally, the most local form of AI is 'Cogs,&rdquo; defined as 'Models that have been tuned to do one job, with very low tolerance for errors, working unsupervised within applications or pipelines. This is by far the dominant use case I am seeing in the enterprise. All the big platforms (AWS, Azure, Databricks, etc) have pivoted to helping companies load their proprietary data to tune open models to do one little thing well.&rdquo; Even though generative AI pilots get a lot more attention the military is exploring all three of them through programs that provide decision assistance for target identification, i.e. Project Maven, and other decision assistance efforts,&rdquo; and 'cog&rdquo; efforts such as visual recognition of instrument indicators in helicopter cockpits. Because such needs will only grow, it's important for the military that the future of AI research be broad enough to continue to support all three areas. 'Pete and I see eye to eye on this,&rdquo; said Breunig. 'When Pete says the academics' research cases are out of step with the practical reality of actually building with AI, it's because a lot of their focus is on attaining gods not the boring job of building cogs.The cool thing about focusing on cogs is you can do so much with little models! A tiny model tuned for one thing can outperform a giant general model at the same task. And it's faster, cheaper, etc.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/big-ai-prevailing-over-small-ai-and-what-does-mean-military/400111/	2024-10-07T18:26:16-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/07/GettyImages_2087343447/large.jpg
Navy places two new submarine contract modifications	Oct. 4 brought a pair of nine-figure modifications to Naval Sea Systems Command contracts with General Dynamics Electric Boat. The first was a $377 million cost-plus-fixed-fee modification to a previously awarded contract for lead yard support and development studies and design efforts related to Virginia-class submarines. Work is expected to be completed by October 2025. The second was a not-to-exceed $244 million cost-plus-fixed-fee undefinitized order against a previously issued basic ordering agreement to provide unique parts and specialized material, including initial spares, for Virginia-class submarines. Work is expected to be completed by September 2028. [[Related Posts]] A Navy study of the country's submarine-construction infrastructure concluded that tentative plans to produce two Virginia-class SSNs and one Columbia-class SSBN per year for 12 years are viable, given sufficient funding. By the end of that run, the newest of the Improved Los Angeles-class SSN 688s will be 40 years old and overdue for replacement, adding pressure to meet at least the two-SSN's-per-year goal. The Virginia-class Block V construction has seen delays, which the Government Accountability Office has ascribed to supply-chain problems, workforce shortages, and limited shipyard capacity that have made it difficult for the Navy to produce two submarines a year. Throw into the mix the AUKUS plan for the U.S. to sell three Virginia-class submarines for operational deployment in the early 2030s, which comes with an option to buy two more, for a total of five. The U.S. will be hard-pressed to meet its own force requirements. While such a sale will have to have the approval of the U.S. Congress, Australia's fielding of Virginia-class submarines as soon as possible would provide a stopgap until Australia begins fielding its own SSN-AUKUS submarines, which are planned to be operational in the early 2040s. The latest plan floating around is for the U.S. to transfer two of its current Virginia-class submarines (probably Block III or IV) to Australia, with the third to come off the current production line. Although not set in stone, this is likely the best solution to fill the gap between the retirement of Australia's Collins-class diesel-electric submarines and the planned SSN-AUKUS submarines. Some have suggested that the Navy will begin to order three SSNs per year after the final Columbia is delivered.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/10/navy-places-two-new-submarine-contract-modifications/400113/	2024-10-07T18:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/07/FacebookXCopy_LinkEm_2500/large.jpg
The Middle East is in a new era of mass displacement	A year of conflict has ushered in a new era of mass displacement in the Middle East. Since Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the subsequent sustained Israeli bombardment of Gaza, Israel has expanded its operations on multiple fronts to include the West Bank, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon. With fighting continuing unabated and the prospects for a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel rising, the region is now in a new period of internal and cross-border displacement that has already uprooted millions. As scholars of migration, we fear that the results of such displacement will affect the region for years to come &ndash; and is likely to further hamper the ability of the region's people to live safe and secure lives. Israel's ongoing attacks have forced nearly 2 million Palestinians to flee their homes in Gaza over the past year, amounting to 9 in 10 inhabitants of the densely populated strip. What is unique about the scale of the displacement in Gaza is that nearly all internally displaced persons remain trapped, unable to leave the territory amid Israel's ongoing border closure and bombardment. This has intensified cascading humanitarian crises, including famine and the spread of disease, along with countless other hardships that make normal life nearly impossible. For many Palestinians in Gaza, the yearlong bombardment has meant repeated displacement as Israeli attacks shift from area to area, amid shrinking humanitarian spaces. And although there are complex historical and geopolitical reasons regarding the border closures, international law experts argue that Egypt and Israel have violated international refugee law by refusing to allow Palestinians in Gaza to cross the Rafah border to seek asylum. The situation in Gaza is structurally different from previous displacement crises in the region &ndash; even in civil war-torn Syria, where cross-border aid operations have constantly been on the brink of collapse. That's because Israel continues to limit and block aid into the territory, and humanitarian workers struggle to provide the bare minimum of food, shelter and medical care during bombing campaigns that have rarely stopped. To make matters worse, the experience of the past year has shown that refugee camps, civilian apartment buildings, U.N. schools, and hospitals serving civilians and refugees are not safe spaces. Israel frequently justifies its attacks on such locations by saying they are used by Hamas or Hezbollah, despite formal U.N. disputes of many of these accusations. At least 220 U.N. workers have also been killed in these targeted Israeli attacks in the past year &ndash; more than any other crisis ever recorded. This contributes to humanitarian workers struggling to access populations in need, especially displaced individuals. For its part, the United States continues to be the top donor to the the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) and the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), as well as the top supplier of weapons to Israel. In Lebanon, massive displacement has also resulted from Israel's developing war with Hezbollah. Even before the September escalation of conflict across the Lebanon-Israel border, nearly 100,000 Lebanese had been displaced from their homes in the country's south due to Israeli shelling. Meanwhile, approximately 63,000 Israelis were internally displaced from the country's north due to Hezbollah's rocket attacks. But starting in late September 2024, Israeli strikes on Hezbollah and Palestinian targets in Beirut and across Lebanon killed hundreds of civilians and exponentially increased internal and cross-border displacement. More than 1 million Lebanese have now fled their homes in a matter of days amid Israel's invasion and bombardment. In addition, Syrian refugees and the large migrant worker population in Lebanon were also displaced, with many sleeping on the streets or in makeshift tents, unable to access buildings that were converted into shelters for Lebanese. In a separate stark example of reverse migration, about 230,000 people &ndash; both Lebanese and Syrians &ndash; have fled across the border into Syria. Bringing the recent regional conflicts full circle with post-2011 Arab uprising displacement and crisis, returning home is an unsafe option for many Syrians who still fear repression under the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Israel's ongoing invasion of Lebanon is likely to only amplify these trends, as the country ordered numerous villages and towns in the country's south &ndash; miles above the U.N.-recognized buffer zone &ndash; to evacuate. Over several decades, the Middle East has experienced many large-scale, cross-border displacements for myriad reasons. The original forced displacement of Palestinians surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948 and subsequent conflicts created the world's longest-standing refugee situation, with approximately 6 million Palestinians living across the Levant. The first Gulf War, sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s and the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq produced millions of refugees, with long-standing political repercussions for the region. More recently, the 2011 Arab uprisings and the wars that followed in Syria, Yemen and Libya created millions of refugees, as well as internally displaced peoples, with nearly 6 million Syrians still living in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan and another 6 million displaced inside Syria. Because Syrians have largely not returned home, international organizations have become a semipermanent safety net to provide basic services to refugees and host communities. New layers of displacement in Lebanon &ndash; nationals, refugees and migrant workers &ndash; as well as cross-border movement into Syria will put further strain on the underfunded system of humanitarian assistance. Further, the current Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon is not the first time conflict between the state and its neighbor to the north has preceded large-scale displacement. In an attempt to eliminate the Palestinian Liberation Organization, Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and again in 1982. Israel's 1982 invasion led to the Sabra and Shatila massacres of between 1,500-3,000 Palestinian civilians &ndash; carried out by Israel's Lebanese Christian allies &ndash; showing that military operations that do not distinguish between militants and civilians can lead to devastating impacts for displaced populations. Between 600,000 and 900,000 Lebanese fled abroad during the entire course of the country's civil war from 1975 to 1990. Two decades later, Israel again invaded Lebanon in 2006 in an attempt to stamp out Hezbollah, leading approximately 900,000 Lebanese to flee the south &ndash; both internally and across the border into Syria. While the speed and volume of Lebanese displacement in 2006 was unprecedented at the time, the number of people forced to flee in late September and early October 2024 has quickly surpassed that record. So, the region is well versed with the consequences of mass displacement. But what is clear a year into the current conflict is that the Middle East is now in a new era of displacement &ndash; in terms of scale and kind. And the number of families' lives disrupted by this new era of displacement looks set only to increase. Tensions in the region have escalated further with fresh missile attacks against Israel from Iran and threats of retaliation by Israel. The experience of decades of conflict in the region is that civilians are most likely to bear the brunt of fighting &ndash; whether through forced displacement, an inability to access food or medical care, or death. Only by way of a cessation of current hostilities and a lasting cease-fire across the region can the conditions be set for at-risk populations to begin to return and rebuild. This is particularly true for those displaced in Gaza who have been repeatedly forced from their homes, but have no borders over which they can cross to safety, and for whom a political solution remains elusive.

The D Brief: Another hurricane looms; Grim anniversary in Israel;...	From Helene to Milton: The death toll from late September's Hurricane Helene has risen to at least 230 people as recovery efforts continue in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, and the Carolinas, the Associated Press reported Monday. More than 250,000 are still without power across the south, with the majority (136,180) in North Carolina alone, according to Poweroutage.us. New this weekend: 'The entire length of the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia is closed&rdquo; &mdash; that's 469 miles of road &mdash; 'as crews continue their assessment of the damage from Hurricane Helene,&rdquo; the National Park Service said Saturday after erosion washed out significant portions of the scenic highway. 'Based on what the teams have seen so far, significant, and in some cases catastrophic, damage has occurred along the parkway, particularly from milepost 280 to milepost 469,&rdquo; officials said. Panning out: Nearly 7,000 federal workers are helping, including more than 1,200 Urban Search and Rescue personnel who have helped rescue or support more than 3,200 people in North Carolina so far, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Sunday. Additional FEMA workers have shipped out meals, water, generators and tarps to those in need. The Army Corps of Engineers is on duty conducting assessments around North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Their tasks span water/wastewater checks, bridge and road inspections, debris removal, and more. Almost 1,000 active duty soldiers from Fort Campbell and Fort Liberty are also helping out around western North Carolina in the vicinity of the hard-hit mountain town of Asheville, where flooding swept away key stretches of road, leaving many folks stranded. An additional 500 active duty soldiers will join the recovery efforts soon, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement Sunday. The thousand or so active troops come from the 82nd Airborne, the 101st Airborne, the 20th Engineer Brigade, the 18th Airborne Corps, and others, according to officials at Northern Command, which helps coordinate efforts across the U.S. mainland, with FEMA leading overall efforts. Worth noting: 'The National Guard has activated more than 6,100 Guardsmen, hundreds of high-water vehicles, and dozens of helicopters and rescue boats from 18 different states in State-Active-Duty status,&rdquo; Ryder said Sunday. Status report: The Georgia National Guard has their hands busy passing out supplies. The Tennessee National Guard is clearing debris. The North Carolina National Guard is doing a bit of it all. And the Florida National Guard is preparing for another major storm, which could make landfall Wednesday, Hurricane Milton. What might lie ahead with Milton: 'A possible 8- to 12-foot storm surge (2.4 to 3.6 meters) in Tampa Bay and said flash and river flooding could result from 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) of rain in mainland Florida and the Keys,&rdquo; AP reports, citing forecasters. Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis expanded his state of emergency declaration on Sunday to 51 counties across the state in anticipation of Milton. He also cautioned that more power outages were likely, and recommended residents keep at least a week's worth of food and water available&mdash;and be ready to drive elsewhere to safety. For the latest, check out Floridadisaster.org/Updates. Misinformation and lies are disrupting Helen recovery efforts, so FEMA has had to create a website to dispel some of the rumors being spread. According to AP: 'Republicans, led by the former president, have helped foster a frenzy of misinformation over the past week among the communities most devastated by Helene, promoting a number of false claims, including that Washington is intentionally withholding aid to people in Republican areas.&rdquo; Of particular note: Donald Trump 'has lied about the federal hurricane response with staggering frequency and variety,&rdquo; CNN's Daniel Dale reported in a fact check published Sunday. Also not helping: Georgia conspiracy theorist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who wrote on social media Thursday that unspecified humans 'control the weather.&rdquo; Related reading: 'FEMA's Criswell dismisses 'ridiculous' Helene recovery falsehoods,&rdquo; ABC News reported Sunday after an interview with Criswell; 'Helene recovery is more political online than on the ground,&rdquo; NPR reported Monday; 'Hurricane Milton Intensifies Into A Category 4; Prompts Hurricane And Storm Surge Watches In Florida,&rdquo; the Weather Channel reported Monday morning.

It's been one year since Hamas launched its brutal surprise attack on Israel, killing more than 1,100 people. The Oct. 7, 2023, attack 'brought to the surface painful memories left by millennia of hatred and violence against the Jewish people,&rdquo; President Biden said in a statement Monday. 'One year later, Vice President Harris and I remain fully committed to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist,&rdquo; he said, and stressed, 'We support Israel's right to defend itself against attacks from Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and Iran.&rdquo; 'What Hamas did that day was pure evil &ndash; it was brutal and sickening,&rdquo; said Vice President Kamala Harris in her own statement Monday. 'We will not forget, and we will not lose faith,&rdquo; she said. 'And in honor of all those souls we lost on October 7, we must never lose sight of the dream of peace, dignity, and security for all.&rdquo; Timeline and outlook: Axios looks back at what happened on Oct. 7, 2023, what's going on now, and where it might all lead. Read that, here. Latest: 'At least seven people were injured late Sunday in what Israel said was a Hezbollah rocket attack on the northern Israeli cities of Haifa and Tiberias,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported, adding that on Monday afternoon, Israel bombarded areas around Lebanon's southern city of Tyre. Additional reading: 'Mossad's pager operation: Inside Israel's penetration of Hezbollah,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Saturday. Inside the Marine Corps' first-ever littoral regiment. Much of what the 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment trains for is basic infantry operations&mdash;with a modern and Pacific twist, its leaders told Defense One's Jen Hlad during a recent exercise. 'When we go on the next deployment, we're going to be pretty disaggregated, seizing key maritime terrain, providing the sensing capability and things like that,&rdquo; said Staff Sgt. Dylan Greene of Banjo Company. And unlike in Afghanistan and Iraq, 'The most challenging thing is going to be [that] we do not have air dominance. I would argue we don't even probably have air superiority, just because of near-peer, and also just going to be like signature management.&rdquo; More, here. A destroyer's first deployment took an unexpected turn. The USS Daniel Inouye's maiden deployment was supposed to be seven months long, mostly working with regional partners such as Japan and Korea as part of the Theodore Roosevelt strike group. But as tensions in the Red Sea heated up, the group's deployment was extended, and the brand-new destroyer received a fresh tasking: deter aggression and protect 'the free flow of commerce&rdquo; in the waters of the Middle East. Hlad talked with the destroyer's leadership as it returned to its home port of Pearl Harbor. Read that, here. And lastly: For several months, Chinese government hackers penetrated major U.S. broadband providers, 'potentially accessing information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized network wiretapping requests,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. Targets included Verizon Communications, AT&T and Lumen Technologies, among others, officials said, describing it as 'a potentially catastrophic security breach,&rdquo; according to the Journal. 'Hackers apparently exfiltrated some data from Verizon networks by reconfiguring Cisco routers,&rdquo; the Washington Post reports (gift link). 'The fact that they were able to make changes in the routers without detection reflects the sophistication of the adversary but also raises questions about Verizon's security posture, analysts said.&rdquo; Read more at BleepingComputer, here.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-07-2024/400087/	2024-10-07T08:15:48-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/07/DB_lander/large.png
Inside the Marine Corps’ first-ever littoral regiment	MARINE CORPS BASE HAWAII&mdash;'Hold right, clear left.&rdquo; Four Marines in helmets and flak jackets are stacked outside a rusty metal building covered in faux brick and wood. The first enters the doorway with his rifle at the ready, followed by the other three, while 2nd Lt. Alex Willbanks observes inside. Other than the color of the camouflage, the scene is virtually indistinguishable from Marine pre-deployment training at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. But instead of a traditional infantry unit preparing for a counterinsurgency fight in the desert, these Marines are part of the Corps' first-ever littoral regiment, getting ready for a potential future war in the Pacific. Back in 2008, Willbanks was one of the young enlisted Marines just learning how to clear a room before he deployed to Afghanistan with 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment. Now he's back as an officer in the two-year-old 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment, passing on his hard-earned knowledge to new Marines. 'The MLR is still rooted in infantry tasks, but has a new flavor to it,&rdquo; Willbanks said after a morning of training at the base's Military Operations on Urban Terrain, or MOUT, facility here. 'It still does the same things that every other unit would do, but now we're looking at the Indo-Pacific region and deploying up there, as opposed to what we did in' the Global War on Terror.&rdquo; The 3rd Marine Regiment became the 3rd MLR on March 4, 2022, in a ceremony that created the first of three such units prescribed by the service's Force Design 2030 transformation effort. A second MLR is now being formed in Okinawa, with a third planned for Guam. Unlike the Corps' traditional infantry regiments, which are composed of a headquarters company and four infantry battalions, the 3rd MLR has a headquarters element and three subordinate commands: 3rd Littoral Anti-Air Battalion, Combat Logistics Battalion 3, and Littoral Combat Team 3. The Force Design concept, including the design of the MLRs, faced criticism from a cadre of retired general officers early on, who said the changes would weaken the Marine Corps and take focus away from the infantry. Willbanks said he understands some of the criticisms, but noted that 'Marines are still doing the same things that they did before, even looking at peacetime, going into Desert Storm and everything. Like, everyone at some point was training to do a certain thing, and then we pivoted immediately to direct ourselves at what the new threat was&hellip;I think everyone's going to have their own preference of what they think the Marine Corps should be doing. But I think at this time, from my understanding, we're doing what is needed.&rdquo; Across base, on a grass sports field across the street from a rocky beach, Staff Sgt. Dylan Greene and the rest of Banjo Company&mdash;part of the Littoral Combat Team&mdash;are rehearsing for fire team attack training. 'The basic skills have not changed at all,&rdquo; Greene said. As the unit moves closer to its planned deployment next summer, the Banjo Company Marines will begin integrating with the scout platoon, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, and small drone operators. 'When we go on the next deployment, we're going to be pretty disaggregated, seizing key maritime terrain, providing the sensing capability and things like that,&rdquo; he said. And unlike in Afghanistan and Iraq, 'The most challenging thing is going to be [that] we do not have air dominance. I would argue we don't even probably have air superiority, just because of near-peer, and also just going to be like signature management.&rdquo; Greene said there have been a lot of discussions about how to manage not just electromagnetic and radio signatures, but other types of signatures as well., He pointed out the unit's new camouflage netting, which is smoother than the previous version and provides a 'nice thermal screen&rdquo; for people standing underneath if a drone flies by. Up a steep hill from the sports field, on a training range inside a crater, 1st Lt. Seth Benscoter and Chaos Company's 2nd Platoon are practicing basic infantry skills. 'Buddy fire and movement, being able to shoot at the target&mdash;the guy in front shoot at the target, and the guy behind him sort of see what's going on, assess how the rounds are making it downrange, and then when he's ready, he moves, so on and so forth until they are able to get close,&rdquo; Benscoter said. The skills are the same that any infantry unit might practice&mdash;MLR Marines refer to traditional infantry regiments as 'legacy units&rdquo;&mdash;but as the deployment training cycle continues, 'it'll get more complicated,&rdquo; he said. Asked about how the unit is adapting to the shift in focus from land battles to working with the Navy for amphibious operations, Benscoter said he thinks that's something the entire Marine Corps is working through. 'We haven't done that, aside from [Marine Expeditionary Units] in a very, very long time, and actually affected an amphibious assault at a larger scale,&rdquo; he said. 'I think it's not, it's not really just the LCT and the MLR that's working through that, but it's kind of the entire Corps' priorities.&rdquo; Back at the MOUT facility, Willbanks is underscoring the importance of fundamentals. 'I can't tell you the answer to everything&hellip;you have to be postured and ready to pivot at a moment's notice,&rdquo; he said. 'There are some standardized ways and practices to do these things, but at the end of the day, you have to rely on your instincts.&rdquo; A contractor who served 14 years as a Marine helicopter pilot overhears the conversation and jumps in: 'Just because you can see some guys in an open desert from eight miles away doesn't mean you're going to find anything in a triple-canopy jungle in the middle of the Philippines, right? Like, it doesn't translate sometimes, and you need to be ready to solve that problem.&rdquo; The contractor, Brent Kreckman, said the MLR Marines are 'building those little building blocks, like how to break down the door and clear the room, that they can then go, &lsquo;Well, how am I going to apply this there? And how do I avoid the small drone problems? How do I avoid booby trap problems?' And they get to solve a new problem set&rdquo; without the bias that some of the older Marines have. That ability to take initiative is trained into them, Benscoter said. 'The NCOs in the infantry, and even the more junior guys, they're trained to critically think and to not just follow orders, but to seize initiative,&rdquo; he said. 'I think the best part of the Marine Corps is that no matter what the mission is, no matter what the time period, the technology, whatever, our whole goal is to be ready when we're called on. And I don't think that culture's going anywhere.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/inside-marine-corps-first-ever-littoral-regiment/400084/	2024-10-06T13:17:28-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/06/mlr_8679447/large.jpg
A destroyer’s first deployment took an unexpected turn	PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii&mdash;The USS Daniel Inouye's maiden deployment was supposed to be seven months long, and include mostly 'encouraging stability&rdquo; by working with regional partners like Japan and Korea as part of the Theodore Roosevelt strike group. But as tensions in the Red Sea heated up, the group's deployment was extended, and the brand-new destroyer received a fresh tasking: deter aggression and protect 'the free flow of commerce&rdquo; in the waters of the Middle East. While there, the crew heard an emergency call. 'A distressed mariner is a distressed mariner,&rdquo; Cmdr. Kevin Dore, the commander of the Inouye, said Friday after his ship and crew tied up at their homeport here. 'If an emergency like that happens, it is &lsquo;Get there as fast as you can and do everything you can' to save what, in this case, was two distressed mariners who happened to be Iranian.&rdquo; The crew sent search-and-rescue swimmers out in a small boat, rescued the mariners, and gave them medical assistance. 'That was really one of those moments where we see the team fully come together, because we knew there were lives at stake, and the crew gets that. It's incredible to watch that happen and really to be able to take action and to make a difference,&rdquo; Dore said. Cmdr. Ryan Kelly, the ship's executive officer, said the crew quickly drew on their training. 'Everyone was cool under pressure, and they executed the mission just like we asked, every single time. And that was just another perfect example of being ready for anything,&rdquo; Kelly said. The Inouye returned home Friday to a crowd of cheering families holding signs, leis, and in one case, a Starbucks iced coffee with a curly straw. 'I've been a part of a lot of great crews before, but this team on board Daniel Inouye is one of the most special and unique groups of people that I've ever been a part of,&rdquo; Kelly said. 'Every challenge, every piece of adversity that we felt through an entire nine-month deployment, they just delivered every single time.&rdquo; The homecoming is a key milestone for the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, which was commissioned in 2021 and named for Sen. Daniel Inouye, who represented Hawaii in Congress from 1959, when it became a state, until his death in 2012. Inouye earned the Medal of Honor for his service in the Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team during World War II. The destroyer served as the air and missile defense commander for the Roosevelt strike group during the deployment, and Dore said the ship's helicopter detachment did 'a massive amount of flight ops,&rdquo; the vast majority of which were at night. 'We asked a lot of them, and they delivered,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/destroyers-first-deployment-took-unexpected-turn/400083/	2024-10-06T08:19:55-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/06/The_Arleigh_Burke_cl_2500/large.jpg
Iran’s Oct. 1 strike on Israel had several meanings.	Israel and Iran are at war. In truth, the two sides have been fighting for decades, but the conflict has played out largely under the cover of covert and clandestine operations. The recent actions of both sides in this once 'shadow war&rdquo; have changed the nature of the conflict. It is not clear that de-escalation is on the horizon. On Oct 1, 2024, Iran launched a massive, direct attack against Israel notionally in retribution for Israel's dual assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah's chief, Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. It was the second such barrage in six months. By many accounts, the previous Iranian attack against Israel on April 13 &ndash; which consisted of over 300 ballistic and cruise missiles and attack drones &ndash; caused very little damage to Israel. Perhaps because of this, and likely in part due to U.S. encouragement of restraint, Israel's immediate military response then &ndash; an airstrike against a single advanced Iranian air defense system in the Isfahan province &ndash; was somewhat measured. Many onlookers saw the calibrated exchange in April as a possible indication that both sides would prefer to de-escalate rather than engage in ongoing open warfare. But further Israeli military operations since then have prompted escalatory Iranian military responses, forcing the conflict back out of the shadows. With Hamas' capabilities and leadership degraded in the Gaza Strip, Israel's military leaders announced in June that they were 'ready to face&rdquo; Hezbollah &ndash; the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group whose persistent rocket attacks against northern Israel have caused tens of thousands to evacuate the area. Israel's pivot from Gaza toward Lebanon coincided with the July 31, 2024, assassination of Hamas' political bureau chairman, Haniyeh, during his stay in Tehran. The purported Israeli operation was seen as an affront to Iran's sovereignty. It was also an embarrassment that highlighted the vulnerability and permeability of Iran's internal security apparatus. Even though Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei vowed a 'harsh response&rdquo; against Israel, by September Iran had taken no action. Tehran's inaction caused many Middle East analysts to question if the Iranian response would ever materialize &ndash; and by extension, what that would mean for Khamenei's commitment to his proxy forces. If indeed Iran's leadership opted for restraint following the assassination of Hamas' top political leader, the same could not be said for its reaction to Israel's multiphase operation against Hezbollah in mid-September. Israel began with a clandestine operation to sow chaos and confusion in Hezbollah's command and control through the means of sabotaged explosive communications devices. Israel then carried out airstrikes eliminating Hezbollah's top leaders including Nasrallah. The Israeli military then launched what the country's leaders describe as a 'limited [ground] operation&rdquo; into southern Lebanon to remove Hezbollah positions along the northern border. Tehran's Oct 1. attack in response against Israel was, according to many Middle East experts and indeed Iranian military leaders, primarily a retaliation for the two high-profile assassinations against Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. These were certainly key factors. But as an expert on Iran's defense strategy, I argue that Iran's leaders also felt compelled to attack Israel for three equally, if not more important, reasons: to slow Israel's advance in Lebanon, to save face, and to restore deterrence. Iran hopes to slow and potentially reverse Israel's successes against Hezbollah, especially as Israel embarks on ground operations into southern Lebanon. Of course, Israeli ground troops must now deal with what is perhaps the world's most capable guerrilla fighting force &ndash; one that performed quite successfullyduring the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Nevertheless, Israel's ability to achieve a tactical surprise and eliminate Hezbollah's top leaders &ndash; even in the midst of an ongoing localized war, and even after Israel's leaders announced their intention to engage Hezbollah &ndash; reveals a far superior Israeli strategy and operational planning and execution capability than that of Hezbollah. And that presents a huge blow to what is seen in Iran as the Islamic Republic's crown jewel within its 'Axis of Resistance.&rdquo; In this respect, the Oct. 1 retaliatory strike by Iran can be seen as an attempt to afford Hezbollah time to appoint replacement leadership, regroup and organize against Israel's ground invasion. It also serves to help Iran save face, especially in how it's seen by other parts of its external proxy network. Orchestrated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, or IRGC &ndash; Tehran's primary arm for coordinating external operations &ndash; Iranian money, training, guidance and ideological support enabled and encouraged the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack against Israel &ndash; even, as it has claimed, Iran had no prior warning of the assault. Since then, Hamas fighters have received almost no real-time support from Tehran. This lack of support has no doubt contributed to Hamas being successfully degraded as a threat by Israel, with many of its members either dead or in hiding and unable to mount a coherent offensive campaign, leading Israel's military leaders to claim the group has been effectively defeated. Unsurprisingly, Iran is glad to enable Palestinians to fight Tehran's enemies and absorb the human costs of war, because this arrangement primarily benefits the Islamic Republic. Once the fighting in Gaza started, the IRGC was nowhere to be found. Now that Israel has shifted its attention to Lebanon and scored several initial tactical successes against Hezbollah, Iran cannot afford to stand back and watch for two main reasons. First, a year of fighting in Gaza has demonstrated that Israel is willing to do whatever it takes to eliminate threats along its borders &ndash; including a willingness to withstand international political pressure or operate within Iran's borders. And second, Iran's proxy groups elsewhere are watching to see if Tehran will continue supporting them &ndash; or will abandon them, as it seemingly has done with Hamas. Perhaps above all, in Tehran's calculus over how to respond is Iran's need to restore a deterrence. The two defining features of Iran's interrelated external, or 'forward defense,&rdquo; and deterrence strategies is its regional network of militant proxies and its long-range weapons arsenal, which includes a large number of advanced ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and attack-capable drones. These Iranian defense strategies seek to dissuade enemies from attacking Iran proper in two ways: first, by threatening Israel and other regional U.S. allies with punishment via proxy militia or long-range weapon attacks; and second, by offering scapegoat targets against which Iran's enemies can express their rage. In effect, Iran's proxy forces act as proxy targets that pay the costs for Iran's hostile policies. Israel's degradation of Hamas and ongoing operations against Hezbollah threaten to undermine Iran's ability to deter attacks against the homeland. For the Islamic Republic's leaders, this is an unacceptable risk. These interweaving imperatives likely prompted Iran's leaders to launch a second massive, direct missile attack on Oct. 1 against Israel. How effective the strike will be in achieving any of Tehran's aims is unknown. The Islamic Republic claimed that as many as 90% of the ballistic missiles reached their intended targets, while Israel and the United States characterize the attack as having been 'defeated and ineffective,&rdquo; despite unverified cellphone videos showing several ballistic missiles detonating after reaching land in Israel. What is almost certain, however, is that this will not be the last move in the conflict. Israel is unlikely to halt its Lebanon operation until it achieves its border security objectives. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed retaliation against Iran for its latest retaliatory attack. IRGC leaders met this warning with a counterthreat of their own that if Israel responds to the Oct. 1 attack militarily, Iran will again respond with unspecified 'crushing and destructive attacks.&rdquo; Rhetorically, neither side is backing down; militarily this may be true, too. The nature and scope of Israel's next move will dictate how the war with Iran develops &ndash; but make no mistake, it is a war.

The D Brief: Helene recovery; 100 new spy sats; Post-strike asses...	Hurricane Helene's death toll across the southern U.S. has now risen to 215, making it the deadliest storm to hit the mainland since Hurricane Katrina almost 20 years ago. (Hurricane Maria remains the deadliest, with nearly 3,000 who perished in Puerto Rico alone.) Just over a week after landfall, more than 740,000 people across five states are still without power. That includes 500,000 in the Carolinas and 200,000 in Georgia, according to PowerOutage.Us. For the U.S. military, 'More than 6,700 National Guardsmen from 16 states have been spearheading recovery efforts across the Southeast region in support of their governors, providing critical aid to those impacted by this storm's devastation,&rdquo; Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Thursday. That includes service members who lost their homes but are still reporting for duty, according to Col. Paul Hollenack of the North Carolina National Guard. (Task & Purpose has more on that.) One thousand active duty troops from Army base Fort Liberty have also been tasked to assist with recovery efforts, Singh said. They'll be working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Volunteer pilots are bringing out their Cessnas to assist as well, with more than 350 flights ferrying supplies throughout the region via North Carolina's Concord-Padgett Regional Airport as of Thursday. 'Another 215 supply flights using helicopters have taken off from Hickory Regional Airport, which is about 60 miles northwest of Concord,&rdquo; NBC News reports.

On this day in 1957, the Soviets became the first to put a satellite into orbit with the successful launch of Sputnik 1, triggering what science historians refer to as the 'space race.&rdquo; Changing times in the spy satellite business: Until recent decades, the National Reconnaissance Office wouldn't acknowledge even one satellite it had in space. Now, the intelligence agency is speaking publicly about launching dozens in the past year and a half, Defense One's Audrey Decker reports. 'From last June to December of this year, we'll have probably launched 100 satellites,&rdquo; Christopher Scolese, director of the NRO, said at an event Thursday in Washington. The agency's first batch of operational satellites in this constellation launched in May, and the agency has since launched two more batches, Decker writes. But officials haven't disclosed the number of satellites in those first launches or how many the constellation will have in total. 'What are they going to be doing? They are part of the proliferated architecture to go off it and get us reasonably high-resolution imagery of the Earth at a high rate of speed,&rdquo; Scolese said. Continue reading, here. New: Despite an abnormality during launch, ULA sent its heavy-lift rocket into space Friday, declaring the second certification flight 'successful&rdquo; even though some material broke off one of its solid rocket boosters. Footage of the flight illustrated the anomaly, which could have changed the trajectory of the vehicle. Company CEO Tory Bruno said they did have 'an observation on SRB number one&rdquo; and will look into the abnormality. Background: ULA's much-anticipated rocket flew for the first time in January, but had to complete a second certification flight before it can start flying missions for the Space Force. The company is on a tight timeline to get Vulcan certified because it has to launch two Space Force missions, USSF-106 and USSF-87, by the end of the year. The problem with the booster could complicate Pentagon certification, depending on the investigation. Official reax: 'We are already starting to review the performance data from this launch, and we look forward to Vulcan meeting the certification requirements for a range of National Security Space missions,&rdquo; Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, Space System Command's Program Executive Officer for Assured Access to Space, and Commander of Space Launch Delta 45, said in a statement.

Iranian missile attack, post-strike assessment. While Israeli troops continue attacking alleged militants in southern Lebanon, satellite imagery released Thursday seems to suggest a key Israeli air base was particularly bombarded with Iranian ballistic missiles during Tehran's multi-wave barrage at about 7 p.m. local time Tuesday. AP on Thursday published imagery taken by the commercial firm Planet Labs over Israel the day prior&mdash;roughly 24 hours after the Iranian attack. At least three military and intelligence bases appear to have been hit, according to a Washington Post analysis of satellite imagery published Friday. That includes the southern Nevatim air base; Tel Nof base, in central Israel; and Israel's Mossad spy agency headquarters, near Tel Aviv. Expert reax: 'Our first count is that 32 missiles struck Nevatim air base,&rdquo; which hosts Israeli F-35 jets, Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute for Strategic Studies wrote on social media Thursday, illustrating those 32 apparent strikes with yellow pins. 'This should be no surprise,&rdquo; he said, noting, 'there is plenty of video showing the missiles raining down on Nevatim.&rdquo; 'They landed multiple hits in the area of F-35 hangers, with one possible direct hit, but not a lot of damage,&rdquo; said researcher Decker Eveleth. Why the apparent success rate? Hard to know for sure, Lewis notes. But he suggests a few possibilities, including Iran using 'Better missiles (more Fattah-1s instead of Emad).&rdquo; He also points to certain apparently 'exaggerated expectations for [U.S.-made] SM-3 and [Israeli] Arrow-2/3&rdquo; interceptors. 'They're good, but c'mon,&rdquo; Lewis writes. 'I don't think we've seen the maximum scale of [Iranian] attack by any means,&rdquo; another expert, Malcolm Davis of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Reuters this week. That's partly due to Iran's maneuverable warheads, as Lewis explained in a bit more detail, here. Also visible in satellite imagery: Apparent Iranian launch points, including from a missile base south of Shiraz, as Decker and researcher Sam Lair pointed out with supporting imagery. Big picture consideration: After recent success against Hezbollah, Israel's military appears to be caught in a 'long game&rdquo; with no clear outcome, the New York Times reported Thursday from Jerusalem, citing the opinion of retired Israeli Brig. Gen. Assaf Orion, now with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. For example, with history as a guide, 'After Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982, it took [Israel] 18 years to withdraw forces from the Lebanese side of the border,&rdquo; Isabel Kershner of the Times writes. But considering the even longer history of internecine warfare around Palestine, it's anyone's guess how long the present conflict will endure. 'We are still in the middle of the movie,&rdquo; Orion said. More, here.

You can’t hide': Spy agency will have 100 new sats on orbit by y...	Until recent decades, the National Reconnaissance Office wouldn't acknowledge even one satellite it had in space. Now, the intelligence agency is speaking publicly about launching dozens in the past year and a half. 'From last June to December of this year, we'll have probably launched 100 satellites. So we are going from the demo phase to the operational phase, where we're really going to be able to start testing all of this stuff out in a more operational way,&rdquo; Christopher Scolese, director of the NRO, said today at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic & International Studies. At least some of those 100 belong to a new network of satellites that will collect information for the Pentagon and intelligence community. The agency's first batch of operational satellites in this constellation launched in May, and the agency has since launched two more batches. But officials haven't disclosed the number of satellites in those first launches or how many the constellation will have in total. The agency has launched demonstration satellites over the last few years 'to verify cost and performance,&rdquo; according to officials, but this year's satellites will start being used for real-time missions. 'What are they going to be doing? They are part of the proliferated architecture to go off it and get us reasonably high-resolution imagery of the Earth at a high rate of speed,&rdquo; Scolese said. [[Related Posts]] Growing this constellation of intel-gathering satellites will enable the United States to keep a persistent gaze on a given point on Earth, Scolese said. 'Now you can't hide because you're constantly being looked at.&rdquo; The agency will continue launching new satellites into various orbits for this architecture through 2028, and aims to eventually quadruple the number of satellites it has in orbit over the next decade. 'The NRO continues to build and fortify the largest government satellite constellation in history which has been enabled by a dynamic 18-month period, ending late this year, where 10+ missions will have launched and delivered more than 100 payloads on orbit. The purpose of this proliferated architecture is to increase revisit rates, enhance NRO's coverage, and capture and deliver&mdash;by orders of magnitude&mdash;more data to our users than ever before,&rdquo; an NRO spokesperson said in an email. But with the influx of satellites on orbit, and the heaps of data coming from those satellites, humans can't keep up, Scolese said, so the agency will need help from artificial intelligence to manage its satellite constellations better. 'Operating a proliferated architecture means that it's no longer possible to go off and for an individual sitting at a control center to say, I know what the satellite is doing. So we have to have the machines to go off and help us there. We need artificial intelligence, machine learning, [and] automated processes to help us do that,&rdquo; he said. Separate from NRO's planned network of satellites, the Space Development Agency has been building out its own proliferated constellation of satellites, called the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, or PWSA, which will start delivering operational capabilities for troops this year.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/you-cant-hide-spy-agency-will-have-100-new-sats-orbit-years-end/400047/	2024-10-03T14:00:05-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/03/GettyImages_2144495544/large.jpg
Senators want answers from DOD on quantum sensing efforts	Two U.S. senators are working across the aisle to get answers from the Pentagon about its efforts to advance quantum sensing&mdash;whose promises include jam-resistant position-navigation-timing systems&mdash;and whether the U.S. military can keep pace with China in the field. 'China is pursuing advances in quantum information science, some of which outstrip the efforts of the United States in scale and scope,&rdquo; Sens. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., write in an Oct. 3 letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, obtained exclusively by Defense One. 'To ensure that the United States maintains its technological advantage, DOD must have a strategic plan to integrate quantum sensing into our national security efforts.&rdquo; Hassan and Blackburn cite a September report from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, or ITIF, that finds 'China leads in quantum communications&hellip;and matches the United States in sensing, excelling in market-ready tech, while the United States dominates high-impact areas.&rdquo; This points to a big contrast in the way the two countries are pursuing quantum technology in general. The United States leads in quantum computing&mdash;but real-world quantum computing applications are years away, in part because of the challenge of building machines to handle large numbers of qubits&mdash;the basic unit of information in the field. For instance, IBM hopes to have three 100,000-qubit computers&mdash;capable of solving some of 'the world's most challenging problems&rdquo;&mdash;but not until 2033. But quantum communication and sensing is closer to real-world applications today. Instead of trying to get subatomic particles to work together to process information, quantum sensing involves the (relatively) simpler observation of them. Because all atoms behave the same way, and all have mass, they can, for instance, create precise measurement data for phenomena like acceleration, allowing for, say, a drone or an aircraft to understand where it is anywhere on earth without receiving a jammable or spoofable GPS signal. The Defense Department and the services have various investments in quantum sensing, including a $55 million effort to lay the groundwork for moving to quantum sensors. But as the ITIF report points out, China has a clear lead in quantum communication and there are some indications that it is leading in quantum sensing as well, due in part, to a focus on these more near-term applications over quantum computing hardware development. 'Overall, China's strategic focus on near-term quantum technologies enables it to lead in technologies that are closer to market readiness.&rdquo; it reads. In their letter, Hassan and Blackburn press Austin for more details about how the Pentagon is coordinating its efforts among various services and offices; how it is coordinating with other federal agencies, some of which are out-spending the Defense Department; and asks simply: does the Defense Department have a strategic plan for quantum science? 'To ensure that the United States maintains its technological advantage, DOD must have a strategic plan to integrate quantum sensing into our national security efforts,&rdquo; the letter reads. Among the questions: 'What emerging threats and areas of concern has DOD identified that quantum sensing may play a role in addressing? How has DOD already worked to use quantum sensing to address these threats?&rdquo; &rdquo;What is the current breakdown of quantum sensing efforts within DOD, including the offices responsible for managing and moving forward overall DOD quantum efforts?&rdquo; 'What does DOD need from Congress to support, sustain, and accelerate quantum sensing technology for national defense?&rdquo; The senators want the answers to the questions by November 15.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/senators-want-answers-dod-quantum-sensing-efforts/400036/	2024-10-03T11:31:18-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/03/Screenshot_2024_10_03_at_8.30.03AM-1/large.png
DOJ, Microsoft disrupt Russian hackers targeting civil society or...	Microsoft's digital crimes team and the Justice Department seized some 100 website domains belonging to a Russia-backed hacking gang that's built a reputation targeting civil society organizations around the world. A civil action unsealed Thursday afternoon authorized the tech giant's Digital Crimes Unit to take down some 66 websites belonging to the group, dubbed Star Blizzard. Another 41 websites used by the group were seized by the Justice Department, according to a statement issued by Microsoft. Star Blizzard &mdash; also known as Seaborgium and Callisto in the cybersecurity community &mdash; has been a thorn in the side of U.S. cyber officials and international intelligence partners for some time. The group, likely tied to Russia's Federal Security Service, has been launching cyberattacks against governmental orgs, NGOs, academia and other institutions since at least 2019, DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said last year. The group's hacking activities expanded in 2022, targeting U.S. Department of Energy facilities, CISA said at the time. Microsoft said 82 of its customers were targeted by the hackers since January of last year, at a rate of around one attack per week. 'This frequency underscores the group's diligence in identifying high-value targets, crafting personalized phishing emails, and developing the necessary infrastructure for credential theft,&rdquo; said Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel for the company's Digital Crimes Unit. 'Their victims, often unaware of the malicious intent, unknowingly engage with these messages leading to the compromise of their credentials.&rdquo; Star Blizzard has been deemed a top antagonist for phishing cyberattacks that target victims through email communications containing links that can siphon sensitive data or load malware onto targets' devices. Specializing in email credential theft, the collective has aimed to exploit NGOs and think tanks supporting government employees, as well as military and intelligence officials, Masada said. Phishing schemes have been particularly harder to identify because generative artificial intelligence tools have allowed attackers to craft more realistic-sounding scam messages in languages not native to their upbringing, researchers say. CISA has previously released guidance for civil society groups, focusing on activists, journalists, human rights workers and others affiliated with organizations that may face cyberthreats.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/doj-microsoft-disrupt-russian-hackers-targeting-civil-society-orgs/400046/	2024-10-03T09:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/03/100224MicrosoftNG/large.jpg
The D Brief: Russia hacks Taiwan; Diego Garcia shocker; ‘Sunken n...	New: Russian hackers have turned their sights on Taiwan, Dmitri Alperovitch noted Thursday on social media. Targets include Taiwanese companies and government agencies. Why now? Possibly because just last month, Taiwan's new president said that if Chinese Communist Party leaders' dream of annexing Taiwan is (as they allege) about restoring territorial borders from a bygone era, then China should take back land ceded to Russia back in the 19th century 'in the Treaty of Aigun during the Qing Dynasty.&rdquo; 'This clearly shows that the intention to invade Taiwan is not about territorial concerns,&rdquo; Taipei's President Lai Ching-te said. Rhetoric alert: Chinese leader Xi Jinping echoed the arguments of one of the deadliest dictators in history on Monday when he asserted at a state banquet in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, 'Taiwan is China's sacred territory. Blood is thicker than water, and people on both sides of the strait are connected by blood,&rdquo; according to CNN, citing state-run Xinhua news. Former U.S. Navy submariner Tom Shugart pointed out the chilling similarities with Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, who wrote in Mein Kampf that the reunification of Germany and Austria 'is a life task to be carried out by all means! German-Austria must be restored to the great German Motherland&hellip; People of the same blood should be in the same REICH.&rdquo; Coverage continues below the fold&hellip; Welcome to this Thursday edition of The D Brief, brought to you by Ben Watson with Bradley Peniston.

On this day in 2015, the crew of a U.S. Air Force AC-130U gunship failed to consult their no-strike list for Kunduz, Afghanistan, and spent 30 minutes attacking a hospital operated by Doctors Without Borders. The early morning attack killed 42 people, including three doctors as well as others who were shot by U.S. gunners as they tried to flee the burning building. Officials later blamed a special operations commander on the ground, the gunship's aircrew, commanders at Bagram airbase, and a poorly-rigged antenna for contributing to the tragedy. Sixteen American troops were disciplined afterward, though none faced criminal charges. Leading U.S. security analyst: 'China Is Ready for War,&rdquo; Seth Jones of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies argued this week in Foreign Affairs. However, he explained, thanks to America's 'crumbling&rdquo; defense industrial base, the U.S. appears to be nowhere nearly as prepared for a conflict with China. The gist: 'Despite the country's current economic challenges, its defense spending is soaring and its defense industry is on a wartime footing,&rdquo; Jones writes. 'China has already caught up to the United States in its ability to produce weapons at mass and scale,&rdquo; and it has 'become the world's largest shipbuilder by far, with a capacity roughly 230 times as large as that of the United States.&rdquo; A few areas the U.S. should improve upon in the months ahead, according to Jones: Its 'anachronistic contracting and acquisitions system that is much better suited for the leisurely pace of peacetime than for the urgency of wartime&rdquo;; U.S.-based production of certain 'solid rocket motors, processor assemblies, castings, forgings, ball bearings, microelectronics, and seekers for munitions&rdquo;; It will also need to shore up its 'advanced battery supply chain,&rdquo; since so many of the components are dominated by China; And U.S. shipyards need to somehow increase their supply of 'engineers, electricians, pipefitters, shipfitters, and metalworkers.&rdquo; Related analysis: 'What reports got wrong about China's &lsquo;sunken nuclear submarine,'&rdquo; via J. Michael Dahm of Blue Path Labs with Peter W. Singer, writing Wednesday in Defense One. For one thing, there's little actual evidence that the sub was nuclear. For another, the discussion of the sub in Chinese-language sources reveals interesting things about the state of the Chinese naval industrial base. Read on, here.

'In looking at the history of US shipbuilding, two major trends stand out,' he writes. 'The first is the high cost of inputs, particularly labor and steel.' But the other factor is cultural, he argues. While some nations have been driven to build ships for trade or survival, the United States 'never appears to have been strongly motivated to make its shipbuilding industry an international success. Historically it has been isolationist, trading much more with itself than it has with other countries.&rdquo; Read the rest, here. From the region: The Brits just announced a major change in how it manages a quietly-influential territorial relic from the colonial era. In a joint statement with Mauritius on Thursday, the two nations announced the Chagos Archipelago is Mauritius's sovereign territory. This includes the strategic Diego Garcia island, which the U.S. military has used to carry out its post-9/11 global war on terrorism. However, 'both our countries are committed to the need, and will agree in the treaty, to ensure the long-term, secure and effective operation of the existing base on Diego Garcia which plays a vital role in regional and global security,&rdquo; 10 Downing Street said Thursday. Fine print: 'For an initial period of 99 years, the United Kingdom will be authorised to exercise with respect to Diego Garcia the sovereign rights and authorities of Mauritius required to ensure the continued operation of the base well into the next century,&rdquo; the joint statement reads. The legal struggles of locals on Diego Garcia were thoroughly documented in a recent book from international law specialist ​​Philippe Joseph Sands entitled, 'The Last Colony: A Tale of Exile, Justice, and Courage.&rdquo; The Brits forcibly removed some 2,000 people from the island in 1973, diverting them to Mauritius and the Seychelles. Sands' account of that history is short but packed with emotion as he retraced just some of the lives disrupted by the Brits' determination to stay on Diego Garcia against the will of the UN General Assembly. 'The [new] treaty will address wrongs of the past and demonstrate the commitment of both parties to support the welfare of Chagossians,&rdquo; the joint statement reads. What's more, 'Mauritius will now be free to implement a programme of resettlement on the islands of the Chagos Archipelago, other than Diego Garcia, and the UK will capitalise a new trust fund, as well as separately provide other support, for the benefit of Chagossians.&rdquo; New small cruise missile slated for SOCOM gunship test. Leidos tells Defense One's Patrick Tucker that its Black Arrow, a relatively small cruise missile with a designed range of about 400 miles, passed preliminary tests that set it up for an actual test launch out the back of a U.S. Special Forces Command AC-140J gunship sometime this fall. Leidos, which is arguably better known for its weapons components than full-up rounds, exemplifies how digital engineering techniques are enabling the entry of new competitors in the missile market, and even the creation of new product categories.

Lastly today: The CIA is looking for informants from Iran, China and North Korea. The agency posted instructions Wednesday 'on how to securely contact us&rdquo; after it claimed unspecified success with the same approach targeting Russian speakers, Olivia Gazis of CBS News reported. 'We want to make sure individuals in other authoritarian regimes know that we're open for business,&rdquo; an agency spokesman said. According to NBC news, potential informants are advised 'not to use their home or work computer; employ only up-to-date web browsers; use the browser's private browser mode; delete computer searches and browser histories by following the CIA's instructions; use the Tor network or a trusted VPN service not headquartered in Russia, Iran or China or other country hostile to the U.S.; and use a &lsquo;kill switch' feature on the VPN service&rdquo; in case the VPN connection is lost.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-03-2024/400025/	2024-10-03T08:25:53-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/03/DB_lander/large.png
New small cruise missile slated for SOCOM gunship test	An upcoming test-firing of a small cruise missile is a step toward filling a rising need for U.S. special operators&mdash;and perhaps allies around the globe. Sometime this fall, Leidos aims to launch its under-development Black Arrow missile from an AC-130J furnished by U.S. Special Operations Command, building on hitherto unrevealed captive-carry and safe-separation tests conducted last December, according to a company statement. The effort by Leidos, better known for its weapons components than entire missiles, shows how digital technologies and open, modular design are enabling new entrants to the missile market and clearing a path toward cheaper, easier-to-built weapons. The Black Arrow is designed to answer SOCOM's 2021 call for a small air-to-ground cruise missile that can fly about 400 nautical miles and hit targets even when GPS is down. SOCOM said it needed such a missile because more advanced air defense systems were putting U.S. forces at greater risk in more places. The same can be said of many partner militaries, such as Ukraine. In August, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov invited inventors and companies to help the country develop new missiles. 'What are the next challenges where we need your help?&rdquo; Fedorov said at the GLOBSEC forum in Prague. 'How to invent effective laser guidance, how to develop AI for swarms of drones, how to produce Ukrainian HIMARS, how to develop cheap Ukrainian missiles to shoot down Shaheds?' But creating cruise missiles has generally required more money and time than outfits like SOCOM or Ukraine have to spend. SOCOM hired Leidos through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, that allowed the development process to move unusually quickly, a Leidos official told Defense One. The company spent more of its own money than usual on research and development, while the command furnished a test aircraft, range, and other resources. Leidos trimmed its own costs by using digital engineering techniques such as high-data modeling and digital twinning. 'We're circumventing the normal development time that can take a decade or more by accomplishing a lot of the work under the CRADA, and a key element of that is our reliance and confidence that we have on the digital models,&rdquo; the Leidos official said. 'We use [advanced digital modeling] in our hardware loop facility so that we can run literally hundreds of thousands and millions of trajectories and scenarios to make sure that not only do we fly well at the heart of the envelope that we understand, we've evaluated the corners of the fight envelope as well.&rdquo; But Leidos is not the only new entrant in the small-missile market. In September, Anduril announced its own family of small cruise missiles. And Y Combinator, the startup accelerator known for boosting small digital companies at their earliest stages, announced in August that they were backing Ares, their first cruise missile company. Leidos says they did extra work to ensure that their missile actually functions with the aircraft that the military wants to use. That digital modeling was key not just to designing the missile but also making sure that it could integrate with the NSWC Battle Management System and the AC-130. That's why the captive-carry and safe-separation tests were so important. With that done, they hope to move forward much more quickly with flight tests than is the norm for cruise missiles. 'And now, when we go in the fall, instead of an incremental buildup and test, we will move directly to a control-guided flight test relying on the fidelity and confidence that we have in the digital model,&rdquo; the official said. Digital modeling also makes it easier to modify the missile for more platforms, the official said. For example, a 400-mile cruise missile would give the slow, vulnerable MQ-9 drone more relevance in a high-end fight. 'It's 80 inches long, nine inches in diameter. So you could carry eight of these on an MQ-9, for instance. So now you start thinking about these MQ-9s that are vulnerable to enemy air defenses,&rdquo; said the official. 'It's sort of like a loaf of bread. It has various subsections that&hellip;we could lengthen the missile. We could shorten it. We could put a different front in it, on it. We could alter the body length.&rdquo; That could be a big huge advantage for militaries like Ukraine or other partners that are struggling to obtain and operate advanced fighter jets like F-16s but might be able to get other aircraft. 'You could put this on a C-138 that the Philippines have, all the hundreds of C-130s that our allied partners have, or other transport aircraft like the C-27. So the idea is simple, rapid integration.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/new-small-cruise-missile-slated-socom-gunship-test/400021/	2024-10-03T03:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/02/Screenshot_2024_10_02_at_11.20.27PM/large.png
Air Force taps Leidos to lead digital infrastructure for connect-...	The Air Force picked longtime defense IT contractor Leidos to develop and manage the guts of the service's next-gen command, control, and communications network Defense One has learned. The $303 million contract covers 'planning, analysis, and operations&rdquo; for the digital infrastructure network of the Air Force's Advanced Battle Management System&mdash;a key component of the service's contribution to the Pentagon's connect-everything effort, called Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2. The Air Force also recently announced plans to bring more industry partners in to ABMS experiments. The Air Force's program executive office for command, control, communications and battle management runs point on ABMS and has been expanding its use of cloud-based command and control tools as part of its overall digital infrastructure plans for operators to improve battlefield communication. But the contract, which runs for three years with an option for two more, puts Leidos as the lead for stitching technologies together for ABMS' Digital Infrastructure Network. Defense One spoke with Chad Haferbier, who leads Leidos' multi-domain solutions division, to understand more about this largely classified initiative. He said the first order of business is sitting down with Air Force leadership to understand 'what they want to field, and how we can help them do that, and how we want to organize,&rdquo; then hiring more people to work on the solutions. What's the significance of this contract for the Air Force's Battle Network, the service's contribution to JADC2, and ABMS effort, which falls under that? The digital infrastructure is the backbone for the modernization aspects of battle management command and control. How do you start to connect things and share data and process that data? How do you build a network and manage that network and keep that operational and secure [while moving] data from tactical edge to operational, strategic decision makers? And if they're fielding elements of that network, we're going to be their partners to support them to make that vision a reality. What does that look like? This element is more focused on the infrastructure than it would be on the applications. [That means] supporting the Department of the Air Force in terms of where do we need to put this infrastructure to start to expose and share this data and keep it secure? And then move it to those, whether it be a tactical node or operational node or a tech or a strategic code&mdash;and that's all, speculation, I would say&mdash;and move that data to inform decision makers&hellip; in order to make those decisions in a timely manner. The DAF is really set out&mdash;and I'm super proud of that team, because they have actually turned all of these ideas and lightning bolts on PowerPoint charts into programs of record. And they've secured a budget from the Congress to go make investments to realize that connected-network vision. And the digital infrastructure is just a fundamental core element of that. How does this fold into the other work Leidos is doing in the JADC2 space, for the Air Force or elsewhere across the DOD? We're also making [independent research and development, or] IRAD investments in command and control applications, AI/[machine learning]-informed code generation. How do we start to bring in other domains in a meaningful way, and filter that data for the decision maker for what they need&hellip;so that we can be a preferred partner higher on the stack&hellip;as we start to bring all this data together. Have you been able to successfully do anything like this on the scale already? Even if it's in a lab where you're gathering a bunch of information from disparate locations. Proof points on our ability to be the integrator from the digital infrastructure side: The DISA contracts that we have and the Navy contracts. There are examples where we're showing our ability to make sense of all that data. A program that is also part of my team in [the Air Force's Command and Control Incident Management Emergency Response Application, or] C2IMERA would be an example where we are collecting data from multiple sources to help assist base management in a crisis scenario. [During the] withdrawal from Afghanistan, C2IMERA was used pretty heavily to assist in those decision makers' ability to take all that data and make good decisions with the information. Let's say all of this goes well with the Air Force. This is a limited contract. How are you thinking about integrating and feeding into the bigger beast of combined joint all-domain command and control across the entire joint force? Because we're fully dedicated corporately to open architecture, not proprietary frameworks. What you've seen in the past are proprietary boundaries between systems, and so to have an integrator that is fully willing to tie their business strategy to being a trusted partner and deliver that open architecture and backwards compatibility. To me, that's why Leidos is a great selection to help with that. Even if there's open architecture, there can still be policy challenges when trying to link technologies. The recent news that [Maj. Gen.] Cropsey has become the executive agent for the Joint Fires Network in INDOPACOM is a great example of how a single acquisition entity can start to stitch together the services from a single service. You're always going to have to have an acquisition office to manage the procurement and the development with industry partners to realize the capability. And given the steps the Air Force has taken, the confidence that the DOD has now shown to them to give them the [Joint Fires Network] responsibility, I think that's huge in terms of progress towards a joint realization of that connectedness. Anything else? There are ongoing acquisition solicitations for mission partner environment networks that we are very interested in performing. [Such as] how do you use a software solution for [identity, credentialing, and access management, or] ICAM to adjudicate between NATO partners, what data they can see? Because right now, in the NATO environment, everyone has point-to-point networks, and so it's very manually intensive on how you share data. I believe the vision is to, how do you collapse that into a single network and then provide the security through software to rapidly enable allies and partners to to have access to the data that they can. We're investing in [independent research and development] to turn that data into information. We're also very interested in helping close the gap between the [intelligence community] and the DOD to expedite those data movements, and those information movements and decision abilities.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/air-force-taps-leidos-lead-digital-infrastructure-connect-everything-effort/400020/	2024-10-02T17:02:01-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/02/GettyImages_1661051950/large.jpg
Can ULA clear the final hurdle on Vulcan?	Despite delays, United Launch Alliance says its Vulcan heavy-lift rocket will still fly two missions for the Space Force before the end of the year&mdash;if the rocket's second flight goes smoothly. Vulcan had its maiden flight in January, years behind schedule. But ULA has to complete a second certification flight&mdash;scheduled to take off from Cape Canaveral this Friday&mdash;before the rocket can start flying operational missions for the Pentagon. So far, the second flight is on track to be 'another perfect launch like Cert-1,&rdquo; ULA CEO Tory Bruno told reporters Wednesday ahead of the launch. Bruno said he's confident that Vulcan will be certified in time to launch two Space Force missions, USSF-106 and USSF-87, by the end of the year&mdash;but that's a tight timeline considering that nine months passed between the first and second certification flights. Bruno didn't provide details on the service's certification timeline, but said 'as long as it's a very clean mission, it's a short number of weeks to get it all done.&rdquo; Pentagon officials have previously expressed concern over ULA's ability to ramp up its launch cadence essentially tenfold in the coming years. The company launched three rockets in 2023, but is slated to launch 25 national-security missions by the end of 2027. [[Related Posts]] In June, ULA co-owners Lockheed and Boeing formed an independent review team to keep Vulcan on track. Bruno said the team came up with 'great suggestions&rdquo; and tools for ULA to improve its production planning and management. 'I guess I'll say that everything that they brought to me as recommendations, I thought were great ideas, and I plan to do them,&rdquo; he said. ULA officials once hoped Vulcan would fly for the second time in April. But delays with the intended payload&mdash;Sierra Space's Dream Chaser space plane&mdash;pushed that timeline back. And since the Sierra payload still isn't ready, ULA will launch a dummy payload, plus some 'experiments and demonstrations,&rdquo; on the second certification flight, according to company officials. Since there isn't a customer for this second flight, ULA will eat the entire cost of the launch, which is in the 'high tens of millions of dollars,&rdquo; Bruno said. He admitted it won't be easy to get to 20 launches next year (split roughly half-and-half between the Vulcan and Atlas rockets), but said, 'I know how to do that, it needs to be done, and I'm not daunted at all.&rdquo; Vulcan is the centerpiece of ULA's plan to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX, which upended the space launch market ULA had dominated for years. SpaceX is also developing its own heavy-lift rocket, Starship. ULA made a huge bet on Vulcan, expecting Pentagon and commercial contracts for years to come, and has invested '$5 to $7 billion&rdquo; on the rocket itself, as well as more than a billion on infrastructure, to support bigger factories, more tooling, and more capacity throughout the supply chain, Bruno said. ULA, SpaceX, and Blue Origin are competing for a slew of launches under the Space Force's new satellite launch competition, called National Security Space Launch Phase 3. The companies will vie for $5.6 billion worth of contracts over the next five years.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/can-ula-clear-final-hurdle-vulcan/400019/	2024-10-02T16:46:20-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/02/GettyImages_1908310728/large.jpg
The US military must prepare for a second Trump presidency	Nobody's talking about how the rapidly approaching presidential election might affect the state of civil-military relations in this country. But we should be. The military in particular should be hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. The election promises two possible outcomes, each with serious implications for the military, its relationship with the next commander-in-chief, and society as a whole: Either we will elect a commander-in-chief in the traditional mold&mdash;one who unselfishly respects norms and limits, seeks to preserve and protect the Constitution and the institutions of democracy, and exerts responsible civilian control over a professional military dedicated to serving the nation. Or we will usher back into office a commander-in-chief who regularly denigrates those in uniform, seeks to undermine and circumvent the Constitution and the institutions of democracy, and selfishly uses the military for personal and political gain rather than to serve the public or national interest. The former electoral outcome promises to ensure the sustainment of a more-or-less stable equilibrium in civil-military relations in which all parties involved, notwithstanding any differences they might have, honor their constitutional obligations and respect behavioral, political, and ideological boundaries for the greater good. The latter electoral outcome, by contrast, will ensure that self-absorption, self-indulgence, and self-aggrandizement on the part of the commander-in-chief are permanently arrayed against the self-sacrifice, self-discipline, and self-respect of the military, thereby producing a perpetual state of ethical tension and upheaval for those in uniform. Civil-military relations are grounded in a tacit but binding social contract of mutual rights, obligations, and expectations among the parties to the relationship. Perhaps the defining precept of sound civil-military relations is civilian control of the military, the understandable recognition that a profession that considers itself the Profession of Arms&mdash;whose distinguishing area of expertise is the management of violence&mdash;must be directed and overseen by duly elected and appointed civilian officials answerable to the people if it is to have legitimacy. All civilian officials and military officers have sworn an oath to unreservedly support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. For those in uniform, that oath is further underlain by their original enlistment oath, which swears them to obey the lawful orders&mdash;not ethical, prudent, or competent, but lawful&mdash;of those appointed over them. The paramount motive force behind these oaths is respect for and adherence to the rule of law. Ironically, civilian control is neither defined nor even mentioned specifically in the Constitution. References to its purported Constitutional roots derive solely from the designation of the President as commander-in-chief in Article II, and, by implication, from the several enumerated military-related powers assigned to Congress in Article I. Civilian control, properly exercised for reasons of state rather than for personal gain, owes its democratic character in large part to two defining principles of the military ethos: obedience to properly constituted authority and political neutrality. A power-hungry, power-driven commander-in-chief, motivated solely by self-interest at the expense of all else, would unreservedly exploit these deeply ingrained military imperatives to his own advantage, thereby reinforcing the steady accretion of power that has otherwise increasingly muscularized the presidency over time. Historian Arthur Schlesinger first awakened us to the imperial nature of the presidency. Others since have embraced the all-encompassing power they believe inheres in the so-called unitary executive. It is more truth than truism that absolute power is likely to produce absolute corruption, and the concentration of power in any person or office is feedstock for tyranny. A thus-empowered commander-in-chief wouldn't hesitate to employ any instrumentality, legal or illegal, ethical or unethical, that best serves his personal interests while disguised as serving the national interest. And he almost assuredly would claim personal ownership of a supplicant military to do his bidding. Until recently, the quintessential vehicle for doing this was the Insurrection Act, which, because it doesn't define what constitutes insurrection and doesn't subject the president to checks by Congress, leaves him free to take unfettered action against political opponents easily labeled clear and present dangers and enemies of the state. Such individuals and groups are obvious targets for a military steeped in dutiful obedience to lawful orders and possessed of a penchant for defending the nation against internal and external threats. The recent Supreme Court decision granting the president immunity from criminal acts in the conduct of official duties takes such presidential license to a whole new level. Since it's almost impossible to conceive of any presidential use of the military as unofficial or private business, the military is left to ask itself whether the unquestioning obedience, compliance, and silence it has tacitly agreed to provide should continue to be unconditional, or whether such limitations and inhibitions should be conditioned on the public and private actions of the commander-in-chief. All of this is to suggest that, depending on the results of the upcoming election, the military should be prepared to 'lawyer up&rdquo; in defense of its honor, integrity, and rights; to concern itself not merely with the legality, but also with the ethicality of the direction it receives; to scrutinize the motive and intent behind all such direction; and to fundamentally rethink its past orientation toward dissent and disobedience. Only by doing so, can the military expect to maintain its dignity and self-respect as an institution, while also preserving the binding social contract of civil-military relations. Gregory D. Foster is a professor at the National Defense University, where he previously has served as J. Carlton Ward Distinguished Professor and Director of Research and as George C. Marshall Professor.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/10/us-military-must-prepare-second-trump-presidency/400006/	2024-10-02T12:23:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/02/Republican_president_2500/large.jpg
What reports got wrong about China’s ‘sunken nuclear submarine’	The purported sinking of a Chinese nuclear submarine at a Wuhan shipyard pier is the latest example of Western reporting on military developments in China that overlooks important details and context, or even takes the wrong lessons from the fragments of stories they tell. The incident, which took place in June, drew some mention the following month on social media and even in the defense press, but it went viral after a Sept. 26 report in the Wall Street Journal touched off coverage from Fox News to CBS. What apparently lit up the U.S. media landscape were the assertions, attributed to unnamed U.S. defense officials, that the submarine was nuclear-powered. Many of the subsequent reports suggested that the incident revealed safety concerns about a new class of PLA Navy nuclear submarine and a serious setback for China's military modernization. These are mischaracterizations. Moreover, the reporting actually buried the lead. The shipyard accident tells us very little about the future of PLA naval modernization, but the submarine itself does. The afflicted boat was said to be a 'Type 041 Zhou-class submarine&rdquo; powered by a nuclear reactor. But tracing that claim to its origins reveals the importance of context and of using varied sources. The designation seems to have first publicly appeared in Chinese media sources in late 2023, which identified the 'Type 041&rdquo; as an improved variant of the Type 039C Yuan-class submarine. Two of the submarines were said to be in production at the Wuhan shipyard with advanced air-independent propulsion engines, not nuclear reactors. In spring 2024, rumors began to emerge on the Chinese internet that China was developing a nuclear reactor for a 4,000-ton submarine the size of the Type 039/041. Most of the world's nuclear-powered submarines are significantly larger. The rumors took off when Du Wenlong, a PLA senior colonel-turned-state-television commentator, appeared to drop veiled hints. 'Some people say that China is making a &lsquo;Type 041' small nuclear submarine,&rdquo; Du wrote, going on to argue that the PLA should indeed invest in such technology. Rumors continued to percolate over the summer, even as some Chinese military forums pointed out that China's only known nuclear-capable shipyard is in Huludao, on the northern Bohai Gulf, and that there were no indications that the Wuhan shipyard had received certifications to produce nuclear submarines. While it is possible that the Wuhan shipyard built this 'Type 041&rdquo; submarine only to have its nuclear power plant or fuel installed elsewhere, reactors and fuel rods are not something one just drops into a pressure hull. Installing a nuclear reactor post-assembly would be inefficient and unlikely. Moreover, China's limited experience in building nuclear submarines suggests that it would more likely evolve its designs from conventional to nuclear rather than launch a revolutionary, keel-up nuclear design in Wuhan. Further context comes from a PLA officer who had recently written that China's navy will focus on building more nuclear-powered submarines. The expansion of the Huludao nuclear shipyard over the past several years supports that claim. However, given its relative dearth of nuclear submarine design experience and engineering talent, it would be difficult for China to increase nuclear-submarine production at two shipyards simultaneously. The point is that a preponderance of public sourcing indicates there is far more uncertainty about the ship itself than the headlines would have it. Indeed, there is nothing in the available reporting that indicates an actual nuclear incident. The satellite photos showed four crane barges that may have been deployed to raise a sunken object, but no nuclear-response efforts were detected. This was not Chernobyl. What was missed Even worse, the media reports focusing on the potential nuclear nature of the shipyard accident missed what this submarine actually does tell us about PLA naval modernization. Today's Chinese subs lack a vertical launch system, or VLS, limiting their ability to carry and quickly fire land-attack and anti-ship missiles. The ill-fated submarine, by contrast, had an extended hull with a section that appears to contain a VLS. Chinese language sources indicate it would accommodate long-range YJ-18 anti-ship missiles or CJ-10 land-attack missiles. Nuclear-powered or not, the prospect of numerous, difficult-to-locate submarines that can deliver a vastly larger salvo of weapons against ships or air bases would boost Chinese capability and complicate allied defense plans. This story highlights the risk of both dropping into a topic and relying too much on unnamed U.S. military officials, who bring biases along with perspectives and information. In this case, the source appears to have been happy to highlight a Chinese submarine accident and what the incident may say about PLA capability. Yet U.S. defense officials&mdash;and the subsequent media reports&mdash;have said relatively little about the PLA's announcement that it successfully test-launched an ICBM deep into the Pacific Ocean, the very same week of the reporting about this shipyard incident that happened months ago. This story also underlines a larger problem in Western media reporting on China's military in recent years: too often, it swings between two extremes that portray the PLA as either comically inept or ten feet tall. The ICBM test reminds us of a similar media frenzy sparked by a dubious claim earlier this year. In January, Western media aired claims by unnamed U.S. officials that corrupt PLA officers had filled their missiles with water. The reporting seemed to be unaware that the Chinese term 灌水 (gu&agrave;nshuǐ), which does mean 'to pour water into&rdquo; but also references unscrupulous butchers adding water to meat to increase its weight and price, used metaphorically to refer to corruption. Yes, the PLA Rocket Force has experienced a crisis of corruption. No, they do not fill their missiles with water to cover up that corruption. Media coverage of nuclear issues in particular often suffers from mischaracterization and hyperbole. In July, the North American Aerospace Defense Command issued a statement about a flight of Russian Tu-95s and PLA H-6 bombers near Alaska; they were not, NORAD took pains to point out, seen as a threat. Several media reports, however, heralded Chinese 'nuclear-capable bombers&rdquo; patrolling near the United States. A quick reference check of the H-6 tail numbers clearly visible in the NORAD photos indicates these were H-6K variants, part of the PLA's Eastern Theater Command 10th Air Division, 28th Air Regiment. These aircraft were not the PLA's nuclear-capable H-6Ns. Again, yes, China has nuclear-capable bombers and is building up that capability; no, they did not fly into a U.S. air defense identification zone. The issues in U.S.-China security are of growing domestic interest and political importance, especially during an election season. As such, it is ever more vital that mass media reporting on PLA capabilities avoids the temptation to hunt for 'clicks&rdquo; and 'eyeballs&rdquo; and instead seeks out the details and context necessary to fully understand the implications of China's military modernization.

The D Brief: Iran’s missile attack on Israel; Russia seizes town;...	Shortly after U.S. officials predicted it publicly, Iran launched more than 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday, with dozens flying over Jerusalem's Old City, a holy site for Muslims, Christians, and Jewish people around the world. Targets appear to have included Israel's Nevatim airbase (which was also attacked in April); the Tel Nof airbase; and possibly the Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv, as well as locations around Tel Aviv, Matt Savill of the Royal United Services Institute said. A 38-year-old man from Gaza hit by debris was the only death from Iran's attack. Why it happened: An Israeli airstrike Friday killed Iran-backed terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah along with a top Iranian paramilitary commander (Abbas Nilforoushan) while meeting at an underground facility in southern Beirut. Iranian generals felt some kind of missile attack was necessary in order to save face and appear strong to the world, three Iranian officials told the New York Times. Israel's Arrow and David's Sling air defense systems played the largest role intercepting Tuesday's barrage. Raytheon and Israeli defense firm Rafael teamed up for David's Arrow; Boeing and Israel Aerospace Industries joined forces to develop the Arrow. 'Both systems along with the Iron Dome were utilized during Iran's attack on Israel last April when 99% of the more than 300 drones, ballistic and cruise missiles launched by Iran were intercepted,&rdquo; Luis Martinez of ABC News reports. Also pitching in: Two U.S. Navy destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea launched nearly a dozen interceptors at Iranian missiles headed toward Israel, Pentagon spokesman Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters Tuesday. Those destroyers were the USS Bulkeley and the USS Cole. FWIW: 'The IDF and the U.S. Armed Forces cooperated together in defense several days before, during, and after the Iranian attack,&rdquo; the Israeli military said Wednesday morning, specifically noting Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi's conversations with U.S. Central Command's Michael Erik Kurilla. SecDef: 'I am deeply proud of the skill and the bravery of the U.S. troops who helped to save lives today from Iran's assault and who continue to support Israel's defense and to prevent a widening conflict or escalation,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Tuesday evening. 'Our forces remain postured to protect U.S. troops and partners in the Middle East, and the Department maintains significant capability to defend our people, provide further support for Israel's self-defense, and deter further escalation,&rdquo; Austin added. Israeli reax: 'Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it,&rdquo; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video posted to social media. Next steps: 'Israel will need to continue launching airstrikes further north if it wants to reduce further Hizballah's longer-range precision missile stockpile, or strike new leadership targets,&rdquo; RUSI's Savill says. 'The tempo of operations has already dropped off significantly from the first 48 hours of the Lebanon operation,&rdquo; Savill noted, 'but if it decides to launch a major strike against Iran in the near future, it might reprioritise aircraft away from Lebanon temporarily.&rdquo; Developing: Israeli ground troops are skirmishing with Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon, including around the border town of Maroun el-Ras, Reuters reports from Beirut. The fighting has already claimed the life of at least one Israeli team commander and seven others, the IDF announced Wednesday. Israeli jets have also renewed airstrikes against suspected targets inside Beirut. What might lie ahead: Here's a map of Lebanese towns Israel is targeting and has asked residents there to leave, via the New York Times graphics team. Bigger picture consideration: 'Nearly 1,900 people have been killed and more than 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, with most of the deaths occurring in the past two weeks,&rdquo; Reuters reports, citing Lebanese government statistics. In addition, 'More than a million people have been forced to flee their homes,&rdquo; the wire service adds. For the latest, the BBC has a robust live blog you can review here.

After more than two years of attacks, Russian invasion forces have seized the small Ukrainian city of Vuhledar, a coal-mining town of about 10,000 people (before the war) along Ukraine's eastern front, the Institute for the Study of War reported Tuesday. Capturing the city could make it easier for Russia to advance on other two nearby cities occupying higher ground, Chasiv Yar and Toretsk, the Wall Street Journal reports. 'Over the past few days Ukrainian soldiers had to find their own way out of Vuhledar by foot as it was impossible to evacuate them otherwise,&rdquo; one soldier told the BBC. 'Many were wounded and killed by Russian drones and artillery as they tried to leave, another soldier, Roman, says. Many more are still missing.&rdquo; Meanwhile in Kyiv, nearly 300 companies from over 30 countries sent reps to the Ukrainian capital for the second International Defense Industries Forum, which President Volodymir Zelenskyy is hoping can boost Ukraine's domestic defense production. 'We need foreign expertise, access to supply chains, and technology to continue this growth,&rdquo; he said on social media Wednesday. In attendance: Reps from BAE Systems, KNDS, MBDA, D&M Holding Company, Amentum Services, Inc., AeroVironment, Inc., Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace, Romarm, CZ Colt Group, Quantum Systems, Hellenic Defence Systems, and the DI Danish Defence & Security Industries Association, according to Zelenskyy's office. In the first half of 2024, 'Ukraine produced 25 times more artillery and mortar ammunition than in the entire year of 2022,&rdquo; Zelenskyy told the audience gathered in Kyiv Tuesday. 'We are producing artillery, our &lsquo;Bohdana' howitzers, at a rate of 15 units monthly, and sometimes as many as 20,&rdquo; he continued. And 'The total number of drones we are now capable of producing annually in Ukraine is 4 million,&rdquo; he said. 'While years ago, the Ukrainian defense industry unfortunately looked helpless, today it is an industry that is on its way to leadership, at least in Europe,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said. 'There is no state sovereignty without the ability to defend oneself&hellip;we are grateful for everything we can do together today and in the future,&rdquo; he told his audience.

U.S. lawmakers: 'The rioters were inside the halls of Congress because the head of the executive branch of our government, the then-President of the United States, told them to attack,&rdquo; the House committee that investigated the attack wrote in the foreword to its final 2022 report. Vance at the debate: 'Remember, he said that on January 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully,&rdquo; he said, omitting Trump's exhortation to 'fight like hell' to stop the certification of the 2020 election results, his repeated false claims of election fraud, and his efforts to stoke the ire of his supporters at a rally that morning. Vance also omitted mention of Trump's refusal to send in the National Guard as hundreds of rioters overwhelmed police and violently forced their way into the Capitol with the aim of stopping the transfer of power.
