Can Syria's triumphant rebel coalition unite the country?	The brutal 54-year reign of the Assad family in Syria looks to be over. In a matter of days, opposition forces took the major city of Aleppo before advancing southward into other government-controlled areas of Hama, Homs and finally, on Dec 7, 2024, the capital, Damascus. The offensive was all the more astonishing given that the 13-year civil war had largely been in a stalemate since a 2020 ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey. Reports suggest President Bashar al-Assad has resigned and left the country. But what has he left behind and what happens next? As an expert on Middle East security, I believe the opposition forces' ability to maintain unity will be critical in the transition to a post-Assad Syria. Since the civil war started in 2011, the many opposition factions in Syria have been fractured by ideological differences and the interests of external backers&mdash;and that remains true despite their current victory. Meanwhile, the rapid change of fortunes in Syria's civil war poses serious questions for those countries that have backed one side or the other in the conflict. For Iran and Russia, the fall of their ally Assad will damage regional aspirations. For the backers of elements of the opposition&mdash;notably Turkey but also the United States, both of which maintain a military presence in Syria&mdash;there will be challenges, too. Fears of a &lsquo;catastrophic success' Iran, the U.S., Russia, and Turkey have been crucial players throughout Syria's civil war. The recent opposition offensive came as Assad's three key allies&mdash;Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah&mdash;were stretched thin. Russia's focus on Ukraine and Iran's setbacks from Israeli strikes have limited their ability to provide Assad robust support, while Hezbollah appeared hesitant to commit additional fighters, as it had done previously. Then, on Dec. 2, as opposition forces were on the move, Russia began withdrawing naval assets from its strategic Mediterranean base at Tartus, Syria. This erosion of external backing substantially undermined Assad's capacity to regroup and mount an effective counteroffensive. The U.S. will no doubt welcome this diminished Russian and Iranian influence in Syria. But concern in Washington has already been aired over a scenario of 'catastrophic success&rdquo; in which Assad is replaced by an Islamist group that many in the West see as terrorists. It was members of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that spearheaded much of the opposition gains in Syria, fighting alongside the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army. And while Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has not directly targeted the U.S. troops stationed in the northeast&mdash;which is under the control of Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces&mdash;instability and the potential for clashes between opposition factions and U.S. allies could increase the risks for the 900 Syria-based American personnel. The fact that different opposition groups have taken control of various once-government-held areas points to a crucial fact: Syria is de facto partitioned. The northwest is controlled by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army. The northeast is under the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, supported by the United States. Despite a shared goal of ousting Assad and the joint offensive on Aleppo, conflicts between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Syrian National Army are frequent. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, led by Abu Mohammad al-Golani aims to assert control over opposition-held areas, including those currently managed by the Syrian National Army. And the Syrian National Army and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham maintain complex, often conflicting relationships with the Syrian Democratic Forces, shaped by ideological, territorial and strategic differences. The Turkish-backed Syrian National Army frequently engages in direct clashes with the Syrian Defense Forces, which Turkey views as a terrorist organization and an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers Party it has been fighting in southern Turkey for more than four decades. The opposition's internal fragmentation may weaken its ability to bring stability to Syria in the long run. Adjustment problems Assad's fall will have major implications for those countries that have a stake in the region. Iran's grand strategy of preserving the 'Shia Crescent&rdquo;&mdash;connecting Tehran to Beirut through Baghdad and Damascus and in the process countering Sunni Islamist factions&mdash;has failed. For Washington, Assad's departure doesn't necessarily fit any hoped-for outcome. The U.S. has prioritized balancing, containing, and potentially diminishing Russian and Iranian influence in Syria. But until recently that did not mean the removal of Assad. The Biden administration had even hinted in early December that it would be prepared to lift sanctions on Syria if Assad severed ties with Iran and Hezbollah. There was also talk of Assad's government allying with the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. But as city after city fell to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, it became increasingly unlikely that the Kurdish group would align with the weakening Assad forces&mdash;especially as Kurdish forces themselves made significant territorial gains. Syrian Democratic Forces will need to adapt in response to the fall of Assad. This will be doubly true if, as many anticipate and President-elect Donald Trump has hinted at, the U.S. withdraws from Syria. Currently, the 900 U.S. troops are in eastern Syria, alongside a military base in Al-Tanf, located near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders. Should American forces withdraw, the Syrian Democratic Forces and the autonomous region it administers&mdash;known as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria&mdash;would need to negotiate their autonomy with both different factions of the opposition and Syrian neighbor Turkey. A Kurdish and Islamist alliance? The precarious role of Syrian Democratic Forces in the transition to the post-Assad era could make for a significant foreign policy headache for the U.S. Given Turkey's history of military incursions and campaigns against the Syrian Democratic Forces in northern cities like Afrin and Kobani, the Kurdish group may need to align with some factions of the opposition, likely Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, should the U.S. eventually withdraw. Of late, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has largely avoided antagonizing the Syrian Democratic Forces. Indeed, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's efforts to rebrand and moderate itself are notable, especially given its origins as a Salafist group with ties to al-Qaida. By adopting a range of policies like issuing an amnesty for Syrian army personnel, facilitating evacuation agreements and using the language of building an ethnically and religiously diverse governance structure, the Islamist group has attempted to soften its hard-line image and gain favor &ndash; or at least neutrality &ndash; from international stakeholders, like the U.S. Yet skepticism about Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's ultimate objectives persists. Strategic calculations for Turkey Turkey's position on Syria now is equally complex. Turkey is home to 3.6 million Syrian refugees&mdash;the largest refugee-hosting country globally. A prolonged economic downturn and rising anti-refugee sentiment had pressured Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to signal a willingness to engage with Assad prior to the opposition offensive. Turkey's hope was that normalized relations with Syria would help facilitate refugee return and address concerns about a potential Kurdish state in northeastern Syria. But Assad dismissed such overtures, and he intensified airstrikes on Idlib&mdash;triggering new waves of displacement near the Turkish border. Turkey's Syria policy is also closely linked to its renewed peace process with the Kurdistan Workers' Party. These talks reportedly include discussions about the potential release of imprisoned Kurdistan Workers' Party leader Abdullah &Ouml;calan &ndash; whose influence runs deep in Kurdish-led regions in northern Syria. The chance for a new Syria The apparent end of the Assad family's rule after half a century of brutal oppression signifies a pivotal moment for Syria &ndash; offering an opportunity to rebuild the nation on foundations of inclusivity, pluralism and stability. Achieving this vision depends on the opposition factions' ability to navigate the immense challenges of transition. This includes fostering unity among diverse groups, addressing grievances from years of conflict and establishing governance structures that reflect Syria's ethnic, religious and political diversity. That will be no easy task. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Some Republicans remain unsold on Hegseth	SIMI VALLEY, California&mdash;Pete Hegseth, the president-elect's controversial pick for defense secretary, spent last week on Capitol Hill trying to persuade Republicans that he's fit for the job. But some lawmakers remain unconvinced. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a key Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and former military officer, said Hegseth will go through a 'very thorough vetting process&rdquo; and noted her experience with sexual assault when asked about what else she needs to hear from Hegseth before she supports him. 'I am a survivor of sexual assault, so I've worked very heavily on sexual assault measures within the military. So I'd like to hear a little more about that. I'd like to hear about the role of women in our great United States military,&rdquo; Ernst told the audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum here. Hegseth was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2017; he later paid her as part of a nondisclosure agreement. The Fox TV personality and former Army major has also publicly questioned whether women should serve in combat roles. Ernst said she'll sit down with Hegseth again this week, and expects an FBI background check to provide her with more information about Donald Trump's pick. Other senators have expressed concern about reports of Hegseth's drinking on the job, but have since touted his promise to stop drinking if appointed. His inexperience is also a concern: Hegseth has never made national-security policy, served in a senior military role, worked in defense acquisition, or led an organization larger than a nonprofit advocacy group. He is an 'anti-woke&rdquo; crusader, and has drafted a list of Pentagon officers to fire if he takes the helm. This list includes officers who have promoted diversity, and those involved in the Afghanistan withdrawal. One Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., pushed back on Hegseth's plan, arguing that those military officials were following orders of their commander-in-chief. 'The nominee for the secretary of defense has talked about wanting to go after the generals for being too DEI or going after those who he thought responsible for Afghanistan, and I think we should be careful about that. Our generals are following the orders of the President of the United States, the civilian commander and the Secretary of Defense, and it's not right to punish a military guy for bad decisions,&rdquo; Bacon told Defense One on the sidelines of Reagan. Some of those generals recommended against 'a lot of the stuff&rdquo; President Biden ordered, but had to follow lawful orders from their civilian leaders, Bacon said. Politico recently summed up Hegseth's stances this way: 'Based on numerous public statements and writings, it's likely he will aim to undermine the military's long-standing nonpartisan pluralism by scrubbing diversity from the ranks, banning women in combat, urging the military to choose sides in a &lsquo;civil war' against &lsquo;domestic enemies' on the left, and orienting the military's mission around his fixation on the Muslim world, which he feels represents an existential threat to Western civilization.&rdquo; Trump has continued to defend his pick, writing on Friday that support for Hegseth is 'strong and deep, much more so than the Fake News would have you believe.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/12/some-republicans-remain-unsold-hegseth/401523/	2024-12-08T19:06:49-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/08/U.S._President_elect_2500/large.jpg
US strikes ISIS in Syria as Assad regime falls	U.S. military aircraft struck 75 ISIS-related targets in Syria on Sunday, just hours after the government of Bashar Al-Assad fell to rebel forces, according to the White House. 'ISIS has been trying to reconstitute in this broad area known as the Badiya desert,&rdquo; a White House senior official told reporters on background. 'We have worked to make sure they cannot do that. So when they try to camp there, when they try to train, which we do, we take them out, something.&rdquo; The strikes were executed by B-52s, F-15s, A-10s, and other Air Force assets, the official said. On Saturday, outgoing National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that the United States will continue to play some role in the country, where it has since 2014 deployed troops to fight ISIS. 'There are three things we have to be particularly focused on,&rdquo; Sullivan said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California. 'One: that the fighting in Syria not lead to the resurgence of ISIS, and we are going to take steps ourselves, directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurds, to ensure that does not happen. 'Two: that our friends in the region, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, others who border Syria, or who would potentially face spillover effects from Syria, are strong and secure,&rdquo; he said. 'Three: that this does not lead to a humanitarian catastrophe.&rdquo; The White House official said Assad has been offered asylum by his longtime backers in Moscow, but his current whereabouts are unknown. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main rebel group, had some early links to ISIS and the United States designated it as a terrorist organization in 2018. The White House official said that over the course of the days, senior administration officials will be in the region, 'maintaining the mission against ISIS, helping ensure stability in East Syria, protecting our personnel from any threats, but most importantly, engaging with all Syrian groups to establish and help wherever we can transition away from the Assad regime towards an independent sovereign Syria.&rdquo; They said the United States was proactively involved with multiple groups in Syria and partners in the region. 'I just want to emphasize the future here will be written by Syrians. We are not coming up with a blueprint from Washington for the future of Syria is written by Syrians,&rdquo; the official said. The United States is also concerned about Assad's arsenal of chemical weapons. 'There's a number of efforts going on in that regard, including some of Our partners in the region who have been able to ratio, that's something that we're very much focused on,&rdquo; the official said but indicated that it was unlikely the United States would need to deploy additional assets to Syria to deal with them.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/12/us-strikes-isis-syria-assad-regime-falls/401522/	2024-12-08T15:22:34-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/08/A_U.S._Air_Force_B_5_2500/large.jpg
‘Multi-headed monster’: Biden, Trump officials address threat fro...	Simi Valley, Calif.&mdash;China, Russia, and Iran are working closely together across the globe, which presents new threats to U.S. and allied national security, defense officials from both the Biden and incoming Trump administrations said Saturday. But even together, those countries are not stronger than the American military and its allies, they said. 'Autocrats resort to partnerships of convenience. But America leads partnerships of conviction. And the department's National Defense Strategy rightly calls the U.S. network of allies and partners our &lsquo;greatest global strategic advantage,'&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at the Reagan National Security Forum, in a speech that also included the announcement of a new Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package worth nearly $1 billion. 'That package will provide Ukraine with more drones, more rockets for its HIMARS systems, and more support for crucial maintenance and sustainment,&rdquo; he said. Robert Wilkie, who previously served as secretary of Veterans Affairs and is now leading the Trump administration's Pentagon transition, said: 'The killing fields of Ukraine are a warning to us all, and a warning that this is a multi-headed monster that we have to prepare for multiple theaters&hellip;Weakening the Iranians, weakening the Russians in Eastern Europe weakens China.&rdquo; Wilkie did not address speculation that Trump might cease arms support for Ukraine, but did say the next administration will emphasize a return to large-scale production of key weapons to challenge increasingly coordinated adversaries. 'We will be focusing on producing artillery shells, producing precision-guided munitions, putting more hulls in the water and making sure more ships and submarines are at sea and more aircraft are in the air,&rdquo; he said, adding that he was not speaking in an official capacity for the Trump transition. Wilkie made his remarks as the collapse of the Assad Syrian regime was imminent. He called the fall of Assad&mdash;a close alley of both Russia and Iran&mdash;'a welcomed development,&rdquo; though he noted the emergence of an extremist organization seeking to fill the power vacuum left by Assad's departure is not. The events in Syria, he said, are further proof that the West has over-estimated the strength of adversary states. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan made a similar observation as he defended the Biden administration's record. The partnership between Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea 'has not happened because these countries are so strong. It has happened out of necessity, because these countries are under pressure. Russia, under pressure in Ukraine, had to turn to Iran for munitions and North Korea for personnel. Iran, under pressure, tried to turn to Russia to get help because its attacks against Israel were defeated and its own air defenses were badly degraded. And if you look at China, when we came into this administration, the prevailing storyline was China will surpass the United States in economic strength by the end of this decade,&rdquo; he said, and that's no longer true. President-elect Trump acknowledged the difficulty the Russian regime is facing and made a connection to the collapse of the Assad regime, in a post on Truth Social. 'Russia, because they are so tied up in Ukraine, and with the loss there of over 600,000 soldiers, seems incapable of stopping this literal march through Syria, a country they have protected for years,&rdquo; he wrote. 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/12/multi-headed-monster-biden-trump-officials-address-threat-fromchina-russia-iran-coordination/401521/	2024-12-08T13:41:30-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/08/GettyImages_2152601665_1/large.jpg
A day in the diplomatic life of America’s defense secretary	VIENTIANE, Laos&mdash;From his first memo on the job, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has centered the tending and extending of ties with America's allies and military partners. One busy day&mdash;Wednesday, Nov. 20&mdash;offers a lens on the breadth and intricacy of his efforts. Austin had flown into this southeast Asian capital&mdash;part of a nine-day, four-country trip to the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;for the annual ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus, which this year gathered 19 regional defense leaders and their considerable staffs. He has attended the event in each of his four years as secretary, seizing the chance for face-to-face meeting with counterparts in a region central to U.S. defense strategy. 'People don't realize how much of the job of secretary of defense, particularly of this secretary of defense, is diplomatic,&rdquo; said one U.S. official who accompanied Austin on the trip. On Nov. 20, Austin arrived at the temple-roofed Lao National Conference Center for a series of meetings. Leading off: Austin's first in-person discussion with New Zealand Defense Minister Judith Collins, whose 13-month-old government is upping its regional-security contributions&mdash;for example, sending a warship through the Taiwan Strait for the first time since 2017. The defense chiefs discussed 'next steps for New Zealand's updated strategic documents and framework, and areas for expanded cooperation in the Pacific Islands region.&rdquo; Next up: a meeting with Cambodia's defense minister, part of a wider U.S. effort to woo Phnom Penh from China's ambit. The chiefs settled plans for a December visit by Adm. Samuel Paparo, who leads U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and discussed trust-building projects such as military training, disaster assistance, and de-mining. Austin then met his Laotian counterpart, emerging with joint vows to accelerate work to clear the country of unexploded ordnance&mdash;much of it dropped by U.S. aircraft during the nine-year Secret War&mdash;and continued support for U.S. efforts to bring home troops' remains. And in the day's final 'bilat,&rdquo; Austin talked with Singapore's defense minister about getting the city-state's military more involved in multilateral efforts. This was a running theme of his trip: using American relationships to foster broader connections among friendly nations. A few days earlier, he had stopped in northern Australia to seal a deal to, among other things, bring Japanese forces into a long-running exercise of U.S. Marines and Australian troops. It's also a running theme of Austin's diplomatic efforts. In June, he laid it out in a speech to the Shangri-La conference in Singapore. 'You know, in the past, our experts would talk about a &lsquo;hub-and-spokes' model for Indo-Pacific security,&rdquo; he said. 'Today we're seeing something quite different. This new convergence is not a single alliance or coalition, but instead something unique to the Indo-Pacific&mdash;a set of overlapping and complementary initiatives and institutions, propelled by a shared vision and a shared sense of mutual obligation.&rdquo; In Laos on Nov. 20, Austin made this vision explicit. Having met individually with several of ASEAN military leaders throughout the day, he issued a late-afternoon message for all of them: 'U.S. Department of Defense Vision Statement for a Prosperous and Secure Southeast Asia,&rdquo; a 1,200-word declaration of support for a region 'free of coercion where safety, security, sovereignty, self-determination, and prosperity are shepherded by ASEAN centrality.&rdquo; The document outlines 'key lines of effort&rdquo;&mdash;mostly tactical things like exercises, training, and improving domain awareness. 'We really want to be able to operate with our partners more effectively and in more robust ways together,&rdquo; said one senior defense official. But the ultimate goal is strategic. It's no small thing to 'get a region's countries on board with a shared vision of shared values and shared purpose,&rdquo; as another put it. Austin's preparation Few U.S. defense secretaries can claim Austin's combination of battlefield leadership and diplomatic experience. He has commanded troops in combat as a one-, two-, three-, and four-star general&mdash;the latter as commander of U.S. Central Command, where he managed military relationships and wartime coalitions across a 21-country area of responsibility. Soon after President Biden appointed Austin in 2021, the new secretary issued a memo declaring that building and maintaining ties with allies and partners would be one of nine main thrusts of his tenure. Several months later, Austin was in Singapore, delivering a Fullerton Lecture entitled 'The Imperative of Partnership.&rdquo; An immediate challenge was Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who had for five years sought to shift his country's security policy toward China and Russia. In July 2021, Austin sealed the U.S. ally's return to the fold at a meeting with Duterte in Manila. Not a year later, after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Austin helped rally international support for the besieged country, convening the Ukraine Defense Contact Group to coordinate military aid. Austin has been at the forefront of the Biden administration's efforts to manage international crises such as the Israel-Gaza war, Iran and Israel's exchange of air strikes, China's increasing aggressiveness, and more. Austin, in fact, had invited his Chinese counterpart to meet at the ASEAN event here, part of a long-running effort to bolster military-to-military ties. But on the eve of the conference, Chinese officials declined, citing a recent sale of arms to Taiwan, a senior defense official told reporters traveling with Austin. 'The PRC's decision is a setback for the whole region,&rdquo; Austin told reporters later. 'As I've said consistently, the right time to meet is any time.&rdquo; &lsquo;The role we would expect' As Austin flew from country to country aboard the modified 747 that serves as a traveling command post, Austin's staff kept him informed as the White House approved a loosening of limits on Ukraine's employment of ATACMS missiles, Kyiv fired them at targets inside Russia, and Moscow retaliated with a ballistic missile strike near Dnipro. The continued flow of events underscored the substantial investment Austin makes in partner outreach. 'It takes time, and that can be the most valuable resource that leader has to spend,&rdquo; a staffer said. At a late-afternoon press conference on Nov. 20, Austin laid out what the trip&mdash;and his previous 11 to the region&mdash;mean to him. 'It means a lot,&rdquo; he said. 'You know, when we came on board, we designed a national defense strategy that placed the PRC as a pacing challenge. And despite all the things that we've been supporting around the globe, we've remained focused on that pacing challenge. We've strengthened our relationships with our allies and partners. We've helped them increase their capacity to be able to protect their own interests.&rdquo; 'We have not come to this region ever, on my watch, just to come. We've always done something to increase our capability, our access.&rdquo; He expressed optimism that the progress would stick even as a new administration takes over. 'I think we've put some things in place that will be lasting no matter what happens,&rdquo; he said. 'We've done amazing things like, you know, initiated the AUKUS project, which will add a generational capability, and in my view will contribute to greater stability and security throughout the region. &rdquo;We see things like Japan drastically increasing its investment in its own defense capabilities, investing in long-range strike, wanting to co-produce munitions with us. You see ROK [South Korea] and Japan working together, unlike they've done before. 'We're seeing things that we've not seen before, and it's because of the influence and the hard work of the United States of America.&rdquo; A few days earlier, his Australian counterpart credited Austin himself. 'Of all my counterparts around the world, Lloyd Austin is the person with whom I've been the most&mdash;but I'm really aware that I'm only one of 20 or 30 defense ministers around the world who would say the same thing. And that speaks volumes about the effort that Lloyd Austin has put in,&rdquo; Minister for Defence Richard Marles said at a Nov. 17 press conference. 'He has played the role we would expect of a secretary of defense of America.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/12/day-diplomatic-life-americas-defense-secretary/401516/	2024-12-08T05:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/07/austin_laos_IMG_3424/large.jpg
Russia in talks to send fighter jets to North Korea, INDOPACOM sa...	SIMI VALLEY, California&mdash;Russia may send North Korea 'formidable, but&hellip;early fourth-generation&rdquo; fighter jets, the leader of U.S. Indo-Pacom Command said Saturday. 'We've seen some agreement&rdquo; between Moscow and Pyongyang on the transfer of Russian MiG-29s and Su-27s, Adm. Samuel Paparo said at the Reagan National Defense Forum here. He did not say how many jets might be transferred. The move follows Pyongyang's dispatch of what Paparo said were 12,000 North Korean troops to Russia to fight Ukrainian forces. Paparo spoke at a time of crisis for South Korea, where President Yoon Suk Yeol survived an impeachment vote for his brief declaration of martial law this week, which some are calling a failed coup. 'The National Assembly has drawn up articles of impeachment, which require a two-thirds majority in order to pass. That remains to be seen,&rdquo; the U.S. commander said. Yoon issued an apology on Saturday, four days after rescinding his martial-law declaration and two after firing his defense minister Kim Yong Hyun. Paparo said there was little chance that the drama would affect regional security. 'There is a little bit of political uncertainty in Korea. I'm convinced that, from a security standpoint, there is stability,&rdquo; he said. The discussion turned to whether the incoming Trump administration would come to the self-governing island's defense if China invades. Donald Trump dodged the question on the campaign trail, but said in July: 'Taiwan should pay us for defense...You know, we're no different than an insurance company.&rdquo; Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., who leads the defense panel of the House Appropriations Committee, said he didn't want to speculate how the next administration would approach Taiwan policy, but judged it unlikely that U.S. policy would shift dramatically. Paparo, asked about the possibility of a shift, replied that open-source information indicates that a conflict in the Western Pacific would be devastating for the U.S. economy, and therefore the United States should strengthen its deterrence in the region. Calvert said this was one reason why Congress must focus on INDOPACOM's $11 billion unfunded priorities list and pass military budgets on time. But the question remains open how best to deter China from invading Taiwan, which officials have said is possible before 2027. Paparo declined to endorse a proposal to put Marines or other U.S. forces on Taiwan, a policy shift he said would be 'provocative.' 'The real key to success is for the enablement of Taiwan to be more effective,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/12/russia-talks-send-fighter-jets-north-korea-indopacom-says/401520/	2024-12-07T16:15:02-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/07/Russian_Air_Force_ae_2500/large.jpg
Want ‘government efficiency'? Help change agencies from within	Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been tweeting up a storm about creating a Department of Government Efficiency &mdash; although to listen to some of what they are saying, such a department has already come into being through their tweets. Most accounts of this effort have emphasized their calls for eliminating 'inefficient&rdquo; programs or cutting 'inefficient&rdquo; regulation of business. No prizes for guessing the kinds of regulations or programs they are likely to find most inefficient, as we can be certain it is ones that constrain the ability of companies to do what they want, rather than the internal procedures inside government agencies that constrain their ability to make sensible choices rather than checking boxes for rule compliance. But there is absolutely nothing in the Musk-Ramaswamy pronouncements about making the government more efficient by causing it to work better. Many of the anecdotes about egregious instances of inefficiency are exaggerated. Nonetheless, it is estimated by GAO that $60 billion in fraudulent payments were made during the COVID-19 pandemic, and anyone who has spent time in an agency can come up with many small examples of worthless uses of funds. But we need to understand that an important constituency for better government performance is actually among civil servants themselves. I know from my own experience working on organizational change in agencies from a perch in the Office of Management and Budget many years ago that there are many career civil servants&mdash;not all, but a significant group that I called at the time a 'change vanguard&rdquo;&mdash;who believed in and were committed to improving their agency's performance. My approach while in government was to unleash those people to pursue the changes they sought but had previously not been empowered to undertake. Those people were the backbone for creating changes I could never have done with the small staff I had in the White House. Back in those days, civil servants conceived and pushed important operational changes in how government worked. For example, the old system of buying food for soldiers involved developing a government specification for everything from ketchup to chocolate chip cookies and buying from the lowest bidder producing to the specification. Under a new arrangement that civil servants in the Defense Logistics Agency conceived, the government sampled a range of commercially available items and bought more or fewer depending on what soldiers ate. Other examples of beneficial changes include the switch from buying individual shrink-wrapped software to paying for site licenses (although it took a decade to adopt this practice) and the use of online auctions to buy products. These changes didn't come out of the White House, or from some version of a Musk-Ramaswamy 'Department of Government Efficiency.&rdquo; They came from career civil servants working in many agencies who had ideas people in the White House could never have thought of themselves. Musk and Ramaswamy are in a similar situation. They can't bring about performance improvements in government by themselves; they need to work with those inside the agencies seeking a more efficient government. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen, both because Musk and Ramaswamy are committed to demonizing and diminishing the federal workforce and because performance improvement is not really part of their agenda. This is a missed opportunity. If these two really wanted to make a difference rather than making ideology, they would talk about improving performance and not just slashing agencies, and they would seek to engage allies from our career civil servants. That is more likely to accomplish something than what they are doing instead.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/12/department-government-efficiency-what-about-government-performance/401518/	2024-12-07T10:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/07/120624MuskRamaswamyNG/large.jpg
Robot reality check: Crewed warplanes will remain vital for years...	EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif.&mdash;The U.S. military is many years away from letting robots take over the role of human pilots, according to the Air Force official who oversees development of AI piloting technology. 'There may be someday we can completely rely on robotized warfare&rdquo; but 'it is centuries away,&rdquo; said Brig. Gen. Doug Wickert, commander of the 412th Test Wing here. The base is the hub for testing a host of new planes and technology, including software that enables AI to drive fighter jets. The test wing has been experimenting with autonomous pilots through its X-62A VISTA platform, a modified F-16 jet loaded with AI software. What AI pilots can do today is remarkable, Wickert said, but there's still a gap between the digital world and the real deal&mdash;and robot pilots still make 'unexpected' choices during flight tests. Wickert's comments come as the U.S. military faces scrutiny from President-elect Donald Trump's key advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy for buying expensive manned fighter jets instead of prioritizing drones and other lower-cost platforms. Beyond concerns about technology readiness, warfare is extremely complicated and incorporating AI raises a number of ethics questions&mdash;includingwhether the chance of war increases if humans aren't in the equation, Wickert told a group of reporters visiting the base. Edwards, a sprawling complex in the western portion of the Mojave Desert, has tested every generation of fighter jet since America's very first&mdash;the Bell P-59 in 1942. Now, the base is preparing to test the next generation of fighter technology, including the Air Force's new robot fighter jets, called collaborative combat aircraft. The CCAs will cost about $30 million per drone, which is roughly a third of the cost of one F-35 jet. The base will house the Air Force's CCA drones for testing&mdash;likely next year&mdash;once the two contractors, General Atomics and Anduril, finish their prototypes. The AI software being developed through the VISTA program won't go straight into the CCAs, but will 'inform&rdquo; the AI-enabled drones, Wickert said. Loading AI onto the drones will be an incremental effort, and CCAs will have 'varying levels of autonomy&rdquo; as the service builds trust in AI, Wickert said. Base officials have already started preparing for the Air Force's 6th-generation stealth fighter jet, called Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD. But the program's fate is up in the air after service secretary Frank Kendall paused the program in July due to high-cost projections and emerging technology, and the service announced Thursday that it would further delay the program, punting a decision to the next administration. But the ongoing pause doesn't have a significant impact on Edwards, Wickert said, because there's still planning to do to prepare for NGAD testing. The base has already hired more people so it can prepare for when the Air Force eventually makes a source selection on NGAD, he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/12/robot-reality-check-crewed-warplanes-will-be-vital-years-usaf-general-says/401517/	2024-12-07T08:18:27-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/07/usaf_x_62_240417_F_DB956_9158/large.jpg

The D Brief: A ‘3rd nuclear age’; Seoul’s self-coup fallout; Roma...	Top British military official: 'We are at the dawn of a third nuclear age&hellip;defined by multiple and concurrent dilemmas, proliferating nuclear and disruptive technologies and the almost total absence of the security architectures that went before,&rdquo; Royal Navy Adm. Tony Radakin, chief of the defense staff, said Wednesday in a speech to the Royal United Services Institute in London. 'The era of state competition primarily through geo-economics has shifted to a resurgence of geo-politics, and it will last decades,&rdquo; Radakin predicted. 'This year's most extraordinary development was the deployment of thousands of North Korean soldiers on the border of Ukraine,&rdquo; he said. 'And the possibility of tens of thousands more to follow as part of a new security pact with Russia, which could involve the exchange of the most sensitive technology and expertise between Moscow and Pyongyang.&rdquo; Considering Iran exporting drones to Russia, Yemen and elsewhere, Radakin said 'we are witnessing the world aligning into three groups.&rdquo; Those include: 'authoritarian states seeking to challenge the global rules.&rdquo; That's Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, he said. 'responsible nations of the world. Most are democracies. But it also includes the Gulf monarchies and others who are committed to partnership and to the maintenance of stability and security in the world.&rdquo; And lastly, 'the third group of countries are hedging and ducking between the two for maximum advantage,&rdquo; said Radakin. You may wonder: What were the first two 'nuclear ages&rdquo;? The Cold War was first. 'The second nuclear age was governed by disarmament efforts and counter-proliferation,&rdquo; he said. But the third incorporates 'the almost total absence of the security architectures that went before,&rdquo; said Radakin. His advice: Increase defense spending, and 'renew both our submarines and warhead and to recapitalise our nuclear enterprise after decades of underinvestment&hellip;even though the real benefits won't be realised for another decade at least.&rdquo; Read the rest of his remarks, here.

On this day in 1941, the British and Canadian militaries established Camp X, or Special Training School No. 103, for training Allied secret agents in Ontario, Canada. Between the Pacific and Ukraine Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin cancelled a recent trip to South Korea after this week's martial law attempt by Seoul's embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol, Reuters reported Thursday. Update: South Korea's acting military chief says he won't obey another martial law decree, Yonhap news agency reports. Rumors had been circulating that Yoon might attempt another such order ahead of a possible impeachment vote in the National Assembly. 'Even if there is an order for martial law issuance, the defense ministry and the Joint Chiefs of Staff will never accept it,&rdquo; Acting Defense Minister Kim Seon-ho said Friday. Another top military official said the same during talks with opposition lawmakers. That would be Lt. Gen. Kwak Jong-keun, chief of the Army Special Warfare Command, Yonhap reported separately. He also said that he defied an order from the recently-departed defense minister 'to drag out lawmakers from the National Assembly building&rdquo; during Tuesday's six-hour period of martial law. 'I did not fulfill that task even though I knew it would be insubordination because based on my judgment, dragging lawmakers out was clearly an illegal act,&rdquo; he said Friday. Three other top military officials have been suspended or transferred to other jobs for their participation in Yoon's Tuesday order. That includes Lt. Gen. Lee Jin-woo, chief of the Capital Defense Command; Lt. Gen. Kwak Jong-keun, chief of the Army Special Warfare Command; and Counterintelligence Commander Lt. Gen. Yeo In-hyung, the Defense Ministry announced Friday. 'Military prosecutors have also applied to the justice ministry for a travel ban for 10 military officials facing treason and other charges related to martial law, including the three commanders,&rdquo; Yonhap reports. Meanwhile in Romania, the nation's top court just nullified the recent presidential election result, as officials blame 'aggressive hybrid Russian attacks&rdquo; for results that were deemed too incredible to believe. Context via Reuters: 'Having polled in single digits before the first presidential election round on Nov. 24, [pro-Russian candidate Calin] Georgescu &mdash; who wants to end Romanian support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion &mdash; surged to a first-place finish that raised questions over how such a surprise had been possible.&rdquo; Romania's intelligence service 'also said access data for official Romanian election websites was published on Russian cyber crime platforms,&rdquo; and it asserted 'Georgescu was massively promoted on social media platform TikTok through coordinated accounts, recommendation algorithms and paid promotion,&rdquo; according to Reuters. More, here. New: Ukraine says it just created a drone with a range of 430 miles, Reuters reports from Kyiv. It's known as 'Peklo,&rdquo; which translates to 'hell&rdquo; in Ukrainian, and it behaves like a cruise missile, Ukraine's Herman Smetanin said. In contrast, U.S.-provided ATACMS missiles have a range of about 190 miles.

Trump 2.0 David Perdue, former senator and election denier, is Trump's pick for ambassador to China. As a senator, Perdue served on the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee. Politico: 'Perdue has significant business experience in Asia, including China, something he ran on during his Senate election in 2014,&rdquo; including stints as the former CEO of Dollar General and a top executive at Sara Lee and Reebok. Outsourcing specialist: 'Perdue specialized throughout his career in finding low-cost manufacturing facilities and labor, usually in Asia,&rdquo; Politico wrote in 2014. That didn't save a company called Pillowtex, where Perdue was CEO when it collapsed, causing the loss of more than 7,600 jobs. More, here. Trump is still staffing up for his promised immigration crackdown. On Thursday the president-elect named Rodney Scott as his choice to lead Customs and Border Protection and Caleb Vitello to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Times describes Scott as 'an outspoken Border Patrol chief from [Trump's] first term,&rdquo; and Vitello as 'a longtime [ICE] official.&rdquo; Additional reading: 'Trump offers a public show of support for Pete Hegseth, his embattled nominee to lead the Pentagon,&rdquo; AP reported Friday from a post on Trump's social media feed; 'Trump's Treasury Pick Has Bought and Sold at Least 20 Homes.

Fallout from China's Salt Typhoon hack continues Feds who forced backdoors on U.S. telecoms think it's time to insist on good locks. More than two months after the China-linked 'Salt Typhoon&rdquo; hack was publicly revealed by U.S. officials, the Federal Communications Commission is circulating a proposed rule to mandate basic cybersecurity in systems installed by telecommunications firms to comply with a 1990s-era wiretapping law. Why now? 'A senior administration official said Wednesday that the swaths of voluntary cybersecurity guidance used by the private sector has proved inadequate for protecting the affected telecom networks, and that minimum cyber requirements would have helped prevent the Chinese cyberspies from breaching the telecommunications systems,&rdquo; David DiMolfetta of Nextgov/FCW reported Thursday. Navies from the U.S., Japan and Philippines joined forces to patrol waters of the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone in the South China Sea on Friday. 'The patrol was staged about 40 nautical miles (74 kilometers) from Scarborough Shoal, a fishing area hotly disputed by Beijing and Manila off the northwestern Philippines,&rdquo; the Associated Press reports, citing Philippine officials. 'Participating units included a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon from Patrol Squadron 47; the Philippine Navy BRP Andres Bonifacio and a C-90; and the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force Murasame-class destroyer JS Samidare (DD 106),&rdquo; U.S. officials at Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement Friday. Two days prior, 'The Philippine coast guard said Chinese coast guard vessels, backed by navy ships, fired powerful water cannons and blocked and sideswiped a much smaller Philippine bureau of fisheries vessel escorted by coast guard ships off Scarborough Shoal,&rdquo; AP writes. Manila filed a formal diplomatic protest in response to the Chinese attacks. 'Thursday's protest is the latest in nearly 200 the Philippines has lodged against China under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr who has increasingly complained about what [he] says are Beijing's aggressive actions in the South China Sea,&rdquo; Reuters reported. Around the Defense Department Update: Air Force punts decision on 6th-gen fighter to Trump admin. Service officials said on Thursday that they will defer a decision about the Next Generation Air Dominance effort, which they paused earlier this year after initial projections put the cost of the fighter at three times the cost of an F-35 and the advent of new technologies and threats have altered how the service views air superiority. The new administration's views on NGAD remain to be seen. The defense chapter of Project 2025, penned by former Trump acting defense secretary Christopher Miller, supports a 'next-generation air dominance system of systems,&rdquo; but does not explicitly mention a crewed aircraft in its calls for new weapons, drones, and sensors. Elon Musk, a key adviser of the president-elect, has been vocal about his dislike for manned fighters. Defense One's Audrey Decker has more, here. And lastly: U.S. soldiers were recently arrested on human-smuggling charges near the Mexican border. 'Emilio Mendoza Lopez, Angel Palma, 20, and Enrique Jauregui, 25, were arrested after a vehicle allegedly driven by Palma and carrying Mendoza Lopez, a Mexican national and two Guatemalan nationals was stopped Nov. 27 by law enforcement in Presidio along the border with Mexico,&rdquo; AP reported Wednesday. DOJ spokesman Mike Lahrman said he 'did not know the soldier's ranks or whether action had been taken against them by the military. A spokesman for Fort Cavazos did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/12/the-d-brief-december-06-2024/401494/	2024-12-06T08:26:04-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/06/DB_lander/large.png
As sims at sea help one carrier’s aviators stay sharp, the Navy w...	Aviators aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln have been using simulators to practice as a group at sea&mdash;and the Navy's air boss wants to replicate that across the strike group and beyond. 'I send about 24 young warfighters down to the highest-classified room on the carrier&hellip;And they rehearse, and they train, and they are higher trained because of the sims at sea than ever before,&rdquo; Vice Adm. Daniel Cheever, who leads Naval Air Forces, said during the National Defense Industrial Association's annual training and simulation conference, or I/ITSEC. 'What I need to do is integrate that training across the strike group and with every asset that comes out.&rdquo; The simulators use the Joint Simulation Environment, which was first designed for F-35 test and evaluation and has since been used for training at Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada and Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. Having the simulators at sea enables aviators to work through complex conditions that aren't easily replicated during daily operations, Cheever said. Live-virtual-constructive training 'helps solve problems of scalability, complexity, and security,&rdquo; said John Bell, chief technology officer for HII Mission Technologies, which supports the JSE. 'When you're flying off an aircraft carrier in routine day-to-day operations,&rdquo; Bell said, 'we don't have a bunch of enemy aircraft flying around at will, and so being able to do it in a more complex training environment has been a problem that, in the last few years, has become much more critical than it used to be.&rdquo; Perhaps the most important reason to have simulators at sea is that they provide the ability to turn real-world scenarios into training missions. 'What's needed is to turn today's Red Sea, Ukraine lessons&hellip;into those simulations for tomorrow,&rdquo; Cheever said. 'If you can't turn it that fast, we're in trouble. So open architecture, fast. I've never seen anything as fast as what we've gotten to in the Red Sea, as far as learning goes. So that learning team, that's where we're heading as a force.&rdquo; Sims at sea could also help prepare pilots for future missions with uncrewed aircraft, as called for in the chief of naval operations' navigation plan. The Navy is 'putting unmanned control systems on every single aircraft carrier, because that's the future,&rdquo; Cheever said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/12/after-sims-sea-helped-one-carriers-aviators-stay-sharp-navy-wants-more/401491/	2024-12-06T07:25:02-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/06/sim/large.jpg
Air Force boots decision on 6th-gen fighter to Trump admin	The Air Force is punting a decision on the direction of its 6th-generation stealth fighter jet to the Trump administration, and asking industry to update their proposals in light of the delay. 'The Secretary of the Air Force will defer the Next Generation Air Dominance way ahead decision to the next administration, while the Department of the Air Force continues its analysis and executes the necessary actions to ensure decision space remains intact for the NGAD program,&rdquo; Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said in a statement today. The service paused its NGAD program earlier this year after initial projections put the cost of the fighter at three times the cost of an F-35 and the advent of new technologies and threats have altered how the service views air superiority. [[Related Posts]] The new administration's views on NGAD remain to be seen.

Elon Musk, a key adviser of the president-elect, has been vocal about his dislike for manned fighters. The Air Force originally planned to pick a builder for a fighter jet by year's end, with Lockheed Martin and Boeing in the running. Northrop Grumman bowed out of the competition last year, but has expressed interest in jumping back in depending on how the service changes requirements for the sixth-gen jet. While the fate of NGAD remains unknown, Stefanek said the Air Force is 'extending the current Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction contracts for the Next Generation Air Dominance program to further mature designs/systems while ensuring the industry teams remain intact.&rdquo; Industry will 'update their proposals to account for the delays resulting from the current pause (schedule/milestone update only),&rdquo; she said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/12/air-force-boots-decision-6th-gen-fighter-trump-admin/401469/	2024-12-05T12:32:54-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/05/8740616/large.jpg
How a director of national intelligence helps a president stay on...	In all the arguments over whether President-elect Donald Trump's choice for director of national intelligence is fit for the job, it's easy to lose sight of why it matters. It matters a lot. To speak of telling truth to power seems terribly old-fashioned these days, but as a veteran of White House intelligence operations, I know that is the essence of the job. The director of national intelligence is the president's principal adviser on intelligence, though the CIA director has remained somewhat co-equal in that role. The director of national intelligence is responsible for both the President's Daily Brief, where the most crucial and sophisticated intelligence is presented, and for the work of the National Intelligence Council. Most of the President's Daily Brief items are still done by the CIA, but the director of national intelligence or their deputy briefs the president, daily in most administrations but one or two times a week in the first Trump administration. The issues in those briefings lean toward the immediate and tactical: What is the situation on the ground in the Ukraine war? If action X is taken, how will Russian President Vladimir Putin respond? But intelligence strives to push presidents and their colleagues to think more strategically: What are the implications of hypersonic missiles? What is the trajectory of the relationship between Russia and China? What are China's geostrategic objectives, and what is the role of the Belt and Road Initiative in that vision? The current director of national intelligence is Avril Haines, who is my friend and former colleague from when she was the deputy national security adviser in charge of the National Security Council policy committees and I was chair of the National Intelligence Council, providing the intelligence support to those committees. [[Related Posts]] As director of national intelligence, Haines sits atop the 17 agencies that make up what is called the U.S. intelligence community. She does not run those agencies. Nor does she have full control of their budgets. Rather, the director of national intelligence coordinates them, which sometimes seems like the proverbial herding of cats. She assembles a combined budget for intelligence, but many of the big agencies, such as the National Security Agency, which makes and breaks codes and intercepts signals of interest, belong to the Pentagon. The creation of the director of national intelligence position was a direct result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The report of the 9/11 Commission was vividly damning about the failures of communication between agencies in the run-up to 9/11. In meetings in New York that summer, CIA and FBI officers were literally unsure what they could tell each other: The former wondered whether the FBI people were really cleared to hear this, while the latter feared that talking might blow a case they were working on. That lack of coordination played a role in letting the plotters slip through intelligence, often in plain sight. The result of the commission's work was the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which created the director of national intelligence position. Before that, the director of central intelligence wore two hats, as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and loose coordinator of the broader intelligence community. Hardly surprisingly, directors of central intelligence spent most of their time running the CIA, for that was the source of their troops &ndash; and their troubles when they arose. A score of blue-ribbon panels over 50 years had recommended breaking the director of central intelligence's conflict of interest &ndash; coordinating agencies and their budgets while running one of them &ndash; and creating a director of national intelligence position. James Clapper, the director of national intelligence for whom I worked as chair of the National Intelligence Council, constantly emphasized 'integration.&rdquo; Across agencies, integration mostly means talking to each other and sharing information. This works against the natural tendency to scoop your colleagues. Across disciplines, integration means better aligning what information intelligence agencies collect with what analysts need. If presidents want to know what the CIA thinks about a particular issue, they can simply ask. Usually, though, the question is what does the intelligence community think, and then the question goes to the National Intelligence Council, the director of national intelligence's interagency group for intelligence analysis. The National Intelligence Council is organized like the State Department, with officers for regions and functions. Once a question has been presented, the relevant national intelligence officer will convene his or her council colleagues from the other agencies. They will argue about the answer to the question, a process sweetly called 'coordination,&rdquo; then agree on the answer. If need be, the process can be done in a few hours. Major strategic analyses &ndash; national intelligence estimates &ndash; like one done in 2022 on the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic out to 2026, may take months. In all cases, though, the analysis carefully records where there are differences of view in the intelligence community. In my last year chairing the National Intelligence Council, of the 700 or so analyses we did, about 400 were responses to questions &ndash; called 'taskings&rdquo; in governmentese &ndash; from the national security adviser or one of the deputies. National intelligence officers are national experts from inside or outside federal government, and their deputies &ndash; the heart and soul of the NIC &ndash; are all assigned from intelligence agencies. The largest number come from the CIA, but I worked with a cyber analyst from the Secret Service and a wonderful analyst from the New York Police Department. What was striking then and has struck me both times I've had the privilege of running a U.S. intelligence agency is the dedication of the officers. They work for the nation, not for a political party or ideology. As chair of the NIC, I had no idea of the politics of my people, save for the several closest to me. For them, telling truth to power is not a slogan. It is what they do. They are always worried about 'politicizing&rdquo; &ndash; producing an assessment to suit a policymaker's preference or, worse, being pressured to do so. The president's daily briefers, for instance, give up a year of their lives to come to work at 4 a.m., learn their briefs and then fan out across Washington to brief senior officials. They like being 'on the team&rdquo; of the person they brief, but they become uncomfortable if the conversation turns political. The director of national intelligence sets the tone for that resolutely nonpolitical stance and polices it through principles articulated in the agency's analytic integrity and standards. As chair of the NIC, for instance, I'd receive regular assessments of both the quality of our analyses and whether we risked becoming 'politicized.&rdquo; For their part, do politicians and agency leaders like it when their pet projects are assessed by intelligence as unwise or infeasible? Of course not. I've been on that side of the intelligence-policy divide as well. But the United States is much the better for it.

The D Brief: Rebels take another Syrian city; China’s big hack; N...	Syrian troops retreat from Hama New: Just a week after taking Aleppo, jihadists and rebels seized another major city in Syria on Thursday. Government troops confirmed their departure from the west-central city of Hama on Thursday after forces led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham entered the city center, al-Jazeera reported on location. But it's not just HTS in Hama, Aleppo, and the Idlib countryside. 'Other groups backed by Turkey and based in Syrian territory just south of the Turkish border have also joined in the fight,&rdquo; the New York Times reports. The city of Homs is reportedly next, Charles Lister of the Washington-based Middle East Institute reports. Accelerated pace: From 2011 to 2023, forces loyal to Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad 'lost control of two provincial capitals &mdash; Raqqa & Idlib,&rdquo; Lister wrote on social media Thursday morning. But 'In the space of 8 days, he's just lost two more &mdash; Aleppo & Hama, Syria's 2nd & 4th biggest cities.&rdquo; Also notable: HTS leader Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani (also spelled Jolani) told Iraqis not to come to Syria to help the fight against the Assad regime, according to a video released Wednesday. Jawlani himself is a Syrian who traveled to Iraq to fight the U.S. and coalition invasion back in 2003. He was later captured and imprisoned in a U.S. military facility for five years before leading a local branch of al-Qaeda militants in the first few years of the Syrian Civil War. Expert forecast: 'Big question going forward for HTS is if they can continue to scale up w/out diluting professionalism/discipline we've seen so far,&rdquo; said terrorism researcher Aaron Zelin. 'Only gets harder once they get into core regime territories&rdquo; closer to Damascus. 'Even if HTS takes those areas, [it] might have to then deal with [an] insurgency against them.&rdquo; Meanwhile in Damascus, 'Shops are deserted except for grocery stores, where people are rushing to stock up,&rdquo; and 'A drone was just shot over the city but it's not clear where it came from,&rdquo; one academic reports on location. There are several military entities tasked with defending the capital city, he writes, including Syria's best-regarded troops as well as Iranian-backed militias and fighters from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Big-picture consideration: 'As the United States shifts its focus to great-power competition with nations such as China, it leaves behind a Middle East where populations and regional countries no longer see groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham merely as terrorists but as political actors filling the void left by failing states,&rdquo; Syrian scholar Hassan Hassan wrote Thursday in the New York Times. 'Their goals are no longer about global jihad but regional dominance &mdash; a strategy that makes them harder to dislodge. Western policymakers must grapple with this new reality,&rdquo; he advised. 'Western nations have a choice,&rdquo; Hassan says. That is, 'create a moderate alternative that can govern effectively, or acknowledge that such groups will continue to rule in a world that is far from perfect.&rdquo; Read on, here.

Roger Donlon's special forces detachment was attacked by Viet Cong troops well before sunrise at their camp about 15 miles from the Laotian border. For five hours, Donlon scrambled to direct the camp's defensive response, killing attackers, moving ammunition and weapons, providing cover fire for evacuating comrades, and rendering first aid to the wounded&mdash;all while under intense grenade, mortar and heavy weapons fire and after having suffered several wounds himself, including injuries to his leg, stomach, shoulder and face. He would become the first Green Beret to receive the Medal of Honor. Donlon passed away in January at the age of 89. Salt Typhoon cut deeper than thought China's Salt Typhoon hack has penetrated eight telecom firms, affecting the U.S. and dozens of other countries, a White House official told reporters on Wednesday. According to the Associated Press, 'Deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger offered new details about the breadth of the sprawling Chinese hacking campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.&rdquo; Among the hacked telecoms: AT&T, Verizon and Lumen Technologies, officials with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told reporters Tuesday. But there could be more: 'Officials who briefed reporters on the recommendations said the U.S. still doesn't know the true scope of China's attack or the extent to which Chinese hackers still have access to U.S. networks,&rdquo; AP reports. The hackers have accessed three types of information, U.S. officials said: Call records showing the numbers that phones called and when. (The hackers focused on phones in the Washington, D.C., area, the officials said.) Live phone calls of some specific targets. (The presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as the office of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, have been informed that they have been targeted.) Systems that U.S. law enforcement uses to wiretap Americans' communications under the 1994 CALEA law. FBI, CISA guidance: The agencies issued cybersecurity guidance for companies to 'help root out the hackers and prevent similar cyberespionage in the future. And Americans in general should use encrypted apps for communications, the officials said. 'Our suggestion, what we have told folks internally, is not new here: encryption is your friend, whether it's on text messaging or if you have the capacity to use encrypted voice communication. Even if the adversary is able to intercept the data, if it is encrypted, it will make it impossible,&rdquo; Jeff Greene, executive assistant director for cybersecurity at CISA, said on a press call Tuesday, per NBC News. So, what apps are encrypted? It's a bit complicated. Signal is 'end-to-end&rdquo; encrypted, meaning that even its parent company can't read your messages&mdash;but only if you use it to message other Signal users. Same with Apple's iMessage: blue bubbles mean encrypted messages, green ones don't. And same with Google Messages, except there's no indication when it sends an insecure text. And WhatsApp says it has E2EE but there have been exceptions. China's denial: A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington denied the country was behind the hacking campaign, telling NBC News in an email that 'China firmly opposes and combats all kinds of cyber attacks.&rdquo; Around the Defense Department The Pentagon's next No. 2 may be a wealthy investor with deep ties to the defense industry. To be sure, those ties suggest potential conflicts of interest; but billionaire Stephen Feinberg's familiarity with the Pentagon's acquisition system could be helpful, too, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reported Wednesday. As co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management, Feinberg directed the firm's investments toward the defense sector across a range of areas, from armored vehicles to aviation services to undersea cables. He's also taken a particular interest in aerospace, through positions in companies like Vivace&mdash;a producer of specialty propulsion tanks&mdash;and investments in hypersonic missile testing businesses, Tucker writes. What's more, the company's acquisition of CalSpan led to the creation of a business called North Wind, which aims to 'drive the expansion and modernization of our nation's valuable test infrastructure with a focus on hypersonics.&rdquo; How could Feinberg help the Pentagon's hypersonics ambitions? Continue reading, here. Armenian Defense Minister Suren Papikyan is visiting the Pentagon for talks with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Aside from the six-week war with its neighbor Azerbaijan over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020, Armenia rarely makes international headlines. And Turkish leaders in Ankara, whose Ottoman Empire oversaw the genocide of more than a million Armenians in 1915 and 1916, aren't in any particular hurry to change that. In fact, Turkey has closed its borders with Armenia and hasn't had formal relations with the country since 1993. Panning out: Armenia occupies a precarious place in the South Caucasus, where Eastern Europe meets West Asia. Sandwiched between Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Iran, Armenia has become 'a flashpoint in the broader Russia-West standoff,&rdquo; two scholars, Philip Gamaghelyan and Nigar G&ouml;ksel, write this week in War on the Rocks. 'Moreover, Armenia's membership in the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization, which involves a mutual defense clause, failed to prevent Azerbaijan's limited incursion into Armenia proper in 2022,&rdquo; Gamaghelyan and G&ouml;ksel explain. 'Thus, Armenia has suspended its participation in the organization and has sought to develop relationships with the European Union and the United States, capitalizing on their geopolitical competition with Moscow.&rdquo; Latest: Armenia's prime minister flagged the ongoing tensions with Russia in remarks to lawmakers Wednesday. Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty has a bit more on that recent development. One last note about Armenia's obscurity: 'No matter what happens to Armenians, it doesn't get in the news,&rdquo; American comedian James Adomian joked in a recent stand-up special. 'You tune in to CNN and they're like, &lsquo;The Armenians&mdash;we've heard the word, we don't know what they are&hellip;'&rdquo; Catch the rest of his bit via YouTube, here. You can also see Adomian discuss the country with now-deceased raconteur and travel writer Anthony Bourdain over plates of Armenian food at Sahag's Basturma sandwich shop in northwestern Los Angeles, Calif. That five-and-a-half minute video is also on YouTube, here. Additional reporting from around DOD: 'Army, Marine Corps want more ground vehicle simulators,&rdquo; Defense One's Lauren C. Williams reported Wednesday from the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference, or I/ITSEC, in Orlando; 'Wanted: realistic simulations for digital warfare,&rdquo; Williams reported separately from I/ITSEC on Wednesday; See also 'New joint data standards could come in early 2025,&rdquo; also via Williams at I/ITSEC; And don't miss, 'Can OpenAI power military drone defenses?

After four years under President Biden, Americans are feeling more confident in the U.S. military than they have in years, with record-high support for U.S. leadership abroad and increasing defense spending, according to an annual survey published Thursday by the Ronald Reagan Institute. 'Fifty percent of Americans overall&mdash;61 percent of Trump voters&mdash;they prefer more of an engaged, internationalist American leadership approach on the international stage,&rdquo; Rachel Hoff, the institute's policy director, told reporters Tuesday. Both of those figures are all-time highs from the survey's six years of polling, Defense One's Meghann Myers reports. Respondents also favored a bump in defense spending, as well as continued U.S. military basing around the world. On the other hand: Results were less enthusiastic for continued spending when it comes to sending weapons to allies, Myers writes. Forty-three percent supported foreign spending, down 5 percent from last year. Within that group, 54 percent support sending weapons to Israel and 55 percent support sending weapons to Ukraine, both slightly down from previous surveys. Other takeaways: 27 percent of respondents said the U.S. should focus its forces on the Indo-Pacific region. Another 25 percent ranked the Middle East as the highest priority, while 18 percent pointed to Europe. 60 percent support for NATO as an alliance, with about three-quarters of respondents supporting the mandate to intervene in its defense.

New joint data standards could come in early 2025	ORLANDO, Fla.&mdash;The Pentagon's top body in charge of developing military requirements is expected to release new data standards next year that will make it easier for combatant commands and services to conduct large scale exercises in virtual environments. The joint requirements oversight council, or JROC, is currently working on a capstone initial capabilities document, which will outline data standards for simulation and modeling systems the military uses. The document is expected in March, said Adm. Christopher Grady, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, during the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference. Standards for data architecture and data sharing are necessary so the joint force can take advantage of modeling and simulation technologies. 'There's so much data out there that you all are working with&hellip;How do we manage data so that we can bring it into these very sophisticated modeling and simulation engines that are going to help us with that dominant decision-making?&rdquo; he said. 'But from a joint perspective, I think we need to have standards right. So that as we build out, for instance, the Joint Live, Virtual and Constructive framework, I want the services and the [combatant commands] to be able to plug into that seamlessly. So standardization will be really, really important.&rdquo; Still, there's work remaining, and the Pentagon plans to ask Congress for funding to 'build out those robust standards so that everybody can see where they fit in,&rdquo; Grady said. 'I think, from a big arc perspective, that will be really helpful,&rdquo; he said. [[Related Posts]] Adopting joint standards would make it so various simulation systems used by each of the services can talk to each other, which would make it easier to hold large, joint training exercises, said John Bell, chief technology officer HII Mission Technology, which supports the Joint Live, Virtual, Constructive training environment the combatant commands use. 'If I'm a Navy guy and I'm running a Navy exercise with Navy simulation systems and we want to do a joint exercise with the Air Force, how do we make sure all of our training systems can talk to each other in a meaningful way, so that we can train together in a meaningful way?&rdquo; Bell said. 'So we have to set those standards at a joint level.&rdquo; And when it comes to data sharing across classification levels, the military needs to have machine-based solutions to keep operators from having to toggle between computers to share information with mission partners, Grady said. 'I want everything to be fully informed. And that's very, very challenging. So the more that we can get away from swivel-chairing data, the more that we can have cross-domain solutions from the highest classification level all the way down, the better will be,&rdquo; he said, describing how operators will spin in their chair to share information between systems of different classification levels. That's a task better suited for computers, but developing cross-domain solutions that are effective is very difficult, Bell said. 'We want to have computers be able to do that. And we have these cross-domain solutions in place, but they're very difficult to develop,&rdquo; he said. Bell said developing cross-domain solutions that work effectively will require 'continued investment,&rdquo; but is critical for the U.S. military to continue to train with allies and partners. 'We want to be able to share data with them so that we can train as we can fight and we can fight the way we want to in an actual warfare scenario,&rdquo; Bell said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/12/new-joint-data-standards-could-come-early-2025/401450/	2024-12-05T04:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/05/8284586/large.jpg
Wanted: realistic simulations for digital warfare	ORLANDO, Fla.&mdash;Training models and simulations need to 'move beyond the physical domains&rdquo; to keep pace with global threats, said Adm. Christopher Grady, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 'We have some holes in our swing from a domain perspective,&rdquo; Grady said Tuesday during a panel at the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference. 'And the areas that I'm focused on now are: can we move beyond the physical domains to space, into cyber, into the [electromagnetic] spectrum, into, say, irregular warfare? We have to be able to simulate those.&rdquo; It is more challenging to digitally recreate threats like irregular warfare or in the information environment because it 'starts to get into the cognitive domain,&rdquo; Grady said, but it's crucial. 'I think if we can get those right, you get some attributes that will be really important. The first is that we might be able to go at scale and at speed faster, particularly if we design a system that is mobile and is cloud-based and leverages AI,&rdquo; he said. 'The second thing is, whatever we build into the future has to be easy to use, right? Because I think that's what will generate the iterative cycle that we really want. If it takes weeks and weeks and weeks to set up the next run&hellip;that's not helpful. It's useful, but it's not where we need to be.&rdquo; Moreover, simulated environments must be integrated so allies and partners can 'see themselves,&rdquo; he said. 'Because we're not going to do anything with that. And so we have to move along with them. And so I think we can solve the standards, the all-domain solutions, the cross-domain solutions, if we can be mobile, if we can build at scale and speed, if we can build ease into it and that collaboration with a fast turn, I think we'll achieve that,&rdquo; Grady said. The Space Force also wants combat credible models and simulations for space systems as quickly as possible. Maj. Gen. Timothy Sejba, the head of Space Training and Readiness Command, or STARCOM, said the command is focused on putting the right infrastructure and training in place to quickly integrate real-life scenarios. 'In a benign environment, which we operated for many decades, we could develop individual trainers, positional trainers that allowed crews to get very proficient, to do their daily jobs, day in and day out. But that didn't necessarily integrate a threat into that environment the way that we face it today,&rdquo; he said during a separate panel Tuesday. 'As a deployed-in-place force with most of our capability operating from the United States, with a few exceptions, when it comes to electronic warfare, most of what we do is dependent upon integrating units together, completely different than we had in the past.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/12/wanted-realistic-simulations-digital-warfare/401449/	2024-12-05T01:12:19-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/05/8170841/large.jpg
Americans favor more international engagement, military spending:...	Americans are feeling more confident in the U.S. military than they have in years, with record-high support for U.S. leadership abroad and increasing defense spending, according to results released Thursday from the annual Reagan National Defense Survey from the Ronald Reagan Institute. At the same time, support for sending weapons to foreign partners is down, researchers found after surveying a bipartisan group of more than 2,500 U.S. citizens who answered questions from Nov. 8 to 14, in the days immediately following Donald Trump's re-election. 'Fifty percent of Americans overall&mdash;61 percent of Trump voters&mdash;they prefer more of an engaged, internationalist American leadership approach on the international stage,&rdquo; Rachel Hoff, the institute's policy director, told reporters Tuesday. Both figures are all-time highs in the survey's six years. Time will tell how this desire for leadership squares with President-elect Trump's more transactional, 'America-first&rdquo; foreign-policy style. Along those same lines, respondents favored a bump in defense spending, as well as continued U.S. military basing around the world. [[Related Posts]] Seventy-nine percent said that they strongly or somewhat supported an increase in spending, the highest level ever recorded by the survey, and up from a historic low of 71 percent from the institute's summer 2023 polling. That is on top of Americans' already inflated sense of how much money the U.S. pours into the Pentagon's budget, according to the survey results, which in reality is around 13 percent of the federal budget. 'Now, Americans overestimate the amount that we are currently spending on the military, and so the fact that there's an appetite for even more defense spending when Americans already &hellip; believe we spend a quarter or even half of the federal budget on defense &hellip; really puts a kind of a finer point on the desire for increased military spending,&rdquo; Hoff said. Results were less enthusiastic for continued spending when it comes to sending weapons to allies. Forty-three percent supported foreign spending, down 5 percent from last year. Within that group, 54 percent support sending weapons to Israel and 55 percent support sending weapons to Ukraine, both slightly down from previous surveys. But respondents were more confident than they've been in years that spending will go to good use, according to the results. Fifty-one percent said they have a great deal of confidence in the military, with another 31 percent stating they have at least some. That's up from a historic low of 45 percent high confidence after the withdrawal from Afghanistan in late 2021, but not nearly rebounded from the 70 percent rate when the survey began in 2018. 'One thing we did see during those years of decline, and I think this gets at some of the initial data we're starting to see on the rebound, is that to a large degree, confidence in the military does have to do with questions of politics,&rdquo; Hoff said. Support for the military fell in both parties throughout Trump's first term, the data shows, dropping to 56 percent just after he left the White House in 2021. Republican confidence plummeted yet more during the early Biden administration, as survey responses showed that Americans of both parties were concerned about politicization of the military and its leaders. During and after his first presidency, Trump derided the military, including his hand-picked Joint Chiefs chairman, while right-wing commentators hammered away at what they called leaders' dangerous 'wokeness.&rdquo; Democrats, meanwhile, were more concerned with extremists in the ranks. A bump can also be seen in confidence that the U.S. can fight a war against China, Hoff said. 'There's a real optimism among Trump voters about the U.S. military extending its edge in terms of superiority against China,&rdquo; she said. With that in mind, 27 percent of respondents said the U.S. should focus its forces on the Indo-Pacific region. Another 25 percent ranked the Middle East as the highest priority, while 18 percent pointed to Europe. Trump has vowed to reinvigorate his crusade against NATO in his second term, decrying the organization as 'dead&rdquo; and deriding the U.S. obligation to protect its partner nations in the face of an attack. Reagan National Defense Survey data shows 60 percent support for NATO as an alliance, with about three-quarters of respondents supporting the mandate to intervene in its defense. The question of continued U.S. military presence abroad has stayed relatively steady since the first survey in 2018. This year, 62 percent favored permanent basing overseas, while 33 percent opposed it. Last year's figure on the same question was split 66 percent to 28 percent. In 2020, Trump ordered 12,000 of roughly 80,000 U.S. troops from permanent basing and rotational deployments in Germany, though it was an undertaking so large that it couldn't get off the ground before President Joe Biden took office in early 2021, when he quickly reversed his predecessor's decision. That total presence now sits at around 100,000, following a surge of troops sent to support countries on NATO's eastern front after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Trump did manage to pull 700 troops out of Somalia in his final days as president, a contingent of mostly special operations forces who helped Somalian forces fight back against al-Shabab, al-Qaida's biggest and most well-funded affiliate. A year later, those troops were back in place, after persistent private and public lobbying from Defense Department officials.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/12/americans-favor-more-international-engagement-military-spending-survey/401447/	2024-12-04T21:05:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/04/GettyImages_2185637991/large.jpg
Can OpenAI power military drone defenses? New partnership with An...	The growing relationship between Silicon Valley and the defense industry opened a new chapter on Wednesday when Anduril announced a partnership with generative AI leader and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The arrangement&mdash;financial terms were not disclosed&mdash;suggests that OpenAI is looking beyond the consumer market to tailor tools for the U.S. government, or at least government contractors. It also shows a sea change in Silicon Valley, where just a few years ago search giant Google stepped away from a lucrative Pentagon contract at the behest of employees and users. The deal may be connected to Anduril's new $100 million Pentagon contract for 'edge data integration,&rdquo; Read that to mean large-scale software to quickly pull together and organize huge volumes of data coming from the battlefield and beyond&mdash;the object being much faster operations, particularly involving the deployment of and defense against unmanned weapons of the sort sought by the Defense Department's Replicator program. An Anduril spokesperson said OpenAI and its powerful (and popular) large language model promise to help turn that data into something that operators and analysts can actually use. The addition of OpenAI tools to Anduril's Lattice mesh network will help 'assess drone threats more quickly and accurately, giving operators the information they need to make better decisions while staying out of harm's way,&rdquo; the spokesperson said. [[Related Posts]] The Defense Department has been experimenting with Lattice in the Pacific and Middle East regions. 'By bringing together OpenAI's advanced models with Anduril's high-performance defense systems and Lattice software platform, the partnership aims to improve the nation's defense systems that protect U.S. and allied military personnel from attacks by unmanned drones and other aerial devices,&rdquo; the company said in a Wednesday statement said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quoted in the statement: 'Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects U.S. military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free.' OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Pentagon's interest in generative AI, both as a tool and as a challenge in the hands of adversaries, has received considerable attention under the office of the Deputy Defense Secretary, which launched a task force in August 2023 to explore its national-security implications. Some researchers have warned that consumer-facing AI tools like large-language models, trained on large amounts of publicly available information, could pose privacy and accuracy risks in military contexts.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/12/can-openai-power-military-drone-defenses-new-partnership-anduril-offers-clues/401446/	2024-12-04T15:20:04-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/04/6421261/large.jpg
Could Trump’s pick for Pentagon No. 2 accelerate the Pentagon’s h...	The Pentagon's next No. 2 may be a billionaire investor with deep ties to the defense industry that suggest potential conflicts of interest but also a familiarity with the military acquisition system. Numerous media outlets reported on Tuesday that President-elect Trump has said he will nominate Stephen Feinberg, co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management, to be U.S. deputy defense secretary. Feinberg has played a role in building a variety of technology companies that work with the Pentagon and other defense contractors, and observers and watchdogs have raised concerns that Feinberg's current role presents a serious conflict of interest. But his background may also make him well suited to challenge the notoriously slow and difficult Defense Department acquisition process. At Cerberus, Feinberg directed the firm's investments toward the defense sector across a range of areas, from armored vehicles to aviation services to undersea cables. [[Related Posts]] He has taken a particular interest in aerospace, through positions in companies like Vivace&mdash;a producer of specialty propulsion tanks&mdash;and investments in hypersonic missile testing businesses The company's acquisition of CalSpan led to the creation of a business called North Wind, which aims to 'drive the expansion and modernization of our nation's valuable test infrastructure with a focus on hypersonics,&rdquo; according to a company release from May. The U.S. military services are also investing in advanced highly-maneuverable hypersonics, though many of those efforts have met with setbacks and delays. A GAO report from July noted, 'DOD's hypersonic weapon development efforts are not fully implementing leading practices for product development, which we have found enable leading commercial companies to deliver products quickly.&rdquo; The military also lacks testing ranges and facilities for the advanced weapons&mdash;another area in which Feinberg could have unique insight. As a successful investor, he may be in a position to conquer bureaucratic and management-practice hurdles that have long slowed acquisition reform. But his experience also includes possible conflicts of interest. In 2017, when Feinberg was nominated to serve on Donald Trump's Presidential Advisory Board on Intelligence, the Project on Government Oversight noted that military logistics company DynCorp, which Cerberus acquired in 2010, posed a potential ethics problem. 'Mr. Feinberg owns a financial stake in a companies with national security-related contracts, notably DynCorp International, which could benefit from Mr. Feinberg's recommendations and actions. Lobbying disclosures show that defense contracting is a federal legislative and policy priority for Cerberus and DynCorp. The White House can prevent foreseeable ethics scandals,&rdquo; POGO noted in a letter. Cerberus sold DynCorp off in 2020. Additionally, a person familiar with the nomination told The Washington Post on Tuesday, 'Steve's obviously very aware of the Office of Government Ethics rules, and, of course, he went through the full assessment for his role with the intelligence advisory board. And so he knows exactly what he would need to do and will be prepared to be in full compliance with OGE rules and directions.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/12/could-trumps-pick-pentagon-no-2-accelerate-pentagons-hypersonic-efforts/401445/	2024-12-04T14:33:57-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/04/5070534/large.jpg
Army, Marine Corps want more ground vehicle simulators	ORLANDO, Fla.&mdash;When the Army introduces a new combat vehicle, like the $19 million M10 Bookers that began arriving earlier this year, its Test and Evaluation Command blows several of them up. The command's leader wants to know whether simulations might replace at least some of those expensive real-world tests. 'With the M10 Booker, it's one of the newest prototypes that we're testing. We destroy a number of M10 Bookers. It's very, very costly. Wouldn't it be nice if we had accurate models and sims?&rdquo; Maj. Gen. Patrick Gaydon said on Tuesday during a panel at Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference, or I/ITSEC. 'I'm not saying we get rid of live-fire testing. But it was really interesting a couple weeks ago when I saw that live-fire where we predicted how high the vehicle would jump off the ground, how much something would bend. And we were very, very close, based on models and sims. That should allow us to do fewer live-fire testing [events].&rdquo; Gaydon suggested that future operational tests might combine modeling and simulation with live fire. For the M10, that could mean using a platoon for the live operational test and having the rest of the unit up to the brigade level use constructed environments through linked test centers, he said. There's also the safety angle. At Aberdeen Proving Grounds, the Army's autonomous transport vehicle, which can be driven manually or unassisted, is being tested on tracks and through models and simulation. 'We're learning safety issues, throwing things at it that we just couldn't do in a live environment as many times as we can do in the model and sim,&rdquo; Gaydon said. [[Related Posts]] For the Marine Corps, simulations for ground vehicle systems operators used to be considered a luxury or 'nice to have&rdquo; option that could be eliminated in favor of keeping program costs low, Lt. Gen. Benjamin Watson, who leads the Corps' Training and Education Command, said during a keynote fireside on Tuesday. 'You could get away with that when you were talking about, you know, kind of old jeeps and five-ton trucks and things like that,&rdquo; Watson said. But that's no longer true with the systems the Marine Corps is fielding, from the amphibious combat vehicle to the advanced reconnaissance vehicle, which is set to replace the older light armored vehicle. 'That ARV, I mean, it's like an F-35 with wheels on the ground. It is a sensor platform, highly sophisticated, absolutely requires an integrated crew to operate. And if you just train the driver and then train the individual systems operators, you will never be able to maximize the opportunity of that platform,&rdquo; Watson said. 'We cannot just go out and do live force training to build proficiency&hellip;We might have been able to get away with that at some risk to force a long time ago, but we cannot afford that on any level right now.&rdquo; The need for solid simulators is compounded as services contend with recruiting and retention challenges and there's less room to absorb the extra costs that come with destroying vehicles during training. 'As the vehicles have become much more exquisite and expensive, we [can't] afford to lose the vehicles&hellip;because we can't replace them, either fiscally or from a technical production standpoint, nearly as fast,&rdquo; Watson said. Few recruits have driving experience before they enlist, which improved simulations could help fix. 'I don't know about you all, but the day I turned 16, I mean, I was standing in line with the DMV before they opened to get my driver's license. Now, an awful lot of young men and women come into our armed forces without any driver experience, so things like that also play into the importance of investment here,&rdquo; Watson said. But those ground vehicle simulators should be more than just a video game with a steering wheel, said Army Brig. Gen. Christine Beeler, the program executive officer for simulation, training, and instrumentation. They need to mimic physical driving environments with realistic haptic feedback that troops can feel and respond to. 'One of the products in our portfolio is the [Medical Simulation Training Center, or] MSTC trainer, and that's what helps our combat medics get certified in how to deal with an actual casualty,&rdquo; Beeler said. 'It's got mannequins that bleed and talk to you. And [using] the system provides all of that adrenaline rush that really stimulates the soldier in more than just the cerebral way; it gets to emotion and all of those things,&rdquo; she said. 'We've got to be able to take advantage of that and stress the environment, so that&hellip;the worst thing a soldier or a commander faces is in training.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/12/army-marine-corps-want-more-ground-vehicle-simulators/401437/	2024-12-04T12:24:39-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/04/8354141/large.jpg
The D Brief: Seoul’s six-hour self-coup; Trump’s SecArmy pick; Pa...	Martial law, revoked For six tense hours, South Korea experienced a self-coup brought about by an unpopular president Tuesday in Seoul. Police officers blockaded the National Assembly, and helicopters tried to prevent lawmakers from overturning President Yoon Suk Yeol's surprise declaration of martial law. But in the end, citizens joined lawmakers to protest the draconian measures and overturn Yoon's announcement of martial law in a unanimous vote that included members of Yoon's own party. Now what? Yoon is facing an impeachment motion, which could occur as early as Friday. '​​By law, an impeachment motion must be put to a vote between 24 and 72 hours after the motion is reported to a plenary session,&rdquo; South Korea's Yonhap reports. In terms of power dynamics, 'The main opposition Democratic Party, along with its allies, has at least 191 seats under its control,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reports. 'That means a handful of lawmakers from Yoon's ruling People Power Party will need to be persuaded to break ranks.&rdquo; Embarrassment, confusion. As the Guardian reported Tuesday, 'For the older generation who fought on the streets against military dictatorships, martial law equals dictatorship, not 21st century Korea. The younger generation is embarrassed that he has ruined their country's reputation. People are baffled.&rdquo; Historian reax: 'For the rest of the world, though, South Koreans' immediate and aggressive response to a man trying to take away their democratic rights is an inspiration,&rdquo; Heather Cox Richardson wrote Tuesday evening. 'Among other things, it illustrates that for all the claims that autocracy can react to events more quickly than democracy can, in fact autocrats are brittle. It is democracy that is determined and resilient.&rdquo; Welcome to this Wednesday edition of The D Brief, brought to you by Ben Watson and Bradley Peniston.

On this day in 1918, Woodrow Wilson became the first U.S. president to travel to Europe while in office when he began the nine-day journey aboard the USS George Washington for World War I peace talks in Versailles. Trump 2.0 New: The president-elect said he will nominate Daniel Driscoll to serve as Army secretary. Driscoll is a Ranger-qualified Iraq War veteran (with the 10th Mountain Division) who later graduated from law school at Yale. While at Yale, Driscoll received a grant to visit to U.S. military detention facilities at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba, as an observer. He later interned at the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs before working at law firms in New York, London, and Charlotte. On Wednesday, Trump praised Driscoll as 'a former Soldier, Investor, and Political Advisor&rdquo; who 'brings a powerful combination of experiences to serve as a disruptor and change agent.&rdquo; Read more, here. Developing: Could Trump replace his current SecDef pick with Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis? It's under consideration, say the Washington Post, the Associated Press and others. DeSantis served for five years on active duty and was a former Navy JAG officer with deployments to Iraq and Cuba. As he said in August of last year, 'I learned in the military, I was assigned with U.S. Navy SEALs in Iraq, that you focus on the mission above all else, you can't get distracted. So Republicans, we've got to look forward and we've got to make sure that we're bringing the message that can win in November of 2024.&rdquo; Another reason Trump may be eyeing DeSantis: The Florida governor is responsible for flying about 50 primarily Venezuelan asylum seekers from San Antonio, Texas, to the largely Democratic community of Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts back in September 2022. Those asylum seekers were later processed at a military base on nearby Cape Cod, where they were supported with lodging and dining facilities by the Massachusetts National Guard. But DeSantis used the episode to falsely claim Democrats ordered the U.S. military to 'deport&rdquo; the asylum seekers. Conservatives have resurrected those false allegations in the lead-up to Trump's inauguration, writing on social media that Democrats 'Called in the National Guard to deport 50 illegals out of Martha's Vineyard to a military base within 48 hours of their arrival.&rdquo; While the claim is not true, it is likely that we will hear it again; Trump is expected to pursue his campaign promise of deporting potentially millions of people from the country using the U.S. military, if necessary. By the way: Trump's first pick to lead the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, is refusing to step down as scrutiny on Capitol Hill intensifies following reports of his alleged misdeeds over the past decade, including several bouts of drunkenness described in a profile published Sunday in The New Yorker. 'I'm doing this for the warfighters, not the warmongers,&rdquo; Hegseth wrote Wednesday on Elon Musk's website X. 'The Left is afraid of disrupters and change agents,&rdquo; he said. 'They are afraid of @realDonaldTrump&mdash;and me. So they smear w/ fake, anonymous sources & BS stories. They don't want truth. Our warriors never back down, & neither will I.&rdquo; The Hill has more on the growing news reports complicating Hegseth's nomination. ICYMI: Trump tapped Kash Patel to replace FBI Director Christopher Wray. CNN calls it 'an extraordinary move that would put a self-described enemy of the so-called deep state as the head of the nation's top law enforcement agency &mdash; a role that would give Patel power to carry out Trump's threats to go after his political opponents.&rdquo; Bio: A former junior prosecutor at the Justice Department, Patel served as chief of staff to Christopher Miller, Trump's final acting defense secretary. He also worked to discredit investigations into the ties between Trumpworld and Russia, efforts that the president-elect cited in his Saturday announcement. As FBI chief, Patel would oversee counterintelligence operations on U.S. soil. His qualifications for that, according to his official DOD bio, include service as principal deputy to the acting Director of National Intelligence and as senior counsel for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. This just in: Iranian hackers recently obtained some of Patel's communications, a source tells CNN. Update: After a delay, Trump opts for conventional FBI screenings. President-elect Trump has reached an agreement with the Biden administration's Justice Department that will allow his transition team to submit names for background checks and security clearances, Government Executive's Eric Katz reported Tuesday. The screenings, typically conducted by the FBI, are normally a routine part of the transition process, but Trump had dragged his feet in signing a memorandum of understanding. His team had floated the possibility of sidestepping the FBI background checks altogether, suggesting it would instead use private-sector investigators, but ultimately decided to go the more conventional route. Why bring it up: Some lawmakers and observers had raised concerns that Trump would put government information at risk and generate other security concerns if he did not put his landing team members and nominees through the formal screening process, Katz writes. Next up (maybe): Trump's nominees are also required to engage with the Office of Government Ethics to resolve any conflicts of interest. His team has not yet indicated if it will complete those steps. Read more, here. Trump's team of advisors have (the contours of) a plan for Ukraine's future, Reuters reported Wednesday. However, Ukraine's leaders might not like it very much since the plan involves territorial concessions to Russia and removing possible NATO membership from any negotiations with Kyiv's leaders. Looming over all of this: 'Trump repeatedly pledged during his election campaign to end the nearly three-year-old conflict within 24 hours of his Jan. 20 inauguration, if not before then, but has yet to say how,&rdquo; Reuters writes. Other ideas include trying to implement a 'demilitarized zone&rdquo; inside occupied Ukraine, according to remarks from Vice President-elect JD Vance in September. Another person close to Trump, his former Ambassador to Germany Richard Grennell suggested 'autonomous zones&rdquo; could be created inside occupied eastern Ukraine in order to appease Vladimir Putin of Russia. 'Grenell was one of the few people at a September meeting in New York between Trump and Zelenskiy,&rdquo; Reuters reports. Said one former U.S. intelligence officer: 'I don't think anybody has any realistic plan for ending this.&rdquo; Read more, here. Etc. Eighteen ways Palantir wants the Pentagon to change.

Lockheed braces for new administration as Musk targets F-35	F-35 prime contractor Lockheed Martin is preparing for defense-spending changes under the incoming Trump administration, the company's top financial officer said Tuesday. 'I would expect, over time, that there will be different priorities in this administration,&rdquo; Lockheed CFO Jay Malave said at the UBS Global Industrials & Transportation Conference. 'It typically happens, [that] the administration prioritizes things that maybe the prior one didn't. I think the good thing about Lockheed Martin is that we're accustomed to that. We know how to operate in that environment and how to adjust quickly.&rdquo; Elon Musk, a key adviser of President-elect Donald Trump and co-leader of an effort to cut government waste, tore into Lockheed's F-35 program last week, calling the jet obsolete in the age of drones. Musk also tweeted a video of Chinese drones, saying 'Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35.&rdquo; Malave said some defense programs will feel the pinch, but the company doesn't have much visibility into what the upcoming administration could cut. 'With government efficiency, you could see elements of addition by subtraction, so ultimately, you could see a higher budget a request than what we've seen from the prior administration, but it could be as a result of some things either being curtailed or canceled, and other things being prioritized,&rdquo; Malave said. 'Until we get that visibility, it's really hard to speculate on what we'll see.&rdquo; It remains to be seen how much influence Musk will have on the F-35 program, and whether Congress will approve deep program cuts. Lockheed and the F-35 program office recently reached a handshake deal on the next two F-35 production lots&mdash;18 and 19&mdash;but that deal might not be finalized until after the new administration takes the helm. [[Related Posts]] The handshake deal is 'a very positive sign,&rdquo; Malave said, but the company still hasn't obtained the undefinitized contract that would allow money to start flowing to Lockheed while final details are negotiated. The company has had to front the cash to keep the production line running as negotiations have dragged on. Prolonged negotiations kept Lockheed from collecting $700 million in the last quarter, the company said in October. And until the contract is finalized, the company's financial results will be hit. 'We still don't have that undefinitized contract option finalized yet. So we're still working with our customer to do that, and the impacts will remain the same. If we weren't able to do that by the end of the year, you're looking at a couple billion dollars of revenue associated profit and a billion dollars plus of cash flow,&rdquo; Malave said. Malave said he's 'bullish&rdquo; the undefinitized contract will come by the end of the year. The jets in lots 18 and 19 will be more expensive than previous lots because of inflation and new technology, Malave said, reversing the trend of declining F-35 costs. The company is also still reeling from a year-long F-35 delivery pause caused by problems with an upgrade package called Technology Refresh-3. Lockheed will absorb $600 million this year due to fewer deliveries and the Pentagon's decision to withhold money from the company until the full upgrade is complete. The company will earn back that money 'over the next few years,&rdquo; Malave said, and could recover $400 million of it in 2025.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/12/lockheed-braces-new-administration-musk-targets-f-35/401417/	2024-12-03T17:24:13-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/03/8778162/large.jpg

President-elect Trump has reached an agreement with the Biden administration's Justice Department that will allow his transition team to submit names for background checks and security clearances. The screenings, typically conducted by the FBI, are normally a routine part of the transition process but Trump had dragged his feet in signing a memorandum of understanding. His team had floated the possibility of sidestepping the FBI background checks altogether, suggesting it would instead use private-sector investigators, but ultimately decided to go the more conventional route. A Justice official confirmed that the MOU was signed but did not offer details of the agreement. Last week, Trump signed a different MOU with the White House that enables his transition operation to send 'landing teams&rdquo; into agencies throughout government, completing an agreement that is typically signed in October. That memo still bypassed many of the steps that normally take place during the transition period. Trump's transition team said the MOU with Justice marked the next step in preparing senior administration officials to serve under Trump and would allow for a smoother operation for its landing teams. People serving on those teams must be disclosed to the Biden administration and receive clearance to enter federal buildings. It will also allow them easier access to government information as they 'prepare for leadership of federal agencies,' Trump's team added. 'This agreement with the Department of Justice will ensure President Trump and his team are ready on Day 1 to begin enacting the America First agenda that an overwhelming majority* of our nation supported on Election Day,&rdquo; said Susie Wiles, Trump's White House chief of staff-designate. Some lawmakers and observers had raised concerns that Trump would put government information at risk and generate other security concerns if he did not put his landing team members and nominees through the formal screening process. His campaign previously said it had concerns about Justice's impartiality. The actual adjudication of whether to award a clearance is defined in statute as a governmental function and typically carried out at the agency level or, for presidential aides and staffers, the White House Office of Security. Trump could opt to supersede that process and award clearances to any of his aides or nominees. The president-elect's team has opted out of an ethics agreement with the General Services Administration, instead relying on agreements it set up internally that are now posted to GSA's website. Trump's nominees are also required to engage with the Office of Government Ethics to resolve any conflicts of interest. His team has not yet indicated if it will complete those steps. * Editor's note: Trump received 49.97% of the popular vote; Kamala Harris, 48.36%.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/12/trump-opts-conventional-doj-screenings-nominees-transition-team-members/401416/	2024-12-03T17:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/03/12032024Trump-1/large.jpg
What game theory says about a MAGA military	What should be made of Donald Trump's avowed longing for senior military officers who will do his bidding without question? To answer that, we must contemplate a scenario rarely considered by civil-military theorists, let alone military officers themselves: a U.S. president who gives orders that are not obviously illegal yet which undermine democratic norms. In game-theory terms, a president's orders are generally viewed as either lawful or unlawful, and the military's proper role is generally quite clear: all lawful orders should be followed; no unlawful orders should be followed. This creates a simple two-move game with four possible outcomes: Lawful orders &rarr; Military obeys. Lawful orders &rarr; Military challenges. Unlawful orders &rarr; Military obeys. Unlawful orders &rarr; Military challenges. Even this basic frame reveals gaps in our common discussions of the subject. Scholars and practitioners generally assume that U.S. presidents issue only lawful orders and that a professional military will almost always obey orders. The only source of real anxiety concerns unpopular personnel matters where the military subtly resists political guidance. The most alarming scenario&mdash;Outcome 3, where the military obeys unlawful orders&mdash;is viewed as so extraordinarily unlikely that it is simply not debated in the American context. Moreover, this simple frame does not account for the possibility of orders that are legal on their face yet corrosive to the rule of law. Such orders would break long-established norms, but Trump's track record shows the world to be far more permissive of rule-bending than we have assumed. So let us consider how the civil-military game changes when we introduce a middle position for the president to play. Let us say now that the president has three moves: white (clearly lawful and appropriate orders), gray (orders that are not clearly unlawful, but which place considerable stress on democratic norms), and black (unlawful orders). And let us further say that the military retains its two moves: white (follows orders) and black (refuses to follow orders). Now picture the military as a grid of one hundred tiles. Each time that the president issues white orders, the tiles stay white if the military obeys, but turn black if the military challenges. Every time that the president issues either gray or black orders, the tile turns black if the military obeys, but white if the military challenges. Let us say that 5 percent of the American armed forces are Trump loyalists who will break the law if directed by Trump do so. Picture these as five black tiles randomly placed among the 95 white tiles. If Trump only issues clearly lawful or clearly unlawful orders, we can assume that the ratio of white to black will remain consistent, with a 95-percent tendency toward obeying lawful orders and challenging unlawful orders, and things will remain as they are. Figure 1: 5% Trump Loyalists If, however, Trump begins to issue gray orders, the tiles will start to flip in unpredictable ways, based on how individual officers balance their feeling of obligation to follow orders against their understanding of their responsibility to democratic society. If we assume that 95 percent of officers will choose to challenge gray orders, then after a round of gray orders has been issued throughout the armed forces, the total number of black tiles will still double, since the Trump loyalists will be joined by the 5 percent of rule-followers. Figure 2: Trump Loyalists plus Rule-Followers after one round of gray orders Finally, let us add in the effect of Trump firing loyalists who challenge his gray orders, which we can visualize as the conversion of one tile to black per round. By firing those who consistently challenge his gray orders, he will both embolden his supporters and intimidate those who might prefer the conservative strategy of obeying orders over the riskier strategy of challenging them. We can picture this additional chilling effect as a decrease in the likelihood of challenging gray orders, so let us revise that estimate down to 90 percent after this first round. After nine rounds of gray orders, half the tiles will have turned black. Figure 3: Trump Loyalists plus Rule-Followers after nine rounds of gray orders In the scenario I have described, the endgame for American democracy can play out by the compounding effect of waves of anti-democratic guidance that only a small faction of officers actually follow at any one time. Notably, this accords with the political philosopher V&aacute;clav Havel's theory of the power of the powerless: concessions to corrupt power, even begrudgingly made, nevertheless contributes to the normalization of that corruption. Military officers have an aversion to challenging orders; to actively resist corrupt orders is exceptionally difficult. My estimate that 95 percent of officers would challenge gray orders is probably high. Let us review my assumptions. I have assumed that Trump, recognizing that personal control over the DOD would give him exceptional coercive power and virtually unlimited material resources, will be tempted to corrupt the military by leading officers to break with democratic norms. And I have assumed that in doing so, Trump will use his usual strategy of trial-and-error, probing to find places where he can convince others to break norms in order to act in his interests and demonstrate loyalty. I have also made four assumptions about the military's reactions: Five percent of officers would follow clearly illegal orders by Trump; 95 percent of officers would resist orders that they feel are a threat to democratic norms but which they do not believe to be illegal; Trump would be willing to fire 1 percent of the officer corps for challenging his anti-democratic norms in any given round; and after an initial round of mass firings, the willingness to resist anti-democratic orders would decrease to 90 percent. Finally, I have assumed that once corrupted, officers stay corrupted. These assumptions are merely notional, and should be subjected to proper analysis. In the coming four years, America's officer corps may be faced with a difficult challenge: to resist the temptation to obey orders that should be challenged. It seems likely that this will come in the form of waves, with the transgressiveness increasing as larger numbers become accustomed to breaking norms. The only move for the military to play, in this scenario, is to challenge inappropriate orders&mdash;the very thing that officers are trained not to do. The military is now on the horns of a dilemma. Twisting one way imperils its tradition of obedience of elected officials. Twisting the other risks making it a willing accomplice to the end of American democracy.

Eighteen ways Palantir wants the Pentagon to change	The Defense Department is a sclerotic monopsony whose communist approach to acquisition has the United States on a precipice, writes Palantir's chief technology officer, who prescribes a 'painful&rdquo; but 'necessary&rdquo; reformation based on competition and software. 'I think we're just scratching the surface,&rdquo; said Shyam Sankar, whose company calls itself the first software prime contractor. 'The other huge opportunity is really on using AI to drive efficiencies,&rdquo; including using technology to supplant human workers and processes that slow innovation and adoption. Sankar recently penned 18 theses that could reform how the Pentagon does business, in explicit comparison to Martin Luther's criticisms of the Catholic Church. He highlights several well-documented problems often studied by congressionally mandated commissions&mdash;such as a belabored budgeting-and-planning process, the perils of requirements, and how cost-plus contracts remove incentives to innovate. The 18-page document also manages to say the quiet part out loud, demanding the Pentagon and Congress to change its practices with colorful curtness. One of Sankar's main themes is the need for competition&mdash;whether it's companies vying for Pentagon contracts or customers in the Defense Department looking for solutions. He also criticizes a system whose major suppliers sell only to the Pentagon and other militaries. 'Chinese primes only earn 30-40% of their revenue from the PLA; the remainder is commercial. Those cheap products your neighbor is buying on Amazon are subsidizing lethality which could be used against our men and women in uniform, much the same way that during the Cold War your purchase of an American car, camera, and cereal subsidized America's lethality against her enemies,&rdquo; he wrote. Instead, Sankar writes, the Pentagon should vastly accelerate its purchases from largely commercial companies&mdash;like SpaceX, whose CEO Elon Musk has been tapped to lead a Trump administration government-efficiency drive. In September, Palantir's stock joined the S&P 500, increasing software and tech companies' share of the index. In recent weeks, Palantir's market value of $137 billion edged out Lockheed Martin's. Defense One spoke with Sankar. What are Palantir's goals for 2025, especially amid a new administration? Our government business has re-accelerated dramatically. We're pretty excited about the product road maps that we've built. [Maven Smart System has] become the [Joint All Domain Command and Control] MVP. It's getting a huge amount of adoption, so we're pretty excited about that, and continue to invest in that. What defense areas will you expand into? I think we're just scratching the surface. So I mean, a big focus, obviously, Maven is at the pointy end of integrating AI into the kill chain. So how do you do that across all the services? It's coming down from OSD right now. The Army has started to adopt it&hellip;and the opportunities for that to happen with the [maritime operations centers] with the Navy and with the [air operations centers] with the Air Force, that are definitely top of mind. [We're] continuing to push into space&hellip;we're at the very beginning of that. And then the other huge opportunity is really on using AI to drive efficiencies. There's more civilians in the DOD than there are uniformed service members. There are more acquisition professionals than there are Marines. And so have we just crushed ourselves with process? And I'm sure most of that process is needed, but can we use AI agents instead of humans to drive efficiency and speed through that? We've been able to automate the foreign-disclosure process, where it used to take humans three days to collect intelligence and then rewrite it to be releasable to partners, taking that down to three minutes. So the obvious benefit there is lethality and being able to share with allies and partners. But I think the other part of it is it just makes for a much leaner force. If you look at [Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology] report on Maven. With Maven, you can perform targeting operations with 20 people that used to take us 2,000 people in Iraq. So that sort of efficiency really drives the ability to hide in a pure conflict. You're much smaller, [there's a] much smaller footprint, less support infrastructure, and [that] drives lethality. Would shrinking the Pentagon workforce, particularly on the civilian side, actually drive efficiency? It does in the U.S. commercial market every single day. We automated [an] insurance underwriting process where one of America's largest insurers, with 78 AI agents, took a process that used to take three weeks down to hours. We have this challenge in government, generally&mdash;it's not just the Department of Defense&mdash;where we view people as abundant, and technology is unaffordable and expensive. But that's the exact opposite of how the commercial world looks at technology. They view people as very expensive, and technology as cheap as the way of achieving efficiency and effectiveness. I think a lot of that is because of the monopsony. That's what really speaks to the heart of the 'Defense Reformation.&rdquo; Like, why do we have the system we have? Well, I don't envy the position of being the department; being the sole buyer for a thing is very hard. At some very fundamental level, you believe in free markets or you don't. And what we have is a centrally, unplanned process. So it's like the worst of communism, really: a central planning process is not actually planned. We have a [Future Years Defense Program] that takes five years, two years to do [program objection memorandum]&mdash;you can't really change your mind anywhere along there. You're gonna have unitary efforts: we have one F-35 for three services. I'm not sure we should have 30 years on $2 trillion. When we were building submarine-launched ballistic missiles under [Vice Adm. William] Raborn in the [1960s], we had four competing programs running concurrently. Today, we look at that and we say, &lsquo;Oh, isn't that wasteful?' But actually, CBO zone analysis shows that it was cheaper and faster because we had competition. And we've gotten too fixated, since the end of the Cold War, on how much competition is there in the industrial base. That's not actually the problem. The problem is there's not enough competition inside of government. Will Congress go along? Absolutely. I mean, I don't want to be too Pollyannaish about it, but I think Congress recognizes it's part of the problem. I think what makes it really hard is they do have an actual oversight function to perform. So how do you balance the need for oversight with the necessary maneuver room that you're going to need when you're doing something innovative? That's just reality. If I think about all the projects in the company that I'm overseeing, I have to give folks the room to pivot, to change, to move. I think some of the recommendations coming out of the PPBE Commission are exactly right, like a capability element approach. Rather than a program-element approach, we're going to resource counter-UAS as a category and you're going to have the freedom and flexibility to move and adapt within that. If making a change, if changing your mind, if reacting to new data is major brain damage and requires things to go up and down the building up and down the Capitol Hill, you're not going to make changes, which means you're just going to accumulate error. Because the only thing you know for sure is that whatever plan you came up with yesterday is wrong today. The question is: can you fix it every single day as you observe that error, or can you just let all that error accumulate? And our five-year FYDP, our two-year POM&mdash;how we oversee these things is not fit for the moment. What do you most want the Pentagon and Congress to hear? The first one is that monopsony is the problem. You can look at your industrial base as a monopsonist. You get the industrial base you deserve. It really is all your fault. So you have to change your behaviors, what you're incentivizing and how you're organizing yourself to get what you need. Stop blaming the prime, stop thinking like some process is going to fix this. We need to approximate market forces as much as possible. 'We need more competition inside of government&rdquo; would be the pithy way of saying it. The second one is that cost-plus makes us dumber, poorer, and slower. The only two industries that do cost-plus are general contractors on remodels and the government. I don't know if you've done a remodel before, but are you happy with how that went and the price predictability and the timelines and stuff? It's just not the way to do these things. You've already lost by thinking about requirements to begin with. Share the problems with a competitive American market and let them come to you with solutions and then buy the best ones you like. Buy multiple if you want, but you're going to have to rely on the American industrial base, not the defense industrial base to provide compounding price performance. And you see that with the SpaceX example. It used to cost $50,000 per kilogram to get to orbit with the shuttle program. With Starship Heavy reuse, it's $10 to $20 per kilogram&mdash;not missing any zeros there. You can't get that with cost-plus, you can only get that because Elon [Musk] cares about getting to Mars. But ​​the DoD is kind of a unique customer. It has specific needs, like lethality and security. But that's really a response from our present world. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, only 6 percent of [Pentagon spending on major weapons] went to defense primes. The rest went to dual-purpose companies. Chrysler built cars and missiles. Ford built satellites. Until 1990, General Mills, the cereal company, built torpedoes and artillery. So we had a very different American economy, where people were invested not only in economic prosperity, but also in freedom. And this is important, because commercial innovation drives price-performance improvements. You just can't see anywhere else. If you work at a car company in America and you're not able to decrease price for 4% a year, you're gonna get fired, you know. iIn the industrial base and the defense industrial base, if prices aren't increasing all the time, people would be shocked. So, like, the fundamental mechanisms are missing. And I think the reason we have what we have is that when we lost competition; when the Berlin Wall fell down, we didn't have a pure competitor anymore. The Soviets were basically done, and we went from 6 percent spending on unique defense primes to 86 percent today. It's not that I'm saying the products are dual-use, like missiles are single-use, but the companies are dual-purpose. I built the Operation Warp Speed supply chain for the U.S. government in two weeks because two years earlier, I had solved a structurally similar problem for BP and oil and gas production. Anything else? The most important thing is: 'How did we get here?&rdquo; We are in this state of undeclared emergency. We've lost deterrence as the West in the world, we've spent trillions of dollars. And how did we get here? My argument to you is really this: we went from spending 94% of our money on dual-purpose companies to creating a unique class of defense specialists that we put on the Galapagos Islands, and we created a great schism between commercial innovation and defense. And that has made our country much less safe, much less innovative. It's created many of these problems, and we did that because of the nature of monopsony. And the answer is to fix that. That's where it starts.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/12/eighteen-ways-palantir-wants-pentagon-change/401400/	2024-12-03T12:07:41-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/03/GettyImages_2152090800/large.jpg
How did Hayat Tahrir al-Sham come to prominence in Syria’s civil ...	A major offensive has seen rebel groups in Syria retake the country's second city, Aleppo&ndash; and demonstrated the growing prominence of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in the 13-year-long civil war. The surprise advance was led by members of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, fighting alongside Turkish-backed groups opposing the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. While the offensive &ndash; the most significant fighting in recent years &ndash; may be the first time that many outside of Syria have heard of the Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has been growing in reputation and capabilities over a number of years. As an expert on the behavior of Islamist militant groups in the region, I have watched Hayat Tahrir al-Sham evolve from an offshoot of al-Qaida in Syria into a formidable player in the ongoing conflict. It followed a significant shift in the group's strategic operations that has seen it become less concerned with global jihad and more focused on attaining power in Syria. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has its roots in the early stages of the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011 as a popular uprising against the autocratic government of Assad. The group originated as an offshoot of the Nusra Front, the official al-Qaida affiliate in Syria. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham was initially recognized for its combat effectiveness and its commitment to global jihadist ideology, or the establishment of strict Islamic rule across the Muslim world. In a pivotal shift in 2016 under the leadership of Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani, the Nusra Front publicly cut ties with al-Qaida and adopted the new name Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, which means 'Front for the Conquest of the Levant.&rdquo; The following year, it merged with several other factions in the Syrian war to become Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or the 'Organization for the Liberation of the Levant.&rdquo; This rebranding aimed to move away from al-Qaida's global jihadist agenda, which had limited the group's appeal within Syria. It allowed Hayat Tahrir al-Sham to focus on issues specific to Syrians, such as local governance, economic issues and humanitarian aid. Despite these changes, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's core ideology continues to be rooted in jihadism, with the primary objective of overthrowing the Assad government and establishing Islamic rule in Syria. This strategic shift was partly born of pragmatism. To keep power over the territories it controlled, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leaders concluded the group needed to minimize international opposition and effectively integrate into the broader Syrian revolutionary movement. In other words, it needed to balance its radical Islamist origins with the demands of local governance and political engagement. Since 2017, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has been the prevailing force in Idlib, the final significant rebel stronghold in Syria. Over the years, the group has solidified its control in the region by functioning as a quasi-governmental entity, providing civil services and overseeing local affairs, despite reports of human rights abuses. In recent years, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's propaganda has emphasized protecting Syrian territory and its people from the Assad government. This has helped the group enhance its position among local communities and other rebel groups. In an effort to further burnish its image, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has ramped up its public relations efforts, both at home and abroad. For example, it has engaged with international media and humanitarian organizations to negotiate &ndash; and film &ndash; aid deliveries to the areas it governs. These initiatives showcase a commitment to civilian welfare and distance the group from the violence typically associated with jihadist movements. The recent military offensive, during which Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-led rebels swiftly captured significant parts of Aleppo and pushed toward the city of Hama, marks another significant strategic pivot. It signals a revitalization of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's military objectives and its ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's thinking in launching an advance now has likely been influenced by a blend of regional and local dynamics. The Assad government's increasing vulnerability has become evident of late, marked by economic deterioration and corruption. Many areas in Syria remain only nominally under state control, and the central government is heavily reliant on support from allies such as Russia and Iran. These allies, however, have been preoccupied by their respective conflicts against Ukraine and Israel, potentially diluting their support for Syria. Compounding Assad's weakness are the diminishing capacities of Hezbollah and Iranian forces. Both have been crucial in propping up Assad throughout the civil war. But Israeli strikes in Lebanon, Syria and Iran have potentially weakened Hezbollah and Iran's ability to support Syria. And this reduction in support may have tipped the military balance in the civil war toward opposition groups. Moreover, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and other rebel groups are facing a Syrian military hit by low morale, high desertion rates and inadequate military equipment. Disarray among government forces has made it difficult for Assad to respond effectively to the renewed assault by opposition forces. In contrast, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has bolstered its military capabilities. Having survived various military campaigns, the group has consolidated power and professionalized its forces. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has established a military academy, reorganized its units into a more conventional military structure, and created specialized forces adept at executing coordinated and strategic attacks &ndash; as evidenced by the recent advance in Aleppo. Moreover, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has managed to gain some local support by positioning itself as a defender of Sunni Muslim interests. The inability to find a political solution to the Syrian crisis has only fueled local resentment to the Assad government, creating a supportive base for any force that actively opposes the regime. With growing support on the ground, a more professional military and a political wing focused on governance, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has evolved from a jihadist offshoot into a major player in Syria &ndash; a development that has huge implications for the internal dynamics of the war-torn country.

The D Brief: Seoul declares martial law; Biden rushes to arm Ukra...	48 days to arm Kyiv The Biden administration is racing to send weapons to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20. An estimated $725 million in arms was announced Monday, including 'substantial quantities of artillery, rockets, and air defense capabilities,&rdquo; National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement. There are two sources of military aid totaling nearly $10 billion still available to Ukraine, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Monday. That includes 'the remainder of the Security Assistance Initiative funding, which is approximately $2.21 billion,&rdquo; and there's still $6.8 billion in presidential drawdown authority yet to be distributed. The PDA support is usually delivered much faster than SAI funding because 'the Defense Department already has the articles or services in-hand,&rdquo; the State Department said in a statement Monday. When asked if the U.S. can distribute that much in such a short time, Ryder didn't answer directly. 'We understand the urgent situation in Ukraine and the president's direction and will continue to do everything we can to ensure that Ukraine is getting the aid that it needs.&rdquo; White House: 'Between now and mid-January, we will deliver hundreds of thousands of additional artillery rounds, thousands of additional rockets, and other critical capabilities to help Ukraine defend its freedom and independence,&rdquo; Sullivan said. It's all part of a 'surge&rdquo; in Congressionally-authorized military aid first announced in September that's intended 'to put Ukrainian forces in the strongest possible position before [Biden] leaves office,&rdquo; said Sullivan. 'The bottom line is: at the president's direction, we will spend every dollar that Congress has appropriated for Ukraine and to replenish our stockpiles,&rdquo; Ryder said. Zelenskyy's peace pivot: Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy is reportedly floating a slightly different approach toward a possible future settlement with Russia over invaded territory inside Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. The old and the new: 'For most of the war, Zelensky had insisted that his country would keep fighting until it had reclaimed the roughly 20% of the country now under Moscow's control,&rdquo; the Journal writes. But 'Now, Zelensky is suggesting that he could accept a cease-fire that effectively would leave occupied territory in Moscow's hands if the rest of Ukraine were given protection by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.&rdquo; The big problem for Zelenskyy: NATO members appear to be in no particular hurry to admit Ukraine into the Russia-focused alliance, which treats an attack on one member as an attack on all. That dynamic that could quickly engulf most of Europe in a possible continent-wide war with the most nuclear-armed nation on the planet, should Russia decide to press a new invasion further into Ukraine after a settlement is reached. NATO reax: 'The main issue with Ukraine has to be, &lsquo;How do we get more military aid into Ukraine?' That's priority number one, two and three,&rdquo; alliance Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Monday, which was not exactly a warm reception to Zelenskyy's proposal. One notable wrinkle for Russia: 'The ruble has tumbled recently, pushing up inflation and interest rates and further crimping the parts of the economy not dedicated to defense,&rdquo; the Journal reports. Related reading: 'NATO's chief avoids talk of Ukraine's membership.

Mideast developments Now might be a good time to review who exactly is HTS, aka Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the militant group that led a rebel advance on Syria's northwestern city of Aleppo late last week. Pentagon spox Pat Ryder: HTS was 'formerly known as Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria. But [the] bottom line is [they are] still a designated terrorist organization,&rdquo; Ryder told reporters Monday. HTS is led by a 42-year-old insurgent veteran named Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani, whose name longtime Defense One readers will recognize from the first few years of the Syrian Civil War, and for the group's durability in the nearly 14 years since it began. In short, Jawlani was born Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, and later 'adopted the nom de guerre of Jawlani, a reference to his family's roots in the Golan Heights that Israel seized from Syria in 1967,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported in a profile on Monday. 'The militant leader broke with Islamic State in 2012. He cut ties with al Qaeda in 2016, and since then he has fought both organizations in bloody campaigns.&rdquo; Jawlani is allegedly not interested in international jihad. 'Instead of the banner of Islam, HTS troops choose to fight under the Syrian flag that dates back to the republic that existed before the 1963 Baath Party revolution that eventually brought the Assad family to power,&rdquo; the Journal reports. 'Jawlani is not a cleric, he is a politician who is ready to strike deals and is very compromising on a lot of things&mdash;except fighting against the regime. Don't underestimate this guy's ambition,&rdquo; one expert advised. Former Army general reax: The fact that Syria's resistance 'appears to be spearheaded by HTS is yet another reminder of something we learned many times during the war-on-terror,&rdquo; that is 'that the single richest &lsquo;growth medium' for violent extremism is anywhere a population loses faith in its own government,&rdquo; Mike Nagata, a retired Army three-star, told Defense One's Patrick Tucker on Monday. 'The Syrian people today, in places like Aleppo, hate their government more than any other predation they must suffer,&rdquo; with the Syrian people viewing 'a violent Islamist group [as] preferable to Assad,&rdquo; Nagata said.

Proposed rule would bar sale of Americans' financial data to adve...	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Tuesday proposed a long-anticipated rule that would require data brokers to comply with credit bureau reporting standards, in an effort to prevent Americans' financial data from being obtained by foreign rivals and cybercriminals that may use the information for intelligence gathering and exploitation. The rule would lodge data brokers under a new compliance definition that would, in essence, direct them to follow the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It would also require those brokers to institute protections for personal identifiers used in credit reports &mdash; such as income or a FICO score &mdash; and mandate explicit consumer consent for sharing credit data. The proposal &mdash; first floated in April by agency chief Rohit Chopra &mdash; was born out of an executive order signed by President Joe Biden earlier this year, which was focused on preventing Americans' sensitive personal data from falling into the hands of foreign adversaries. The Fair Credit Reporting Act was enacted in 1970 to ensure accuracy, fairness and privacy in the collection and use of consumer credit information. It grants consumers rights to access and dispute their credit reports, limits who can access this data and regulates credit reporting agencies with enforcement by the federal government and state attorneys general. The data broker industry collects and sells detailed information about individuals and packages their everyday habits and behaviors into data points that are used for targeted advertising, credit scoring, risk assessments and other commercial matters. The CFPB contends that national security threats against the U.S. would increase if such data were to be obtained by nation-state spies or cybercrime operatives. The dynamic also presents personal safety risks for vulnerable populations, law enforcement, judges and domestic violence survivors, whose sensitive information can be easily purchased and misused, the agency argued. 'Today's proposed rule is a major step forward to ensure that companies trafficking in Americans' most sensitive information face real consequences for violating long-standing law and for putting people and our country at risk,&rdquo; CFPB head Rohit Chopra said in a news conference with reporters. The Biden administration is seeking to prohibit transactions that data brokers make to 'countries of concern&rdquo; on grounds that such data can be surreptitiously processed by foreign hackers or spies, enabling myriad national security risks and exposing American citizens to surveillance, blackmail and other privacy violations. A separate DOJ rulemaking proposal tied to the executive order was released in October. A coalition of former officials and groups representing federal employees and military servicemembers last month pressed CFPB to adequately address national security risks tied to the collection, aggregation and sale of Americans' personal data by data brokers. 'The sale of Americans' financial data is particularly valuable to malicious actors, because it provides exploitable insights &mdash; that in some cases, are not found elsewhere &mdash; into personal debts, gambling problems, marital fissures, overseas bank accounts, and other sensitive matters that can be opportunities for blackmail, pressure, and recruitment,&rdquo; wrote the group. A CFPB official, who spoke on background per agency-set guidelines, said that sensitive financial data could be used to target victims more precisely. For instance, a U.S. military member with a low credit score may be targeted with a phishing email, aiming to trick them into handing over data that may improve their creditworthiness, when in reality, the scam would steal their personal information or classified workplace assets. 'The CFPB developed this proposed rule based on extensive market monitoring that revealed widespread evasion of consumer protections,&rdquo; the agency said in a press release Tuesday. 'The agency found that data brokers routinely sidestep the [Fair Credit Reporting Act] by claiming they aren't subject to its requirements &mdash; even while selling the very types of sensitive personal and financial information Congress intended the law to protect.&rdquo; An investigation last month revealed that practically anyone could purchase data that maps the day-to-day patterns of U.S. military servicemembers and intelligence analysts in Germany, as well as contractors that worked on-site at sensitive locations. Last year, Duke University researchers said they were able to purchase reams of sensitive data on American servicemembers and their families for as little as 12 cents per record. Myriad hacking incidents over the past decade have exposed the personal data of federal employees, military members and ordinary Americans. An infamous breach of the Office of Personnel Management that surfaced in 2015 helped galvanize attention to the issue after hackers pilfered data on millions of current and former federal workers. A well-documented 2017 hack at Equifax also compromised the data of some 150 million Americans and received harsh congressional oversight. It was later attributed to Chinese nation-state operatives. The agency is seeking comments on the proposed rule before March 3 of next year, requiring the incoming GOP administration to oversee its implementation after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. The CFPB official said there is 'broad bipartisan recognition that data brokers pose real dangers, both to Americans' privacy and to national security.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/12/us-proposes-rule-prevent-sale-financial-data-foreign-adversaries/401380/	2024-12-03T06:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/02/120224dataNG-1/large.jpg
New AI tool for air defense takes on advanced missiles and drone ...	A new AI tool from GDIC that quickly fuses data from multiple air-defense sensors could transform how militaries defend against emerging aerial threats such as hypersonic missiles and drone swarms. The proliferation of drones and highly maneuverable missiles has made conventional air defense targeting difficult and increased the complexity of threats from the air. But advances in technology have also resulted in a wider range of data&mdash;from radar, satellites, or drones&mdash;to inform and help defenders better spot incoming threats. The challenge is to collect all of that data, even in places where adversaries will be trying to jam communications, quickly analyze and integrate it, and send it back to give the operators on the ground enough time to take action. GDIC tested their Defense Operations Grid-Mesh Accelerator, or DOGMA, tool against that problem at the military's TREX event in August. DOGMA ingests available data about what's coming from the network of sensors and looks across all the available communication paths to pick and choose the best path to transfer the data along the difficult 'first mile&rdquo; near the front lines. Brandon Bean, GDIC's director of AI/machine learning (defense division), told Defense One, 'It could be anything from man-portable radios all the way up to [low-earth orbit or geosynchronous orbit] satellite connectivity.&rdquo; The tool can quickly send data to a Combined Air Operations Center and then back again, applying AI to the different air threats the sensors are picking up. Past the first mile, DOGMA can route the traffic to the cloud using commercial pathways. 'If you're in INDOPACOM, the first available [Amazon Web Services cloud] availability zone would be Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney. Once you hit that availability zone, they then route you on a dedicated path using the undersea fiber cables that they have. So you're not comingled with other commercial Internet traffic,&rdquo; Bean said. [[Related Posts]] To test how well it works, the company set up a geofence around an aircraft hangar at Indiana's Camp Atterbury during the August exercise. 'The objective here was to replicate a [Taiwan's air defense identification zone] incursion. So that geofence was about 1,500 feet tall and about 500 meters wide,&rdquo; Bean explained. 'In the end, what they found is that they could provide a high probability estimate of where even a highly maneuverable threat is headed with about 30 seconds of lead time to the operator.&rdquo; Getting that information across that 'first mile,&rdquo; where the adversary is trying to block all communications paths, is one of the key innovations, Bean said. 'We didn't have an [electronic warfare] threat in the simulated environment. But what we did was&hellip; periodically, without notice, would just start pulling plugs on all of our communications paths.&rdquo; That resulted in a communication disruption of just 33 milliseconds, as the system found the next-best communication path, essentially unnoticeable to the operator. New missile technology, especially highly-maneuverable supersonic and hypersonic missiles, are hugely difficult to defend against. But Beam said the system could be applied to help operators defend even against these missiles. However, he said, there's a big challenge to overcome&mdash;namely 'the amount of training data we had available to us. We put in a request with the FAA national office to get about three months worth of data from their major regional FAA centers. And that request is still in queue.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/12/new-ai-tool-air-defense-takes-advanced-missiles-and-drone-swarms/401381/	2024-12-02T15:42:09-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/02/2223204/large.jpg
China gains, US loses ground in Mideast arms market	The Middle East's share of U.S. arms imports has declined in the past decade, thanks in large part to the U.S. policy of ensuring Israel's qualitative military edge. From the five-year periods 2014-18 and 2019-23, the Middle East's share of U.S. arms exports fell from 50% to 38%, according to a 2024 SIPRI report. Restrictions linked to QME are a major factor in this decline. This legally mandated policy, in place since 2008, binds the United States to ensuring that Israel has a technological and strategic advantage over its hostile neighbors. This approach has strained relations with other U.S. security partners in the region&mdash;for example, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE&mdash;which cannot buy the latest U.S. arms and gear military. In response, these nations have turned to China and other suppliers. In 2020, the commander of U.S. Central Command warned that this might happen. 'We don't want [U.S. partners in the Middle East] turning to China. We don't want them turning to Russia to buy those systems,&rdquo; Gen. Kenneth McKenzie said. Now, as nations bump their defense spending amid an increasingly unstable world, the U.S. policy of prioritizing Israel's QME over broader regional partnerships could allow China to become a formidable contender in the Middle East arms market, and drastically shift the balance of power. Already, China is positioning itself as a flexible and pragmatic alternative to Western suppliers, providing competitive solutions with fewer political and operational strings attached. Here is a look at several regional countries' major arms projects: Egypt Egypt's French Rafale fighter jets, though advanced, were delivered without crucial long-range systems such as Meteor air-to-air missiles. Negotiations for 24 Eurofighter Typhoons from Italy, valued at $3 billion, and a potential deal with the U.S. for F-15 Strike Eagles, face similar constraints, likely omitting long-range strike capabilities to maintain Israel's QME. Frustrated by Western limits on long-range weaponry, Egypt has increasingly sought alternative suppliers, particularly China. Beijing has offered the HD-1A supersonic cruise missile to supplement Cairo's long-rang capability gap. With a range exceeding 180 miles (290 km) and precision targeting, the HD-1A could boost Egypt's strike capabilities. If integrated, it would challenge Israel's QME, shifting regional power dynamics. Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia, while the largest recipient of U.S. arms in the region, has also faced restrictions on acquiring advanced systems. After being denied access to the MQ-9 Reaper drone, the Kingdom purchased Chinese CH-4 and Wing Loong uncrewed combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). These drones have been deployed extensively, particularly in the air campaign over Yemen. Saudi Arabia has also acquired Wing Loong II drones comparable to the phased-out MQ-1 Predator. Riyadh has acquired Chinese Dong Feng (DF) ballistic missiles, including models like the DF-3 and DF-21, after the U.S. refused to sell equivalent systems due to proliferation concerns. The Kingdom has even begun producing solid-fueled ballistic missiles domestically, with Chinese technical assistance, to counter Iran's missile program. Reports also suggest Saudi Arabia is talking with China North Industries Group Corporation (Norinco) to procure advanced systems such as the Sky Saker FX80 UAV, CR500 vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAV, and loitering munitions like the Cruise Dragon 5 and 10. UAE A landmark arms agreement under the 2016 Trump administration included F-35 stealth fighters and MQ-9 Reaper drones for the UAE as part of a $23 billion package. The deal, formalized after the UAE normalized relations with Israel in 2020 under the Abraham Accords, marked a shift in regional defense dynamics. However, in December 2021, the UAE suspended F-35 negotiations with the Biden administration, citing 'sovereign operational restrictions&rdquo; related to the use and integration of the aircraft. Should such negotiations resume under Trump's second term, the UAE would become the second Middle Eastern operator of the F-35, after Israel. In the interim, the UAE has sought alternatives. For example, China has offered Wing Loong II UCAVs. Following the hiatus of the F-35 deal from the United States, the UAE pursued alternatives to modernize its air force and improve its military capabilities. The UAE signed a $19 billion deal with France in 2021 for 80 Rafale fighter jets, a clear pivot away from reliance on U.S. systems. These advanced 4.5-generation aircraft are set to replace the UAE's aging fleet of Mirage 2000s while providing a modern alternative to the U.S.-manufactured F-35 stealth fighter. Additionally, the UAE has explored opportunities with China. Reports suggest that Beijing's Hongdu L-15 advanced trainer jet has already been delivered, raising speculation that more sophisticated Chinese platforms, such as the Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter, could be on the UAE's wishlist.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/12/us-israel-china-and-shifting-arms-trade-middle-east/401379/	2024-12-02T15:17:52-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/02/GettyImages_1126716088/large.jpg
The D Brief: Jihadists seize Aleppo; Taiwan leader visits Hawaii;...	After a four-year freeze, jihadist rebels in Syria seized control of the country's largest city of Aleppo on Friday and Saturday, prompting Russian airstrikes across the city&mdash;allegedly including at hospitals and medical facilities&mdash;as the Assad regime tries to reestablish control. Reuters calls it 'the first time control of the city has shifted since 2016, when government forces, backed by Russia and Iran, defeated rebels who had controlled Aleppo's eastern districts.&rdquo; What's going on: The advances, which also include locations around Idlib and Hamas, are 'not the result of Israel's weakening of Iran and Hezbollah,&rdquo; nor are they 'the result of Russia having &lsquo;withdrawn' from Syria (it hasn't),&rdquo; said Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute. 'It's the result of a profoundly fragile regime & fragmented 'military,'&rdquo; he wrote on social media Sunday. Officials from Turkey, Iran, Russia and Syria are all scrambling to blunt the offensive and protect their troops and territory, the Associated Press reported in an explainer Monday. Iran has even directed several of its Iraq-based militias to assist, AP and Reuters reported separately. Even U.S. strikes were reported Sunday targeting Iran-backed militias traveling in eastern Syria, according to Lister. For what it's worth, 'The U.S., along with France, Germany and the U.K., issued a joint statement overnight calling for a de-escalation in the conflict,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reports. 'The current escalation only underscores the urgent need for a Syrian-led political solution to the conflict,&rdquo; that statement read. From Turkey's POV, this is a problem of Syria's making. 'It would be wrong to explain recent developments in Syria with foreign intervention,&rdquo; Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters Monday. 'The latest developments show the need for Damascus to reconcile with its people and the opposition,&rdquo; he said, citing 'problems in the past 13 years [that] were not solved.&rdquo; From the region: 'Hezbollah fires at an Israeli-held border zone, the group's first strike since a ceasefire began,&rdquo; the Associated Press reported Monday from Jerusalem; 'Israel Builds Bases in Central Gaza, a Sign It May Be There to Stay,&rdquo; the New York Times reported Monday; 'Former Israeli defense minister Yaalon warns of ethnic cleansing in Gaza,&rdquo; Reuters reported Sunday; 'Trump Names Massad Boulos, His Daughter's Father-in-Law, as Middle East Adviser,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday; 'What the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire means for the region&mdash;and US involvement,&rdquo; via The Conversation after speaking to Asher Kaufman, professor of history and peace studies at Notre Dame, last week. Also: Near Yemen, the U.S. Navy shot down several objects the Iran-backed Houthis launched at three U.S.-flagged commercial ships transiting the Gulf of Aden Saturday and Sunday. The projectiles included three anti-ship ballistic missiles, three one-way attack aerial drones, and one anti-ship cruise missile, officials at Central Command announced Sunday. Involved: U.S. Navy destroyers USS Stockdale (DDG 106) and the USS O'Kane (DDG 77). The Houthi 'attacks resulted in no injuries and no damage to any vessels, civilian or U.S. Naval,&rdquo; CENTCOM said.

His service during World War I gave him recurring nightmares, some of which he channeled into celebrated works of art during the 1920s and early 1930s. When the Nazis took power, he was ordered to stop painting subversive imagery, and largely did. He eventually passed away in Dresden at the age of 77. Europe and Ukraine Update: A Chinese ship is suspected of dragging its anchor to cut Baltic cables. According to the Wall Street Journal, 'Investigators suspect that the crew of the Yi Peng 3 bulk carrier&mdash;225 meters long, 32 meters wide and loaded with Russian fertilizer&mdash;deliberately severed two critical data cables last week as its anchor was dragged along the Baltic seabed for over 100 miles.&rdquo; Authorities are now trying to establish whether the captain of the Chinese-owned ship was 'induced by Russian intelligence to carry out the sabotage. It would be the latest in a series of attacks on Europe's critical infrastructure that law-enforcement and intelligence officials say have been orchestrated by Russia,&rdquo; which has denied wrongdoing.

ICYMI: There's a new boss at the helm for General Dynamics Electric Boat. America has just two shipyards that can service nuclear submarines, and one of those just got a new president. Connecticut-based GDEB is now led by Mark Rayha, who took over Sunday after 30-year veteran Kevin Graney retired in a departure announced in August. Rayha had most recently served as senior vice president and chief operating officer of GDEB, with experience at the larger General Dynamics firm extending back to 1989. Pacific U.S. adds restrictions in latest effort to slow China's chipmakers. On Monday, the United States launched what Reuters calls a 'third crackdown in three years on China's semiconductor industry,&rdquo; restricting exports of high-bandwidth memory chips, 24 chipmaking machines, and three software tools. It also restricts the export of chip-related equipment made in Singapore and Malaysia. Reuters: 'The move is one of the Biden administration's last large-scale efforts to stymie China's ability to access and produce chips that can help advance artificial intelligence for military applications, or otherwise threaten U.S. national security.&rdquo; Read on, here.

Taiwan's president, Lai Ching-te, visited Hawaii Saturday on the first of several stops around the Pacific. Lai is also planning to visit Guam, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Pulau. While in Hawaii, he was greeted at the Kahala Hotel by enthusiastic supporters bearing flower leis and Taiwanese flags, and shouting 'aloha&rdquo; and 'Team Taiwan.&rdquo; Defense One's Jennifer Hlad was at the hotel and captured video of the arrival, you can watch that on Instagram, here. During his two days on Oahu, Lai visited a museum and the USS Arizona memorial, met with the governor and members of Hawaii's congressional delegation, and spoke at the East-West Center think tank&mdash;but he did not meet with U.S. military officials. 'Our visit to the memorial today in particular reminds us of the importance of ensuring peace,&rdquo; he said in a speech aired on Hawaii TV. 'Peace is priceless and war has no winner. We have to fight&mdash;fight together&mdash;to prevent war,&rdquo; he said, according to Reuters, reporting Sunday. While at the East-West Center, Lai shared 'three positive actions Taiwan has taken for the Indo-Pacific region and the world,&rdquo; according to a post on his official Facebook page. 'I hope Taiwan, the United States, the world and other countries will strengthen cooperation and work together to contribute to peace, stability and prosperity in the Taiwan Straits and Indo-Pacific region, and build a prosperous future!&rdquo; China's Foreign Ministry was displeased with Lai's travel plans, and warned ahead of his Hawaii visit that if the U.S. wishes to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it must handle dealings with Taiwan 'with utmost caution, clearly opposing Taiwan independence and supporting China's peaceful reunification.&rdquo; By the way: The U.S. approved $320 million in F-16 support for Taiwan, the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced Friday. That deal includes 'critical spare and repair parts, consumables and accessories,&rdquo; with deliveries expected to begin sometime next year. Another sale worth an estimated $65 million was announced separately. That one concerned 'follow-on support for the Improved Mobile Subscriber Equipment and Experimental Force system,&rdquo; which reportedly 'functions as a field base station capable of integrating all voice encryption, data links, and digital and analog signals into a comprehensive hub.&rdquo; Lawmakers can object to the sales in the coming days, though that's not expected. The two potential deals add up to the more than two dozen such arrangements announced during President Biden's tenure. Other purchases include National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, Patriot air defense missiles, a variety of drones, 155mm artillery systems, Sidewinder missiles, Harpoon missiles, and more. ICYMI: We spoke to two experts earlier this year about what Taiwan should try to purchase in the future ahead of a possible blockade or invasion by China.

Army aims to move its pay system to the cloud by 2027	The Army is moving its personnel and pay system to the cloud, an effort that has begun in earnest with the hiring of Oracle to host the HR records of more than 1 million soldiers. Announced last month, the effort will move the guts of the Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army, which the service uses to manage recruitment, personnel, and soldiers' medical files, to a custom-cloud environment. Plans are being drawn up by the IPPS-A product management team at Army Program Executive Office Enterprise. The new system must be operational by December 2027, a PEO spokesperson said. The work will be carried out under the Pentagon's Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability, a two-year-old, up-to-$9 billion contract vehicle that has already seen task orders worth more than $1 billion. The value of Oracle's new deal hasn't been released, but it is the 'biggest competitively awarded JWCC contract&rdquo; so far, according to Kim Lynch, executive vice president for Oracle's government defense and intelligence business. 'So that has been a huge win for us.&rdquo; Before that migration can start, Oracle must build a secure environment to host services, applications, and data. 'The awarded task order allows the team to conduct parallel operations in building an Oracle Broker Landing Zone environment at the Army level and the operating environments for the IPPS-A tenancy,&rdquo; the Army spokesperson said. 'This step is critical to lay the necessary framework for migration of the IPPS-A system and its associated environments.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] The Army is also working with the Defense Information Systems Agency to create a private cloud that can be used to test the nascent personnel-and-pay system. 'This will enable us to begin the initial steps in a phased approach of migrating IPPS-A into a cloud environment based on our draft plan. This careful planning and execution is designed to minimize application disruption during the testing phase of the migration plan, prior to going live,&rdquo; the Army said. The task order award makes Oracle the 'third cloud-service provider to the Army's cloud construct plan,&rdquo; an Army PEO Enterprise spokesperson told Defense One via email. And once the landing zone is completed, it will be easier for the Army to migrate other organizations to the cloud, if needed, and give organizations more to choose from when it comes to service providers. The IPPS-A contract award also feeds into the Army's plans to simplify its data infrastructure by creating data exchanges that support multiple networks and systems. 'One specific effort IPPS-A is leveraging through the migration is automation and the ability to present a comprehensive Unified Data Reference Architecture (UDRA) in support of the Army ASA (ALT) and CIO initiatives.&rdquo; The Army has been upgrading IPPS-A to be more user-friendly, including making the system accessible on mobile devices. Moving the system to the cloud could also improve users' experience. 'Using the enterprise cloud solution will allow IPPS-A to leverage available cloud-native-computing software to assist in the development and overall delivery of the IPPS-A application to the field. Once established and migrated, the impact to the overall user experience may not be immediately apparent,&rdquo; the Army spokesperson said. 'However, the back-end areas of the system, such as development, testing and production will receive necessary performance improvements because of the migration to the cloud, which provides operating efficiencies and cost saving to the program and the government in the future years. Ultimately, the impact on the user will be the speed at which the program will be able to deliver new capability.&rdquo; The cloud-based system will start with unclassified data, including controlled unclassified information. Lynch said the award shows that Oracle is finally gaining recognition as a legitimate cloud-service provider in the Pentagon. In 2018, Oracle unsuccessfully sued the Pentagon after being left out of the $10 billion competition for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, cloud contract that preceded JWCC. 'It's always a blessing and a curse to be newer to the market. The blessing is you've built the latest technology,&rdquo; she said. 'The curse is that it takes a long time for awareness in the market. So we're working really hard at that.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/11/army-aims-move-its-pay-system-cloud-2027/401356/	2024-11-27T14:42:04-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/27/8275508/large.jpg
Defense One Radio, Ep. 167: How U.S. Navy shipbuilding sank so lo...	Google Pla Apple Podcasts Guests: Matthew Paxton, president of the Shipbuilders Council of America; Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va.; Brent Sadler, retired Navy captain and senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation; And Mark Montgomery, retired rear admiral and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Sources and additional reading: Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress (PDF); U.S. Navy budget materials; 'Navy adds $1B to unconventional effort to boost sub production,' by Lauren Williams, reporting Sept. 2024; Defense Department's 2024 Defense Industrial Base strategy; And 'Restoring Our Maritime Strength: An agenda for the next president's first hundred days,' by Brent Sadler and Jerry Hendrix, writing in the National Review in late October. Here's a rough transcript of today's episode: The U.S. Navy will celebrate its 250th birthday next year. That's pretty old. In fact, it's considerably older than China's navy, which wasn't even officially established until 1950. At that time, the U.S. Navy was generally regarded as the best and largest in the world. But it's not the largest anymore. That distinction goes to China. The U.S. Navy currently has 297 ships. At the end of World War II, it had more than 6,000 active ships in the force. And that's kind of an inconceivable number, so we won't really be talking about it again. More recently, in my lifetime for example, the Navy peaked at around 590 ships in 1987. Again, today it has almost half that. But as analysts will tell you, Soviet naval technology of the 1980s is not Chinese naval technology of the 2020s and beyond. So historical comparisons are only marginally helpful in understanding the current dilemma that is the American shipbuilding industry. Here are a few numbers to make the discrepancies a little more clear. The latest public navy ship count has China at 370, and the U.S. as we mentioned before, has 297. The commercial shipbuilding industry side of things is far more stark. Consider that in 2022, the U.S. had just five large oceangoing commercial ships on order. China had 1,794. But China's shipyards crank out both commercial and naval or military ships. And in this regard, the U.S. Navy estimates that China's shipbuilding capacity is 232 times our own. For example, China has 13 shipyards. One in particular is especially notable. Here's Germany's DW News, reporting just four days ago. From a big-picture consideration, as engineer Brian Potter recently wrote, 'successful shipbuilding countries are often island countries or (like Korea) effectively islands that are highly dependent on imports and exports.&rdquo; And an analysis from U.S.-based defense firm Palantir reiterated that point just last month, writing: 'There has never been a dominant naval power that was not also a dominant commercial shipping power. China understands this. Do we?&rdquo; These sort of considerations led me to wonder: What is a normal year for U.S. Navy shipbuilding? It turns out that's a bad question. Because what I've learned is that the U.S. Navy's force structure has been in flux for most of the last decade. And the wider problems contributing to that extend far beyond a single decade. Here's Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro speaking at an event hosted by the Stimson Center think tank earlier this year. 'If you take a look at what happened, basically in the early 1980s when President Reagan was president, he believed that we could actually leave the core elements of the shipbuilding industry, the commercial shipbuilding industry, to the private sector. And he was right. We did leave it to the private sector. And regretfully, countries like China took over with cheap labor, basically, and were able to really build up their commercial shipbuilding industry and dominate the market.&rdquo; The U.S. had eight public naval shipyards when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Today, there are only four. Here's Del Toro again: 'But the commercial shipbuilding industry atrophied through the Cold War. We shut down many shipyards in this country, thinking that we would not need them. We became less competitive as well, too, and now we're at the point where our commercial ship building industry has really suffered&hellip;.But because of that, our building of our naval capabilities, of our naval ships have become far more expensive because there are far fewer shipyards that actually build our Navy ships.&rdquo; Out of those four remaining public shipyards, only two of them can work on nuclear-powered subs&mdash;in Virginia and Connecticut. And nuclear-powered subs are basically how the U.S. maintains its edge and keeps world war from erupting again. The big problem? The U.S. can't quite repair or replace those submarines as fast as they're aging. Lawmakers know that. The Navy certainly knows it. That's why they've set a goal of building two nuclear-powered subs along with one nuclear-armed submarine each year. But since the pandemic hit, the Navy's been unable to reach that goal. Why that is is partly what we'll be talking about today. It's all part of a somewhat pernicious dynamic. And it can be really frustrating for patriotic Americans who remember the industrious elbow-grease-and-bootstrap legacy of the country's defense industries going back to the Second World War, when the U.S. shipbuilding industry cranked out a new destroyer every 17 days. As my colleague Dan Darling messaged me recently, the U.S. has never lacked for naval innovation or design creativity, yet right now, it can barely build a single Navy submarine in a single fiscal year. And those subs? They eat up half of the Navy's desired shipbuilding budget. Its latest shipbuilding budget came in at more than $32 billion dollars. And with that money, the Navy expects to build 10 new ships&mdash;but another 19 are retiring. So that's a net loss of 9 ships for fiscal year 2025. In order to reach the service's current goal of a 515-ship Navy to counter China around the mid-century mark, the shipbuilding industry will have to crank out a net gain of 10 ships every year&mdash;and every year for 35 years. Remember, the Navy is currently working on a net loss of 9 ships for the current year. I'm no mathematician, but that is not trending in the desired direction, if you're a U.S. Navy officer. That's at least partly why you may have heard this commercial on TV or on internet video ads in places like YouTube for example. That ad came from Texas-based Blue Forge Alliance, which has been promoting shipyard jobs through its 'Build Submarines&rdquo; advertising campaign. Blue Forge Alliance has netted more than a billion dollars over the last two years to promote jobs in America's submarine industrial base. But the Navy seems to need a lot more help beyond just its submarine problem. According to a recent report from the Congressional Research Service (PDF), 'The Navy is currently facing challenges in designing, building, crewing, and maintaining ships.&rdquo; That's pretty much all aspects of being a Navy. And a variety of recent developments have illustrated this somewhat painfully. That includes: The Navy recently lost its only oiler in the Middle East when it ran aground and 'partially flooded off the coast of Oman&rdquo; in September. In October, another 26 ships were discovered to have received faulty welds at the Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Virginia. And subs aren't the only ships coming out of shipyards at a dismally slow pace. The country's latest aircraft carrier is at least 18 months behind. Its FFG-62 Frigate program is 36 months behind schedule, too. On top of all this, the Navy is also experiencing a recruiting shortfall, which means it can't quite even fully staff the dwindling number of ships plying the world's oceans to protect global commerce and shipping lanes so you can get that out-of-season citrus or watch those Amazon packages arrive on time. But those shipping lanes are already being cramped and pinched by challenges to the navies of the U.S. and its allies. Look at the Red Sea, for instance. The Iran-backed Houthis know this. It's why the U.S. is having to divert so much of its Navy to the Middle East, redirecting entire carrier groups away from the Pacific, leaving other allies like Taiwan somewhat vulnerable to a possible Chinese blockade or potentially a future invasion. So how did we go from that Reagan-era high point to the current post-pandemic low? Sadler: Well, the first thing is we got lazy. That's Brent Sadler, a 26-year Navy veteran who is now a Senior Research Fellow in Naval Warfare and Advanced Technology at the Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington. He's also author of the 2023 book, 'U.S. Naval Power in the 21st Century: A New Strategy for Facing the Chinese and Russian Threat.&rdquo; Sadler: We got lazy in our post cold war kind of malaise, and then when we got distracted with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, thinking that all we needed was the ability to fight these, these high intensity, low low tech kind of wars, and we just assumed for far too long that we'd be able to operate our Navy wherever, whenever we wanted. And as a result of that, we under invested. We didn't invest in new capabilities, starting 20 years ago. We didn't invest in infrastructure, in shipyards when we knew we didn't have the capacity to maintain the fleet that we had at the time, which was north of 300 ships. And now we can't, for the last 10, 10+ years, we can't, we can't actually grow the fleet north of 300 and we're only talking like from 292 to 300 so eight new ships. We can't even do that. And at the same time, we have an accelerating aged fleet that's getting at its retirement, so we've under invested. We ignore the impending need to invest massive capital investments, both in people and in infrastructure, to turn the tide on a navy that's nearing the end of its lifetime, and it comes at the same time that we are just now realizing with real seriousness the true danger that China poses, and we're realizing this as our deterrence is failing all over the world. So that, in a nutshell, that's kind of it, and it's not very rosy happy message, but that's what I tell folks, and it's not one administration, it's not one political party, it's not the executive branch, it's not Congress, it's not the Navy&mdash;it's all of them. Paxton: The United States is a maritime nation. We're an Arctic nation. That's Matthew Paxton, president of the Shipbuilders Council of America. Paxton: We have a vibrant maritime industry that goes unnoticed. We move Commerce on our inland rivers, on our coast wise lanes. We build the most advanced, lethal and sophisticated navy and coast guard the world has ever seen. But largely the maritime industry is kind of a, you know, the unseen industry. We're incredibly important for our economy. And right now it's the US Navy, with some of our allies, that are keeping, you know, global commerce moving. We're doing that idea that the freedom of the seas would ever be questioned. You know, coming out of the 1990s and the early 2000s is a real question now. One particularly notable inflection point occurred about 10 to 12 years ago. U.S. officials knew this. But what the world knew about China's ambitions was only beginning to change&mdash;and in an especially stark way. Sadler: what was clear from someone in government at the time was that at the highest level, there really wasn't a commitment to the vision of really confronting China. I mean, the Obama administration come in the tail end of its first term, and then through the first half of its second term. Um, still had hope of a partnership with China. And so when it came to tough choices and making putting money behind the actions that were needed, back in 2012 2013 and 14, it really wasn't there. So failure of commitment to a vision and a course of action by the most senior leadership to include the president, President Obama, I don't think was fully committed. I think the political calculations were to try to cut DoD funding overall, and this is the age of sequestration, so they could fund other domestic programs. At the time it was the Affordable Care Act was real, the priority. So our priorities were misaligned, despite the rhetoric. And I would say it was remarkable that then-President Obama did come over in January 2012 and announced with the Secretary of Defense the rebalanced Asia-Pacific. The formal title was the Defense Strategic Guidance at the time. But beyond that, what we were able to achieve, as modest as it was, about about $12 to $13 billion of new investments and activities in the Indo-Pacific in those three years was basically by hook and crook. It was not the president driving it as aggressively as would have been needed to have a real lasting impact, because at the same time, the Chinese were building their island garrisons in the South China Sea, and so we weren't really having the effect that we could have. Sadler: It's worth kind of rolling the clock back to the world that we were in in 2011 to 2013&mdash;presidential elections, Russia was kind of poo-pooed as not a concern. China was a partner in waiting, and you had the Arab Spring that was going on. So it's important to kind of go back in time and remember what it was like. It's similar to what we just went through, but different and very distinct. Now you've got a major war in Europe, the Middle East is a flame, and China is not deterred, as we saw in the South China Sea over this last summer. So how can the U.S. begin to fix these problems? That's what we'll turn to next with a focus on the real movers and shakers&mdash;the actual shipyard workers themselves, the dwindling number of them anyway, and the very particular challenges they face today. Remember just a few minutes ago I noted that the Navy's force structure has been in flux for the past several years. That's been a quiet catastrophe, and the mounting costs of that unpredictability are finally clear to lawmakers and industry officials. Paxton: Our shipyards have invested billions of dollars of capital infrastructure into their facilities and their workforce to meet the demand signal that we had. And so when that demand signal turns up or turns down. You know, we have to either ramp up quickly or, you know, unfortunately, in certain instances where that demand signal because of sequestration or coming out of COVID or other things, you know, we've had to, you know, lay off workforces. We are similar to other manufacturing sectors where we've had a graying of our workforce, particularly coming out of COVID You had a lot of folks who they retired out, kind of that aging workforce moved out, and there was a real effort to get that skilled craftsmen, and it takes, you know, a good Five years for most you know those skilled shift arm workers to get to that level of efficiency. And right now, I would say across certain sectors of the industry, we have, we have a we have a tightening, lower amount of that five year, you know, skilled craftsmen so and what we've also been experiencing is it's hard to retain, you know, you'll go out and you will recruit, you know, hundreds of you know, next generation shipyard workers. And you, you know, won't retain all of the individuals, and that's, that's an expense for the shipyard. You know, they pay for those apprenticeship programs. They are investing in that worker, and with no guarantee that they'll be there, you know, you know, five years out. That kind of uncertainty has functioned like a poison to the American shipyard industry. Because as anyone who is trying to support a family knows, you need predictability in order to buy a home and live in almost any way as a dependable member of your community. Take that away, and people start leaving&mdash;or retiring. And lately those retirees have not been swapped out by younger blue collar workers, as Virginia Rep. Rob Wittman explained in a recent interview with Defense One Executive Editor Bradley Peniston. Here's Wittman. Wittman: The shipyards have struggled to make sure that they replace senior ship builders that are retiring with new people in the workforce, and we've seen some hiccups that have happened with that. Because the new workforce today works differently than the workforce of years ago. You know, they are hands on, but they also like to use technology&mdash;going to, instead of blueprints on a table, to go to iPads and go to other ways to make sure that you can recruit the best and the brightest to come and work in the yards. Another element too is, you know, being able to make sure that there's certainty there for those workers, what we see a lot of times is ship building happening waves. So we see a bow wave of ship construction that all sudden it wanes, and then you have another bow wave of ship construction. Consistency is key. Congress needs to be part of that. Congress needs to make sure that when we acquire ships, we do multiple year ship acquisitions to make sure there's certainty there, and so that when folks go to work at the yard, they can become that next master shipbuilder of the future, that ship builder has been there for 40 years. That last point: multi-year ship purchases is a particularly tall order. And the last 10 years of fluctuating force structure ideas out of the Navy did not help. Government shutdowns because lawmakers can't get along? That didn't help either. But strangely enough, there's another big factor in why America's Navy shipyards are so backlogged. Wittman: Listen, we are in a very competitive area as far as salary. You. Look today, when you can go to a fast food restaurant and make $17 an hour with full benefits, and then you look down the road and they're asking you to work outside under pretty, you know, challenging conditions, and you're going to make $18 an hour. So salaries have to go up. Just this week, the Biden administration asked Congress for more than $7 billion in emergency funds to prop up its submarine industrial base. More than $500 million of that is specifically for 'wage productivity enhancements.&rdquo; That's on top of another almost billion dollar contract with the Blue Forge Alliance the Navy announced in September. That money, too, is intended to prop up the country's flailing submarine industrial base. And that industry needs more than just wage increases to lure workers; it also needs upgrades to its infrastructure. Because America's ability to make submarines isn't the only thing falling behind. The country's ability to maintain and repair its subs is in even worse shape, with a three-year backlog for major work. And the Biden administration's three-country deal to supply submarines to Australia&mdash;known as AUKUS&mdash;that only adds extra pressure to the already shaky industry. But both Rep. Wittman and Matt Paxton believe some solutions are within reach. Here's Wittman in conversation with Defense One's Brad Peniston. Wittman: I would argue that there is some additional capability at existing yards, but one of the untapped potentials there are the ship maintenance yards. Ship maintenance yards have, you know, a whole bow wave of work that comes in, they get the work done, and then the work drops off. Peniston: And just to be clear, you're talking about private maintenance yards? Wittman: exactly, private maintenance yards. The public yards are pretty much level loaded. They have an issue, too, with aging infrastructure there, where they're going to have to be able to take some of that infrastructure down, which means we have to find other places, the private sector, ie, to do that work while we're modernizing the public yards, but these private repair yards have a lot of capacity to do work in new construction while they are managing the repair work there, much of it is exactly the same. In fact, what we're seeing right now is the big yards using smaller contractors to build parts of those ships. So they'll build a panel that slides into a submarine. They'll build panel and parts for aircraft carriers for other surface ships. We need to find more opportunities to do that, because there are certain areas out there with untapped potential. We need to be fully utilizing that potential before we even start down the road and talking about the time and money that it takes to build a new yard. So let's look at existing facilities. Paxton: I think the industry has more than enough capacity and capability to meet the fleet's demands, both in new construction and in maintenance and modernization. What we just got to do is we got to right-size those workloads. So we're optimizing throughput through all our shipyards. And that's, that's, you know, these shipyards are a national asset. You know, I oftentimes refer to the 280 billion that US taxpayers put into the chips Act that was passed in 2002 to, you know, reassure our semiconductor industry. You know, that was all of a sudden that became a real national security concern where we couldn't&mdash;we're wholly dependent on other countries for our semiconductors, and we recognize we need to have that capacity and capability here in the United States. To the tune of two 80 billion we had to reassure that we have a competitive&mdash;we have a capable, the most capable, I believe, because we're building the most advanced and capable nuclear assets in the world, right here in the United States, that are building ships and repairing ships every day. So we don't need a, you know, a CHIPS act for our shipyard industry. What we do need, again, not sexy. We need that market stability so our shipyards are making the investments, and those investments are, you know, being returned with, you know, the ability that we can be highly efficient. You know, you started this interview talking about China&mdash;well, China and Japan and Korea that now dominates over 96% of the world's, you know, output of commercial tonnage. That's all about economies of scale, and you achieve that when you have big order books and you just optimize volume through your shipyards. There may also be a place for emerging technology in all this. Here's Rep. Wittman again. Wittman: Many parts on the ship in years past had to be constructed through castings, which was an arduous process. So you had to create a sand mold, you had a port, then you had a machine that very rudimentary piece of metal into a valve or whatever other structure on the ship today, advanced manufacturing can short circuit that you can do things with. With all kinds of new digital printing, we can actually digitally print metal parts. That happens much, much faster. There are companies out there that do that. So you could short circuit a lot of what happened before in what took a lot of time and took a lot of resources with current technology. So additive manufacturing, there's actually some entities here. One of them is in Virginia, in Danville, Virginia, that actually is putting together an educational opportunity for folks to come there and learn about additive manufacturing, so essentially to be retrained. So if there's somebody that's skilled in CNC machining, you can go there and figure out, well, how do I now take a piece that is advanced manufactured with with a tooling that actually lays down layers of metal, and then machine that so there's much less material to remove, and then make it a more efficient and faster process and retrain the workforce to do that. So I think you have to provide incentives to do that. It has to be more than just providing the training. It has to say, Okay, how do we make sure that you get a benefit as a ship builder for doing those things? Here at the end of 2024, the U.S. sits at a very interesting crossroads in terms of possibly changing all these factors slowing America's shipbuilding industry. With the Trump administration promising an about-face on everything from public education to immigration to the economy, these next few months could be especially revolutionary for the U.S. Navy as well. That anyway, is the thinking among many conservatives like Brent Sadler of the Heritage Foundation. Sadler: The conclusion I came to about two and a half three years ago was the only way we're going to fix navy ship building and navy repair, you know, and the supply defense supply base is to actually revitalize our maritime industrial base. I mean, we have shrunk our ship building, shipping and commercial maritime industrial sector, so much that there's no surge capacity, and there isn't a population out there that you can draw from and recruit into the Navy, into the naval, the naval sector, and you can't. We've been able to demonstrate, I prove, is that we can't sustain just a pure naval, maritime industrial base and so the Ships for America Act, that's something that has great promise for trying to invigorate that national maritime industrial base so that you can get more naval architects, you get more blue collar high competency, and also pay scale kind of workers working in main. Getting robotic systems in the yards for steel plate pipe fitters, all a very wide breadth of skill sets into the ship building in the maritime industrial sector, to try to encourage some of that investment. That's on the commercial side. Over on the Navy side, you hear things like blue forge alliance that up until recently, was, you know, that's actually with Navy and the ship builders working together to contract out, to help identify and to foster new entrants, like the supplier base, at the same time trying to help get and recruit shipyard workers into the workforce. But I think it's starting to shift, and it needs to shift to try and help at the shipyards grow capacity so some of the money in there to try to help longer term and capital investments to grow the ability to build more than 1.33 submarines a year to get it to 2.33 is what their need to so so blue forge Alliance an interesting kind of approach. I'm withholding my assessment or my view on that until I actually start seeing some real, tangible results in the production rate of submarines. Wittman: We have a ton of data, you know, a DDG-51 you ought to know what you need to repair that ship. We have a ton of data. We have a ton of historical data to know what's the likelihood of a valve going bad in the ship, what's the likelihood of a tank need to be recoded and do modeling to do that. There's models out there that can make that happen, these digital twin models. So, how do we do a better job in predicting work? How do we do a better job in keeping work on track? How do we make sure, too, that we get past the delays that come with change orders a lot of times two. Change Orders affect the flow of work on the ship. Because if you have a change order, something that has to be done in order for the next piece of work to be done, and the change order delays that then you have this cascaded delays that never ends. And then all of a sudden a ship avail goes much longer. And what happens if a ship availed maintenance ale goes too long? The Navy says, We don't care. Zip the ship back up, get it out of dock, get it back to sea with work done worth left undone, and when it's undone. Guess what happens to the expected service life of the ship becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. All of a sudden, maybe comes back, goes, we need to retire these cruisers, you know, like, Well, why? Well, because this is decaying, and that's the king. And they said, Well, why is he decaying? Well, you and you look back at the maintenance records, you look back at the insert inspections, where the inserts say, Guess what? We've defined all the work that needs to be done, and then it doesn't get done in the yard. In the yard. And all of a sudden, on the third or fourth maintenance of mail, you look at and go, Wow, all this work is gathered up. And all of a sudden, you look at it in the material condition of the ship is in such a case where the Navy says, well, it doesn't pay to go ahead and try to fix it because it's in such bad shape, we're just going to retire it. It's a self fulfilling prophecy. We're gonna turn briefly now to one of those other big obstacles in the way of growing America's Navy. Negotiations between lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Paxton: On the government side, we've seen instability in kind of that government demand signal, going back to 10 years of sequestration. We don't pass annual appropriation bills. We're right now debating a continuing resolution that will go into March of next year, potentially, you know, there's talk of maybe a full year CR. And so oftentimes we talk about government shipbuilding, we talk about navy ship building&mdash;there's a very important aspect of that that's also navy ship repair, navy ship maintenance and modernization. Sadler: Continuing resolutions have become the norm of behavior up in Capitol Hill. And I would say, despite, you know, I worked on the CNOs personal staff, and I can remember preparing and getting the input for his statements in the past about the impacts of continuing resolutions, but the reality is, the armed services have grown accustomed to this, and they've adjusted their contracting and the way they do business to almost expect CRs. That's not to say it's a perfect way of doing business, but they've been able to mitigate a lot of the damages. And quite frankly, Congress needs to do a better job of holding and getting the debates done and coming to a conclusion on the budget, whether it's lower, higher or unchanged. They just need to go ahead and agree to something and I think when you have one party in control of both the House and the Senate, it becomes more likely that you don't have continuing resolutions. But I mean, I could be proven wrong. There are still a lot of contentious issues in government spending that have to get addressed and to get under control. Wittman: Well, it has to be a joint effort between authorizers and appropriators. Your authorizers have to say, this is what you will do. This is a time frame you'll do it in. These are the resources that you'll use to do that. And the appropriators need to put in there the requirements on saying, by the way, in order for these appropriations to be available, this is how you will use them in executing ship building. Peniston: So you're going to talk to your colleagues and say, you know, this what we need to write into the new defense bills? Wittman: Yes, well, there'll be a lot of discussion in this year's NDAA about how we further streamline and make the shipbuilding enterprise much more efficient. And there are things I think that we can do. You know, the challenge is, is the balance. You don't want to be overly prescriptive. You don't want to come in and say, you know, do A, B and C, because a lot of times that stifles innovation and creation. But what you want to do is to provide the tools for things to get done quickly, provide the tools for innovation and creation to occur. Provide the incentives for them to use new technologies, additive manufacturing, whatever it may be, and let them push forward with that, because they're going to be the best creators and innovators in this enterprise. So just enable them to do that, and make sure there's incentives there to say, Hey, listen, if you do things better, if you do it faster, if you do it more efficiently, there is a benefit to you in doing that, so create some positive rewards for them to do that. What sort of things can the Trump administration do in the months ahead? Here are a few of Sadler's ideas, which he spelled out in a recent article he co-authored along with Jerry Hendrix in the National Review. Sadler: There's no time to waste, and so you have to have a clear plan, and you have to start executing. And you can't allow the perfect no more analysis paralysis through analysis. We've admired these problems for years now, and we know enough to take action. So the first thing is act and and we lay out several things in there, you know, from the operational side, but we're talking ship building specifically today in the ship building part, build it go to Congress, get a dedicated, large block by I advocate for a naval act, because there's, we have stable ship designs we have known year on year the numbers of destroyers, Arleigh Burks, Virginia-class submarines. We know the frigates got some issues, but we know the design is now finally, perhaps stable enough. And we also know about amphibs, that we know stable designs. How many numbers that the Navy needs to buy, just go ahead and write the check. Congress, get it to the ship builders. Shift the risk on to them, and let the yards make the best business decisions, the best engineering decisions, but hold them accountable on delivering ships on time. That's in my mind, the most urgent is to do that, and then there's, of course, accounting and some reorganization within the Navy's program offices as well. But the big thing is to commit to a plan with resources, and then hold the ship builders to schedule, rather than what we've been seeing and billions of dollars being spent to build parking garages, pay wages and micromanaging the shipyards. I mean, if they need to manage the money to get their infrastructure to recruit the workforce, it should be included in the price of the submarine package deal. Let them take the risk, not the taxpayers, and ease the burden. Make it easier for Congress's oversight role to come into play, because right now, it's just overly complicated. It's, it's, it's moved across several funding cycles. It's, in my mind, an elegant solution as a naval act, and that's what's called for Montgomery: Look, Something's gotta change in shipbuilding. That's retired Navy Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery. He now works as a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington. Montgomery: Either we're going to&mdash; we need to significantly increase the Navy shipbuilding budget. If we're going to have the Navy, we need to counter the threats we face, even if you're just in a China context, if you want to be a, you know, a restrainer, you know, or a prioritizer and say, Oh, I'm going to worry about China, which I think is not sensical. But if you're going to be that, or if you're going to be like me, and he believes that you're going to have to deal with multiple problems at a time, because the adversary gets a vote. And if you say, All I care about is China, if you say, All I care about is China and Iran, you know, speeds to a nuclear weapon, you're going to get involved in Iran. But my point is, if you're going to have the Navy you need, you're going to have to change the top line on navy ship building in a fairly dramatic way. Or you're going to have to move into the system and control services. You know, the Navy's program of record ethos. You know, their desire to just keep building what they're building, or Congress's intervention here for example, to build more and more large deck amphibs for a joint forceful entry operation that's not going to happen. Or you're going to have to reimagine where you build things at a labor cost you can afford. So one of those three things is going to break. So if you don't think that the ship building budget is going to break, you know that we're going to break out and get, like, a 10 to 15% increase, you know, for several years. Or you don't think that we can convince Senator Wicker to just stop building large deck amphibs and build something, take the risk that you'll win the contract to build what we replace it with, and that that's the problem there. I think he'd do it if he knew we're going to violate every rule of contracting and put the, you know, the whatever air, whatever craft we realized we needed, into his shipyards or his state shipyards. Okay, if those two aren't going to happen, then you have to realistically address number three, which is the cost of ship building. And to do that, there are, look, I'm not sure I'd start building DDGs in Korea, Japan, although both of them build great DDGs, you know, but I could start building the support ships there. I mean, our convoluted attempts to build large deck support ships over the last 20 years in the United States is rife with disappointment and failure. Um. And, and we really need to, you know, we could transfer some of that over there and maybe get ships for might not be 25 cents on the dollar like you could with a purely civilian ship, but maybe 35 or 40 cents on the dollar for a mill spec, you know, support ship, and 100% I would build my MSC, MARAD&mdash;that's the Transportation Department's contribution to sea lift&mdash;and the Army's waterborne, all three of those are operating at about 40% in need right now, or less. And I don't think we can survive with one of them there. So those ship replacement ships and the repair of those ships should be preferentially moved to lower cost ship building and ship repair. Sadler: Well, well, to be clear, the if the Marines in the army actually do so, and this is something going back to the rebalance to the Pacific, back in 2012 that, that I kind of was working on, is that those forces would already be in the Philippines and in Japan, so you don't have to do forcible entry. And certainly no one's talking about invading Mainland China. I mean, there's a saying, you know, avoid, avoid a land war in Asia. So that's not what's in the cards. The idea is moving under in a contested environment, this north, south kind of lateral movement, shoot and scoot marine sometimes we'll call it, but the idea that you have long range fires from heavy army, uh, regiments and Marine Corps, smaller elements, also with longer range air defense, you complicate the Chinese targeting problem and but you're not doing forcible entry, you're doing contested logistics. But you still need those big amphibs working in concert with the smaller ones, because you're going to have to move large amounts of material in in a contested environment. The large amphibs kind of carry that, not to the touchdown when you get within the five yard line, and use a football analogy. So from the 50 yard line, you're using big amphibs from the 10 yard line you're moving, you're using a whole bunch of smaller amphibs, complex, hard to do, but necessary, driven by the geography and the type of weapon systems the Chinese have spent pretty much 20 years perfecting and and deploying. One big question I have is: How can the Trump administration pay for this bigger Navy? Granted, despite the talk from lawmakers every few years, the U.S. has never been terribly afraid of running up its deficit and taking on more debt. Sadler: I mean, I mean, there's a lot of fraud, waste and abuse that's going on in government that's been accepted as normal. But if you actually just, you know, you look at Medicaid, Medicare, food stamps, you look at unexecuted COVID money, the list goes on. And so this DOGE with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswami, I mean, they're going to hopefully try and streamline government. You take half of that savings and you pay down the debt. You take the other portion of that, you basically can fund the Marine Corps and the Navy for for several years, with the amount of money we're talking about. That sounds a little too simple to me. But time will tell. And the Navy's future? It's not just in ships staffed by new sailors recruited into the force. America's future Navy will have lots of drones. And that, too, will take money. Here's Wittman again. Wittman: The key, though, is it can't just be writing a bigger check. It has to be, how do we get more per our dollar than the Chinese get for their Yuan, and the Russians get for their ruble? This is really an issue with the challenge we face with the deficit and debt is, how do we get more out of the money that we have? Do we need additional dollars in the enterprise? Absolutely, but it can't just be writing a bigger check at the expense of increased efficiencies and increased efforts necessary to make sure we have the capacity and capability necessary in our Navy, and it also is going to make us look too at other ways to capitalize capacity and capability quickly. It's not just the exquisite platforms, they're incredibly important, but it's also capitalizing exquisite platforms, in addition to attritables and expendable platforms. So how do we do that? How do you create mass quickly. Listen, it takes years to do the financing of a ship. It takes years to construct the ship. It takes again time for it to go to sea, get sea trials and then actually be operational for the Navy. We can close that gap much faster with dollars and time and and and numbers of platforms by doing these attritable platforms, and they're pretty doggone effective. So the Pentagon is doing a lot in that realm. Replicator is one of those realms where they're trying to put in place those uncrewed systems quickly&mdash;putting hundreds of them by August of next year. And I think they're on track to do a lot of that. It'll remain to be seen if they meet the top goal there. And then the next effort in Replicator, Replicator two is, you know, what do you do then to create counter systems? For years, I've always had conversations with the Navy. They do all kinds of great research projects. I mean, when you, when you go, when you go to the labs, you look at this, go, Wow. This is a great under, you know, underwater unmanned vessel. This is a great unmanned surface vessel. You look at it, all kinds of great things going on. You go, Okay, well, tell me which one of these systems you're going to field. Oh, we haven't made a decision about feeling the system yet. We're still kind of figuring out, you know, all the possibilities. And I'm like, Well, you know what? Your adversaries are fielding systems. You're still doing science experiments. So the key is, is, how do you cross over from doing the experiments into actually fielding these systems? The Navy has now made that first step into fielding those systems. They have now begun to acquire large numbers of unmanned surface vessels, unmanned underwater vessels. They're still a little bit slower than what they need to be to operate at the speed of relevance. But I think that they finally understand that their gap closure in the Indo-PACOM is going to be attritable platforms, and, for that matter, in many instances, to expendable platforms. I don't know about you, but I'm not even super clear on what kind of drones the Navy wants or is thinking about for its future force. I've always kind of assumed that with the Navy, like its submarines, its drone ambitions and prototypes are super secretive. So I asked Brent Sadler what he knows about these things. Sadler: I've walked the deck of the medium, the large, unmanned&mdash;I'm not really sure. Navy keeps changing how they can't characterize it&mdash;but the Mariner, so it was up in Annapolis a couple years ago. And it's optionally manned. It can operate unmanned or or, or with a completely unmanned kind of situation. It can carry, or has actually carried SM-6 missiles that they've launched and taken out targets in exercises two years ago. So these things are lethal. We do have the capability to actually employ them with lethal intent, if we want to. The key thing is, the Navy and Congress have not really put the money down and made the bet. And that's, I think another thing for the first 100 days, is just go ahead and buy six of these and like Task Force 59 out in the Persian Gulf, just start operating them. And the learning, that will accelerate the learning and accelerate the knowledge to do better within second flight of six of these large unmanned surface vessels. That'll improve, but we don't have time to wait for perfect, because that's going to get us into a situation, a crisis and confrontation with China. There's a whole family of smaller unmanned systems &mdash; from drones moving cargo, up to 200 pounds of cargo, between ships and also to shore. There are, of course, robotic systems under the sea that are able to monitor and to sense, you know, hostile submarines. But also, there's shipping. It is an inevitable reality of the battlefield, as the Ukrainians have proved in the Black Sea, but we have to replicate rapidly what we saw with Fifth Fleet, the Task Force 59, and we need to get these platforms out to sea. And I don't buy the notion that we can't operate them near the Chinese. You can operate in the Philippine Sea. Again, knowing these waters very well, they're not a whole lot of shipping. There's some big gaps of just wide open ocean that are far from shipping lanes. You could operate these in, like a picket duty with long range strike or even air and missile defense. For Guam in the Northern Marianas, there's lots of missions and roles that they could fill and relieve our destroyers to go operate much closer up inside the first island chain, day to day today that we just haven't taken the risk. It's a risk aversion. So it takes a leader to push and to get the institution moving in the right direction, and they're right on the cusp of it. It might be tempting to think the 'golden age&rdquo; of U.S. shipbuilding was in WW2, but that's not true. You have to go back even further. Before WW1. Before the turn of the century. Before the Civil War even&mdash;from 1840 to 1860. That's what we'll get into in our next episode&hellip; A big thanks to our contributors&mdash;Matt Paxton, Brent Sadler, Mark Montgomery, and Rep. Rob Wittman.
