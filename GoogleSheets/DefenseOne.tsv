Intelligence IGs head for the exits ahead of Trump’s return	Two intelligence watchdogs are leaving their positions ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's second term. Inspector General of the Intelligence Community Thomas Monheim and CIA IG Robin Ashton are set to depart around the start of the new year. The news was first reported by the Project on Government Oversight. Monheim has been serving in the position since 2020 when Trump fired his predecessor, Michael Atkinson, who drew White House condemnation after he alerted Congress in September 2019 &mdash; as required by law &mdash; to the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump's first impeachment. 'On Nov. 13, I informed the president of my intent to resign as the inspector general of the intelligence community, effective Jan. 3, 2025. Serving as the IC IG has been a tremendous privilege and the pinnacle of my more than 30 years of military and civilian service spanning seven different presidents,&rdquo; Monheim said in a statement to Government Executive. 'I am incredibly proud of the IC IG team's tireless and selfless efforts to conduct independent, objective and nonpartisan oversight of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and across the IC. As a result, the ODNI and the IC are better and the nation is safer.&rdquo; Over a span of six weeks in 2020, Trump fired five inspectors general, including Atkinson. Ashton said that, after more than 38 years of public service, she would retire from the federal government at the end of the year. 'It has been the pinnacle of my rewarding career to serve alongside the dedicated officers at CIA for the last three and a half years as the CIA inspector general,&rdquo; she said in a statement to Government Executive. 'I have every confidence that the exceptional work of the Office of the Inspector General will continue to have a positive impact on behalf of the American people.&rdquo; Trump has nominated his former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe as CIA director and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, as DNI in his new administration. Some current and former intelligence officials have criticized Gabbard for her record of Russia-aligned public statements.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/intelligence-igs-head-exit-trumps-return/401203/	2024-11-20T18:37:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/20/112024_Getty_GovExec_CIA_1/large.jpg
Why Ukrainian soldiers came to Idaho to study nuclear forensics	It's a long way from the Donbas region of Ukraine to Idaho, but Ukrainian officials recently made the trip to learn about collecting evidence after a nuclear attack. Ten soldiers from the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 10 members from the Security Services of Ukraine spent a week at Idaho National Laboratory learning and practicing debris collection techniques for post-detonation nuclear forensics. Nuclear forensics, which includes the science of determining the origin of nuclear materials used in a detonation, is an essential element of the United States' deterrence strategy. Being able to trace the source of material used in a nuclear device allows the U.S. to credibly hold accountable any state complicit in an act of nuclear terrorism. While Ukraine has practiced nuclear forensics as part of its counter-nuclear-smuggling efforts, officials sought to learn more about how to apply nuclear forensics in a post-detonation scenario after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. INL's decades of research, expertise and support to U.S. nuclear forensics operations position it as one of the few entities capable of providing Ukraine with nuclear forensics support. Although it is highly unlikely that Russia would use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, 'Ukraine takes the threat of a Russian nuclear attack very seriously,&rdquo; said INL's David Chichester, a directorate fellow who develops radiation measurement systems and consults on nuclear counterproliferation and forensics. 'They have tackled it aggressively because the threat is real to them,&rdquo; he said. While the Ukrainian visitors got a chance to enjoy Idaho Falls' American heartland amenities during their stay, the war was never far from their minds. During their time in the U.S., they would often be alerted in real time about attacks back home. During the training exercises, Ukrainian officials were assisted by experts with years of nuclear forensics training expertise from INL, Argonne National Laboratory, the Kansas City National Security Campus&mdash;Albuquerque, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Nevada National Security Site, and the National Nuclear Security Administration. NNSA, a semi-autonomous agency within the U.S. Department of Energy, is responsible for the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, naval nuclear propulsion, and nuclear nonproliferation and counterterrorism programs. Clad in personal protective equipment at locations throughout INL's Research and Education Campus in Idaho Falls, Ukrainian officials learned proper techniques for sweeping areas, gathering dust and debris, placing it into radiation shielded storage casks called lead 'pigs,&rdquo; and loading the parcels into vehicles for transport. The Ukrainian delegation said the training was effective and useful. 'We wish to thank you for inviting us to this training and hosting us in your city,&rdquo; said one participant, speaking through a translator. 'The [response capabilities] we are learning this week will absolutely be implemented when we return home to Ukraine.&rdquo; The participants' names have been withheld for security purposes. 'The support and training you are providing to us means more than you know,&rdquo; said another Ukrainian official. Instructors from the national labs and NNSA who led the training exercise are part of the Department of Energy Forensics Operations team. These U.S. experts are on call 365 days a year to collect nuclear detonation debris samples for analysis. They can respond at a moment's notice during an emergency. DFO uses specialized aircraft and equipment to establish mobile command centers and forensics laboratories anywhere in the world. The materials they collect may be brought to the U.S. for further analysis. DFO's capabilities are especially relevant given Russia's reputation for exploiting misinformation. It's important for Ukraine to possess the ability to incontrovertibly prove the source of nuclear materials. INL and NNSA's nuclear forensics expertise helped advance their capabilities. DFO has evolved in response to Ukraine's ongoing conflict. 'The relationship with Ukraine has prompted some changes in DFO,&rdquo; said C.J. Johnson, senior adviser to the Department of Energy's NNSA Ukraine Task Force. 'We had to turn responders into teachers,&rdquo; he said. 'The point of this [exercise] is to build the capability for collecting high-quality samples for analysis,&rdquo; said Johnson. 'Until two years ago Ukraine had no capability of this kind.&rdquo; The U.S. began conducting post-detonation forensics exercises close to 20 years ago when the National Security Council asked what would happen if the country needed to collect debris for analysis after a nuclear detonation. Around that time, INL's national security and nuclear nonproliferation capabilities in support of NNSA were starting to grow, leading to the first ground debris collection exercise in 2005. Since then, INL has hosted annual nuclear forensics training exercises for U.S. first responders in case the unthinkable should happen. 'There is no better place in the world to do nuclear forensics training than the national labs,&rdquo; said Johnson. 'The capabilities and expertise the labs &mdash; including INL &mdash; have for conducting real-world training is unmatched.&rdquo; In addition to INL and the NNSA's Office of Nuclear Forensics, the Ukrainian team's visit to INL was supported by the U.S. Department of State. Nuclear forensics training events provide an opportunity for scientists and security experts to practice the tactics, techniques and procedures they would employ following a real-world nuclear attack. The relationships and mutual trust developed while working together through realistic scenarios are equally valuable. 'You can't maintain a proficient level of this capability if you don't train,' Chichester said.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/11/why-ukrainian-soldiers-came-idaho-study-nuclear-forensics/401100/	2024-11-20T15:39:49-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/20/8391038/large.jpg
DIU announces software awards for AI-enabled drone swarms	The Defense Innovation Unit on Wednesday announced new prototype awards for software to enable better command and control and autonomous drone swarm operations. It's part of the Replicator program, which is working to field large numbers of cheap, highly autonomous drones to deter Chinese military activity in the Pacific. 'DIU made prototype awards to Swarm Aero, Anduril Industries, and L3Harris Technologies,' the organization said in a statement. These awards are part of the Autonomous Collaborative Teaming, or ACT, effort, which is seeking 'automated coordination of swarms of hundreds or thousands of uncrewed assets across multiple domains.&rdquo; While the Replicator program's drone systems get lots of attention, the ability to integrate them together at the software level is every bit as important, Aditi Kumar, the deputy director for strategy, policy, and national security partnerships at DIU, said earlier this month at a Defense One event. And, she said, DIU's short calendar for testing new drone integration platforms and software is another challenge. 'We are buying this capability independently of the hardware systems, and so we need to be able to have open architectures, government-owned architectures, to ensure that the software that we're bringing in is one being upgraded and then integrated into all manner of hardware systems, which may then require their own hardware fixes to enable that. That is something we're going to test out as we mature these integrated enablers. We are going to demonstrate their integration with the other systems in the Replicator portfolio across multiple domains, and we'll be able to test that out.&rdquo; Anduril's Lattice platform is one of the winners. In a statement, Anduril said it has completed a variety of real-world tests with military partners, such as in the U.S. Pacific Fleet's Integrated Battle Problem 24.1 exercise, in which Navy operators used Lattice to integrate more than a dozen uncrewed systems and data feeds. Another example is CENTCOM's Desert Guardian 1.0, where Anduril integrated '10 different sensor teams into Lattice, merging real-time data sharing, fusion, and tasking across diverse sensor systems&rdquo; to more quickly detect airborne and other threats. And in Army's EDGE23 test, Lattice allowed a single soldier to 'manage an integrated team of multiple uncrewed aircraft to locate, identify, and destroy a surface-to-air missile site,&rdquo; according to Anduril. [[Related Posts]] DIU also made awards for part of another Replicator-related effort dubbed Opportunistic, Resilient & Innovative Expeditionary Network Topology, or ORIENT, to ensure communications for drones in a heavy electromagnetic warfare environment. The awards went to Viasat, Aalyria, Higher Ground, and IoT/AI. Will Replicator prevent World War III? The Defense Department launched Replicator specifically to deter Chinese military action in the Pacific. At a Pallas Foundation event on Wednesday, Adm. Sam Paparo, the head of U.S. INDOPACOM, discussed the role that autonomous systems could play in deterrence&mdash;a role similar to the one Ukraine's maritime drones are playing in the Black Sea. 'One need not actually achieve complete air and maritime superiority over a space when an adversary is trying to gain it. One need only perhaps deny it to the other, and can potentially do that at low cost,&rdquo; Paparo said. 'We've seen that actually in practice, and have learned from that, from Ukraine in the Black Sea, where a Slava cruiser was destroyed and sunk [by a Ukrainian sea drone.] And it's important that we learn that lesson from that and the Black Sea.&rdquo; Paparo also outlined how he might use different levels of autonomy for different missions as part of that deterrence effort. For offensive missions, maintaining human control is critical, he said. But for fleet defense, more autonomy could help speed reaction time. 'For instance, if a raid of ballistic missiles is approaching your unit, this is a time when you would want your system on full auto, carrying those arrows that are coming in. On the other hand, if you are executing a complex attack on an enemy system, this would be a case where you want to do so very circumspectly, because you're taking lives.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/11/diu-announces-software-awards-ai-enabled-drone-swarms/401197/	2024-11-20T13:45:12-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/20/8549751/large.jpg
The D Brief: More long-range missiles target Russia’s Kursk; Bide...	Developing: Ukraine's military used British-supplied cruise missiles to strike targets inside Russia for the first time, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing parts of the Storm Shadow missiles that were allegedly spotted in Russia's Kursk region this week. If confirmed, the action follows Ukraine's recent use of U.S.-provided long-range missiles to strike Russian targets in the Kursk region as well. Worth noting: Few observers believe these long-range authorizations and strikes will alter the course of the war. In fact, as Jack Watling of the London-based Royal United Services Institute wrote on Tuesday, 'Ukraine fired the majority of the UK's Storm Shadow arsenal at Russian deep targets in 2023 yet failed to degrade Russian command and control to a level that the Ukrainian military could take advantage of.&rdquo; What they could lead to, however, are 'exploitable opportunities in Russia's defenses,&rdquo; said Watling. 'The question is whether the Ukrainian military is capable of exploiting the gap created.&rdquo; New: Ukraine's president says if President-elect Trump cuts military funding to Kyiv, 'I think we will lose&rdquo; against Russia's invasion troops. 'We will fight. We have our production, but it's not enough to prevail,&rdquo; he said in an interview with Trey Yingst of Fox that aired Tuesday. Also new: President Joe Biden just authorized the transfer of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine, which is a policy shift that reflects changing Russian tactics and Ukrainian needs, Defense One's Bradley Peniston reports while traveling with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in the Asia-Pacific. Fine print: The mines will be 'non-persistent,&rdquo; which means they become inert after a set amount of time &mdash; 'anywhere from 4 hours to 2 weeks,&rdquo; an administration official said. The idea is to help Ukraine repel Russian advances that have in recent months been led by dismounted troops instead of armored vehicles, Austin said. SecDef Austin: 'What we've seen most recently is because the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting, they've kind of changed their tactics a bit, and they don't lead with their mechanized forces anymore. They lead with the dismounted forces who are able to close and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanized forces,&rdquo; Austin told reporters. Expert reax: 'I wouldn't be surprised if this decision has a greater effect on the battlefield than the policy change on ATACMS strikes into Russian territory,&rdquo; said Rob Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Continue reading, here. And the Pentagon announced a new $275 million aid package for Ukraine, which includes HIMARS rockets, Javelin missiles, and more, U.S. defense officials announced in Laos on Wednesday. The officials were visiting Laos for a meeting of ASEAN defense ministers, which is an annual conference of military leaders from the region and beyond. More, here. More on the ATACMS decision: 'I suspect the Biden administration did this for two reasons,&rdquo; said retired Navy Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'First to help preserve their legacy and not leave office with this glaring deficiency,&rdquo; he told Defense One on Monday. 'And second because this makes things easier for President Trump as he does not have to make this decision and it puts increased pressure on Putin before any negotiations.&rdquo; However, he added, 'In both cases this would benefit from more expanded geographic permissions.&rdquo; Second opinion: 'Militarily, the targets are easy to determine,&rdquo; said RUSI's Jack Watling. 'Destroying Russia's ammunition dumps, or the fuelling and arming points for its strike aircraft, or Russian tactical-operational missile complexes, would have a useful effect in reducing the casualties being suffered by the Ukrainians, and thereby contribute to stabilizing the front. But these are not the targets that will yield leverage in negotiations,&rdquo; he warned. Those include 'economic and industrial&rdquo; facilities, and 'to be effective, their use must be part of a wider strategy that targets a specific target set,&rdquo; Watling said. It's not yet clear that Ukraine is capable of pulling that kind of strategy off. What more could the Biden administration do to help Ukraine before leaving office on January 20? It could expand the ATACMS authority to 'JASMM air to surface missiles in Russian territory as well,&rdquo; Montgomergy said. He also advises 'more promises of security assistance &mdash; from both the U.S. and Europe &mdash; and possibly as a loan in the future,&rdquo; and recommends 'increased pressure on Russian oil exports to include sanctions enforcement on the &lsquo;shadow fleet' delivering Russian oil and natural gas.&rdquo; That would put President-elect Trump in a better negotiating position ahead of what he says will be brokered talks between the leaders of Ukraine and Russia after inauguration in two months' time.

Pacific SecDef visited a South China Sea island to show U.S. support for its regional ally the Philippines, Defense One's Bradley Peniston reported Tuesday on location. That location is known as WESCOM, or the Western Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. It sits on the island of Palawan, some 200 miles off the main Philippine archipelago. From this camp of low buildings under rows of towering palm trees, WESCOM directs and supports the joint forces that keep tabs on and maintain a presence in the waters to the west, Peniston writes. One young officer in the lobby said he'd spent seven months on one of the outposts that dot the sea. Big-picture consideration: The past three months have seen an uptick in Chinese aggression, U.S. and Philippine officials said. 'They have been more aggressive in denying us access to our exclusive economic zone in the West Philippine Sea. They have really placed a lot of these pseudo-military vessels disguised as Coast Guard vessels and maritime militia vessels in the areas of the West Philippine Sea. They have been very aggressive in their information operations against the Philippines,&rdquo; Manila's Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro told reporters. While at WESCOM, SecDef Austin visited a brand-new intelligence-fusion center and received a demonstration of an uncrewed surface vessel, both purchased with U.S. security-assistance funds.

Industry Lastly today: U.S. satellite suppliers are struggling to meet the Pentagon's timelines for its plans to build a network of hundreds of military satellites in low-Earth orbit. And now the first set of operational satellites in the Space Development Agency's big plans aren't expected for another six months, Defense One's Audrey Decker reported Tuesday. The program is called the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. Its first satellites were supposed to begin launching in September; but SDA Director Derek Tournear said that will now be delayed until March or April. 'It's clear that a lot of the subcontractors, they weren't able to scale up as quickly as they had, and we've been working very closely with them,&rdquo; Tournear said at an event hosted by the Mitchell Institute in Virginia on Tuesday. 'We have put contracts in place with some of those subcontractors to help incentivize them, to build them up,&rdquo; he said. SDA is also looking into possible work with SpaceX since Elon Musk's company 'can launch faster than once a month,&rdquo; Tournear said. 'The space vehicles will be ready faster than that once we start the initial launching, but it's just a matter of how fast will it take us to get through launch and early operations,&rdquo; he told the audience. Why the hurry? The U.S. already has a constellation of satellites for missile warning and tracking, which detects launches and follows weapons as they maneuver, Decker reports. But now, SDA wants new missile tracking satellites that can direct interceptors as well, Tournear said. Continue reading, here.

US to begin providing anti-personnel mines to Ukraine	VIENTIANE, Laos&mdash;The United States will begin to send anti-personnel land mines to Ukraine, a Biden administration policy shift that reflects changing Russian tactics and Ukrainian needs, a U.S. official said here. The mines will be 'non-persistent&rdquo;&mdash;that is, they become inert after a set amount of time&mdash;after &rdquo;anywhere from 4 hours to 2 weeks,&rdquo; said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'The United States has sought commitments from the Ukrainians on their use, to further limit the risk to civilians. We expect Ukraine would use these mines on its own territory. The Ukrainians are committed to not employing them in areas populated with their own civilians,&rdquo; the official said. Asked about the not-yet-officially-announced policy shift, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the mines would help Ukraine repel Russian advances that have in recent months been led by dismounted troops instead of armored vehicles. 'What we've seen most recently is because the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting, they've kind of changed their tactics a bit, and they don't lead with their mechanized forces anymore. They lead with the dismounted forces who are able to close and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanized forces,&rdquo; Austin told reporters here. The Ukrainians have been making their own land mines, and U.S.-supplied nonpersistent ones would be safer, he said, adding that the United States has long provided Ukraine with anti-tank mines. The unnamed U.S. official noted that Russia has sown thousands of anti-personnel mines in Ukraine; few if any are non-persistent. 'On the note of Russia's mines being littered throughout eastern Ukraine, we are already providing post-conflict remediation for mines and unexploded ordinance will already be required for eastern Ukraine. We will continue to support Ukraine's efforts on this,&rdquo; the official said. In 2022, the Biden administration decided to 'align its policy concerning use&rdquo; of antipersonnel landmines 'outside of the Korean Peninsula&rdquo; with key provisions of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction&mdash;commonly known as the Ottawa Convention. The convention requires states to stop making, using, and transferring anti-personnel land mines, and to destroy any stockpiled mines except for the 'minimum number absolutely necessary&rdquo; for training purposes, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/us-begin-providing-anti-personnel-mines-ukraine/401177/	2024-11-20T04:37:08-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/20/mines_GettyImages_2184757645/large.jpg
New $275M Ukraine-aid package to include HIMARS ammo	VIENTIANE, Laos&mdash;A new quarter-billion-dollar package of military aid to Ukraine will include HIMARS rockets, Javelin missiles, and more, a defense official said here. 'Later today, the White House will be announcing additional security assistance for Ukraine worth up to $275 million to meet critical battlefield needs, and that will include munitions for rocket systems and artillery and anti-tank weapons,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters here. Austin is in town for the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus, an annual conference of defense leaders from the region and beyond. A defense official said the package will include: Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition; 60mm and 81mm mortar rounds; Unmanned aerial systems; Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; Small arms and ammunition; Demolitions equipment and munitions; Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear-protective equipment; and Spare parts, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation. The arms, ammunition, and gear will be drawn from Pentagon stocks under the presidential drawdown authority for military assistance for Ukraine. An Oct. 31 fact sheet published by the State Department said the U.S. had provided more than $64.1 billion in military assistance since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, on top of about $2.8 billion provided since its initial invasion in 2014. It also said the emergency presidential drawdown authority had been used 55 times since August 2021, sending Ukraine aid worth a total of about $31.7 billion from DoD stockpiles.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/new-275m-ukraine-aid-package-include-himars-ammo/401176/	2024-11-20T03:50:01-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/20/himars_GettyImages_1494251893/large.jpg
What Ukraine can now do with longer-range US missiles	The outgoing Biden administration has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles to strike deeper into Russia territory, according to reports citing White House officials. The move comes amid concern in the West that Moscow &ndash; aided by the influx of thousands of North Korean fighters &ndash; might be preparing a major counteroffensive to regain lost territory in the Kursk region of Russia. But how big a deal is the Biden decision? And could it change the trajectory of the conflict in Eastern Europe? The Conversation U.S. turned to Benjamin Jensen, a professor at American University and the Marine Corps University School of Advanced Warfighting, for answers. The Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, are short-range ballistic missiles that can travel a lot farther than the weapons previously at Kyiv's disposal. We aren't talking about new technology. ATACMS have been around as a concept since the late 1970s and 1980s and first came into production toward the end of the Reagan era, around 1986. By the mid-1990s they were in service, being first deployed by the U.S. in 1991 as part of Operation Desert Storm. ATACMS have a range of approximately 190 miles. That distance is longer than British-supplied Storm Shadow and French-supplied Scalp cruise missiles, which have a range of 155 miles. Not only do ATACMS go a lot farther, they also travel very fast &ndash; at Mach 3, or three times the speed of sound, making them harder to intercept. Depending on where they are fired from, ATACMS can be difficult for radar systems to detect. The other benefit, in this regard, is that ATACMS are not reliant on GPS positioning. Moscow has had success in jamming and blunting the effectiveness of other weapons that depend on GPS. But ATACMS can switch to an inertia guidance system, based on gyroscopes, to avoid GPS jamming tactics. The newly authorized missiles also can carry a heavy payload of up to 500 pounds &ndash; enough to create a huge crater on impact. ATACMS' range, terminal velocity and size of warhead could potentially make a huge difference in the current conflict. It means that Ukraine would have the capability to conduct deep strikes on Russian territory. In addition, U.S. authorization of their use by Ukraine in Russia would, in theory, also make it easier for other allies to transfer ATACMS to Kyiv. Nearby Poland and Romania have them, as do South Korea and Australia. Authorization by the Biden administration could give those governments the green light to supply the missiles to Ukraine, too. Why was this longer-range weapon approved now? Washington's decision comes as Russian troop numbers are being swelled by North Korean fighters &ndash; the 10,000 North Koreans reportedly in Russia at present is likely just a first wave. This has coincided with a build up of 50,000 Russian troops near Kursk &ndash; the key Russian territory taken by Ukraine earlier this year. Over the past few days, there have been what I would call 'probing attacks&rdquo; by Russia in the area in preparation for what could be a much larger assault to recapture the territory. In advance of that counter-push, North Korean and Russian troops will need to marshal together before moving to the front &ndash; and they will be doing so in assembly areas deeper within Russia. The military thinking is, if you can hit troops in those deep areas, you can seriously disrupt Moscow's operational reach. And ATACMS are perfect for attacks on tactical assembly areas &ndash; their size, speed and range makes them harder to intercept. Certainly if I were advising the Ukrainian military, I would be looking to use ATACMS to hit both assembly areas, ammunition sites and airfields. What appears to be the thinking in Washington? If I had to bet, I'd say there are still deep concerns of escalation but growing acknowledgment that we are entering a transition phase in the conflict. President-elect Donald Trump has signaled that he wants to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. I assess that authorizing ATACMS now suggests the Biden administration is trying to give Ukraine a better hand during those negotiations. Alternatively, the current White House may have looked at the growing pro-Moscow support of North Korean and concluded that allowing Ukraine to hit North Korean troops before they can be deployed to the front is the only way to offset the advantage this gives Russia. Besides troops, Pyongyang has sent more artillery shells to Russia than the European Union has to Ukraine. These rationales are not mutually exclusive. It also appears that to the Biden administration, the imperatives outweigh any perceived risks of the U.S. getting drawn further into the conflict or of an escalatory response from Russian President Vladimir Putin. What does this signal about the state of the war? My reading of the conflict &ndash; and you are getting a sense of this through recent statements form Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy &ndash; is that Ukraine may only have until the end of the next campaign season, that is spring to summer 2025, to maintain its position. This is due to the ongoing cost that fighting is having on Ukraine. Kyiv is experiencing problems mobilizing sufficient troops &ndash; it has had to increasingly turn to conscription, something Ukraine had tried to avoid. This isn't to say that Ukraine has run completely out of steam. But it will struggle to take more Russian-controlled territory. Capturing territory in Kursk was a major achievement, but it was a one-off, high-risk gamble. And fighting in parts of Ukraine's east occupied by Russia is proving difficult. So is this about helping Ukraine keep control of Kursk? The reporting around Biden's authorization of ATACMS suggests that Washington is telling Ukraine that the missiles can't be deployed everywhere, just in Kursk. If Trump does have the ability to force people to talk, as he says he does, that will not stop the fighting. Fighting will continue until the parties agree to a cease-fire, and even after that, it could flare up at anytime. For these reasons, I think you will see Russia throw everything at Kursk, militarily. And Ukraine will do everything it can to keep control of territory there &ndash; Kyiv knows that Kursk would be its biggest bargaining chip should it come to negotiations. Did Trump's victory play a role in Biden's thinking? I really think that the decision to authorize ATACMS was more about the reality on the ground in Ukraine than politics in the United States. That said, the president-elect's stated push for negotiations as a way to settle the Ukraine-Russia conflict may well have escalated the decision.

Russian nuclear doctrine change does not indicate imminent attack...	The United States sees 'no indications&rdquo; that Russia is prepping for a nuclear attack, the Pentagon said Tuesday, despite the Kremlin's announcement of a change in nuclear posture. And while the doctrine change is alarming, experts say, it doesn't mean the world is on the brink of nuclear war. The Russian government on Tuesday announced a broadening of its nuclear doctrine, which allows for the use of nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear attack, and allows for strikes against Western nations that are supplying weapons to countries engaged in conflict with Russia&mdash;namely Ukraine. The doctrine was originally changed in September, but Russian government officials are now linking the public change to reported Ukrainian attacks with U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles on Russian territory. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit in Brazil, said the Ukrainian use of the missiles 'is a signal that they want escalation. Using such sophisticated missiles without the Americans is impossible. Putin warned about this and about how our position will change.&rdquo; Michael Kofman, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Defense One the new doctrine 'emphasizes that the Russian president decides when to use nuclear weapons, which ultimately is what matters. In the end, this is intentionally ambiguous language, intended to signal and deter, while much comes down to one person's interpretation of this criteria.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] Still, some Western observers believe the doctrine change indicates Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing to respond to U.S. support for Ukraine with a nuclear escalation. Sean McFate, adjunct professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs, said in a statement: 'Putin has lowered the bar for Russian nuclear engagement, a clear signal to NATO to back off. It's a response to Biden's allowing Ukraine to use long-range American missiles against Russian targets. It is difficult to know when Putin is bluffing or not. Biden is rolling the nuclear dice on the eve of his transition. It's completely reckless.&rdquo; However, in response to questions about the doctrine change, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters Monday: 'We don't have any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon within Ukraine.&rdquo; Other experts on Russian nuclear forces agree the doctrine change doesn't necessarily mean nuclear war is imminent, despite the announcement's language and timing. 'I caution against the view that Russia would never escalate, but there's still quite a lot of steps to go,&rdquo; Gabriela Rosa Hernandez, a specialist in Russian security policy at CNAS, told Defense One. 'Overall, I don't think these updates represent significant/true insights to Russia's nuclear threshold, nor its likelihood to resort to nuclear use. But it is a representation of an emerging consensus that Moscow must employ more assertive and creative measures when it comes to its nuclear signaling to compel the West and show how far it is willing to go to accomplish its goals in Ukraine,&rdquo; Hernandez said in an email. 'Russia is embracing ideas thrown around that would improve coercive credibility.&rdquo; Jeffrey Edmonds, an adjunct senior fellow at CNAS's transatlantic security program, told Defense One he thinks there is 'still significant space between where we are at and nuclear use,&rdquo; and noted the Russians have multiple avenues to threaten the West for its continued support of Ukraine. 'What this actually means for escalation is that we should not be surprised to see horizontal escalation&mdash;geographic e.g. arming Houthis, or vertical e.g. cables, [anti-satellite tests]... Put another way, we should be surprised Putin has not started killing Americans in response to the combat enablers we have provided Ukraine, allowing it to kill thousands of Russian soldiers.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/russian-nuclear-doctrine-change-does-not-indicate-imminent-attack-pentagon-says/401170/	2024-11-19T16:01:17-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/19/GettyImages_2185015348/large.jpg
Next launch of SDA’s satellite constellation pushed to spring	The first set of operational satellites in the Space Development Agency's future orbital network will be launched about six months late, as suppliers have struggled to meet the Pentagon's timeline. Satellites in 'Tranche 1&rdquo; of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, a layered network of hundreds of military satellites in low-Earth orbit, were supposed to begin launching in September, but will be delayed to March or April, said Derek Tournear, director of the Space Development Agency. Manufacturers were 'a little optimistic&rdquo; in their initial assessments, and haven't been able to reach the production levels necessary on components such as optical terminals, Tournear said at a Mitchell Institute event today. However, the agency will still hit its goal to launch within two years of Tranche 0, he said. Tranche 0, which comprised demonstration satellites for PWSA, began launching in April 2023 after a six-month delay due to COVID-related supply chain problems. 'It's clear that a lot of the subcontractors, they weren't able to scale up as quickly as they had, and we've been working very closely with them. We have put contracts in place with some of those subcontractors to help incentivize them, to build them up. We've gotten involved with them and helped to try to build up their processes, as well as the primes. Some of the primes have sent people to their subcontractors on site to help build them up,&rdquo; Tournear said. But despite initial supply chain woes, industry is starting to reach the right production pace, Tournear said. And the agency is looking at other ways to get back on track going forward, he said, noting SpaceX's rapid launch cadence. [[Related Posts]] 'We know SpaceX can launch faster than once a month, so we can bring this in. The space vehicles will be ready faster than that once we start the initial launching, but it's just a matter of how fast will it take us to get through launch and early operations and pull that in,&rdquo; Tournear said. The plan for Tranche 1 is to launch once a month for 10 months, he said. SDA will launch 300 to 400 satellites over the next few years in Tranche 1 and 2. For Tranche 3, industry will need to develop some new capabilities, Tournear previewed&mdash;including satellites that can track and defend against missiles. 'We really want industry to tell us the state-of-the-art and the state of manufacturing readiness for a combined missile tracking-missile defense satellite,&rdquo; he said. The U.S. already has a constellation of satellites for missile warning and tracking, which detects launches and follows weapons as they maneuver. Now, SDA wants new missile tracking satellites that can direct interceptors as well, Tournear said. 'Defense takes that one step further, and says not only can we detect maneuvering missiles, we can detect them to such accuracy that I can send that data down to an interceptor with no other sensors needed,&rdquo; he said. Tournear's agency is already working on programs to address advanced missile threats, like the FOO Fighter program and the 'Gamma variant' of the Tranche 2 transport layer, but those follow a different class of targets than the missile tracking-missile defense architecture in Tranche 3, Tournear said, without disclosing the specific threats each program will address. The agency aims to launch nine satellites that can do both missile tracking and missile defense, in addition to 40 or 45 satellites focused just on missile tracking, Tournear said. In total, Tranche 3 will put about 200 satellites in the constellation. Because these satellites are only built with a five-year life span, Tournear said, Tranche 3 satellites will be the first tranche to replace other satellites being decommissioned, in addition to fielding new capabilities.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/11/next-launch-sdas-satellite-constellation-pushed-spring/401168/	2024-11-19T15:55:51-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/19/8240636/large.jpg
SecDef visits South China Sea island to bolster Philippines and c...	PUERTO PRINCESA, Philippines&mdash;If the South China Sea is where Beijing is pushing most aggressively into allied territory, then WESCOM HQ is most directly in charge of pushing back. WESCOM&mdash;that is, the Western Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines&mdash;sits on the island of Palawan, some 200 miles off the main Philippine archipelago. The island is washed by the West Philippine Sea, which is what Manila calls its slice of the South China Sea. China's legal claim to the waters was rejected eight years ago by international courts, which has hardly slowed Beijing's efforts to gain de facto control by turning reefs into airbases, harassing Philippine vessels, waging information warfare, and more. Little surprise, then, that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin chose to come here on his fourth and final visit to the country, for a series of engagements that have seen him proclaim solidarity with Manila and criticism of Beijing. From this camp of low buildings under rows of towering palm trees, WESCOM directs and supports the joint forces that keep tabs on and maintain a presence in the waters to the west. One young officer in the lobby said he'd spent seven months on one of the outposts that dot the sea. The past three months have seen an uptick in Chinese aggressiveness, U.S. and Philippine officials said. 'It's the same story over and over again,&rdquo; Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro told reporters here on Tuesday. 'They have been more aggressive in denying us access to our exclusive economic zone in the West Philippine Sea. They have really placed a lot of these pseudo-military vessels disguised as Coast Guard vessels and maritime militia vessels in the areas of the West Philippine Sea. They have been very aggressive in their information operations against the Philippines.&rdquo; Beside him, Austin concurred. 'The behavior of the PRC has been concerning. You've heard me say that a number of times. They've used dangerous and escalatory measures to enforce their expansive South China Sea maritime claims,&rdquo; Austin said. 'We condemn dangerous actions by the PRC against lawful Philippine operations in the South China Sea...Again, we'll continue to work with our allies and make sure that we're doing the right thing to promote a secure and open Indo-Pacific.&rdquo; Austin had flown an hour from Manila to see that cooperation in action at WESCOM HQ. He visited a brand-new intelligence-fusion center and received a demonstration of an uncrewed surface vessel, both purchased with U.S. security-assistance funds. The latter had arrived in May, part of a package that included Martec T-12 and T-38 USVs and the command-and-control gear to operate them. The U.S. also dispatched Marine Staff Sgt. Logan Hampton to help the Philippine Navy detachment learn to operate their new remote eyes at sea. 'This stuff right here is all Philippines-owned,&rdquo; Hampton said, gesturing to a T-12 and two aerial drones in the yard. 'We help them with the interoperability and integration, but this is theirs, so I can't tell them, like, &lsquo;Hey, go do this, go do that.' It's all about building relationships and working by, with, and through the partners, and it's their show.&rdquo; For Austin's visit, the sailors put a T-12 up on blocks. The low, slender craft comes with autonomous collision-avoidance systems, carries either an optical camera or a sonar rig, has a range of about 39 miles, and can handle waves up to about three feet, Hampton said. 'So it's more for, like, port security, shoals, and, like, small channels and stuff like that, but it is basically a littoral monitoring station. You could just set it out there and let it kind of feed and get that picture back to the commanders on the Philippine side and the U.S. side,&rdquo; he said. 'One of them is actually on the water in Oyster Bay here. That's conducting surveys now.&rdquo; But when Austin emerged from briefings, the Philippine sailors showed him how they were controlling a T-38 in Subic Bay, some 350 miles to the north. Hampton said the U.S. military has also begun operating Martec USVs, and the two navies are learning about their new gear together. 'We're procuring them for them at the same time as us. And even some of that stuff on there&rdquo;&mdash;he gestured to the T-12&mdash;'is a little bit ahead of what we have, just because of procurement and all that, but we are developing TTPs [techniques, tactics, and procedures] and everything else together,&rdquo; he said. 'We're doing AAR&mdash;after-action reviews&mdash;and we're just together, Phil and U.S. side, trying to develop this as quick as possible.&rdquo; In his press conference, Austin called the remote-controlled craft part of a larger effort to help better equip the Philippines military. 'The T-12 is one of several unmanned capabilities funded and delivered this year through U.S. security assistance,&rdquo; he said, standing before a mural emblazoned Defenders and Patriots of the Last Frontier. 'We expect to see many more platforms like this delivered with the $500 million in foreign military financing that I announced during my visit to the Philippines in July. This will help ensure that the Philippines has the capabilities that it needs to defend its rights and its sovereignty throughout its exclusive economic zone.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/secdef-visits-south-china-sea-island-bolster-philippines-and-check-china/401145/	2024-11-19T09:51:50-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/19/IMG_3361/large.jpg
The D Brief: ATACMS use in Russia?; Undersea cable cut in the Bal...	Ukrainian troops attacked an alleged weapons depot inside Russia using U.S.-provided ATACMS missiles on Tuesday, several news outlets (including Forbes Ukraine and RBC Ukraine) reported Tuesday, citing Russian and Ukrainian officials. A U.S. official confirmed the development in remarks to the New York Times. The targeted facility is near the town of Karachev in Russia's southwestern Bryansk region, which is more than 70 miles from Ukraine's borders. 'As of 02:30 that night, 12 secondary explosions and detonations were recorded in the area of ​​the target,&rdquo; Ukraine's military said on Telegram, without claiming ATACMS were used in the strike. Russia's defense ministry claimed to have shot down five out of six ATACMS missiles, and said falling debris started a fire, but no one was harmed, the Associated Press and Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty report. View a map showing the possible range of ATACMS, published Tuesday by RFE/RL, here. Eye in the sky: Russia's military has been fortifying airbases inside Russia since early October, a former Ukrainian soldier explained on social media Monday using satellite imagery. 'Both the new and existing revetments are being reinforced with what appears to be concrete blocks for added protection,&rdquo; he writes. 'It's unclear whether the Russians plan to add roof coverage or focus solely on strengthening the walls,&rdquo; he added. Also: 'Satellite images show major expansions at five complexes where Russia has made solid-fuel missile engines, indicating the Kremlin plans to significantly boost missile production as it pursues its war in Ukraine,&rdquo; Reuters reported Monday, citing the work of Fabian Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. 'The sites are in the Altai Republic in Siberia, Rostov in southern Russia, outside Moscow and St. Petersburg, and in Perm, in western Russia,&rdquo; the wire service reports. Related reading: 'Putin Lowers Russia's Threshold for Using Nuclear Arms,&rdquo; the New York Times reported Tuesday; 'Hungarian official criticizes Biden decision allowing Ukraine to use US weapons to strike Russia,&rdquo; AP reported from Budapest. Developing: Early Sunday, a key data cable was severed along the Baltic Sea between Germany and Finland. Berlin and Helsinki released a joint statement in response to the findings, which they said 'immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage [and] speaks volumes about the volatility of our times.&rdquo; 'Our European security is not only under threat from Russia&lsquo;s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors,&rdquo; the two countries' foreign ministries said. 'Safeguarding our shared critical infrastructure is vital to our security and the resilience of our societies,&rdquo; they added.

Coming soon: Germany will reportedly begin delivering 'several hundred&rdquo; one-way attack drones to Ukraine in December, German newspaper Bild reported recently. An estimated 4,000 of these drones are expected overall, Ukrainska Pravda reported Monday. The drones have some degree of autonomy and, as a result, are allegedly less susceptible to electronic interference. They're also reportedly much cheaper than U.S.-made Switchblade drones. More here.

On this day in 1943, the Nazis killed at least 6,000 Jews after a failed uprising at the Janowska concentration camp in modern-day Lviv, Ukraine. Around the Defense Department U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin signed a new defense pact with the Philippines to share classified intelligence during Austin's fourth and likely final trip to the Pacific, Defense One's Brad Peniston reports while traveling with the secretary. The agreement paves the way for a new coordination center at the Philippine Armed Force's headquarters, giving U.S. personnel the space to plan and operate with the Philippine military. The two countries have shared information for decades, but the pact is set to streamline the process and usher greater cooperation. Read more, here. Developing: U.S. Indo Pacific Command is building out a single network to connect nearly two dozen countries, Defense One's Lauren C. Williams reports.

Hampered by supply chain problems, workforce challenges, and a lack of capacity, U.S. shipyards are behind on orders for the Navy's Columbia and Virginia class submarines. And AUKUS, a pact to build subs for Australia, is driving more pressure on shipyards. There's 'untapped potential&rdquo; at some private ship maintenance yards, which the Navy could utilize for new construction, Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va, said at a recent Defense One event. Wittman also said the Navy needs to create incentives for shipyards to get work done on time, and penalties if they don't. Read more, here. New rocket startup Dawn Aerospace reached supersonic flight with a prototype aircraft, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reported Monday.

The door is now wide open for Aurora to become the world's highest and fastest flying aircraft too,&rdquo; company execs said. The test comes as the U.S. military races to develop highly maneuverable weapons that can reach hypersonic speeds. Read more, here. Trump (sort of) signals mass deportation strategy Lastly today: In a one-word social media post Monday, President-elect Trump seemed to confirm that once he takes office, he intends to declare a national emergency so that he can use U.S. military 'assets&rdquo; to carry out his plans to deport millions of people from the United States. The apparent confirmation came in the form of a 4 a.m. reply to a conservative activist on Trump's social media platform early Monday. 'TRUE!!!&rdquo; Trump wrote in response. Background: According to Trump advisors, there are several facets or possibilities within their broad plans that could involve the U.S. military in some form or fashion. One includes using military construction funds to build 'vast holding facilities that would function as staging centers&rdquo; for the people Trump wants to deport to await processing, according to his immigration advisor Stephen Miller. This possibility, with a procedural precedent in Trump's first term, seems most likely. Another idea is to use active duty troops to patrol the border and arrest people, 'invoking the [circa 1807] Insurrection Act to use troops as immigration agents,&rdquo; as the New York Times explained in August. This would seemingly be more difficult, as it would rely on the consent of congress to a larger degree than redistributing military construction funds. Relatedly, both active duty and National Guard troops already assist border patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border; however, their work is principally bureaucratic and logistical and does not involve active arrests. Trump's team appears eager to change that. In the meantime, as Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said Monday of possible changes in immigration enforcement under Trump, 'If the National Guard is providing transportation, they do that a lot already.&rdquo; Yet another idea from Trump himself is to use the Insurrection Act to have federal troops 'get crime out of our cities,&rdquo; with New York and Chicago, in particular. In a manner similar to Travis Bickle of the gritty 1970s film 'Taxi Driver,&rdquo; Trump said those cities are 'crime dens,&rdquo; and their Democrat governors are chiefly responsible. 'You look at what is happening to our country &mdash; we cannot let it happen any longer,&rdquo; Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa. 'Because you are not supposed to be involved in that, you just have to be asked by the governor or the mayor to come in; the next time, I am not waiting,&rdquo; Trump said. Expert reax: 'To my knowledge, there are no &lsquo;national emergency' authorities which permit the US military to carry out deportations,&rdquo; said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council. 'The National Emergencies Act is a specific law which unlocks specific authorities to do specific things &mdash; a president doesn't declare a national emergency and then become king. And &lsquo;use the military for deportations' isn't one of those specific things,&rdquo; he said. 'Last time, Trump invoked a specific emergency authority to unlock military construction funding &mdash; and direct more troops to do logistical support at the border,&rdquo; said Reichlin-Melnick. That's most likely the Trump administration's play in 2025 as well, he suggested; but nobody really knows just yet. One big problem for media covering plans like these from Trump and his advisors: They almost always lack specifics, and most seem to prefer 'mak[ing] grandiose pronouncements that are aimed at triggering the libs and making headlines,&rdquo; Reichlin-Melnick pointed out. One last thing about national emergencies: The U.S. is currently under more than three dozen of them, one of which goes back to 1979 (PDF).

Should the Navy lean on private repair shipyards to build subs fa...	As the Navy battles ongoing schedule delays, supply chain problems, and workforce challenges in its effort to produce more submarines, the service may need to turn to private repair shipyards to rebuild capacity, says the vice chair of the House Armed Services Committee. 'I would argue that there is some additional capability at existing yards. But one of the untapped potentials there are the ship maintenance yards,&rdquo; Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., said at a Defense One event. 'Ship maintenance yards have a whole bow wave of work that comes in, they get the work done, and then the work drops off.&rdquo; 'These private repair yards have a lot of capacity to do work in new construction while they are managing the repair work there&mdash;much of it is exactly the same. In fact, what we're seeing right now is the big yards using smaller contractors to build parts of those ships. So they'll build a panel that slides into a submarine&hellip;and parts for aircraft carriers, for other surface ships. We need to find more opportunities to do that.&rdquo; Wittman also suggested incentives to encourage shipyards to complete work on time, as well as penalties for missing strict timeframes. 'And then give them incentives to say, how do you diversify the ship building enterprise? How do you do more than just what you do in the yard?&rdquo; he said. [[Related Posts]] Earlier this year, the Navy set up a program office to focus on converting submarine industrial base efforts&mdash;including workforce and manufacturing technology&mdash;to submarine sustainment, surface shipbuilding, and repair, Matt Sermon, executive director of the strategic submarines program executive office, said at a Naval Submarine Symposium and industry update. Ship repair and maintenance were also prioritized in 2024 supplemental funding and the president's 2025 budget. 'The sustainment goals are getting [nuclear-powered submarines] to 80 percent, getting the Ohio to even past the end of its life in serving the nation. But every bit as important [are] the manufacturing technology efforts and the workforce efforts that [submarine industrial base] is doing&hellip;those are a rising tide that floats all boats,&rdquo; Sermon said. 'We seek to help the entire supply chain, right? To have material available, and to get the workers in the public shipyards, in the repair yards.&rdquo; U.S. shipyards are up to three years behind on submarine orders for the Navy's Columbia and Virginia class submarines, and the AUKUS deal to provide Australia with submarines has added even more pressure. To address that, the Navy wants to increase repairs of aging submarines to keep them operational for longer. That plan would mean producing one Columbia- and two Virginia-class submarines each year, while also ensuring 80 percent of attack submarines were operational and available each year, National Defense Magazine reported. The Navy previously floated the idea of repairing aging Ohio-class submarines to compensate for delays with the Columbia&mdash;a move that would help stabilize the U.S. sub-based nuclear capabilities. 'We all know that Columbia is struggling to stay on schedule. I mean that's no secret,&rdquo; Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe, director for the Navy's Strategic Systems Programs, told reporters during the Naval Submarine Symposium. 'Even when that first Columbia comes in the water, the weapon system is the same as what's on Ohio. So, if the Columbia were to be delayed, from a deterrence perspective, it's not going to impact what the Navy has to do, because I'll have an Ohio that has that system that fills that gap.&rdquo; The lack of skilled workers is also causing sub-building delays. The Defense Department is putting billions of dollars into rebuilding the submarine workforce&mdash;including an unconventional job advertising campaign&mdash;with tandem efforts in the Navy and the Pentagon. But officials are taking steps to make sure work isn't duplicated, Sermon said. In recent months, the Pentagon awarded Deloitte an up-to-$2.4 billion contract, followed by a nearly $1 billion contract with not-for-profit BlueForge Alliance to increase shipbuilding capacity by addressing workforce training and manpower shortages. Sermon said most of the program executive office's work with IBAS has focused on the workforce, and where it intersects with manufacturing technology. 'We're partnering with [DOD's Industrial Base Policy, or IBAS,] on what they're doing, but they are executing those [submarine industrial base] workforce efforts through the Deloitte contract,&rdquo; which is run by the defense secretary's office and the General Services Administration, Sermon told Defense One on Thursday at the Naval Submarine League's annual symposium. Sermon said those contracting efforts, while coordinated with the Navy's BlueForge contracts, don't overlap. 'We're making sure we're pushing the right direction, that our projects are integrated with each other,&rdquo; he said. For 2025, DOD requested $4 billion to improve the submarine-building workforce, infrastructure, supply chain, manufacturing technologies, and government oversight. The Pentagon has also highlighted its investments in the submarine industrial base as part of its industrial base strategy to deter adversaries in the Indo-Pacific. The Navy in September awarded and funded a $50 million direct contract with BlueForge, Sermon said. That contract has a $950 million ceiling, and the remainder is expected to be funded with 2025 appropriations once Congress passes a budget. The Navy also previously awarded BlueForge about $700 million as a subcontractor to General Dynamics Electric Boat to handle submarine industrial base workforce challenges, he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/should-navy-lean-private-repair-shipyards-build-subs-faster/401136/	2024-11-18T16:05:34-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/18/8725712/large.jpg
Classified-info pact sets stage for closer US-Philippines coopera...	MANILA, Philippines&mdash;To the strains of a military band playing Mariah Carey's Christmas song, U.S. and Philippine leaders broke ground on a new coordination center&mdash;and a new era of military cooperation as the country shifts its security focus from internal rebellion to Chinese incursion. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin flew into this sprawling metropolis of 24 million on Monday to sign a classified-information agreement, turn over a symbolic spadeful of earth, and meet the country's president and defense minister. The pact sets out rules for sharing classified intelligence and other data, including how to handle it, safeguard it, and report breaches, U.S. defense officials said. The two countries&mdash;treaty allies since 1951&mdash;have long shared information on various occasions and in various ways, but the agreement will greatly streamline the process, the officials said. Formally called the General Security of Military Information Agreement, or GSOMIA, the pact follows a more-or-less standard template used with at least 10 other U.S. security partners. But it was more than two years in the making because of the necessary negotiations, planning, training, infrastructure improvements, and more. 'We set the end of 2024 as the goal for concluding it,&rdquo; one senior defense official said on grounds of anonymity, and it 'will be a huge breakthrough in our ability to continue to deepen the cooperation that we have with the Philippines.&rdquo; At the signing ceremony, Philippines Minister of National Defense Gilbert Teodoro echoed that sentiment&mdash;and added that the agreement will also enable his country to pursue similar information-sharing pacts with other countries. The pact also lays the groundwork for the nascent Combined Coordination Center at Camp Aguinaldo, site of the Philippine Armed Forces' general headquarters. The building, to be erected in a vacant lot at the camp, will essentially give U.S. personnel&mdash;military as well as diplomatic&mdash;a purpose-built space where they can meet, plan, and operate with their Philippine counterparts. 'It was clear there was a need to take this out of, you know, random conference rooms and into a more dedicated center, especially one that had the right types of information feeds coming in both classified and unclassified information that we could see together,&rdquo; a second defense official said. 'I think certainly it will be where we do the bulk of our exercise planning, and when we conduct the exercises, it's going to be the op center&mdash;the hub where our forces assess what's going on for other operational activities that we do together, like our maritime cooperative activities in the South China Sea,&rdquo; as well as humanitarian operations. The center is to open next summer or early fall, the official said. Still to be determined is how many U.S. troops and officials might rotate through the center. 'I think the idea is it would have pretty large capacity to support some of our larger-scale exercises like Balakatan,&rdquo; the official said. 'It's somewhere where we would envision potentially having liaison officers in the future, once it is at full operating capacity.&rdquo; Austin also paid a call to the country's president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., at his official residence, the sprawling Malaca&ntilde;ang Palace. The defense secretary announced he had authorized U.S. forces&mdash;he didn't say which ones or how many&mdash;to provide humanitarian assistance to the country, just days after it was struck by a fourth typhoon in two weeks. The visit is Austin's fourth and likely final official visit to the Philippines. His visits&mdash;the most by any U.S. defense secretary&mdash;began during the administration of Rodrigo Duterte, who threatened to tilt the country's security alignment toward China before being brought back into the U.S. fold. Under Austin, U.S. forces have helped reduce the country's Maoist insurgency to a fraction of its former strength, even as China has increased its assertiveness in defiance of international courts. Austin is slated on Tuesday to travel to the island of Palawan for a Philippine Navy demonstration of T-12 unmanned surface vessels provided by the U.S. through Foreign Military Financing, then to travel on to Laos for the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting-Plus event.

INDOPACOM is replacing a pile of partner-nation networks with jus...	After years of building bespoke networks to connect with individual allied and partner militaries, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command is preparing to bring nearly two dozen countries into a single network in 2025. This INDOPACOM Mission Network, or IMN, is meant to replace the current unwieldy situation with a single seamless and secure platform that provides a common operating picture, file transfer, voice and chat tools. And while the IMN itself is meant for high-level information-sharing, it is intended to eventually enable new tactical networks as well. 'Most of our operations are not just joint, they are combined, they're multilateral, and this network of alliances and partnerships are, in fact, our key strategic asymmetric advantage,&rdquo; Adm. Sam Paparo, who leads the command, said last month at the AFCEA TechNet conference in Honolulu, Hawaii. Paparo said the IMN will make it 'so that we're operating off the same picture at all times, we're able to pass mission orders at all times, so that we're able to achieve unity of effort at all times.&rdquo; As INDOPACOM expanded its exercises with regional militaries over the years, it often tailored a new network for each new partner or ally, ultimately creating some 20 of these bespoke networks. This made adding partners to multilateral wargames increasingly complicated, said Brig. Gen. Mark Miles, who led the command's Command, Control, Communications and Cyber Directorate until a few months ago. 'For example, if we're doing an exercise with Japan and then at the last minute we include Australia, that's two different networks. We have a network we use to share with Japan, and we have a network we use to share with Australia. And, to collaborate across those two networks involved manual data movement, so thumb drives or CDs, or sometimes people looking at two different monitors,&rdquo; said Miles, who is now deputy commander of the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence. Over the past two years, Miles led the effort to create a network that could securely accommodate all, or at least most, of INDOPACOM's partners. In February, the IMN stood up with initial operating capacity for Keen Edge, a long-running U.S.-Japan exercise that this year included Australian forces for the first time. The network was subsequently approved for use by the Five Eyes, the intelligence alliance of the U.S., U.K., Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. IMN was also used in June's Valiant Shield, a larger multinational wargame designed to boost interoperability. Over the summer, South Korea was added to the IMN. Next up, the Philippines. 'We're currently participating in Exercise Bold Quest 24 as proof of concept for our Indo-Pacific Mission Network Tactical Data Center. And by 2025, in the summer, our mission network will reach full operational capability during Exercise Pacific Sentry,&rdquo; Paparo said. Once IMN gains approval by the National Security Agency, the admiral said, its zero trust architecture 'will be operationalized with our allies and partners.&rdquo; By the end of next year, INDOPACOM aims to connect 23 nations with key applications like phone and video calls, chat tools, file sharing, email, and a common operational picture. Miles said the IMN is built to accommodate other militaries' varying technical abilities and security requirements, using on-premise and cloud-based solutions. 'There are limitations to what we can put in the cloud. So I would say it's a hybrid. And I'll also say that we built and designed and architected the network with the ability to move it to the cloud at some time in the future. So we did that by building everything containerized,&rdquo; he said. Paparo said the new network would help with one of his command's top priorities: 'counter-C5ISR and T,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, 'the ability to dazzle, deceive, destroy&hellip;at times of our choosing, [our] adversary's ability to see and sense the battle space. And to do so while being interoperable with our allies and partners.&rdquo; Army's tactical network IMN's use focuses on a strategic or perhaps operational, level. But the network's architecture also makes it possible to link with platforms&mdash;dubbed 'tactical mission partner environments&rdquo;&mdash;that connect military units at lower echelons. The first of these will likely be deployed by U.S. Army Pacific Forces, which has been testing out preliminary equipment sets in various coalition exercises. 'It's iterative, and it's evolving,&rdquo; Gen. Charles Flynn, then the commander of U.S. Army Pacific, told reporters in May. &rdquo;Because the partner plays a role here, we have to do continual assessments of that architecture to make sure that we don't expose them or us the challenges with that communications network.&rdquo; The effort is being led by I Corps, the Army Pacific formation based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. The corps is currently in Japan, setting up for a mega wargame that will test the MPEs capabilities. 'We are going to be the first tactical mission partner environment network that gets connected to the INDOPACOM Mission Network. That's our goal,&rdquo; said Col. Rett Burroughs, I Corps' chief information officer. 'All the way down and put it into vehicles that move and put it on the backs of soldiers that walk.&rdquo; Burroughs said the corps has been installing networking gear in various partner nations over the past year. 'We actually have our tactical server infrastructure in place all across the Pacific. We can now talk on our mission partner environment with the Australian 1st Division in Brisbane. We have our connection in Thailand and the Philippines,&rdquo; he said. But the networking software is coming more slowly. Over the past year, I Corps created and tested a tactical network between the U.S., Japan, and Australia with a simple goal: enable an Australian service member to send an email to her Japanese counterparts. There's no data-sharing policy between the three nations, which limits what can be shared between their respective networks. 'If you, from the Australian side, were going to send me, a Japanese officer, an email, you can't send an attachment. We would actually take that attachment and we would just make it disappear. But the body of the text would go through,&rdquo; Burroughs said. I Corps aims to test and refine the new system in December. 'We're throwing our warfighter exercise that [U.S. Army Forces Command] requires us to do every two years on top of an [U.S. Army Pacific] exercise that we do every year. So we're going to mash two exercises into one&hellip;it's going to be a pretty chaotic event for us communicators, to say the least, because it's never been done before,&rdquo; Burroughs said. 'We're going to refine them to make them simpler, more effective, and just a little more seamless to the operator so they don't have to take as many steps,&rdquo; like being able to find files easier. The goal is to inform the Army, Indo-Pacific Command, and the Joint Staff on 'what we know works in the Pacific&rdquo; using real-world test cases at scale to form requirements. 'Technologically, there's nothing that we can't do,&rdquo; Burroughs said. 'Everything that we see in science and science fiction, we can do it. But policy has to dictate what we're actually allowed to do. So those trilat agreements&hellip;military-level discussions, those are happening and those have to happen in order for us to modernize.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/11/indopacom-replacing-pile-partner-nation-networks-just-one/401129/	2024-11-18T13:48:13-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/18/8035141/large.jpg
Women veterans react to 'ill-informed' disparagement by Trump's S...	Originally published by The 19th. Women veterans, national security organizations and military historians are pushing back against recent disparaging comments made by Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Defense. 'I'm straight up just saying we shouldn't have women in combat roles,&rdquo; Hegseth, a Fox host who served in the Army National Guard, said on a podcast last week while promoting his new book, The War on Warriors. 'It hasn't made us more effective. It hasn't made us more lethal. It has made fighting more complicated.&rdquo; Allison Jaslow, the chief executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said she was deployed to Iraq in 2004 as a platoon leader. Within two months, her entire platoon's mission shifted to a more combat-focused directive and many of the 'women could run circles around some of the men&rdquo;&mdash;both in physical fitness and courage, Jaslow said. 'During my time in the military, I've had some male colleagues really freaking disappoint me,&rdquo; Jaslow said. 'I've seen women who've displayed more courage, better physical fitness and better character over some of the men that I've served with. I reject the notion [that men are categorically better] altogether, and I think some people with strongly held beliefs will look at one example and label all the rest of us.&hellip;It's just one of those things where I'm like, &lsquo;Tell me to my face.'&rdquo; Hegseth, who according to his personal website served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, also said that institutions shouldn't incentivize women to take these roles because 'over human history, men in those positions are more capable.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] He argued in his book that standards have been changed to accommodate women, which ultimately detracts from the capability of military units. He also claims that 'America's white sons and daughters&rdquo; are walking away from the military because of 'woke&rdquo; ideology that is too 'effeminate&rdquo; and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion to the country's detriment. 'Everybody knows between bone density and lung capacity and muscle strength, men and women are just different,&rdquo; Hegseth added in the interview. Women&mdash;who currently make up more than 21 percent of the active-duty force&mdash;have held combat roles in the military for decades, though it's been a gradual progression. Congress repealed the law banning women from combat aviation and on ships in 1991 and 1993, respectively. The Navy reversed the policy barring women from submarines in 2010. And then in 2013, Congress announced the repeal of the combat exclusion policy, which was implemented in 2015. Over a quarter of a million women served in Iraq from 2003 to 2011, the largest-scale and most visible deployment of women in U.S. history. More than 1,000 women were injured in combat and 166 killed as of 2017, according to the Service Women's Action Network (SWAN). Lory Manning, a Navy veteran who served as the director of government operations with SWAN, said Hegseth's comments are 'ill-informed&rdquo; and there's no substantial evidence that the presence of women in combat roles harms the U.S. military's effectiveness. 'He keeps saying they've lowered standards for women [in combat roles], and that is just not true,&rdquo; said Manning, who also led Women in the Military Project at the Women's Research and Education Institute for 15 years. 'Number one: it's against the law to lower standards for women.&rdquo; Manning said he is likely confusing or conflating two different kinds of military standards: basic physical fitness and occupational. The basic physical fitness tests differ across military services and are typically adjusted by age and gender. 'These are basically just to see if this person is fit to be in the military, whether they're a heart surgeon or a Catholic chaplain or a combat person,&rdquo; Manning said. 'But for every single job in the military, there's also a set of occupational standards that have to be met. And the law says that they must be gender and age neutral.&rdquo; Women service members are required to meet the exact same standards as the men serving alongside them in the same roles. In some recent instances, Manning said women were even asked to participate in specialty combat squads called Lioness Teams. In Iraq, it became clear that only American women soldiers were able to communicate with Iraqi women due to cultural customs and were able to gain important intel on the ground. 'I think [Hegseth] is dead wrong when he says that women are the problem,&rdquo; Manning said. 'Leadership is and has historically been about how to blend the diversity in the armed forces.&rdquo; Jaslow emphasized that women should not be considered as weaker based on their gender, pointing to how many have competed and succeeded on the same playing field as their male counterparts. 'Look at the women who've graduated from Ranger School, which is so grueling that around half of the men who enter it fail out,&rdquo; Jaslow said, referring to one of the toughest Army training courses. 'These women deserve a Secretary of Defense who is aware of that reality and also ensures that the culture in the military embraces that reality.&rdquo; Jaslow said Hegseth's remarks were especially disappointing because he also fought during the post-911 conflicts alongside an increasing number of women service members. 'It's tough to swallow that he is somebody who is a contemporary of mine, who lived through our most recent wars and also understands that we are fighting our wars with an all-volunteer military right now,&rdquo; Jaslow said. 'We don't need to be standing in the way of any able-bodied American who wants to serve or telling them that there are restrictions on the way that they have to serve their country. Just set the standards, and if they can rise to the challenge, they should be able to serve.&rdquo; If confirmed, Hegseth would lead the largest government agency, which employs nearly 3 million military and civilian employees all charged with protecting the security of the country. Kara Dixon Vuic, who studies gender and the U.S. military at Texas Christian University, said that if Hegseth were to bar women from serving in combat roles, it would be a rare reversal in a centuries-long history of the military expanding toward greater inclusivity. A major exception was when Trump placed a ban on transgender people serving in the military, which went into effect in 2019 and was ended by the Biden administration in 2021. 'Nothing Hegseth's saying is new,&rdquo; Vuic said. 'People said those same things about the racial integration of the military. They said similar things about gay men and women being allowed to serve openly. He's putting the blame for anything negative that could happen on a group of people without providing evidence to support that claim.&rdquo; Yet, women have found themselves on the frontlines of war for centuries, even before they were given technical combat role titles. When the chaos of conflict ensues, roles are often not cleanly delineated into combat and non-combat. Even cooks, medics and radio operators can find themselves in the battlefield. As far back as the Revolutionary War, there were reports of women serving in combat alongside their husbands or disguised as men or as spies for the cause. 'I think top military leaders will push back because they know the realities on the ground,&rdquo; Vuic said. 'They see that women in combat is a matter of efficiency and effectiveness. And they have understood for a long time that to be the most lethal military, you have to draw on the widest pool of talent in this country. To cut off more than half of the population simply because of their sex is not going to give you an optimal military force.&rdquo; Lauren Buitta, who founded Girl Security, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing gender equity in the national security sector, said the U.S. military is currently struggling with high suicide rates, rampant sexual misconduct and assault and a recruitment crisis. 'In my mind, the short of it is that this issue is decided: Women have served selflessly,&rdquo; Buitta said. 'There are other tremendous challenges that the U.S. military confronts that I imagine a Secretary of Defense would be focused on.&rdquo; Buitta, who works on dismantling gender stereotypes to create career pathways for young girls and women in the national security sector, said that her organization will continue to help girls achieve their dreams, even if that is to serve in a combat role in the military. 'If Hegseth's words did turn into action that impacted women's contributions and combat occupations, I think it will hurt America's position on the global stage,&rdquo; Buitta said. 'We lead by example.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/women-veterans-react-ill-informed-disparagement-trumps-secdef-pick/401119/	2024-11-18T12:38:21-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/18/5401454/large.jpg
Exclusive: New rocket startup debuts with supersonic flight	The competition for new highly-maneuverable missiles just got much hotter. Dawn Hypersonics &mdash; part of Dawn Aerospace &mdash; today revealed it has achieved supersonic flight with their prototype Mk-II Aurora craft off the coast of New Zealand. Defense One spoke exclusively with the company's co-founder and CTO, Stefan Powell, on what the success means for the U.S. missile race. On November 7, the Mk-II Aurora completed a 66,000 foot ascent in just 118.6 seconds, beating the previous decades-old record by more than 4 seconds. 'With flight test 57, we retired the final major technical risk; vehicle dynamics through the transonic regime [between Mach 0.8 to 1.2]. In doing so, Aurora became the highest climb rate aircraft ever built. The door is now wide open for Aurora to become the world's highest and fastest flying aircraft too,&rdquo; Powell said. The U.S. military is racing to deploy a wide variety of high-speed, highly maneuverable missiles capable of hypersonic speeds, Mach 5 and above. But reaching supersonic speeds while maintaining maneuverability and control is a bigger barrier, said Powell. Once you overcome that obstacle, the transition from supersonic to near hypersonic speed is much easier. Powell said that the ultimate goal is to get the Aurora up to about Mach 3.5, or about 2,685 miles per hour. That's a bit beneath the technical definition of hypersonic. But the military's goal in its highly-maneuverable missile program isn't a magic number, it's a missile that can beat the world's most advanced air defense systems. After all, intercontinental ballistic missiles from the 1960s hit speeds above Mach 5 by flying in a simple ballistic path through space, which is also why they are beatable. High maneuverability means flying much closer to the Earth, at near space altitudes of between 20 and 100 kilometers. At those heights, atmospheric and other forces put a lot of pressure on aircraft moving at extremely high speeds. And maneuvering becomes an even greater challenge. The Mk-II builds off jet aircraft design and is intended to be reusable, up to two flights a day, but doesn't require a pilot, essentially making it a highly-maneuverable missile if that's how the operator chooses to use, or a high-altitude surveillance drone that's much harder to hit than many of those currently in use. 'We really want it to act like a jet engine, but you want to have the thrust-to-weight ratio of a rocket engine, which is about 20 times better than a jet and that means you don't end up building the whole aircraft around the engine. Most of the aircraft is actually just propellant and you got a tiny little engine at the back that really just kicks ass and gets you up to these hypersonic speeds,&rdquo; Powell said. The decision to make a jet that can serve as a missile, rather than focus on some minimal innovation on hypersonic engine design, was key to getting the craft certified as an aircraft and that made a huge difference in getting the necessary certifications to do testing, said Powell. 'Avoiding such novelty saves us literal decades of development and is why we already have a well-developed flight test program with 50+ flights under our belt,&rdquo; he said. That flight test record is the company's real advantage. Powell admits that while the Mk-II boasts an innovative design, it was a series of business decisions that enabled rapid and repeated testing. It's a big part of the reason the company is based in New Zealand. 'This is the real secret source of Dawn Aerospace testing. A lot of very forward-leaning companies come to New Zealand to do the aerospace testing, Powell said. 'Merlin Labs is one. Wisk [Aero] is another, because the CAA, our equivalent to the FAA, is extremely forward thinking. A small enough organization that you can get them all around a single table and talk to them and figure out this stuff of like, how are we going to do this in a constructive way? And they have a few rule sets that are performance-based rather than prescriptive, which means they require you to uphold a certain level of safety, rather than tell you how to design the vehicle.&rdquo; That allows the company to conduct tests out of a commercial airport. Contrast that with the severe limitations on test range facilities that are hobbling hypersonic missile development in the United States. While the company is aiming for the military market, Powell sees an expanded future for hypersonic craft in the commercial and public sector as well. 'I think what we're seeing now and what we will experience over the next 15 to 20 years will be very similar to the story of the jet engine, where the first markets were absolutely military, but potentially, in the long run, the most interesting applications are actually in the commercial sphere,&rdquo; Powell said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/11/exclusive-new-rocket-startup-debuts-supersonic-flight/401109/	2024-11-18T09:21:36-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/18/Screenshot_2024_11_18_at_12.07.56PM/large.png
The D Brief: Biden green lights ATACMS for Kursk; SecDef Austin i...	Biden lifts restrictions on long-range missiles It's been 999 days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. And just before that anniversary, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden finally authorized Ukraine's use of U.S.-made long-range missiles to attack Russian military targets inside Russia, with an early emphasis on Ukrainian-held territory inside Russia's Kursk region, U.S. officials told multiple news outlets over the weekend, including the New York Times and the Associated Press. It's a decision Ukraine's president has been requesting for months, at least partly because many Russian aircraft launch missile and glide bomb attacks against Ukraine from well inside Russia's borders. Since Ukraine first requested the Army Tactical Missile System authorization, White House officials signaled a reluctance to escalate the conflict and potentially provoke Russia into launching a nuclear attack or a war on NATO in response. The missiles, which can be fired from High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, can fly as far as 190 miles, potentially allowing Ukraine to strike additional Russian military resupply routes, Defense One's Patrick Tucker writes. Back in August, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War published a series of maps to illustrate how the White House restrictions have hampered Ukraine's ability to target Russian forces that were directly attacking Ukraine. But Russia's military has escalated its own drone and missile attacks on Ukraine in recent days, and Russia has been more deliberately targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure with long-range strikes, which could prove especially devastating as Ukraine heads into its third consecutive winter under the boot of Russian invasion forces. And this winter, those invasion forces are backed up by a contingent of North Korean troops. Why lift the restrictions now? The short answer is North Korea, U.S. officials reportedly said. The president was reportedly convinced 'by concerns that the Russian assault force would be able to overwhelm Ukrainian troops in Kursk if they were not allowed to defend themselves with long-range weapons,&rdquo; according to the Times. And AP reported Biden's decision 'followed meetings over the last two days with the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China,&rdquo; noting 'the addition of North Korean troops was central to the talks&rdquo; with those leaders. Think tanker reax: 'The Biden Administration's shift to allow ATACMS use in Russia is a good thing, but it must extend beyond Kursk Oblast,&rdquo; George Barros of ISW wrote on social media Sunday. 'There are hundreds of valid, legal, legitimate, and operationally consequential military targets in range of Ukrainian ATACMS,&rdquo; he added. Another thing: 'Both the French and UK government[s] have previously indicated a willingness to approve Ukrainian use against targets in Russia of the cruise missiles they have supplied,&rdquo; Matthew Savill of the London-based Royal United Services Institute writes. 'However, both rely on updated targeting data that probably comes from the US, meaning that they too have been blocked from Ukrainian use,&rdquo; he notes. 'It stands to reason that relaxation of the ATACMS criteria will similarly lead to some relaxation on both Storm Shadow and SCALP,&rdquo; Savill speculated. 'If so, from the Ukrainian perspective it would be preferable for this take place privately and not be announced until after first use, though the Russians already have some advance warning.&rdquo; For what it's worth 'The overall supply of ATACMS missiles is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference,&rdquo; AP noted, while the Times points out, 'U.S. officials said they do not believe that the decision will change the course of the war.&rdquo; While Republican Sen. Roger Wicker said he's 'encouraged&rdquo; by the decision, which he also said came far too late, others close to President-elect Donald Trump questioned the change in policy. That included David Sacks, a close ally of Elon Musk and a favored Trump donor. 'President Trump won a clear mandate to end the war in Ukraine. So what does Biden do in his final two months in office? Massively escalate it. Is his goal to hand Trump the worst situation possible?&rdquo; Sacks wrote Sunday on Musk's social media platform. The view from Kyiv: 'Strikes are not carried out with words. These things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves,&rdquo; President Volodymir Zelenskyy said on social media Sunday. One Ukrainian military POV: 'With Trump, everyone is joking that it's better to have a horrible end than unending horror,&rdquo; a soldier told the BBC last week. Trump, he said, is 'willing to take hard decisions, and from there, we're getting better chances to get a good decision versus Democrats, who would be reluctant to make any hard decisions. They're pretty weak. Overall, it's surprisingly not as bad as I expected. So overall, the morale is quite nice. And we're all looking forward to seeing what's going to happen.&rdquo; Additional reading/listening: 'Russian officials say Biden decision to let Ukraine fire missiles deep into Russia could lead to world war,&rdquo; CBS News reported Monday; 'Long-range strikes against Russia: too late to save Ukraine?&rdquo; Reuters reported Monday; 'Germany still a 'no' on long-range missiles,&rdquo; Germany's Deutsche Welle reported Monday; And former NATO chief 'Jens Stoltenberg on...

On this day in 1978, the F/A-18 Hornet completed its first flight at Maryland's Naval Air Test Center. It was first introduced to the U.S. military just over four years later, in January 1983. SecDef Austin's (likely) last Pacific swing Japan, Australia, and the United States say they're strengthening three-way defense cooperation&mdash;vowing, among other things, to consult with each other in military planning and regional crises, Defense One's Bradley Peniston reported Sunday while traveling in the region with the U.S. defense secretary. The increased coordination will take place under a new structure called the Trilateral Defense Consultations, Richard Marles, Australia's deputy prime minister and minister for defence, told reporters at the naval base in Darwin, Australia. 'It provides a substance and a structure to the trilateral meeting of our three countries which has not been there before, and it represents the ambition that all of us have about taking this architecture of our three countries even further,&rdquo; Marles said. Marles spoke after an annual meeting with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts&mdash;Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin and Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani&mdash;that produced a slew of other announcements, including (1) Japan's new Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade will join annual U.S.-Australian exercises held by the Marine Rotational Force&ndash;Darwin, starting with Talisman Sabre 2025 and building toward the countries' first air- and missile-defense live-fire training event in the exercise's 2027 edition; (2) Australian forces will join U.S.-Japanese exercises, beginning with Orient Shield 2025, and increase their participation in others, including Yama Sakura, Keen Edge, and Keen Sword; and (3) the three nations will look for ways to increase Australian participation in the U.S.-Japanese Bilateral Information Analysis Cell.

From the region: 'China's second mass attack in a week spurs soul-searching,&rdquo; Reuters reported Sunday; 'Asia-Pacific summit closes in Peru with China's Xi front and center as Trump whiplash looms,&rdquo; AP reported Sunday from Peru; 'N. Korea sends trash-carrying balloons to S. Korea for 1st time in 3 weeks,&rdquo; Seoul's Yonhap news reported Monday; And 'As Beijing Threatens, Taiwan Looks Nervously at Trump,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Monday from Taipei. Around the Defense Department In a new first, the U.S. Air Force awarded the Silver Star to a female airman, Capt. Lacie 'Sonic&rdquo; Hester, after Hester helped defend Israel from Iranian drones and missiles in April. Air Force F-15E jets shot down 80 drones during Iran's attack on Israel, one of the largest-ever drone attacks. The Silver Star is the U.S. military's third-highest decoration for valor in combat. Update: Trump's defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault, but he maintains that the encounter was consensual, and thereby is not something that should disqualify him from leading the U.S. military during Trump's second term, the Washington Post reported over the weekend. Hegseth's attorney said he paid the woman out of fear of being fired from his post as a Fox TV personality. The Post obtained a copy of a memo sent to the Trump transition team from a friend of the accuser, detailing the allegations. The accuser signed a nondisclosure agreement and received a payment after threatening litigation in 2020. Trump himself is reportedly undeterred. Indeed, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung insisted last week that 'President Trump is nominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his administration. Mr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all allegations, and no charges were filed,&rdquo; said Cheung. Some senior officers in the Army's ROTC program have used their power to make unwanted sexual advances on young students, Military.com reported Friday. The investigation, which interviewed 15 women, found that 'the ROTC has consistently been a place where senior instructors &mdash; positions overwhelmingly held by men &mdash; can use the program as a personal dating pool, targeting women in the program and often taking advantage of their ability to skirt the traditional oversight the service has on its senior officers.&rdquo; Etc. And lastly today: Reed, Shaheen request probe into Musk's Russia calls. New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen says she and Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed have requested an 'investigation into Elon Musk's involvement in U.S. government contracts with SpaceX,&rdquo; citing several alleged phone calls between Musk and Russian officials over the past few months. 'These relationships between a well-known U.S. adversary and Mr. Musk, a beneficiary of billions of dollars in U.S. government funding, pose serious questions regarding Mr. Musk's reliability as a government contractor and a clearance holder,&rdquo; the senators warn in a letter (PDF) to U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General Robert Storch and U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. 'We urge an immediate review into this reporting to ascertain whether Mr. Musk's conversation and specific ties to high-level Russian officials warrant an investigation and a determination by the Department of Defense's senior debarment official whether SpaceX should exclude Mr. Musk's involvement in any and all U.S. Government contracts,&rdquo; they write. The two senators are also worried Musk has outsized influence within the Space Force, including a possible 'overreliance on SpaceX for national security space activities,&rdquo; they wrote in a separate letter (PDF) to Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. 'We are also concerned that SpaceX's Starlink is the only commercial service available to offer global broadband connectivity in low-Earth orbit,&rdquo; they said to Kendall.

Biden allows Ukraine to use ATACMS to strike Russia	Ukraine can now use long-range ATACMS missiles for some strikes inside Russia, the Biden administration said Sunday, a development that Ukrainians had been seeking for years. Administration officials told The New York Times the missiles would 'likely&rdquo; first be used against Russian and North Korean forces battling Ukrainians in Kursk, but noted that Biden may allow them to be used elsewhere. Army Tactical Missile System missiles, or ATACMS, were one of many weapons Ukraine requested at the outset of Russia's 2022 attack on Ukraine. The missiles, which can be fired from High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, can fly as far as 190 miles, potentially allowing Ukraine to strike Russian resupply routes or even Moscow. The United States has supplied HIMARS since the first few months of the war, but has been reluctant to provide the longer-range ATACMS, saying it could prompt Russia to escalate hostilities. Russian doctrine allows for the country's military to treat a threat to the capital or even a supply route far from the border as 'existential,&rdquo; and Russian officials had said even giving Ukrainians the missiles&mdash;much less allowing them for targets inside Russia&mdash;was a 'red line.&rdquo; However, in March, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. C.Q. Brown said the risk of escalation was 'not as high,&rdquo; and that same month, the White House began to send some of the longer-range missiles to Ukraine&mdash;albeit with strict limits on their use. [[Related Posts]] The Institute for the Study of War published a series of maps to illustrate how the White House restrictions have hampered Ukraine's ability to target Russian forces that were directly attacking Ukraine. The decision to loosen those restrictions comes after reports that North Korea may send as many as 100,000 troops to Russia to fight Ukrainians, and after Russia launched a brutal missile assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and other targets. 'Reminder that there are hundreds of valid, legal, legitimate, and operationally consequential military targets in range of Ukrainian ATACMS. The Biden Administration's shift to allow ATACMS use in Russia is a good thing, but it must extend beyond Kursk Oblast,&rdquo; George Barros, leader of the Russia team and GEOINT team at the Institute, said on X. Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister, told The Financial Times that ATACMS will greatly improve Ukraine's ability to strike Russian forces as they prepare to attack Ukraine: 'There are targets which can only be addressed by high payload missiles such as ATACMS or equivalent aerial missiles. This is, of course, a decision giving Ukraine troops a chance, though as with many previous decisions, coming after a significant and extremely painful delay.&rdquo; The move also follows a decision by the French and British governments to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles, according to La Figaro. It also signals a shift in Washington's risk calculus&mdash;a shift that many, like Zagorodnyuk, argue should have come sooner. Rep. Roger Wicker, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is one of several Republicans who have been pressuring the administration for more than a year to give Ukraine the missiles and lift the restrictions. 'If initial press reports are true, I am encouraged at the prospect of allowing Ukraine to use long-range ATACM missiles supplied by the U.S. This does not excuse the administration's deliberate slow-walking of items and assistance long authorized by Congress for use against Putin's illegal aggression,&rdquo; Wicker, of Mississippi, said in a statement. 'This devastating conflict could have been ended on terms benefiting the U.S. and NATO if Mr. Biden had listened to the counsel of bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate.&rdquo; But others in the party, such as David Sacks, a close ally of Elon Musk and Trump donor who spoke at the Republican National Convention, have taken a much different stance. 'President Trump won a clear mandate to end the war in Ukraine. So what does Biden do in his final two months in office? Massively escalate it. Is his goal to hand Trump the worst situation possible?&rdquo; Sacks wrote on X on Sunday.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/biden-allows-ukraine-use-atacms-strike-russia/401101/	2024-11-17T17:06:38-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/17/GettyImages_2030058326/large.jpg

US, Australia, Japan deepen defense cooperation	DARWIN, Australia&mdash;Japan, Australia, and the United States are strengthening their three-way defense cooperation&mdash;vowing, among other things, to consult with each other in military planning and regional crises, defense leaders from the countries said Sunday. The leaders also discussed prospects for increased cooperation under AUKUS and their views on the incoming Trump administration. The increased coordination will take place under a new structure called the Trilateral Defense Consultations, Richard Marles, Australia's deputy prime minister and minister for defence, told reporters at the naval base here. 'It provides a substance and a structure to the trilateral meeting of our three countries which has not been there before, and it represents the ambition that all of us have about taking this architecture of our three countries even further,&rdquo; Marles said. Marles spoke after an annual meeting with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts&mdash;Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani&mdash;that produced a slew of other announcements, including: Japan's new Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade will join annual U.S.-Australian exercises held by the Marine Rotational Force&ndash;Darwin, starting with Talisman Sabre 2025 and building toward the countries' first air- and missile-defense live-fire training event in the exercise's 2027 edition. Australian forces will join U.S.-Japanese exercises, beginning with Orient Shield 2025, and increase its participation in others, including Yama Sakura, Keen Edge, and Keen Sword. The three nations will look for ways to increase Australian participation in the U.S.-Japanese Bilateral Information Analysis Cell. [[Related Posts]] India, too, got a nod: Marles said the three nations will deepen their cooperation with the Indian military in the realm of maritime domain awareness, building on a 'maritime patrol aircraft collaboration activity with India&rdquo; on the sidelines of September's Exercise Kakadu. AUKUS Just as in Austin's trip to London in September, local press wanted to know whether U.S. shipbuilding troubles would delay or boost the price tag of the Virginia-class attack submarines promised to Australia under AUKUS Pillar I. Replied Austin: 'I'm confident that we're going to be able to provide the capabilities that we set out to provide. Now, we recognize that there are challenges in the industrial base, and we're doing things to address those challenges. We're investing more so that, you know, we can speed up the production to meet our objectives going forward. And you know, I've met with the leadership of the companies that are producing submarines, and I'm encouraged by what they're doing and their focus to get this done, and they will get it done.&rdquo; And Marles: 'We do have a sense of confidence about the fulfillment of the timelines that we articulated when we announced the optimal pathway back in March of last year.&rdquo; As for AUKUS Pillar II, the effort to jointly develop various 'advanced military capabilities,&rdquo; the leaders said they 'look forward to continued consultations with Japan,&rdquo; whose first contribution is expected to be in maritime autonomous systems. In October, Japanese officials attended Exercise Autonomous Warrior as observers. Trump, incoming Reporters also asked whether AUKUS and the plans for increased cooperation could be expected to survive the incoming administration of Donald Trump, who has unexpectedly shut down multinational exercises and often expressed contempt for U.S. alliances. 'I think the answer to that is yes,&rdquo; Marles said. 'This time last year, legislation passed the U.S. Congress&mdash;with the support of Democrats, Republicans, Trump Republicans&mdash;which saw the legislative underpinning of the sale of Virginia-class submarines to Australia... 'The basis of the alliance is shared values, but it's a shared strategic objective and shared strategic advantage. And AUKUS is in the strategic interest of both the United States and Australia, and that's the fundamental here, as it is for Britain. And so we are seeing AUKUS survive change of governments in Australia, in United Kingdom&mdash;and it will happen in America as well.&rdquo; He added, 'Everything that I've heard about Pete Hegseth since his name became public, in the context of becoming the secretary of defense, has been positive, and I approach the prospect of getting to know Pete Hegseth and working with him with enormous optimism.&rdquo; And Austin: 'It's the prerogative of the president-elect to nominate whoever he deems appropriate to serve on his cabinet. As far as DOD is concerned, we remain focused on a smooth and effective transition to the next administration...I would just say that this is a large enterprise, DOD, and it often involves making life-and-death decisions on a near-daily basis, and accounting for and taking care of some 2.7 million soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, guardians and really remaining focused on protecting the country and protecting our interests around the world.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/us-australia-japan-deepen-defense-cooperation/401099/	2024-11-16T22:44:08-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/17/IMG_3154/large.jpg
‘Extraordinarily dangerous’: Intelligence community insiders warn...	Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, lacks experience, and her record of Russia-aligned public statements could undermine the ability of the United States to acquire intelligence from allies and partners, current and former intelligence officials say. Trump on Wednesday announced his intention to put Gabbard, who served in Congress as a Democrat from Hawaii, in charge of the national intelligence office. The office coordinates intelligence efforts across the entire government, forges intelligence-sharing relationships with other countries, and shapes the way the public and the White House understand threats to U.S. interests. The office takes a leading role in assembling the daily brief for the president, which the White House uses to understand how adversaries are working against the United States, and in telling the public about threats Americans face. Gabbard, an Iraq war veteran and lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, has military experience but not a deep background in intelligence. One former senior intelligence official told Defense One that such experience is vital to making sense of the wide variety of intelligence pieces that compose a picture of current or future threats. 'What people don't understand about intelligence is, if it's known, it's not intelligence. It's that assessment that you make. It has uncertainty, and the craft of understanding that uncertainty has nothing to do with opinion but rather has to do with trust, integrity and independence,&rdquo; the former official said. But intelligence community veterans are more concerned with her past actions and public statements&mdash;particularly those that aligned with Kremlin propaganda&mdash;than her resume. [[Related Posts]] In 2022, as Russian forces were launching an illegal expansion of their war against Ukraine, Gabbard said the U.S. was to blame, echoing a claim Russian President Vladimir Putin made to justify his invasion&mdash;but that NATO and the United Nations fully reject. Putin later said the war was actually a means to reconstitute the territorial empire of Catherine II. Gabbard has echoed other Russian talking points as well, including one that came directly from Kremlin information operations. Beyond Ukraine, Gabbard met with Syrian dictator and Russian ally Bashar Al-Assad in 2017. Assad continued to target civilians with chemical attacks after meeting Gabbard. But two years after the meeting, she refused to say whether he was a war criminal&mdash;despite clear evidence that he had killed some 1,400 people in Syria in a chemical weapons attack in 2013, among other crimes. Gabbard's pattern of publicly taking positions that are not supported by fact but do match up with narratives out of Moscow is going to hurt U.S. intelligence-sharing relationships with partner militaries and governments, the former senior official said. Many allies are already wary of Trump because of actions during his first term in the White House, such as abandoning Kurdish fighters in Syria in 2018&mdash;a move that prompted the resignation of several members of Trump's first cabinet, including then-Defense Secretary James Mattis and anti-ISIS coalition envoy Brett McGurk. 'They're watching. Remember, there are a whole bunch of people that already, from [Trump's] first term, are not comfortable with Trump because he was willing to throw allies and partners on a whim under the bus&hellip;So [allies] are already worried. And now this is a pertinent person who has basically said, &lsquo;Hey, I think these bad guys are good guys.'&rdquo; Gabbard's past public statements will also hurt her ability to earn trust among rank-and-file intelligence workers in the United States, said one current intelligence official. 'Tulsi's history of irresponsibly promoting misinformation and giving comfort to some of America's most aggressive adversaries is counter to the values of the intelligence community. If confirmed, she'll have a steep hill to climb to earn the trust and respect of the community,&rdquo; the official told Defense One. As DNI, Gabbard would be ultimately responsible for protecting U.S. intelligence operations and people from adversaries. She also would be the one to make the call on things like the 2022 decision to declassify intelligence analyses of Russia's intentions in Ukraine, which helped marshal allies to Ukraine's cause. 'That decision was an ODNI decision,&rdquo; said the former senior intelligence official. 'It is reflective of a new world order where we don't have absolute trust and you do need to be able to build coalitions&hellip; Alliances, friendships have always been one of the real elements of our strength. And it's imperiled.&rdquo; Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., a former CIA officer, echoed this sentiment on MSNBC on Thursday. 'The idea that someone who has aligned herself with and defended Vladimir Putin could potentially have information related to the sources and methods of how it is that we knew that Russia was going to have invaded Ukraine&hellip;helps illuminate why this is so extraordinarily dangerous.&rdquo; Because of her past statements, intelligence professionals are also worried that she could alter analysis to fit a political narrative, which would leave the president or the public in the dark about key threats. Said the current intelligence official: 'Intelligence is conducted in the service of the nation, without regard for political parties or motives, and we are typically the bearers of bad news. Will she champion the professionalism and apolitical nature of what we gather and assess, and speak truth to power, or disregard our work to convey what power wants to hear?&rdquo; Gabbard may also face an additional challenge when building trust within the community: The Trump administration decided to forgo the traditional FBI vetting of nominees to top posts, including Gabbard, CNN reported Friday.

The D Brief: Austin to the Pacific; North Korean drones; Reformin...	SecDef Austin's last Pacific swing. Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin took off this morning for his 12th and presumably final trip as U.S. defense secretary to the Asia-Pacific region. It starts with a visit to Darwin, Australia, for a trilateral meeting with Australian and Japanese officials&mdash;the latter of whom is expected to announce that Japan will start to integrate forces into U.S.-Australian exercises held by Marine Rotational Force-Darwin, senior defense officials said. Then it's over to the Philippines to meet President Bongbong Marcos and Secretary of National Defense Gilbert Teodoro and mark the opening of a new U.S.-funded intel fusion center. Next is a visit to Laos for the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus, a meeting that every U.S. defense secretary has attended since its inception in 2010, and finally to Fiji, to kick off negotiations for a status-of-forces agreement intended to lay the foundation for more defense cooperation. D Brief-er Bradley Peniston is traveling with the SecDef; stay tuned for more coverage. North Korea has ordered 'full-scale mass production&rdquo; of so-called 'suicide attack drones,&rdquo; state run media KCNA reported Friday. The country's dictator Kim Jong-un called the drones 'an essential requirement in military aspects&rdquo; and said North Korean production facilities have the 'potentiality to produce and introduce various types of drones&rdquo; in the months ahead. At least three different kinds of North Korean drones were demonstrated Thursday, according to selectively blurry photos posted at the Pyongyang Times. One was a smaller fixed-wing drone; another was a larger model similar in appearance to Russia's Ranchet 3; and the third, larger one was reportedly designed for long-range strikes, one South Korea-based analyst told the Wall Street Journal. Rewind: 'In July 2023, North Korea unveiled two types of new reconnaissance and multi-purpose attack drones at an arms exhibition and a military parade,&rdquo; South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports. 'The North also sent five drones across the border with South Korea in December 2022, with one of them penetrating a no-fly zone close to Seoul's presidential office.&rdquo; From the region: 'Taiwan president plans Hawaii visit on sensitive trip to Pacific, sources say,&rdquo; Reuters reported Friday; 'Beijing is already preparing to retaliate in a second Trump era,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Friday; 'China Coped With Trump's First Trade War. A Second One Will Be Tougher,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Friday; 'Trump's &lsquo;America First' foreign policy will accelerate China's push for global leadership,&rdquo; William Matthews of Chatham House argued in an essay published Thursday; And 'Ex-Trump envoy on N. Korea says Kim Jong-un won't negotiate denuclearization,&rdquo; Yonhap reported Friday from Seoul. And ICYMI: U.S. authorities uncovered 'a broad and significant cyber espionage campaign&rdquo; carried out by China-affiliated actors, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement Wednesday. The operation hit 'multiple telecommunications companies&rdquo; and 'enable[d] the theft of customer call records data, the compromise of private communications of a limited number of individuals who are primarily involved in government or political activity, and the copying of certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders,&rdquo; according to the statement. That latter detail could refer to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which allows U.S. authorities to spy on the communications of individuals suspected of working for a foreign country. 'We expect our understanding of these compromises to grow as the investigation continues,&rdquo; the FBI and CISA said. Developing: CISA is under threat under new Republican leadership. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, who is about to take over as the Chair of the Homeland Security Committee, which oversees CISA, told Politico he would like to 'eliminate&rdquo; it due to the work they do calling out foreign election interference particularly from Russia. You may recall President-elect Donald Trump clashed with CISA over its monitoring of the 2020 election. (CISA has said both the 2020 and 2024 elections were secure, despite foreign influence efforts.) While Trump can't just close CISA outright, Democratic lawmakers are reportedly worried he could weaken it through staffing decisions.

On this day in 2012, Xi Jinping took office as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, beginning what has since become at least 12 years of consecutive rule. The long-rumored prospect of a future U.S.-China war has prompted Air Force officials to change how they buy weapons, and that is driving defense companies to pursue new ways of making money, Defense One's Audrey Decker reported Thursday. Since the U.S. military will need to operate thousands of connected systems across vast distances in a Pacific conflict, those dynamics are posing new challenges for the Pentagon's acquisition community, Andrew Hunter, the service's acquisition chief, said at an event hosted Wednesday by Defense One in Washington. For example, the service is investing in the mission systems of an aircraft or platform first, and building direct relationships with suppliers instead of working through the major defense companies to manage suppliers. This means prime contractors, who have historically profited from controlling the entire architecture, are having to relinquish some control, Decker writes. Consider: 'Every time we persuade ourselves that, Hey, we found a program [where] the risk is actually so small that we can probably use fixed price contracting here, even during the development phase, we end up finding risks we didn't appreciate,&rdquo; Hunter said. He pointed to two Boeing programs where the service massively underestimated development risks: the T-7 trainer and the KC-46 tanker. Both fixed-price contracts resulted in huge losses for Boeing and delayed capability for the Air Force. Continue reading, here. Suicides across the Army, Navy, and Air Force continued to rise in 2023, according to the latest annual report (PDF) published Thursday by the Defense Department. During that 12-month period, '523 Service members died by suicide, which is more than the previous year (493),&rdquo; the Pentagon said. That included 363 on the active duty side; 69 in the Reserves; and 91 among the National Guard. 'Young enlisted males accounted for the largest number of suicide deaths,&rdquo; and they most often used a firearm in the completed act, which is consistent with prior years, according to the report (poisoning is the most common way service members attempt suicide). The highest rates were among men under the age of 30; and overall, more than 9 out of 10 who died from suicide were men compared to less than 7% for females. While the Marine Corps' suicide rate did not rise in 2023, the service still has the highest rate among all the branches, U.S. Naval Institute News reports with accompanying slide data. However, 'In short-term comparisons, between 2023 and 2022, no service was found to have had a statistically significant difference in suicide rates,&rdquo; the report's authors write. The Associated Press has more.

Etc. Report: Israeli forces struck an Iranian nuclear weapons research facility in October. Sources within the Israeli military told Axios that they hit the Taleghan 2 facility, some 20 miles south Tehran, during the October 25 strike on Iranian targets. US and Israeli government sources said that they began detecting new activity at the site earlier this year and the work 'could lay the ground for the production of a nuclear weapon.&rdquo; The program was so secret that many in the Iranian government didn't even know about, the officials said. And lastly, DHS just released guidance for the use of AI in critical infrastructure. Nextgov/FCW report that the new voluntary guidance helps infrastructure operators design AI models for security and operation, deploy them and monitor them safely. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters the framework provides 'specific recommendations that each participant in the ecosystem can and should implement to ensure the safe and secure deployment of AI in critical infrastructure.&rdquo; More here.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/the-d-brief-november-15-2024/401072/	2024-11-15T08:07:09-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/15/DB_lander/large.png
DHS releases guidance for AI in critical infrastructure	The Department of Homeland Security unveiled a new series of recommendations for the safe use of artificial intelligence tools in U.S. critical infrastructure, breaking down flexible guidance by each sector included in the broader AI supply chain. Unveiled on Thursday, the Roles and Responsibilities Framework for Artificial Intelligence in Critical Infrastructure &mdash; created in consultation with Homeland's internal Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board &mdash; tailors recommended actions to specific sectors key to the AI industry. These include cloud and compute infrastructure providers, AI developers, critical infrastructure owners and operators, civil society and public sector entities. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this guidance is 'groundbreaking&rdquo; in regards to being the first such document that was created through 'extensive collaboration&rdquo; with a board that included AI developers themselves to help civil society responsibly deploy these softwares. 'The framework, if widely adopted, will go a long way to better ensure the safety and security of critical services that deliver clean water, consistent power, internet access and so much more,&rdquo; Mayorkas said during a Thursday press call. 'It is, quite frankly, exceedingly rare to have leading AI developers engaged directly with civil society on issues that are at the forefront of today's AI debates, and [it] presents such a collaborative framework.&rdquo; He added that the framework acts as a new model of shared responsibility and governance to safeguard critical infrastructure with AI technologies. The report goes on to identify specific recommendations that every individual stakeholder can adopt within their existing AI governance protocols. 'It is descriptive and not prescriptive,&rdquo; Mayorkas said. 'The evolution of the technology is still rapidly advancing, and to be particularly prescriptive would not necessarily capture that evolution. And we intend the framework to be, frankly, a living document and to change as developments in the industry change as well.&rdquo; The voluntary guidance for stakeholders working at the intersection of AI and critical infrastructure includes five steps: securing environments, driving responsible model design, implementing data governance, ensuring safe and secure deployment and monitoring performance and impact. Different stakeholders will have different tasks within these steps. An AI software developer, for example, would be responsible for managing access to models and data to secure a given environment, whereas a critical infrastructure owner and operator would be responsible for securing existing IT infrastructure. Given that the report's contents are voluntary, Mayorkas noted that he expects board members to help evangelize the guidance into practice across their industries, especially ahead of an incoming Trump administration that stands to change current tech and AI policy. 'There is a great push for the promulgation of regulations, the enactment of legislation in the AI sphere,&rdquo; he said. 'We are leading the world in innovation in AI and broader technologies and this framework, if, in fact, adopted and implemented as broadly as we envision it will be &ndash;&ndash; and the board members envision it should be &ndash;&ndash; will and could ward off precipitous regulation, legislation that that does not move at the speed of business and debt and does not embrace and support our innovative leadership.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/dhs-releases-guidance-ai-critical-infrastructure/401066/	2024-11-14T16:17:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/14/111424cityNG-1/large.jpg
How the Air Force is revamping acquisition to prepare for a Pacif...	The prospect of a fight with China has prompted the U.S. Air Force to change how it buys weapons&mdash;driving defense companies to pursue new ways of making money. The military will need to operate thousands of connected systems across vast distances if war breaks out in the Pacific, which poses new challenges for the Pentagon's acquisition community, Andrew Hunter, the service's acquisition chief, said at Defense One's State of Defense Business event. 'If you think of the typical acquisition approach: cost, schedule, performance; see the fighter, buy the fighter, operate the fighter. This is more complicated than that. It's about how these things interact together effectively to achieve a warfighting outcome in a particular mission. So we've tried to engineer our acquisition tool set, which is not radically different from tools of the past, but to solve this particular problem, which is our pacing challenge,&rdquo; Hunter said. To do this, the service is investing in the mission systems of an aircraft or platform first, and building direct relationships with suppliers instead of working through the major defense companies to manage suppliers. This means prime contractors, who have historically profited from controlling the entire architecture, are having to relinquish some control. The Air Force still needs traditional defense primes to integrate the systems on a platform, Hunter said, but future money will flow to those who have the 'best of breed in missions systems,&rdquo; in addition to integration work. 'Now they're things that [traditional defense primes] would have thought of as their competitor's systems, there's more opportunity for them in that space as well. More competition. And then for the smaller providers, an opportunity to get in the game more easily and to have a direct relationship&hellip;with the government, and that is crucial, to have that engagement with the mission system providers as well,&rdquo; Hunter said. [[Related Posts]] Hunter pointed to the collaborative combat aircraft program as an example of their new approach to acquisition. The program was set up to allow companies to bid on future tranches if they miss out on the first one, creating a more dynamic relationship with industry. The service has also learned, through trial and error, that putting all of the risk on industry in the development stage of programs drives companies to ignore potential risks, which can hurt the service down the line, he said. 'Every time we persuade ourselves that, Hey, we found a program [where] the risk is actually so small that we can probably use fixed price contracting here, even during the development phase, we end up finding risks we didn't appreciate,&rdquo; Hunter said. He pointed to two Boeing programs where the service massively underestimated development risks: the T-7 trainer and the KC-46 tanker. Both fixed-price contracts resulted in huge losses for Boeing and delayed capability for the Air Force. Hunter remained fairly confident that Boeing will be able to turn things around, despite the company's defense arm bleeding billions and a recently concluded seven-week strike that put near-term deliveries on hold. 'I am confident that Boeing can still deliver quality aircraft. I think the record shows that &lsquo;on time' has been a bit of a question mark in recent years, and we'd like to see them get back there,&rdquo; Hunter said. While Boeing is still behind on a few programs, when they do deliver, they're 'effective combat aircraft,&rdquo; Hunter said, so the engineering talent is 'very much still there.&rdquo; The Pentagon needs a healthy industrial base that makes a profit, Hunter said, because without that, companies won't be able to retain a talented workforce. 'We need the best of the best, because the things that we're doing are really hard. So it's in our interest for industry to be profitable within reasonable bounds. And I think by and large, we achieve that, and we need to be careful not to push an industry to a place where they are unprofitable, unattractive to capital, and unattractive to human talent,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/how-air-force-revamping-acquisition-prepare-pacific-fight/401060/	2024-11-14T16:13:19-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/14/8217842/large.jpg
The D Brief: Trump’s DNI, AG picks; China’s improved bomber; USAF...	Trump's cabinet of loyalists, cont. Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence. A former Army Reserve lieutenant colonel, Tulsi Gabbard served as a Democratic U.S. representative from Hawaii for eight years, during which she criticized then-President Donald Trump for his approach to the Middle East and other matters. She ran for president, withdrew, and endorsed Joe Biden. But she subsequently switched to the Republican Party, denouncing her former colleagues as an 'elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness,&rdquo; and endorsed Donald Trump for a second presidential term. On Wednesday, the president-elect announced that he intends to nominate her to lead the nation's intelligence community. Gabbard, 43, has no direct experience in intelligence work, nor in running large organizations, and has held no senior government roles. She served two years on the House Committee on Homeland Security. She has been noted for speeches and social-media posts that align with Russian propaganda and espouse conspiracy theories. Also: Gaetz for AG. Trump on Wednesday also nominated Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz to be Attorney General. Gaetz, 42, is a relatively young but seasoned GOP operative, and the son of a prominent Florida politician Don Gaetz, who is likewise the son of former North Dakota Republican Jerry Gaetz. Rep. Matt Gaetz's Florida district spans the state's western panhandle, which includes the seaport of Pensacola. Gaetz has represented Florida's first congressional district since 2017. He's since risen among Republicans as a particularly rancorous lawmaker&mdash;the New York Times describes him as a 'right-wing provocateur&rdquo;&mdash;so much so that former GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy blamed for costing him his speakership role in October 2023. Another thing: As the Pensacola News Journal reminded readers, Gaetz is 'the subject of an ongoing Conservative-led House Ethics Committee investigation regarding sexual misconduct allegations&rdquo; as well as alleged illicit drug use. The Times reports that the investigative work concluded in 2023, but the findings were never released publicly. Gaetz's nomination Wednesday came just two days before the House Ethics Committee was set to vote on making that report public, Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News reported Wednesday evening. Shortly Trump nominated Gaetz, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the congressman had resigned&mdash;which means the House Ethics Committee no longer has jurisdiction over his actions, effectively ending the investigations. According to Trump, 'Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William & Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice.&rdquo; 'Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System,&rdquo; Trump wrote in a statement Wednesday. 'Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans' badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department.&rdquo; For what it's worth: 'Gaetz is married to Ginger Luckey, the sister of Oculus V.R. founder Palmer Luckey,&rdquo; the Pensacola News Journal reports. Palmer Luckey founded the defense startup Anduril, which has been working hard lately to diversify its drone offerings for Pentagon contracts, as Defense One has covered extensively. The idea of Gaetz as AG came up 'just hours before it was announced,&rdquo; Politico reports. 'It was hatched aboard Trump's airplane en route to Washington, on which Gaetz was a passenger,&rdquo; according to Playbook, which poses four related questions about the nomination, including, 'Can Gaetz actually get the Senate votes to be confirmed?&rdquo; It's obviously too soon to know; but 'Republicans will have a three-seat majority&rdquo; in the Senate, 'so if four senators bounce, it's a wrap&rdquo; and Gaetz won't be confirmed. But that's a long way off right now. Additional reading: 'Trump Sends Shock Waves Through Washington With Gaetz Pick,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday; 'House Ethics Panel Was Set to Vote to Release Report Critical of Matt Gaetz,&rdquo; the New York Times reported Wednesday; 'Gaetz pick shows value Trump places on loyalty and retribution,&rdquo; the Associated Press reported Thursday; 'Trump opts for personal ties and TV chops in choosing his team,&rdquo; Reuters reported Thursday&mdash;with a side report entitled, 'Expect to hear the F-word a lot in Senate&rdquo;; And 'Top Senate Democrat calls on House to release ethics report on Gaetz,&rdquo; the BBC reported Thursday from Capitol Hill.

Ukraine developments Update: The U.S. defense industrial base is now cranking out 50,000 or so 155mm artillery rounds each month, and will allegedly be able to double that rate sometime next year, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment William LaPlante said at an event hosted by Axios Wednesday in Washington. Similar advances could be made in the Patriot missile defense interceptor production line, he argued. His advice: Appropriate more for production in the U.S. industrial base. 'We still have situations where, at the end of the budget, to balance the budget people lower production numbers, because that's where the money is. We have to stop that,&rdquo; LaPlante said.

Military bases can use private 5G networks, Pentagon says	The Defense Department has released a new strategy document that gives global military installations the ability to use private 5G networks if such solutions best meet their mission needs. The Pentagon's private 5G deployment strategy, which was signed on Oct. 16 and publicly released on Tuesday, outlined the operational requirements that must be met for DOD bases to embrace private networks instead of commercial high-speed solutions. In a forward to the guidance, DOD Acting Chief Information Officer Leslie Beavers called the new document an addendum to the department's 5G strategy and implementation plan that were released in 2020. That previously issued guidance outlined the need for DOD to leverage the use of 'private, hybrid and public 5G networks' to enhance its operational and data-sharing capabilities across the globe. Beavers said DOD 'will leverage commercial networks to the maximum extent possible,&rdquo; but added that the department 'acknowledges that under certain circumstances, commercial networks may not fulfill an installation's requirements.&rdquo; In a Tuesday press release announcing the strategy, DOD also said it anticipates most military installations will use commercial networks but that private 5G solutions 'may augment or supplement commercial services because they are tailored to each installation's mission needs, security and military-unique capabilities.&rdquo; The document outlined three strategic objectives when it comes to deploying private 5G capabilities, including: aligning 5G networks with each military installation's unique needs; accelerating DOD's 'acquisition, development and secure deployment of 5G;&rdquo; and expanding an Open Radio Access Network &mdash; or Open RAN &mdash; ecosystem, which helps enhance interoperability between multiple capabilities. The strategy said DOD should incorporate Open RAN solutions 'in both commercial and government-owned models unless there are specific operational, technical or business concerns that make this approach impractical or cost prohibitive.&rdquo; The Pentagon has been working to adopt and deploy 5G that can offer warfighters the secure broadband capabilities needed to complete their missions, including through its combined joint all-domain command and control initiative. Known as CJADC2, the approach is designed to enhance communication across disparate military environments. The release of the private 5G deployment strategy comes after the fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act mandated that the Pentagon develop guidance for deploying 5G networks across DOD installations. The department said it will roll out additional implementation documents 'in the coming months&rdquo; to further guide the military's implementation of both private and commercial 5G networks.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/11/dod-issues-private-5g-deployment-guide-military-bases/401032/	2024-11-13T15:52:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/13/1113245GNG-1/large.jpg
Air Force ordering more robot wingmen for its experimentation uni...	The Air Force is buying more drones for its collaborative combat aircraft experimentation unit in Nevada to test out how the service will use these robot wingmen in a potential fight. 'One thing that I recently did was approve some additional CCA purchases to equip the experimental operations unit in order to enable that experimentation to happen using real assets,&rdquo; Andrew Hunter, the service's acquisition chief, said today at Defense One's State of Defense Business event. The service will buy additional prototypes from both vendors building 'increment one&rdquo; CCAs&mdash;General Atomics and Anduril&mdash;for the experimental operations unit, Hunter said. The service has been setting up the unit at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada to test how it might use CCAs in operations and how the drones will pair with manned fighters. Hunter did not say how many drones the service will buy, or when these test assets will get to the Nevada unit. The additional buy will help 'ensure that warfighters will have ample opportunity for experimentation to support operational fielding before the end of the decade,&rdquo; Diem Salmon, Anduril's vice president for air dominance and strike, said in a statement. [[Related Posts]] The experimental operations unit will help the Air Force build trust with the autonomous fighters, and formulate tactics, techniques, and procedures, said General Atomics spokesman C. Mark Brinkley. 'Supplying them with actual CCAs is an important step to that. We're happy to support them in any way,&rdquo; Brinkley said. Both companies' CCA designs recently cleared a key milestone, called critical design review, Col. Timothy Helfrich, senior materiel leader for the advanced aircraft division at Air Force Materiel Command said today at the Mitchell Institute's Airpower Futures Forum. The service has been able to keep the program on track by stopping when it's 'good enough,&rdquo; Helfrich said, instead of going after a highly exquisite system. 'If we are to continue to add capability and gold plate things, we're going to miss out on our costs and most importantly our schedule targets. And so making some of those tough trades. To say this is good enough and moving on has been a challenge, because we want a lot, but we are making those decisions,&rdquo; Helfrich said. General Atomics and Anduril expect to fly their drone offerings sometime next year, after which service officials will decide whether to build one or both of the companies' offerings in increment one. This decision hinges on first flight&mdash;but also each company's production capability, Hunter said. 'It's the approach to production, right? It's the people demonstrating that they can scale to the rates that we envision for this platform and that are necessary for it to be affordable mass. So I think both vendors have an opportunity to succeed, and it is entirely conceivable that we could move forward with both,&rdquo; Hunter said. The Air Force has emphasized that CCAs need to be cheap enough to buy en masse, and while service officials haven't disclosed the exact price, Hunter reiterated that a CCA will be a fraction of the cost of an F-35 fighter jet, and that he's 'feeling good&rdquo; about the figure they reached. Along with CCAs, the Air Force is devising plans for two key modernization programs: a sixth-generation fighter jet, called Next Generation Air Dominance, and a next-generation tanker. The designs of all three new programs are tied together, both from an operational and cost perspective. But, there's not enough money to pursue all three programs as the plans stand today, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said recently. Kendall's comments were a signal to the acquisition community to focus on affordability from the start, Hunter said, which is why the service baked affordability into its approach to CCAs. 'We need to be doing that with all of our programs. We need to do it with the Next Generation Air Refueling System, the NGAS program. We need to do it with our solution for our air dominance going forward. Affordability has to be a key component,&rdquo; Hunter said. All of these modernization plans will likely change under a Trump presidency, but asked about how the service will fare under the new administration, Hunter didn't say much. 'A lot depends on what is the strategy that the incoming administration adopts, and I'll be looking to see that as well as the rest of you. I think if the strategy remains similar, I think you're going to see that Air Force systems are well designed to address the challenges of the strategy,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/air-force-ordering-more-robot-wingmen-its-experimentation-unit/401030/	2024-11-13T15:37:42-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/13/7668885/large.jpg
Newest Replicator drones proven on battlefields of Ukraine	A new tranche of drones&mdash;incuding at least one being used against Russia in Ukraine&mdash;will join the Pentagon's Replicator effort to accelerate the deployment of cheap autonomous systems, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks announced Wednesday. Tranche 1.2 'will include systems in the air and maritime domains, as well as integrated software enablers that will enhance the autonomy and resilience of other Replicator systems,&rdquo; the Defense Department said in a statement. Among them: Anduril Industries' Ghost-X and the Performance Drone Works C-100 UAS, as well as classified drones that include 'low-cost long-range strike capabilities and maritime uncrewed systems,&rdquo; according to the release. Ghost-X and the C-100 UAS are already part of the Army's company-level Small UAS effort, a program inspired in part by observations from the war in Ukraine. Army Chief Gen. Randy George said in a statement that 'Ukraine has demonstrated the value of small, attritable drones on the battlefield.&rdquo; Ukrainian fighters have been using Ghost-X since the first weeks of Russia's expanded 2022 invasion, said a source familiar with the matter. Having to face off against advanced Russian EW has helped Anduril evolve techniques that could be applicable against similar high-tech adversaries like China. For instance, the source said, Anduril has developed flying mesh networks to enable drone swarms to swap data even amid heavy electromagnetic warfare interference, 'relaying that data along multiple UAS[es] so that they can have long data-chain links.&rdquo; The drones' high level of autonomy also helps them evade EW effects and interceptor missiles, the source said. 'Let's say that I'm relaying comms, and then all of a sudden, the Russians pop up an EW bubble. The drone can say, &lsquo;OK, I expected that. I'm not even going to go to my fallback positions. I'm gonna fly over here. I'm gonna go into a place where their jammer&mdash;which I can triangulate&mdash;is not affecting my link anymore.' So you get all these networks that physically reconfigure their geometry to be robust to jamming.&rdquo; Replicator is pushing more than just drones to the front lines. Software to enable better data collection and collaboration between drones is also essential to the effort&mdash;potentially more important than the individual systems themselves. The Defense Innovation Unit, or DIU, has played a key role bringing new systems as well as the underlying software into the Replicator program, to make sure that as new drone types are added they all work together to achieve a combined effect. 'Combining cutting-edge hardware with cutting-edge software&mdash;the capabilities and needs of each pushing the bounds of what is possible with the other&mdash;is at the heart of the very best of technology in the commercial sector,&rdquo; DIU Director Doug Beck said in a statement. 'Replicator is harnessing this same synergy, ensuring we can adopt commercial best practices to iteratively develop, test, and ultimately field autonomous systems, both individually and collectively, at scale.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/11/newest-replicator-drones-proven-battlefields-ukraine/400997/	2024-11-13T07:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/12/Screenshot_2024_11_12_at_10.17.55PM/large.png
The D Brief: TV host tapped as SecDef; Flag-officer firings, mull...	Trump selects TV personality for SecDef President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday evening that he intends to nominate Pete Hegseth, 44, to be defense secretary at the start of his second term in office. Hegseth, a host on 'Fox & Friends Weekend,&rdquo; served in Afghanistan and Iraq but has run nothing larger than a political advocacy organization. As a civilian, he's advocated for privatizing veterans' health care, written books arguing that diversity initiatives have weakened the military, and, last week, denounced the opening of combat roles to women. After graduating from Princeton University in 2003, Hegseth took a job with the Bear Stearns investment bank and a commission in the Minnesota National Guard. He later led an infantry platoon at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, then served as a platoon commander in Baghdad and as a civil-military operations officer in Samarra, Iraq. From 2012 to 2015, Hegseth was CEO of Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group funded by the Koch brothers' network. Among its top priorities was privatizing Veterans Administration health care. Hegseth became a Fox contributor in 2014, and a co-host of FOX & Friends Weekend two years later. In 2019, Hegseth successfully lobbied Trump to pardon three service members convicted or accused of war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last week, he told an interviewer: 'I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.&rdquo; Read more from Defense One's Bradley Peniston, here. Expert reax: ​​'I think Trump was tired of fighting with his secretaries of defense and picked one who would be loyal to him,&rdquo; Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Associated Press. And: 'It's clear that President-elect Trump wants to go to war with the Pentagon. He wants to put a former major with no experience running a large organization in charge of the 2+ million Department of Defense,&rdquo; said Charles Stevenson, author of SECDEF: The Nearly Impossible Job of Secretary of Defense. 'Instead of organizing a team effort to challenge U.S. adversaries, he seems destined to impose a hostile takeover for a culture war.&rdquo; And: 'Hegseth is undoubtedly the least qualified nominee for SecDef in American history. And the most overtly political. Brace yourself, America,&rdquo; Paul Rieckhoff, founder of Independent Veterans of America, tweeted Tuesday night. Panning out: Hegseth's nomination followed a slew of others for Trump's intended national-security team, including former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem atop the Department of Homeland Security, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to be ambassador to Israel. Fine print: Filling these positions requires a formal nomination after the inauguration, and typically, Senate confirmation under the Constitution's Article II, which was written to give the upper house a check on, among other things, manifestly unqualified candidates. But the president-elect is pressing the senators vying to lead the newly GOP-controlled Senate to call a recess in the new year that would allow him to appoint anyone he likes to serve through the two-year congressional term. A bit more on former DNI John Ratcliffe as CIA director: When Trump first tapped Ratcliffe to run America's intelligence community in 2016, the Texas politician withdrew after Democrat and Republican senators alike looked askance at his evidently 'exaggerated&rdquo; resume. When Trump tried again in 2020, Ratcliffe won approval after vowing to be apolitical. But that didn't last; within a few months, Ratcliffe 'approved selective declassifications of intelligence that aim to score political points, left Democratic lawmakers out of briefings, accused congressional opponents of leaks, offered Republican operatives top spots in his headquarters and made public assertions that contradicted professional intelligence assessments,&rdquo; as the New York Times reported. For what it's worth: In his Tuesday announcement, Trump touted Ratcliffe as a 'warrior for Truth and Honesty&rdquo; who had debunked allegations of Russian collusion.

Attention at the Pentagon Trump's transition team is considering creating an advisory board 'with the power to review three- and four-star officers and to recommend removals of any deemed unfit for leadership,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. The idea has been formulated in a draft executive order that aligns with a campaign promise to fire 'failed&rdquo; and 'woke generals&rdquo; in the U.S. military. The board would be staffed by retired generals and noncommissioned officers. But 'The draft doesn't specify what officers need to do or present to show if they meet those standards,&rdquo; the Journal reports. 'The potential for this to go wrong is infinite,&rdquo; one former senior Pentagon official told the Journal. Expert reax: 'If you are looking to fire officers who might say no because of the law or their ethics, you set up a system with completely arbitrary standards,&rdquo; one former Army lawyer warned. Read more, here. Also coming soon: Space Command HQs will move back to Alabama. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers says Trump will sign an executive order within his first week of office to move U.S. Space Command headquarters to Alabama, clearing the way for construction to start as soon as next year, Defense One's Audrey Decker reported Tuesday. Background: Space Command has been based in Colorado at Peterson Space Force Base since its inception in 2019, but the decision on a forever home has been the subject of a years-long debate. The Biden administration in 2023 reversed a decision Trump made in his last days in office to move the command's permanent headquarters to Huntsville, Alabama. Biden officials have argued that the command should stay in Colorado to maintain readiness and prevent the loss of civilian workers, who make up 60 percent of its workforce. 'I've told y'all since Biden made that crooked decision, it wasn't going to work,&rdquo; Rogers said during an interview on Alabama radio station FM Talk 106.5 that aired on Monday. 'As you know, on the [House] Armed Services Committee, I put a hold on any money being spent in Colorado Springs after President Biden came in and stole that mission away, and I told everybody then that Colorado Springs will not be the future location of Space Command, it will be Huntsville, Alabama, who won at fair and square.&rdquo; Read on, here. Trump's cabinet, cont. Trump has nominated New York real estate tycoon Steven Witkoff to be Special Envoy to the Middle East. Witkoff is a golf partner and campaign donor to Trump, though it's unclear if he will be subject to Senate confirmation, Politico reports. Witkoff has no Middle East experience to speak of, but Trump called him an 'unrelenting voice for peace,&rdquo; in his Tuesday announcement. Regarding Trump's appointment of Mike Huckabee as Ambassador to Israel, the president-elect cited Huckabee's 'love&rdquo; for Israel and 'the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him,&rdquo; he said in a statement. 'Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East,&rdquo; Trump said. For what it's worth, Huckabee admitted recently, 'I never use the term West Bank, I find it offensive. We're talking about Judea and Samaria.&rdquo; Think tank reax: Allison McManus of the Center for American Progress called Huckabee's appointment 'a sign that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu can act with impunity.&rdquo; Related reading: 'Eyeing Trump support, Israeli minister pushes for West Bank settlement annexation,&rdquo; CNN reported Tuesday; And 'Israel's Netanyahu acknowledges pager attack, says he sees &lsquo;eye-to-eye' with Trump on Iran,&rdquo; CNN reported Sunday. More Mideast developments The Iran-backed Houthis attacked U.S. forces in the Red Sea off Yemen's coast, the Pentagon confirmed Tuesday. 'During the transit, the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Stockdale and USS Spruance were attacked by at least eight one-way attack uncrewed aerial systems, five anti-ship ballistic missiles, and three anti-ship cruise missiles, which were successfully engaged and defeated,&rdquo; Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters. 'The vessels were not damaged; no personnel were hurt,&rdquo; Ryder said. ICYMI: The U.S. carried out strikes against Houthi weapons-storage sites inside Yemen over the weekend. 'The operation involved US Air Force and US Navy assets to include F-35C fighter aircraft,&rdquo; Ryder said. U.S. troops also attacked 'an Iranian-backed militia group's weapons storage and logistics headquarters facility&rdquo; inside Syria on Tuesday, officials at Central Command said. Those strikes came in response to a rocket attack on coalition troops at Patrol Base Shaddadi; no one was harmed in that attack, CENTCOM said. On Monday, U.S. forces conducted airstrikes 'against nine targets in two locations associated with Iranian groups in Syria,&rdquo; CENTCOM said Tuesday. Those strikes were in response to 'several attacks on U.S. personnel in Syria over the last 24 hours,&rdquo; according to CENTCOM, which did not say whether any U.S. forces were harmed. Trendspotting: 'There've been 25 attacks in 2 months & dozens of US artillery strikes&rdquo; in Syria, Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute wrote Tuesday on social media. Etc.

Trump taps Fox host Pete Hegseth to be defense secretary	A former Army National Guard major who has led two political advocacy organizations has been tapped for the 'nearly impossible job&rdquo; of U.S. defense secretary. President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he intends to nominate Pete Hegseth, 44, to be the first Pentagon chief of his second term in office. Hegseth, a host on 'Fox & Friends Weekend,&rdquo; served in Afghanistan and Iraq, receiving the Combat Infantryman Badge. In civilian life, he has advocated for privatizing veterans' health care and written books arguing that diversity initiatives have weakened the military. The announcement followed a slew of others about Trump's intended national-security team, including former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to run the Department of Homeland Security, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to be ambassador to Israel. Should Trump formally submit their nominations after he is inaugurated, they would require Senate confirmation. Hegseth has 'an excellent background as a junior officer but does not have the senior national security experience that secretaries need,&rdquo; Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Associated Press. After graduating from Princeton University in 2003, Hegseth took a job with the Bear Stearns investment bank and a commission in the Minnesota National Guard. He led an infantry platoon at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, then served as a platoon commander in Baghdad and a civil-military operations officer in Samarra, Iraq. By 2007, Hegseth had joined Vets for Freedom, a political advocacy group that, as NPR put it, 'supports current U.S. policy in Iraq and promotes continuing the war until &lsquo;victory'.&rdquo; He later became its executive director and served with the group until 2012, according to his LinkedIn page. In 2011 and 2012, he deployed to Afghanistan for 10 months with the Minnesota Guard, serving as a senior instructor at Counterinsurgency Training Center Afghanistan at Camp Julien in Kabul. In 2012, he helped found a political action committee, MN PAC, which was noted for spending one-third of its $15,000 in funds on Christmas parties for families and friends. From 2012 to 2015, Hegseth was CEO of Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group funded by the Koch brothers' network; among its top priorities was privatizing Veterans Administration health care. Hegseth became a Fox contributor in 2014, and a co-host of FOX & Friends Weekend two years later. During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, he backed Marco Rubio, then Ted Cruz, and ultimately became a vocal supporter of Trump, whom he got to know during the candidate's frequent appearances on his show. When reports surfaced that the new 45th president was considering Hegseth to be secretary of veterans affairs, the nation's largest veterans groups rose in intense opposition and scuttled the idea. When Trump's first VA secretary moved on in 2018, Hegseth was again considered for the job. But news of his acrimonious second divorce&mdash;two years after he argued in a book that 'family policy&rdquo; should focus on 'preventing divorce of parents with kids&rdquo;&mdash;and nepotism at his advocacy group broke just as Trump was taking fire for his own rumored infidelities and family members in White House roles. In 2019, Hegseth successfully lobbied Trump to pardon three service members convicted or accused of war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was also temporarily banned from Twitter after he posted the manifesto of the Saudi Air Force student who killed three and injured eight more in a terrorist attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Hegseth said he wanted to expose the shooter's Islamist ideology; Twitter officials said posting the manifesto violated their content standards. This year, Hegseth&mdash;long outspoken about 'woke-ness&rdquo; in the military&mdash;released his fourth book: The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free. In an interview posted to YouTube last week, he said he was among a dozen National Guard members who had been removed from security duties related to President Joe Biden's inauguration after vetting by the FBI. He also said that putting women in combat roles 'hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.&rdquo; Trump's first presidential term was noted for the turnover in the Defense Department's top job. Only Jim Mattis and Mark Esper lasted more than a year, and three other men served as acting SecDef. 'I think Trump was tired of fighting with his secretaries of defense and picked one who would be loyal to him,&rdquo; Cancian told AP, adding that Hegseth's inexperience might hinder his path through Senate confirmation.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/trump-taps-fox-host-pete-hegseth-be-defense-secretary/400999/	2024-11-12T19:46:32-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/12/GettyImages_11275941911/large.jpg
HASC chair: Trump will move Space Command HQ to Alabama immediate...	President-elect Donald Trump will sign an executive order within his first week of office to move U.S. Space Command headquarters to Alabama, clearing the way for construction to start as soon as next year, according to Alabama congressman Mike Rogers. Space Command has been based in Colorado at Peterson Space Force Base since its inception in 2019, but the decision on a forever home has been the subject of a years-long debate. The Biden administration in 2023 reversed a decision Trump made in his last days in office to move the command's permanent headquarters to Huntsville, Alabama. 'I've told y'all since Biden made that crooked decision, it wasn't going to work. As you know, on the [House] Armed Services Committee, I put a hold on any money being spent in Colorado Springs after President Biden came in and stole that mission away, and I told everybody then that Colorado Springs will not be the future location of Space Command, it will be Huntsville, Alabama, who won at fair and square,&rdquo; Rogers said during an interview on Alabama radio station FM Talk 106.5 that aired on Monday. The 2024 defense policy bill put a freeze on SPACECOM headquarters construction until two government watchdog agencies evaluate Biden's decision to keep it in Colorado. The two investigations will wrap up in December or January, Rogers said, and would have 'reversed the president's decision anyway.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] 'It's going to be a big point now because President Trump's already announced it, and I think you'll see in the first week that he's in office, he'll sign an executive order reversing Biden's directive. And we will start construction next year in Huntsville,&rdquo; Rogers said. Biden officials have argued that the command should stay in Colorado to maintain readiness and prevent the loss of civilian workers, who make up 60 percent of its workforce. But Rogers said the new Trump administration is unlikely to see any pushback from Democrats on HASC. 'I have every confidence that if for some reason we didn't take control of the House, [HASC ranking member] Adam Smith and the Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee would do nothing to try to interfere with the U.S. Space Command being constructed in Huntsville,' Rogers said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/hasc-chair-trump-will-move-space-command-hq-alabama-immediately/400986/	2024-11-12T12:28:58-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/12/GettyImages_1241860686/large.jpg
The D Brief: Trump’s picks; GOP takes House; Chinese airshow’s dr...	Trump cabinet staffs up on loyalists President-elect Donald Trump has named nearly a half dozen insiders and officials to his White House staff and cabinet well ahead of Inauguration Day, though some will require Senate confirmation. Here's a running list of those who have made the cut so far: Tom Homan as top border-enforcement official. According to Trump, Homan will oversee the 'Nation's Borders,&rdquo; which includes 'the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,&rdquo; the president-elect announced Sunday on social media, referring to Homan as his 'Border Czar.&rdquo; Worth noting: 'Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,&rdquo; Trump said in his statement, and added, 'I have no doubt he will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job.&rdquo; Trump said in the spring he expected between 15 to 20 million undocumented people to be deported, though more credible estimates (Pew in 2021, e.g.) put the number of undocumented migrants in the U.S. closer to 10 million. Relatedly, Trump's famously nativist first-term aide Stephen Miller is set to serve as Homan's deputy chief of staff. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem for Homeland Security secretary, which CNN reports, 'signal[s] Trump is serious about his promise to crack down on his immigration pledges&rdquo; and 'ensur[es] a loyalist will head an agency he prioritizes and that is key to his domestic agenda.&rdquo; Florida Rep. Mike Waltz as national security advisor, according to the Wall Street Journal, which calls him 'among the most hawkish members of Congress on China.&rdquo; Waltz is a former Army Green Beret who, like most Republicans, has lost patience with prolonged U.S. support for Ukraine. He has, however, threatened to 'tak[e] the handcuffs off of the long-range weapons we provided Ukraine&rdquo; should Russian leader Vladimir Putin not cooperate with Trump in potential future negotiations over the fate of the invaded country. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of state, as the New York Times first reported. Like Waltz, Rubio is a Ukraine-aid skeptic; unlike Waltz, he used to call Trump a 'con artist.&rdquo; Rubio rose to prominence in the so-called Tea Party wave of conservative politics nearly 15 years ago. More recently, he's fashioned himself as a China hawk and an advocate for more aggressive U.S. policy toward Venezuela, which the Trump administration reportedly tried but failed to overthrow in the months of his first term. Also from Florida politics: Susie Wiles, who will serve as Trump's chief of staff following a very successful stint as his 2024 co-campaign manager. 'She's credited with running a disciplined, professionalized campaign&rdquo; and 'has demonstrated an ability to help control Trump's impulses &mdash; to the extent that's possible &mdash; in a way few others have,&rdquo; Politico reported last week. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik as United Nations ambassador. Stefanik is a stalwart Trump loyalist, as the president-elect noted in his announcement Monday, and comes with experience in the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committees. Others appointees include early Trump loyalist and former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protective Agency. With Zeldin at the helm, Trump predicted 'fair and swift deregulatory decisions&rdquo; that will 'unleash the power of American businesses.&rdquo; According to Zeldin, 'We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI. We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water,&rdquo; he said Monday in a statement on social media. Critics say Zeldin's nomination underscores Trump's record of policies that deepen the climate crisis&mdash;and likely cedes a key global leadership role to China. By the way: Trump's Republicans have formally clinched control of all levers of U.S. power&mdash;including the White House, Senate, and most recently the House of Representatives, in addition to their 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. In this way, the autocrat-friendly Trump will have virtually no first-year obstacles to pursue an agenda decidedly different from the Biden administration in most every way, as Trump and JD Vance promised in their campaign. Given the open admiration for Hungary's authoritarian leader Viktor Orban among many in Trump's orbit, one big question for the months to come is just how much the GOP levers of power permit Trump to copy Orban's playbook of eroding checks on his power. Why bring it up: As the New York Times explained late last week, after ascending to office in 2010, Orban 'changed the electoral rules to better suit his party, throttled the free press and cracked down on nonprofit organizations.&rdquo; In the years since, 'With the state apparatus rebuilt in his favor, Mr. Orban has continued to win elections, lending an air of legitimacy to what he calls the &lsquo;illiberal state,' in which Mr. Orban rules like an elected autocrat.&rdquo; And like Trump, Orban, too, is openly fond of Russian despot Putin. On the other hand, former Air Force Lt. Col. and Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, wrote on social media Friday, 'I have absolutely no fear of Trump. Honest to God&hellip;Trump himself is weak and scared. Don't be intimidated, I'm absolutely not, and you shouldn't be either.&rdquo; Kinzinger, of course, announced his retirement from Congress in late 2021 after a redistricting effort&mdash;along with his public opposition to Trump&mdash;cost him too many constituents. As for the Pentagon and U.S. military, the same rules as always are expected to apply in the months ahead. That is, 'As it always has, the U.S. military will stand ready to carry out the policy choices of its next Commander in Chief, and to obey all lawful orders from its civilian chain of command,&rdquo; outgoing Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement to all Defense Department personnel last week. 'The U.S. military will also continue to stand apart from the political arena; to stand guard over our republic with principle and professionalism; and to stand together with the valued allies and partners who deepen our security,&rdquo; Austin wrote. 'America's Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Guardians swear an oath to &lsquo;support and defend the Constitution of the United States'&mdash;-and that is precisely what you will continue to do,&rdquo; he added.

Pacific partnerships are key to preventing war, Army leaders say	FORT SHAFTER, Hawaii&mdash;The personal relationships soldiers are building in dozens of training exercises each year with partners throughout the Indo-Pacific are the true strength of U.S. Army Pacific, the command's new leader said Friday, pledging to continue the initiatives championed by outgoing commander Gen. Charles Flynn. 'It's those relationships, built on a bedrock of trust, that really give our adversaries pause. They can plan for, or resource against, technical or procedural advantage that we may have, but they can't undo relationships,&rdquo; said Gen. Ronald Clark, adding that Flynn 'has made the region safer and our Army stronger.&rdquo; Clark has served here multiple times before. He is returning to Hawaii after two years as the senior military assistant to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin&mdash;a role that prompted Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., to hold up Clark's promotion for weeks. He took command from Flynn on Friday in a rainy ceremony attended by senior military leaders from across the region. Flynn used his last speech in uniform to discuss key events and themes that made a difference in his life, to recognize family and friends, and to thank U.S. partners in the region for underscoring what he calls 'the strategic land power network&hellip;a great counterweight to all the things that are happening out here every day that are dangerous and aggressive.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] The way to 'maintain peace and stability, protect everyone's freedoms and prosperity, and ultimately&hellip;our highest duty, as [INDOPACOM's Adm.] Sam Paparo says, is to deter and prevent a way from going on. So the goal here is to have no war.&rdquo; Flynn has been a passionate champion of the Army's role in the Pacific&mdash;which he calls 'vital and central to success&rdquo;&mdash;and regularly highlights the importance of Operation Pathways, a series of more than 40 joint and partner exercises across the region. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George said at the ceremony that Army's Pacific forces have during Flynn's tenure 'planned, coordinated, and executed more than 200 bilateral military exercises in more than 90 countries,&rdquo; as they 'built a formation that is lethal and cohesive.&rdquo; U.S. Army Pacific 'is gritty, determined, smart, creative, and a spirited team, because they have taken on the traits of their commander,&rdquo; George said. 'Your genuine and sincere appreciation for our partners and allies has laid the foundation of trust and respect we enjoy today and must have to win tomorrow.&rdquo; There is no mission more important for the Army, George said, directing his comments to Clark. 'Today, our adversaries are working together to challenge us in every theater. Russia, China, Iran and North Korea represent an axis of upheaval that is increasingly collaborating to threaten the free world.&rdquo; Paparo, leader of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, noted that 'the security environment has worsened&rdquo; since Clark was last stationed in the theater, in 2021. 'Given this dangerous security environment, the connected, transactional symbiosis of our would-be adversaries, the [People's Republic of China's] increasingly aggressive behavior, the increasing connections between Russia and North Korea, we need to the team to be ready. You are precisely the right leader for this assignment,&rdquo; Paparo said. Still, Clark told reporters he is not overly concerned by news that North Korean troops are fighting alongside Russians in Ukraine. 'It really doesn't give me pause&hellip; because on, as you know, on the Korean peninsula, we're ready to fight tonight,&rdquo; he said. 'The proliferation of combat capabilities across the world is something that happens at breathtaking speed now, given automation, the internet, AI, machine learning. So our expectation is&hellip; that our adversaries are going to learn quickly. We also have to learn quickly, and quicker, from ongoing conflicts. And&hellip; the thing that they can't break are those relationships&rdquo; with allies and partners.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/pacific-partnerships-are-key-preventing-war-army-leaders-say/400971/	2024-11-12T01:31:32-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/12/8745881/large.jpg
Trump’s climate skepticism could hurt military operations	The U.S. military would be weakened by Trump-ally proposals to break up the federal government's main weather-monitoring agency and roll back efforts to reduce Pentagon dependence on fossil fuel, DOD leaders and former national-security officials say. 'I think it would be a real mistake to pivot,&rdquo; Brendan Owens, assistant defense secretary for energy, installations, and environment, told reporters on Friday&mdash;a mistake, he said, that China or Russia could exploit in wartime. Project 2025&mdash;the Heritage Foundation's policy plan for a Trump presidency&mdash;says the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, 'should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.&rdquo; Trump has attempted to distance himself from the document, which was largely produced by his former appointees and staff. But during his first term as president, he lashed out at NOAA after its scientists contradicted a false statement of his, and, more generally, attempted to squelch scientific reporting on climate change. While Project 2025 calls for privatizing the provision of weather-service data, Owens said, 'I don't know any alternative&rdquo; to the capability NOAA provides. The agency operates 18 satellites that track weather patterns and other atmospheric phenomena, including three that are part of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. Without them, he said, 'We would lose the ability to inform our combatant commanders and our installation commanders of risk. As a result of that&hellip;We'd be creating a blind spot, which we currently don't have.&rdquo; Owens is hardly alone in pointing out the danger to operations from shuttering NOAA. It would introduce 'a huge risk,&rdquo; said Erin Sikorsky, a former member of the U.S. National Intelligence Council who now leads the Center for Climate and Security. 'We know that China is investing a huge amount in their capabilities for weather prediction, not just in the short term but in the sub-seasonal forecasts. I don't think we want to be in a situation where our adversaries have better information than we do.&rdquo; In July, the deputy assistant defense secretary for Arctic and global resilience enumerated the various ways the military works with the weather-monitoring agency. 'We do lean on NOAA pretty heavily right now with our Arctic weather forecasting. We work very closely with our Air Force weather community, but also our naval weather community, works closely with NOAA to detect weather forecasting and for ice forecasting,&rdquo; Iris Ferguson told reporters. Scientific weather forecasting has long been a key to battlefield success. In the run-up to D-Day, the most important beach landing in modern military history, German and allied forces alike sought to divine when favorable weather might allow a successful assault. Enter Norwegian forecaster Sverre Petterssen, serving under Gen. Dwight Eisenhower's head of meteorology. Petterssen was a fan of the new approach that tracked masses of cold and warm air, or 'fronts,&rdquo; colliding miles above the earth's surface. The fluid dynamics of these fronts, movement, pressure, etc., could provide more information than the customary statistical regressions based on averages. Using that insight, Eisenhower's team pinpointed a brief weather break that would allow an invasion, information the Germans didn't have. Today, data from NOAA and other sources helps the Pentagon&mdash;and U.S. allies&mdash;plan operations via the Defense Department Climate Assessment Tool or DCAT. Said Owens: 'Climate wargaming is something that the Defense Department is doing actively, right now. It is changing the way that we look at various different [combatant command] plans. It's informing that and the rate at which we are doing contested logistics assessments and how those are coming into operational planning, how we're looking at extreme weather, and our ability to fight through any of those.&rdquo; Would DCAT suffer if deprived of NOAA data? 'Yeah, it would,&rdquo; Owens said. 'It would affect our ability to improve them and make them better decision-making tools.&rdquo; Shedding dependence The Pentagon has increased its efforts in recent years to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, such as moving toward electric vehicles and exploring alternative means for powering installations. Owens framed those efforts as essential to future military operations. Owens was confident, or at least optimistic, that some of those efforts, like nuclear power for installations and bases, would survive the Trump administration. 'Nuclear meets a need and a level of resilience that we have to maintain to be able to deploy in certain circumstances,&rdquo; he said. But other initiatives are more vulnerable. Trump has expressed concerns about the military use of electric vehicles, concerns not always based in fact. Owens said the practical, operational case for more electric vehicles is clear. The same fuel and supply vulnerabilities incurred by running diesel generators on bases also apply to the fuel to run vehicles. Owens is hoping that military leaders will make that case to keep the department's electric-vehicle efforts alive. 'I think the department's going to say, &lsquo;Look, this is our reality. We need this stuff. It makes us better warfighters,'&rdquo; he said, adding that it happens, 'it's going to help them sustain a lot of the momentum that has been built over the course of the last and not just this administration.&rdquo; Sikorsky is less sure. 'The foot will not be on the gas, right, the same way,&rdquo; she said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/trumps-climate-skepticism-could-hurt-military-operations/400961/	2024-11-08T18:55:15-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/08/sharpiegate_GettyImages_1172289651/large.jpg
Air Force waits for tankers in wake of Boeing strike	Six weeks into the new fiscal year, Boeing has yet to deliver any of the 15 KC-46 tankers it owes the service by next September. Service officials did not say when they expect the deliveries, which were disrupted by a recently concluded seven-week strike, but said they expect the company to hew to its contract. Thus far, 'no KC-46s have been delivered in FY 25,&rdquo; an Air Force spokesperson said. The final tanker of fiscal 2024 was delivered on Sept. 27, completed check-outs, and was ferried to an operational unit on Oct. 4, the spokesperson said. Tanker production was stalled when thousands of Boeing workers went on strike in September. After weeks of negotiations, union workers voted on Monday to end the strike, clearing the company to restart aircraft production on lines that build commercially derived military aircraft such as the 767-based tanker and the Navy's 737-based P-8 maritime aircraft. Some employees could resume work as early as this week, but the company said production might not restart for weeks. The strike hit Boeing's finances in the third quarter and contributed to $6 billion in losses, including $2 billion on the defense side. A Boeing spokesperson, asked about the company's timeline to restart production and deliveries of KC-46s, said, 'We'll have more to share in the coming days.&rdquo; As Air Force units wait for tankers to arrive, service officials said this week that they may extend the KC-46 program two years beyond initial projections, to 2031, after repeated pauses on deliveries. Schedules have also slipped for several key fixes for the tanker, which has been plagued with development problems. Those problems have already caused the company to lose more than $8 billion on the program, and new challenges with the tanker are still popping up. It's unclear when Boeing's fixed-price contracts will start to bring in profits, but in the meantime, the company has said it will try to improve its numbers by 'doing less&rdquo; and cutting non-core defense programs, possibly its space business. 'I think that we're better off doing less and doing it better than doing more and not doing it well, so we're in the process of taking an evaluation of the portfolio,&rdquo; Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg told investors in October. The company also announced in October that it would cut 10 percent of its workforce, roughly 17,000 people, in order to 'position&rdquo; itself for the future.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/air-force-waits-tankers-wake-boeing-strike/400960/	2024-11-08T16:32:24-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/08/Workers_stand_near_a_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: DOD shakeup expected; Russian barrage; N. Koreans fi...	How Trump may shake up DOD, according to Chris Miller, who was the last person to occupy the U.S. defense secretary's office during the first Trump administration, and whose name tops the defense chapter of Project 2025. The retired Special Forces colonel wants irregular warfare to have a larger, even predominant, role in implementing U.S. policy in South and Central America and Africa&mdash;and a smaller one in the Pacific. 'Let Special Operations Command, irregular warfare command, handle Latin America and AFRICOM. Let them compete against whoever it is out there. Let the services just focus on INDOPACOM and the Russian bear,&rdquo; Miller told Defense One's Patrick Tucker in June. Miller also wants more money to flow to innovative ideas, particularly ones that come from operators, and downplays fears that Trump will withdraw from alliances. 'Everybody is concerned that he means a wholesale pullout of NATO or other organizations. I find that probably a stretch. The ultimate point is better burden-sharing.&rdquo; Read on, here. Trump's record and own words suggest much bigger changes are coming, 'amid fears that the once and future commander in chief will follow through on vows to deploy the military domestically against American citizens, demand fealty from key leaders and attempt to remake the nonpartisan institution into one explicitly loyal to him,&rdquo; writes the Washington Post, with plenty of links out to previous coverage. Project 2025 and the GOP party platform also highlight culture-war issues, The Hill notes in its own article. The next administration will also try 'reducing wasteful defense spending and decreasing the number of generals in the military, although it also includes less divisive measures, such as enhancing nuclear strategy, prioritizing China and building a resilient military.&rdquo; The article links back to the GOP party platform, which says: 'We will invest in cutting-edge research and advanced technologies, including an Iron Dome Missile Defense Shield, support our troops with higher pay,&rdquo; the platform reads, and 'get woke leftwing Democrats fired as soon as possible.&rdquo; Read, here. Quote: 'The greatest danger the military faces&rdquo; under a second Trump presidency is a 'rapid erosion of its professionalism, which would undermine its status and respect from the American people,&rdquo; said Richard Kohn, a professor and military historian at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 'Mr. Trump does not have a real understanding of civil-military relations, or the importance of a nonpartisan, nonpolitical military.&rdquo; A spokeswoman for Trump, Karoline Leavitt, said that with Tuesday's vote, the American public had given him 'a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.&rdquo; Meanwhile: Pentagon puts a dent in cyber workforce vacancies. The department is still short nearly 30,000 cyber workers, but 'The civilian vacancy rate is now down to 16 percent&mdash;that is a 4.8 percent decrease from last year,&rdquo; Mark Gorak, principal director for resources & analysis, the Pentagon's office of the chief information officer, told reporters Thursday. 'In order to get there, believe it or not, we had to hire about 14,000 additional civilians, and we lost or turned over about 6,000 civilians&rdquo; to jobs outside the department.

Ten years later, Hitler and the Nazis did indeed take full control. Russians in Ukraine Russia lost another general to its Ukraine invasion, the eighth since 2022, the BBC reports. His name is Major General Pavel Klimenko, and he was reportedly killed Wednesday inside Ukraine under circumstances that aren't clear just yet. Klimenko was just promoted to general this past May. Several months ago, he was accused of 'setting up a torture camp in Donetsk where, according to media reports and relatives of victims, Russian soldiers were tortured and had their salaries taken away,&rdquo; the BBC reports. Read on via Google translate for more on the other seven generals killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. On the other hand: Retired U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt explains how Ukraine's military is 'bleeding out&rdquo; against Russia in an eight-minute video published Friday by the Wall Street Journal. Early-morning Russian missile and drone strikes across Ukraine killed at least nine people and injured more than 60 others Friday, President Volodymir Zelenskyy said on X. Ukrainian troops claim to have shot down four missiles and around 60 drones from the overnight barrage. 'Air defense, long-range capabilities, weapons packages, and sanctions against the aggressor&mdash;these are the actions required, not just words,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said. Update: The lame-duck Biden administration still has $4 billion in Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine and another $2 billion from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. However, it's not clear exactly how much more support the U.S. military can provide before Donald Trump takes office in mid-January. 'Some things can arrive within days and weeks. Some items in those packages take longer,&rdquo; Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Thursday. 'It does matter what's available on our stock, on our shelves. You're going to see us continue to draw that down pretty frequently. Could there be things that go out beyond Jan. 20? I can't say for certain right now.&rdquo; Related reading: 'Europe cannot finance Ukraine war if Trump pulls U.S. out of the conflict, Hungary's Orban warns,&rdquo; CNBC reported Friday; 'Hungary's leader Orb&aacute;n predicts Trump will end support for Ukraine in comments before EU summit,&rdquo; AP reported Friday; And 'Putin is ready to talk to Trump but his Ukraine demands are unchanged, Kremlin says,&rdquo; Reuters reported Friday. North Koreans in Russia Developing: Russian and North Korean troops have allegedly begun their counteroffensive to recapture territory in Kursk, the region Ukrainian troops entered in a surprise offensive of their own back in August. According to one official on Ukraine's Defense Council writing Thursday on Telegram, 'DPRK troops have been deployed to the contact line in Kursk,&rdquo; and are 'embedded in Russian units fighting on the Lyubimovka-Novoivanovka line, as well as near Pogrebki.&rdquo; According to Ukrainian military chief Rustem Umerov, a 'small group&rdquo; of North Koreans were first attacked earlier this week in the vicinity of Kursk, South Korean media reported on Tuesday. An anonymous U.S. official confirmed the allegation to the New York Times on Tuesday, and said North Koreans were killed in the incident, but no date for the actual incident was provided. More North Korean casualties could be coming soon, the Ukrainian defense official said. That's because 'the positions of the Russian units, in which the North Korean troops are present, regularly come under artillery fire. Our UAVs engage them, too,&rdquo; he said Thursday on Telegram. New: South Korea says pro-Russia hackers have stepped up cyber attacks against military, government, and judicial websites, Yonhap news agency reported Friday. Those attacks seem to largely involve distributed denial-of-service efforts, which have so far caused 'temporary delays or disruptions,&rdquo; but little else. Related reading: 'S. Korea holds live-fire ballistic missile drills after N.

Pentagon puts a dent in cyber workforce vacancies	The Pentagon still needs nearly 30,000 cyber workers, but the number of open positions has gone down significantly since last year, defense officials said Thursday. 'The civilian vacancy rate is now down to 16 percent&mdash;that is a 4.8 percent decrease from last year,&rdquo; Mark Gorak, principal director for resources & analysis, the Pentagon's office of the chief information officer, told reporters Thursday. 'In order to get there, believe it or not, we had to hire about 14,000 additional civilians, and we lost or turned over about 6,000 civilians&rdquo; to jobs outside the department. Cyber workers are in high demand across the federal government and in industry, making it difficult for the Pentagon to attract and keep its cyber workforce, which is composed of about 75,000 civilians, 25,000 troops, and 75,000 contractors. Last year, about 24 percent of DOD cyber jobs were vacant. That vacancy rate dropped to 16 percent, which amounts to about 28,000 unfilled military and civilian cyber roles, Gorak said. Moreover, the Pentagon is still tallying attrition for military cyber workers, but estimates that 4,000 troops left their cyber jobs in 2024. 'We still have a long way to go to get to our closure here, but we're getting better, and I think that's one of some of the key metrics of success of this program,&rdquo; he said. [[Related Posts]] Money was the top reason cyber workers left their DOD roles, and the Pentagon must increase pay incentives to improve retention, Gorak said. 'We're addressing that with [cyber excepted service] and target local market supplement,&rdquo; he said. 'I'm also working with [the Office of Personnel Management] and [the Office of Management and Budget] on the levels of pay that were authorized to pay, and the caps that we have within the federal government. So we're trying to work for cyber and digital to increase those. But again, there's guard rails and lots of obstacles for us to make that happen.&rdquo; In addition to reducing the number of cyber vacancies, the Pentagon named five key initiatives to focus on in 2025: new standards for role qualifications; developing a skills-based assessment for hiring; increasing use of apprenticeship programs; and improving pay. Another target is growing the Pentagon's congressionally mandated cyber academic engagement office, which Gorak leads and was created this year. But DOD missed one goal it slated for 2024: creating a fund for defense and cyber workforce development, Gorak said. That effort won't mature until 2027. 'The one initiative we didn't get to that we had focused on for FY24 was the establishing of a dedicated fund for the defense and cyber workforce. And now we took a closer look at that, and we're going to need a lot more support on that, so we've actually changed the timeline,&rdquo; Gorak said. The fund is similar to others in the department and would be used to help with recruitment, retention, and placing interns or individuals on assignment, Gorak said. 'I can use some of this fund to actually have a two-year internship program where they have two years to bring them in, test them out, train them, develop them, and then have that flexibility in that timeline to then hire as authorizations become open,&rdquo; he said. The money could also be used to train employees on new skills. 'So if part of the segment of the workforce isn't qualified in a certain skill, then this fund would actually pay for that centralized training so that we can make sure that our readiness is increased,&rdquo; he said. 'And again, this isn't new, but actually centralizing this and actually getting the funding to support this is the challenge to make this happen.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/11/pentagon-puts-dent-cyber-workforce-vacancies/400932/	2024-11-07T18:16:03-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/07/Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_4.14.22PM/large.png

How Trump may shake up DOD: an insider’s view	Few, if anyone, has a better window into Donald Trump's plans for the Pentagon than Christopher Miller, the final acting defense secretary of Trump's first term and architect of the defense chapter of the Project 2025 document. Two people with knowledge of the Trump campaign's internal deliberations told Defense One that Miller is well-placed to play a key role in the next White House's national security apparatus. And while Trump sought to distance himself from the Heritage Foundation document after its many controversial elements rose to public attention, it was written largely by his former appointees and staff and mirrors many of his key policy proposals. Although he has acted as one, Chris Miller is no one's idea of a defense secretary&mdash;not even Chris Miller's. A retired Army Special Forces colonel who later ran the National Counterterrorism Center, he lacks the defining qualities of a Washington political operator. He shows no enthusiasm for delivering talking points or speeches; takes no joy in commanding large budgets; expresses no interest in waging culture-war battles in front of cameras. He shares Trump's extemporaneous, unscripted speaking style but none of his former boss's vindictiveness. Miller is far more likely to extend praise to those in the security space whose work he admires than complain about people. (Although he is quick to condemn what he sees as bad ideas and failures, particularly the 2021 Afghanistan pullout.) In a town that runs on political ambition, Miller displays annoyance both at the question of what role he might play in a future Trump administration and, it seemed, at the very possibility. He's most at home in the attire of a man about to go fishing for the day and many, especially Miller himself, consider him too unpolished to make it through a Senate confirmation hearing. But given Trump's expressed preference for acting cabinet secretaries rather than confirmed ones, that is not the barrier it once was. And Miller's low-ego personality could serve him well in an Oval Office run by a man with ego to spare. We caught up with Miller in June to discuss how the Defense Department might change in a second Trump term and to hear his own priorities and thoughts on the future of U.S. defense. In the interview, he said the Project 2025 defense chapter was a collaborative work, involving multiple contributors and committees. He described his role as 'herding cats.&rdquo; Regardless, Miller was happy to endorse and expound on several of its key provisions, many of which did originate from him. Innovation Unlike many of the better-known, more partisan parts of the Heritage Foundation's voluminous Project 2025 document, the chapter on defense contains points and proposals that echo what many national security professionals have been urging for years, and many that the Biden White House has itself attempted to implement. One of these is a core focus on innovating and deploying new weapons far more quickly. He's main complaint of current innovation efforts like the Replicator program and even the Defense Innovation Unit is that such efforts aren't matched with real dollars. Miller's approach, however, differs from the current status quo, placing far greater emphasis on ideas and innovations that emerge from within the department, particularly at the operator level. 'Here's my idea, push down to every battalion-sized unit across all of the services an innovation fund..and let's go bottom up,&rdquo; he said in the interview. '​​Push decentralized innovation down to the kids in the field. Provide them some seed money.&rdquo; Miller also wants to tackle the culture of risk aversion that especially permeates the middle tier of the services by prodding inspectors general to better monitor how innovation funds are spent. 'They go in each year and guarantee that the money is being spent appropriately, that it's tied to the commander's vision and all that. Then we just institutionalize it across the force,&rdquo; he said. Irregular warfare Unsurprisingly, Miller, a former Army Green Beret who first arrived in Afghanistan in December 2001, does not agree with the service's plan to cut U.S. special operations forces. Miller wants irregular warfare to have a larger, even predominant, role in implementing U.S. policy in South and Central America and Africa&mdash;and a smaller one in the Pacific. 'Let Special Operations Command, irregular warfare command, handle Latin America and AFRICOM. Let them compete against whoever it is out there. Let the services just focus on INDOPACOM and the Russian bear.&rdquo; It's a new version of an idea that won serious consideration in the early days of the 2001 operations in the Middle East. Ultimately, combatant commanders killed it, he said. 'All the geographic combat commanders just crushed that because of their authorities and their prerogatives.&rdquo; Defense intelligence The Project 2025 document calls for substantial reform of the defense intelligence apparatus, away from 'peripheral intelligence obligations that do not advance military readiness,&rdquo; including screening people for security clearances. Miller sees a possible combined role for defense intelligence and special operations, in effect transforming the latter into a quasi-intelligence service in order to better anticipate rapidly shifting geopolitical crises. It's a vision similar to that espoused in 2016 by then-SOCOM commander Gen. Tony Thomas. 'This is nothing new. It's been kicked around for ages,&rdquo; Miller said 'There's this almost knee-jerk reaction to it related to civil liberties, that if you have an operational element and an intelligence element working together somehow you might violate American civil liberties. I don't see that. It requires cognizant oversight and serious attention. But we know how to do that.&rdquo; Miller would also place more emphasis on rapid collection and analysis of open-source intelligence. 'We haven't even scratched the surface of the power of open-source intelligence, and we're still kind of stuck in these silos,&rdquo; he said. Space and tactical nuclear weapons The Project 2025 document calls on the United States to 'develop a nuclear arsenal with the size, sophistication, and tailoring&mdash;including new capabilities at the theater level&mdash;to ensure that there is no circumstance in which America is exposed to serious nuclear coercion.&rdquo; Miller said that the issue of low-yield tactical nuclear weapons was a heated one during the Project 2025 committee deliberations and would likely continue to be. But he's willing to consider adding them to America's nuclear arsenal. On space, Miller said the Pentagon can't simply rely on an abundance of cheap, low-earth orbit satellites for resilience. 'Obviously, treaty restrictions for weaponizing space have to be considered. A lot of that is talking about not just space-based weapons, but also cyber effects, other effects,&rdquo; he said. National Guard Miller expressed little enthusiasm for a proposal by former Trump advisor Stephen Miller to send the National Guard into American cities to help deport people. 'I think the risks are a little hyperbolic,&rdquo; he said of the notion sending National Guard units from state to another, even against the will of governors. 'There are enough fire breaks in there&rdquo; to prevent misuse. But he believes that border security is a natural fit for the Guard, which has been helping there for years. Beyond that, he said individual governors should determine the duties of their state's Guard units, while the Pentagon trains and equips Guard units to help deter potential foreign adversaries. Alliances The public perception of Trump as eager to abandon NATO&mdash;a perception Trump himself has at times advanced&mdash;doesn't represent his previous administration's actual policy or current thinking, which primarily emphasizes a need for NATO nations to spend more on collective defense, an idea that alliance officials have also supported. Miller, too, dismissed the notion that Trump was preparing to storm out of the alliance. 'Everybody is concerned that [Trump] means a wholesale pullout of NATO or other organizations. I find that probably a stretch. The ultimate point is better burden-sharing.&rdquo; That expectation for greater individual defense spending by partner militaries would also extend to other countries, such as South Korea. On the topic of joint development, particularly of ships, Miller sounds more like the present Defense Department than the next one. The United States alone just doesn't have the ship-building capabilities to meet the former Trump administration goal of a 350-ship Navy, let alone the service's current stated goal of 381. 'The prohibition against U.S. Navy ships being built in foreign shipyards&mdash;I understand the reason for that, but there are national-security waivers. So why don't we have a serious conversation about shipbuilding capacity in Japan, South Korea? There are other places. You can probably get the Philippines. Australia as well.&rdquo; That opinion, he said, was very much a personal one. 'This is where I am, not where Heritage is. Freaking, I have no idea where the Trump campaign is.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/how-trump-may-shake-dod-insiders-view/400911/	2024-11-07T10:10:50-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/07/GettyImages_1285484786/large.jpg
